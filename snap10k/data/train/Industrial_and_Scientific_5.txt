6534	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It works well and appears to be quite accurate, though I've only done a mild amount of cross-referencing with other tools.  Keeping it from being 5* is only one issue I'm having with it, and that's when it is closed all the way to a 0.00 reading, it's a real mf'er to get it to start sliding open again.  I'm not sure why it sticks like that.  I've lubed it up, worked it, etc., but it still does this.  A strange trait, and maybe it's just mine, but nonetheless that doesn't take it down any further than 4* because this type of product at this price is really a good buy and I would buy it again.

The "straw" on this insulating foam bends just enough to slide under the vinyl siding. This works, but I suggest wearing rubber gloves you can toss after doing the job.

On May 7th 2010 I brought this Black, Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology.  This Panasonic Microwave oven works fine for me.  As we speak I am heating up some shrimp fried rice using it.  After a long day at work last thing I want to do when arriving home is cook a full on dinner.  Lucky for me I live within walking distance of like 30 take away shops and all of them deliver.  Too often however the food arrives that legally safe lukewarm that insures no one will get burned and sue the place.  Problem I hate luke warm food.  I love my cold food cold and my hot food piping hot.  In my experience Microwave ovens are horrible at cooking most things from scratch.  In my experience what microwave ovens do best is heat things up fast while breathing new life into tired food with the caveat that it only works well once.  So for the cost of a bunch of electrons my luke warm take away shop dinner is now heated to truly HOT temperatures thanks to this Panasonic microwave I brought here at Amazon.com.

512	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Cuts holes cleanly and quickly,  I've mostly used it on aluminum which it cuts like butter, although it often leaves a large burr on the back side that has to be trimmed away. The distance for each hole size is quite small, so it's only useful for thin material.
4322	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This oven was a replacement for it's predecessor we had for over 10 years.  When that one died I looked for a a new model that was close to the same as we really liked our old Panasonic. Newer models have replaced the keyboard with a dial that seemed pretty funky to me and some reviewers.  Then I hit on this one.  1250 watts, same as my old one..and a keyboard.  Reviews were mainly good.  This review is early so can't speak to longevity but after a couple days I have put it through it's paces.  First I found how much more quickly it cooks familiar items than the old one.  It also has some new functions and the old function of reheating and cooking by sensor.  I did not use that on the old one as I found it never did the job right.  Better by trial and error with the timer. This one didn't do any better on things I have tried.  But I am enjoying the power that had diminished over the years on my old one and the unit is sleek and good looking in our kitchen.  I hope it will have at least have as long a life as the old one but I also understand most of the new stuff is designed otherwise.  We'll see.

This Panasonic microwave oven is powerful and has enough space to do almost any basic reheat jobs.  This Panasonic microwave has nothing fancy, no real bells and whistles above basic features you would expect.  Panasonic's highest quality days are behind it based on my experience with its products.  I brought a Panasonic DVD player recorder that barely lasted 4 months so I believe all those reviews that suggest Panasonic quality is circling the bowl at warp speed.  I have to rate a product on my experiences with it.  I've had this Panasonic Microwave over for about two and a half years with all joys and no problems whatsoever.  However as I said buying any appliance today is a crap shoot at best.  Some of an appliance line works well while others fail.  I think in most industries the science and concept of quality control is in the toilet since most companies are only in it for a fast buck.  The crappy appliances we get now days is what we deserve for not holding companies to a higher quality standard.  People have learned to accept front load washers that stink of mildew while not getting wash truly clean because; its marketed as "Green".  We accept light bulbs full of mercury because they are marketed as green.  Panasonic microwaves are no different their spotty quality record comes from the fact that people are far more willing to accept shoddy products today.  I just happened to get a great Panasonic Microwave oven out of this deal but its a lottery and it is not just Panasonic.  There are more lame versions of any product or any microwave today and we consumers are just left to take our chances.

Long story long: I did not try the cutter/punch straight out of the box. I felt I could sharpen it up a little bit first, so that's what I did. I chucked it in the drill and took a file to the cutting edge as it spun. I can't say it made a huge difference in sharpness, but I do believe it helped. When cutting your material, hit the punch hard with a hammer, rotate, and repeat. Usually 3-5 quick and heavy blows were enough to cut through my two layers of heavy material. I hit it until the punch was stuck in the wood behind the material-- then I knew I had gone completely though.

No obnoxious 'BLEEP' when food is done.  Finally, a microwave, that lets me pop popcorn, or heat something up after putting the kids to bed, that won't wake up a light sleeper.  Just a series of 5 beeps, not much louder than the beeps you hear when pressing the buttons to operate the oven.  It beeps 5 times again maybe once or twice a minute, until you open the oven.  I also like that the display says 'enjoy your meal' when it is done, and scrolls across the screen.  Even without my glasses on, I can tell from across the room if it is done, by the movement of the scrolling letters, as opposed to the 'end' that our old microwave would display.

Irwin Item #: 10231
If you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.
5852	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	After a month or two, it no longer sticks. I had a simple application, tape some small telephone wires to the inside of a new cabinet. The telephone jack ended up inside a cabinet and I mounted the phone on the outside. I routed the wires in the cabinet and used 4-5 pieces of Gorilla tape to hold the wires. It has been 1-2 months and the tape is no longer sticking to the cabinet walls. Keep in mind these are very small telephone wires. I have found this to be true a number of times where after 1-3 months, the tape simply no longer sticks to whatever you applied the tape to. I've used other heavy duty black tape such as Nashua or 3M and they stick much better and a lot longer.

4375	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Pipe dope is one of the things that you can't really say much about. So I will say that it was easy to apply to the pipe threads (spread it out with a stick or finger) and tighten them into position. The pipe dope will remain semi-liable and won't fight with you if you need to remove the fitting later. There is no waiting with this, you can apply it, install the fitting(s) and begin using the whatever you were assembling/repairing. I have used it on my natural gas piping and connections to the water heater (gas and water), living room gas stove, gas dryer and gas burner top and oven. It works fine.

6617	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	There are numerous testimonials for the oldest/most stuck/most corroded parts freed by AeroKroil.  In airplanes in particular, there are lots of aluminum, anodized and coated parts...everywhere.  When you apply this stuff...and PB Blaster and CRC656...it goes everywhere.  AeroKroil is approved by all aerospace builders (I think).  Every 6 months, I fog everything with ACF50 (like the Navy does with their carrier jets).  I think using these two products will displace water, and seep oil into any corrosion you might have.  The only worrisome issue is that the plastic nozzle may not last as long as the contents, so think thru buying the big can unless you are really needing it...like restoring an old CAT bulldozer.

Despite my lack of success with the hair dryer, the only area where I have seen Gorilla Tape fail is in moderately-high temperature applications.

It sticks well. It cuts good out of the dispenser (you have to have your own dispenser as these are refill rolls). It's a little hard to get a fresh roll started, they do have a spot where you are supposed to be able to get a new roll started, but it is difficult to grab hold of that to get it started (these are not e-z start rolls). My only other complaint with this tape is that I think because it is so much thicker of a tape, it sometimes has a tendency to want to wrinkle if you don't keep it going in a perfectly straight line while laying it down. Other than that, it does what it should and I have not had any complaints yet about the tape being unstuck from a package.

And I am overtly particular about most things.
The unit isn't nearly as heavy as it looks in the picture. It's rock solid sturdy and comes 99.9% assembled. There are about 20 screws to finish assembly which consists of mounting the wheels (super rugged high quality casters), the push handle and the power bar that mounts to the side.

Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.
It was easy to install, plain and simple.  The tank took a lot more time of jockeying back and forth to find hole locations to drill.  The kit was quick and easy.  My Ford has a metal fuel line from the fill cap, transitioning to rubber after about a foot.  I was able to cut back the rubber line and install the kit at the transition from metal to rubber.  I did have to cut about 4-5" of rubber hose back and use one of the couplers provided (see photos).  The parts fit together perfectly and wasn't difficult to line everything up.

1562	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	We have used foam weather seal for many years for many different purposes.  Today I installed this roll in a Sidebar / China Cabinet to block the light seepage in between the cracks in the doors.  One roll perfectly completed the job.  The white peel off tape protector is on the NON STICKY side of the foam. This means that the end of the roll about 6 inches of foam seal is wasted as it is firmly stuck to the cardboard roll.  If the manufacturer put a layer of the tape protector on the cardboard tube they wouldn't have this waste.

Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.

I'm fairly handy but this was my first attempt at cutting stainless steel or with a step drill bit. I tried to start a pilot hole with a 1/16 titanium drill bit but was only successful at creating a little dent before it got obvious it was starting to get hot. I read reviews saying be careful about denting or heating SS so it doesn't work harden so I stopped. The little dent the 1/16 bit made was plenty to get started and keep the step drill bit on target. Used Tap Magic cutting fluid and followed advice to press hard and start slow. The bit dug right in and I had a small hole in just a few seconds. Every 30 seconds or so I stopped, checked my progress, wiped excess oil and metal and added fresh oil. As the hole got bigger the bit got stuck a few times. I had to go in with a little bit of speed to get the bit to spin without getting stuck once the hole got big enough. Had some smoke and hot pieces of smoking metal coming off the bit when I increased the speed . . . glad I did this when the wife wasn't home or I'm sure she would've stopped me and we'd be waiting for a plumber to finish the last 2 minutes of this job. The hole's not 100% perfect but it's decent and since it's covered by a gasket it works just fine for my needs.

4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly. I recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by Intel are notoriously poor. Zalman makes some great ones. Do NOT buy one that uses push pins to lock in place. You want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your CPU. This is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.

The kit has a good selection of screws, containing enough to get you by for a repair or 2, if you're using one size. I've already used about half the kit. But, it's a nice assortment to have, so I've ordered another one.

4698	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	What is that feature made this product special, at least for me, it has a tight closing cap! So, the option of reuse it again after long is possible. I was suffering with such glue type when I purchase one I have to use it at the same time because if I did not it will solidify shortly. Previously, I was calling in the house " who has a broken thing should come now " to utilize the whole quantity of that glue.

there are arrows printed right on the valve to help you install it so that it opens and closes in the correct direction, just in case you couldn't figure it out on your own. i actually got two of these when i added the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wayne-ESP25-12-Volt-3300-Gallons-Per-Hour-Battery-Back-Up-Sump-Pump-System/dp/B000HOQZDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wayne ESP25 12-Volt 3300 Gallons Per Hour Battery Back Up Sump Pump System</a>&nbsp;to the pit with my primary pump. i'm no plumber, but install time for the new pump and both check valves, plus new drain lines out of the house, was less than 3 hours. installing these valves was one of the easiest parts too.
7475	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice quality drill bit. I've been using it in aluminum, plastic, and steel sheet. The 120 degree flats on the shank make it really nice so that it doesn't slip in the drill chuck. Remember when drilling to slow your rpm considerably as you go to larger dia steps, especially drilling steel and aluminum. The titanium nitride coating will help prevent wear and gives longer tool life, but you still need to resist the temptation of running a large diameter drill really fast.

4) The fumes are strong and toxic.  Allow glued items to dry in a well-ventilated area (ideally out-of-door) for several days.

If someone needs to cover a larger area/larger bandages, they'll want to find these in a larger width. Even though the size was given. I just didn't visualize how narrow the 2 inches would be. The size still works for me because I just slice down the middle and place the 1/2 strips on either side of my bandage. A wider size would be needed for anyone wanting to completely cover a bandage, depending.

3) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking. They are stronger and you can't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products. Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.
When you want to make no mistake about drilling too large a hole. A regular drill bit always makes the same hole size - no need to count the steps - which can be very reassuring when drilling into a valuable workpiece.

You need to hand tighten these with the arbor lock button pressed pretty good or they will spin themselvs off when the trigger is released due to the weight and inertia.  There is no locking system used on these since they have embedded screw threads that mate with the arbor.

Second, the yellow funnel arrangement seems nice on first glance, until you try to use it!  It mounts to the spout on a 90 degree angle so you cannot get the gas can tilted enough to get all the gas out.  My cars fuel filler spout (and most others) goes into the car at a 45 degree angle.  If I tilt the gas can all the way (sideways/90 degrees) the funnel interferes and wants to pop out of the 45 degree fuel neck (the funnel then wants to point straight down).  I could only get maybe 3 of 5 gallons out.  I tried to turn it sideways but it will only go so far.  I finally was able to get 4 out of 5 gallons out while spilling it all over my shoes, the side of the car, and the ground.
The weight is not much more than the plastic and I would say that it is negligible. Not even a consideration I would say.

The duct tape part, well, it claims to last 6x as long as traditional duct tape (the package says "based on accelerated aging tests"). I don't verify the factor of six, but the tape does seem to hold up pretty well.
I put the red version down in my garage and it's basically bullet proof; it's got some scratch and dings, but overall, it looks fantastic, and is so easy to clean. I did it myself in a weekend (with the help of a friend). Wear a dust mask and clothes you don't plan to keep; it's a messy process.
Cons
7756	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Defective straight out of box, and I guess it's non-returnable? End of scope won't stay locked into one position, which I think is affecting sound transmission. I could hear very little, no matter what I tried. The color red doesn't match what is online. either. Instead of candy apple red, it is an orange/red color. So disappointed! I had a prestige scope in the past that I loved! Quality control must not be the same anymore. Maybe I'll use this one for spare parts.

I load my Brute trash cans on them and roll them to the curb.  The dolly can fold, but not fold flat.  You basically can stack your Brute cans on one side, and then flip the other side up and have it stand 90 degrees.  This allows you to roll your empty cans and push them against the wall.

The creative cap design not only prevents drying but also prevents accidental loosening and leakage. Sides of the base of the cap have little pins which immobilize into the small holes on the actual body. That interlocking design keeps the cap in place.

My thoughts. The floor seemed good everywhere but around the flange. The toilet while it would turn and lift on one side was still holding fair on one side.

This tubing does the trick, and ten feet provided a perfect amount of tubing for my entire system.

My wife alerted me to something about when we were using this unit but I never knew until she told me recently; We have DirecTV and she said that she had noticed that when the TV was on and this microwave was turned on, the DirecTV receiver gave a bad weather picture and showed an alert that reception was being compromised. I couldn't stand this so, I took this thing out of the garage, where I had stored it for emergencies, and plugged it in. Sure enough, every time I turned it on at any setting, the DirecTV lost picture and gave a reception warning. This was a good 15-20 feet from the TV. This thing may have a dangerous microwave leakage problem and I am reporting this to the proper authorities. I have also decided to junk the thing to get it out of my life.

This barstock tee is extremely strong and well made. I found the threads to be well formed and well within the "standard" for size.

6834	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I picked this up as I had an open circuit in an apartment that took out the 3 receptacles at the end of a branch.  Without this I couldn't find where the break was upstream.  This tool provided a quick and easy solution as I was able to trace the romex buried under the drywall with out a problem.  It is intuitive to use if you have ever used any of the comparable products out there.  I had a different brand that took AAA and watch batteries in the base unit and wand so the 9V batteries this uses is a nice feature.  I don't have to go looking for the little watch batteries around town when I get in a pinch and need the tool now.  Also, this seems sturdier (albeit more expensive) than the previous one I owned.  Of course I stepped on the wand from my other one and that ended its useful life.  Hopefully I can keep my size 13's off of this one.  I have to admit that I am probably biased toward Fluke products as I have a Fluke multimeter from the late 1980's that is still working fine.

Old thick Goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  It is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface

With this kit you can quickly reveal the presence of nitrates and nitrites (usually caused by animal waste). You will test for possibly dangerous heavy metals, including copper, lead, and iron. Iron, by the way, is present in a lot of wells -- observably as ugly orange stains in sinks and toilets. Our water did not display even a trace, which surprised us. The test for dangerous bacteria, as I mentioned, takes two days to "ripen." If the water remains purplish, you're in good shape (ours did).

The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go. The other benefit of an aluminum rod is that it can be used to tap parts without marking them, if done carefully. This is a good all-purpose tool helper to keep around. It weighs almost nothing and can be kept in the range bag or tool box.
On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.

I should point out to people who might be confused about it's name, it doesn't actually "weld" metal.  When you weld metal, it is heated to a high enough temperature to actually melt the metal and a filler metal is simultaneously melted into the pool of molten metal.  This product is a 2 part epoxy that when mixed together at a 1:1 ratio hardens on the surface of the part that you are repairing.  With that being said, I still think that it's a good product.

However, despite purchasing this Shop-Vac coupler and a Shop-Vac hose extension of the proper diameter, this coupling does not provide sufficient grip to keep the two hoses connected. I had to put a layer of duct tape on the cuff of each hose before inserting them into this coupler, then duct tape them together on the outside of the hose and coupler in order to prevent the hoses from slipping out and apart at the slightest nudge. If I'd known I was going to need to use duct tape to hold the hoses together with this coupler I would've simply doubled up on duct tape and done without it.

The biggest issue, and it can be a deal breaker, is that it takes a long time to cure. At least 24 hours, but even then it's not fully hardened. I would actually give shoes a full week to cure and harden up. Most other stuff 48 hours is probably good. So yeah, if you need a quick caulk you might still use silicone or acrylic. Although, this is pretty waterproof even after a few hours, so you don't really have to worry about it that much.

A plastic cover is taped over the switch with the tape going around the brace.

7415	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love liquid electrical tape. This stuff works great. You wipe on with the self contained applicator brush and it dries quickly. The thinner the coat, the quicker it dries. After it dries, if you want a thicker coat, apply more and allow to dry. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired thickness. It is a little hard to maintain a consistent thickness throughout simply due to the nature of the compound and how quickly it dries (or starts to become tacky).

When it came it was covered with heavy machine grease and was anything but "smooth".  Travel had binding spots and just felt off to me.

Threw out the old lead set and am working with this new one now.  Then I read that I should probably change the leads like every 2 or 3 years so I guess I got about 20 more than planned by Fluke.

338	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I had originally purchased this for my DEWALT D26451 Orbital Sander. I first was trying to figure out in what ways I could get it to fit so at first I was disappointed because the smallest end would not fit, but the larger end would fit, but then when the other end was hooked up to the hose it simply was too small to slide on the ShopVac, what I did find though was that on the small end, simply by cutting off a single tier to the adaptor that the next notch up fit my DeWalt with a slight bit of modification. I give it 4 stars because after I cut the small end off it does exactly what I need it to, I took away a star because I had to modify it, but other than that, this thing worked beautfully for what I needed it for... so If you have a DEWALT D26451, THIS WILL WORK, but you will need to cut the smallest tip off using a razor and trip up the inside of the cup and need to stretch it slightly and after that it just slips on like a glove. Since I purchased this exclusively for use with my D26451 modification was not a big deal and especially since the modification was a simple and easy 2-minute fix.

It also arrived with several scratches. This seems to be due to handling during production. The material is relatively soft like a soft wood, which will scratch from pieces rubbing together with dust between the pieces. This was not a problem for me since I used it for industrial purposes.

We love the price point, sporty retro look but more so, the overall quality and weight of this trike. Compared to other similar trikes, this actually has metal body and rubber tires where most others are completely plastic, even the tires. Daughter loves the bell and streamers and that she can go fast and take sharper turns without worry. However, because the trike is metal, it is heavier and harder to pedal. At first she would tire out rather quickly but as we ride more, she is building up strength and endurance.

Now one thing I will tell anyone who has never used a caliper before don't be shocked when you use it and the results do not equal exactly what the item says it is supposed to be and that is not due to the calipers.  I was shocked and thought they were broken until I read up on the subject and found it is because of tolerances of the original manufacturing.  So, I tried a US penny (it has a very tight tolerance for many reasons) and it was spot on (19.05mm in diameter) so I knew it was really not this caliper.

So far Im satisfied with this item. Shop Fox is well known for crappy paint jobs but this has been painted properly. I expect to get a lot of use out of it, and didn't have to pay a fortune for it. Your going to need mounting bolts and nuts for it (1/4").

1996	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	The outside dimensions and design of this line splitter are fine. Both of my clamp -on ammeters fit the 1X and 10X holes well. And, the voltage meter probe holes are handy. But I immediately noticed that , when plugging into the female end, the plugs tended to spring back out.  This was especially true for two blade plugs.  Something was obviously wrong with the female receptacle contacts, so I took the device apart to investigate. Sure enough, the blade contacts were so far recessed into the housing that the plug blades barely made contact.  The internal shape of the plastic housing suggests that it was designed for longer blade contacts, but short ones were used instead. Also, one power wire was not soldered to the blade contact, as were the other wires. The unsoldered wire was simply pushed through a hole in the contact, but someone forgot to solder it. I modified the blade contacts so that plug blades would make good contact, and I soldered the loose wire. Still, however, the female plug receptacle contacts are weak, and will eventually break if this device is used often. To address that problem, I plugged a multi-plug adapter into the female end,  and I plan to tape or glue the adapter into place . That way, the unit's internal weak blade contacts will not repeatedly be stressed by inserting plugs directly into the unit.  Also, the stiff, solid wire inside is soldered to one of the plug receptacle flexible contacts. That joint is bound to eventually break as the receptacle flexes. How this device qualified for a UL listing, I'll never know. But, having spent about two hours modifying it , I do plan to keep it , and use it when needed.  ( The "Kill a Watt" power meters, also sold by Amazon,  are a better bet for most uses, and far more versatile.)

In closing, these probes are part of a modular test lead system.

I saw another reviewer complain that he thought it was 48 and only got 24, but the General Tool website says 48 pieces and 24 grommets, which is right. Another complained about lead. A trace amount of lead is often used for lubrication purposes to prevent the grommets from sticking to the punch, causing you to destroy the grommet to get it off. You'd have to suck on a grommet for a while to get lead traces into your system, so keep them out of your mouth and you'll be fine. It's a good little kit and will help you get more use from old tarps, or help you in other DIY projects that call for grommets.  The materials are good quality and the grommet halves are accurately made to fit together well. At a great price, you can't ask for more!

Of course super glue doesn't work for all applications.  And sometimes it's hard to figure out which ones it does work for and which ones it doesn't.  But when it does, it's great.  When it doesn't you try something else, or throw out the broken item.  It's just adhesive, it can't work miracles.

9776	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is the super glue you need for any job. It is small enough where you can use the entire amount. The bigger one tends to dry out or seal the cap where you can't open it again. Even if you don't use the entire amount and it seals on you then you are only loosing  a little amount of glue. The price for this is worth it just for that reason.

It is conformable and you simply cut off (I used a hack saw) the portion you don't need.  I had an odd coupling between a Festool vacuum and a small Jet sander and this is the only way I could make the connection work.  The cut end is rough and I suppose I could use a sander or fine knife to trim the edge but it hasn't proven necessary.  Quality is good, material is conformable, highly recommended.

Sonicare performs only as well as the brush head allows it to! Don't try to stint on brush head replacements. Philips recommends replacing the brush head every 6 months. I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective. I'd say change the brush head every 3-6 months. Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you? More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you? Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched? Don't believe me?

Anyway, Gorilla Glue.... Five stars. Excellent product when used as designed. Very high strength and waterproof.  Can't ask for more than that....
Place a peice of tape (ideally masking tape) perpendicularly across the EZ tape near the end.  Rub the masking (or other) tape to insure maximum adhesion.  As slowly as you can, peel up the end of the EZ tape back to the masking (or other) tape.  Because of the slivering, you may have to peel back 5 or 6 "slivers".  Then peel off the "unit" held together by the masking tape.
Goop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amazing-Goop-All-Purpose-Household-Goop-3-7-Ounce-Tube-130012/dp/B0000A605I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012</a>

I've used this scope in my nursing school labs and have had really good results with it.

4378	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Yes it's marketed as a caulk and it works perfectly for that. But as a flexible glue it is absolutely the best. It sticks to basically anything, and I mean sticks. It's waterproof, VERY flexible even when a few years old. I use it to repair shoe and boot soles, it's much better for that than Shoe Goo which turns yellow and hardens and peels off after a couple months. It sticks as a glue MUCH better than any other caulk. It's much stronger and tougher physically as a glue. Yes silicone stays flexible but it's a lousy glue. It stays flexible and doesn't crack like almost any other glue.

There is no definitive consensus nor clear epidemiological evidence yet as to how much milligauss (mG) for extended periods could be harmful (within reasonable home/office real world levels). However, there is a consensus from studies that staying under 1mG-4mG would be a good defensive strategy in case 20-40 years from now longer term studies (think smoking, etc.) start showing stronger causal relationships. Most folks who care about this aim for under 2mG, preferably under 1mG, especially where pacemakers can be involved.

I read the other reviews here and they talked about how the fan would spin hard when it wasn't on. Mine will spin freely if the wind blows thorough the house.

If I get another few years out of them it would be worth it as they are cheaper than running my central air.
White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elmer-s-All-Multipurpose-White-Glue-7-5-8-oz-E379/dp/B0013CBH9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz.

Once you have mixed it in your hands, you have about5 minutes or so to shape it before it starts to hardens so I try and use 1/2 - 1 inch "slices" of the roll - unless I obviously need a bigger piece for one project.  Better to go with smaller pieces for multiple locations so that you don't end up wasting it if it hardens too soon.  I use it for all kinds of stuff.

1619	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Before reviewing this item I should explain how I came to use it. I was reading a recent special issue of Popular Woodworking Magazine entitled "The Ultimate Guide to Tablesaws 2004". In this magazine I found the article "19 Step Tune-up" by Paul Anthony. This article explained a lot to me and really emphasized the importance of keeping your tablesaw (and other tools) properly adjusted. He explained the many components of a tool that can be checked/calibrated using a dial indicator. I assumed throughout the article that he was probably using some $300 model that would forever be out of my reach. Imagine my surprise when he revealed that he was using the Grizzly dial indicator with magnetic base attachment, and that these items are precise and affordable on every budget!

Depending on the type of current draw, the accuracy tends to vary.  Placed in series with a Fluke 87V, the clamp meter tended to be at most 10% off when the draw was continuous, and it did not matter which leg of device you used.  When the draw was heavily pulsed, the clamp meter did not read the peak current but averaged them, while the Fluke could show the peak draw, and if set to MIN-MAX mode, one could measure MIN, AVE and MAX current.

6841	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Haven't had it long, or used it much but has performed extremely well so far. Easy open cap, once i figured out that i had to use my fingernail or a small screwdriver to get down into the safety latch to open it. Opened easily. I had a pair of small wire cutters that i used for craftwork. they had gotten a bit rusted somehow from lack of use and incorrect storeage, apparently. This oil loosened the joints and removed the rust easily.
I have found it particularly useful in locating radiating power spiking areas in my home of recent.  Much of the spiking,  as it turns out, originated from my new wireless modem.  It does not radiate like one would expect either.  I have some selective areas that were very "hot" with nearly 1000 mico-watts pulses and others very close by with only 300 to 400 micro-watts by comparisons.  The goal was to see if I could effect a change to reduce any area in the home, except right close to the modem itself, to levels below 200 micro watts/sq meter.  I finally achieved that through experimentation for most areas, and I particularly focused on bedroom areas since we were all having some trouble with sleep patterns and repeated wake-ups in the night more than it should be..... or like it used to be previously.  As I looked back, after using this instrument, I realized that it all seemed to get gradually worse when I setup the original wireless network in our home, but it got a lot worse when I bought the newer ActionTech GT784WN which has a VERY strong excellent wifi strength signal!

(2)  The lever-lock ring is hard to close (it's very tight).  This is good for a one-time use of hazardous materials but not good for a product that will be opened to be emptied repeatedly.
7485	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Used ittoday to drill a couple holes in the bed of my truck working on a project. One was in a reinforced spot and had no issues going right through. Didn't use a punch and didn't have an issue with the bit walking but mostly because the sprayed bed liner helped.  Only a few holes in sheet metal and some 3/16" thick aluminum but seem to hold it's cutting edge well. Time will tell on longevity but price was good enough for me compared to much pricier bits.
This glue works as advertised. It is incredibly strong and waterproof. One of the main features (and concerns..) is it's tendency to expand and fill openings. If you have a tight fit and are securely clamped, the glue will tend to penetrate into the softer wood substrates and fill all of the wood pores and the available space. This is a GOOD thing. If, on the other hand, your joint is not fitted tightly, the glue will still expand and will fill available space but will not penetrate into the wood as much. This is still better than the older carpenter's glues in this respect. But you need to clamp securely to get the best results.

I have been using this as a 3D print bed running almost non stop since I got it.  We have printed a fallout 4 T45 Helmet, A combat shotgun and a 10mm pistol also from fallout 4 and a bunch of other stuff.  I have done prints out to almost 8 hours.  They have all been PLA so far so no report yet on ABS but the PLA has been flawless.  Sticks when it should and comes off easy.  It is easy to cleanoff and so far the material hasn't even scratched .  You have to play with temps to get it right.  I normally used 55c bed temps for printing PLA on blue tape.  With this stuff 55C stick so hard I can't get it all off.  I tried 35 C and it didn;t stick well enough.  45C seems about right BUT if you are printing small or tall things with a small footprint then add a brim and maybe a raft if the item is very tall.  That way it still comes off pretty easy but sticks well enough. 5 degrees either way seems to matter a lot so if you try it, play with temps before you decide.  For me, there's no going back for PLA.  I just bought 2 more pieces to keep handy just in case the original piece breaks.

Durability is pretty much what one should expect at this price point, just adequate. I don't see any kind of sealing, so I can see machining oil/coolant killing this thing pretty quickly.  Call it good for inspection, not good for factory floor.  Mine came with a loose battery cover, and judging by the design, this is probably a common issue.  There is a fix of sorts: Insert a piece of masking tape under the cover.  It will tighten up nicely.

The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go. The other benefit of a brass rod is that it can be used to tap parts without marking them, if done carefully. This is a good all-purpose tool helper to keep around.

For general purpose glue, I love the Loctite one-step gels, and Gorilla Glue. They work great at what they do. However, those products are not appropriate for applications that require high-strength, high-heat resistance, shock resistance, and substantial longevity. For applications as such, this (the Original and NOT the Kwik) is the product you want. Sometimes referred to as a "2k epoxy" or "2s epoxy", this is one of the strongest epoxies that is readily available, affordable, and in practical sizes for home usage (there are many good makers of 2k's, but none are as easy to find for a cheap price in convenient sizes as JB Weld).

I especially like being able to switch from metric to inches and the accuracy works well enough for my limited home use. The price seemed almost too low but other reviews convinced me the quality was there and so far so good. Some reviews criticized it (and others) for the level of accuracy not being up to snuff for engineering requirements. They're probably right but who expects that kind of quality and accuracy at this price point? For most home shops this one should work just fine and you won't have to spend hundreds of dollars.

VetMed shipped via US Postal Service via DHL which added two additional days onto the "free 2 day delivery" to my area and does not offer any en-route shipment tracking; The shipping delay is not VetMed's problem, it is a problem with my local post office, but a recurring one. The cups are not as flexible; and the graduations are not as sharp and clear. They are made from a different material. I did not tear open the sealed plastic bags they came in so I can't determine if they are as solvent-resistant as the first batch or if they have the same handy supplemental markings on them because I may return them. I haven't made up my mind if it is worth the effort to ship them back since we aren't talking about much money here. I'm sure this second batch would be fine for dispensing meds, but since I'm using mine for mixing glues and paints I am not nearly as enamored of them.

8607	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Well, here's a new one for Duct Tape. My neighbor has a Mercedes M80 SUV and it has a little plastic antenna above the rear door. I guess it's used for GPS systems and phones. In any case, it broke. So, my neighbor asked me to help her in-as-much as she was traveling on a 200-mile trip and she couldn't have the antenna thingy flopping around while she was traveling at 80 MPH down the freeway. Well, I couldn't fix it and the only thing I could suggest was to tape it together with duct tape on a temporary basis, until it could be taken back to the dealer and replaced. That seemed reasonable so we did it and it worked fine. Afterwards we were laughing about her driving a Mercedes that was held together by duct tape.

Ok ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.
4276	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is one heavy duty unit. It's very heavy, very well-made and will fit a ton of tools or other items.

Overall, very impressed with this cart!
5200	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	After my share of owning a plastic gas container and seeing it swelled up like a balloon (ready to burst?), I opted for a metal gas can.  I decided on this Eagle product based on the positive reviews.  It is well built.  It doesn't leak gasoline vapor after you filled it.  Mine came with several dents as mentioned by other reviewers.  Amazon was kind enough to send a replacement.  But guess what, even the replacement had similar dents on it.  Go figure!  Another gripe I had was the difficulty of filling the container at the pump.  In California, most gas station pump nozzles requires a tight seal for the auto-shutoff to work.  With this container, there is a metal screen just below the can's opening.  This make it impossible for me to push the gas pump nozzle deep enough to get that seal, so no gas can be pumped.  I finally figured out that if you use a plasic funnel you can get a good seal around this and this eventually allowed me pump the gas into the container.  No other reviewers mentioned this problem so it must be an isolated issue.  Overall, this is a much better and safer container than any of those plastic ones.
5889	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This is the best duct tape for the money, as it is much sticker and stronger than regular duct tape or any other tape I have used.  Just make sure surface is completely clean and dry, and press down firmly and uniformity for max. adhesion.

9402	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I've been using this for a bit turning a bunch of wood products.  I do utilize wet sanding on some products.  There's been minimal oxidation on this.  I suspect that the oxidation was because I might not have wiped down the live center like i do the bed, but a little sanding and wax and it's good to go.

One of my favorite and regular uses is in the garden - when a plastic bucket or planter cracks from age I get many more years of use out of it by using Gorilla tape.

When using the pre-programmed Popcorn button, you select the ounce size of bag you are popping and hit start.  As others have pointed out - you may find that it has burnt your popcorn. BUT the next time you cook popcorn, after you press the Popcorn button, select your size of bag - THEN before you hit start, you can adjust the time shorter or longer using the "More/Less" button to adjust to your preferences.  This allows those who like slightly burnt to add more time.  Most of us wanting that just right cooked bag find that using less time pops a perfect bag.  Be aware that Popcorn cook time varies slightly among brands of popcorn.

Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that.

4233	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased this product (the Silver Gray for 2 car garage) twice now and find it to be an excellent product when you follow the directions and apply it properly.  My first garage that I did this in, I didn't quite follow the directions and had some hot tire peeling after a year or so.  Having learned that lesson, in my next place, I made sure I follow the directions exactly.  It is especially important to clean the floor thoroughly and use the etching so that you have proper adherence to the floor.  Apply the product within the time frame and make sure you are thorough when applying.  Don't worry about running short on the product as Rustoleum provides enough product to use for a 2 car garage and then some. I actually had extra paint that I used as an additional coating.  I will say that if you are applying the blue decorative flakes to make sure you apply evenly or you will run short as sometimes as in the case of my second garage, the two packages did not have an equal amount of flakes.  Thinking it was divided evenly between the halves of the garage, I ended up with more on one side than the other.  One of the most important steps is to make sure you apply it in the right temperatures and give your garage floor several days to properly cure up.  I let mine sit for at least 4 days.  In addition, if you want this to last a long time, I took it a further step and bought Rustoleum clear coat for painted surfaces.  After allowing the gray coating to cure for 4 days or so, I applied the additional clear coating over the surface and let it cure an additional 4 to 7 days.  Yes, I know it an additional cost as this stuff can be a bit pricey and is a bit of a pain having all your stuff and cars out of the garage but this additional step will prevent most peoples complaints about hot tire pickup after a year or so.  My garage looks brand new after two years with no issues and no tire pickup or flaking anywhere in the garage.  Price wise this normally is in the 90 to 100 buck range (sometimes on sale for 80 to 90) for a 2 car garage and if it is any higher, then you should look elsewhere.
5549	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Good product and good service.


7341	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Once dried, this stuff is a pretty darn good, rubbery coating.

While I'm not a professional, I do understand the basics behind using a stethoscope. I bought this on a recomemndation from a doctor friend and his recommendation was spot on. This stethoscope has two different types of sounds that you can hear based on how much pressure is applied to the diaphragm. While the pressure applied to the ear pieces is sufficient to seal off outside sounds, the shape of the ear buds and the pressure level applied to seal them is still comfortable even while using it for a long time. Having used these for four and a half years, I must say they certainly are top of the line - as I've used many others the last few decades. To put it simply, you won't be disappointed in these!
4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly. I recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by Intel are notoriously poor. Zalman makes some great ones. Do NOT buy on that uses push pins to lock in place. You want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your CPU. This is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.

The frequency range of 30Hz/40Hz to 300Hz usually covers much of low frequency EMF produced in a home or office. This includes the U.S. 60 Hz AC power frequency and 4 of the harmonic frequencies from that. Thus we usually aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover over a few hundred Hz or so. However, note that capping the upper end of the low frequencies in the low hundreds may fail to capture a good portion of CFL's EMF (compact fluorescent lights) if that is important to you.

Ordered this Arctic Silver 5 stuff and immediately at application, the difference was obvious. It's extremely thick and spreads very evenly. I used a guitar pick and got it very thin and very even on the heat sink plate. I installed it and immediately ran the Prime95 torture test...
I've also have had good results using it to clean soap scum off tiles and shower doors, getting in the nooks/crannies around faucets and toilets, and cleaning drips/spills in the oven and on the range top. Light to moderate dirt/grime comes up with just steam. More intensive messes (or ones that are very greasy) need to be sprayed first with a spray cleaner (409, Fantastic, or whatever brand you like) to help the steam do its work.

7266	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I like making stuff out of poly-carb, cutting is straight-forward (like wood), bending is straight-forward with heat.  Worked well.  Seems to spook birds at one of my large bird-feeders versus the old plexi-glass the squirrels destroyed, but the squirrels haven't been able to do anything to this PC.  Almost like the poly-carb is a little more reflective than the dull-transparent look of plexi.
Not too impressed with this unit.

6440	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a solid set of calipers at this price point. It's easy to switch between mm and inches; the "inches" scale gives you good fractional readout; the measurements are highly repeatable; and the lock nut works fine. Overall, a good deal.
9683	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	The case is the big problem.  The case I received was either older or mis-manufactured.  Despite great effort and careful use of a razor knife, I was finally able to get the case open without damaging the case too much and not damage the Super Glue tubes inside.  When I tried to open the case the second time, it was almost as difficult to open.  I like having 10 tubes of Super Glue on hand at one time, but in a case this difficult to open is not welcome.
Note: It may be offered cheaper at a retail store but I like the convenience of amazon so I did not compare the prices
Update...even better than I thought.  Smooths out nicely with a water wet paper towel too. My favorite outdoor chalk for foundation to concrete patio floor seal.  The  tube goes a long way too.

4735	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The Kreg SML-C150-100 pocket screws 1 1/2 inch install quickly in plywood and particle board; although these are not pocket screw applications.  The course screws work well in these materials and not so well in very fine grained material.  If used in the wrong material they can split the wood.  I use them for securing jigs and rough outdoor projects.  The wide head holds very well in fences and other odd jobs.  I seldom use them for pocket holes because of the length.  They will penetrate most projects unless they are made with extra wide material such as 2x4s.
4951	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Great little fitting. Allowed me to install a nice ball cock to drain the compressor tank. Strong and properly made at a good price.
(2) it's completely indistinguishable from any cut ABS pipe laying around, and I fear can be easily lost. This coupling really ought to  be brightly colored, and/or have distinguishing marks of some sort on it, so it doesn't inadvertently end up in the scrap bin. Nothing a wrap of bright yellow vinyl electricians tape won't solve.
I use it for many different things. Because this is liquid, I put it on anything I want to protect. Works perfect on bare wires. I have used it as cushioning between two objects. I have even put it on sharp edges to protect from cuts. This takes a few layers but turns out nice. Once it dries, it is nearly impossible to get it off and forms, what feels like, a soft rubber film.
Otherwise great packaging, no blemishes, welded fine, and made some nice HD tie rods from it.
you never know when it will come in handy.
I won't comment on the makeup of the alloy here. I don't know if it is recommended for potable water use or not. Since that wasn't my application, I was not concerned with the specific alloy in use.
3542	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I used this to repair some seams in our bathrooms on counter tops and in a faux marble shower.  It was easy to install, cut and squeeze the tube to get a fairly consistent bead of caulk in the corners and seams. I used a bevel tool to get a nice corner seal.  I used the almond to match the color of the ceramic tiles and the faux marble.

7106	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this rod to use as a squib rod, primarily. For those unfamiliar with that term, a squib is bullet that gets stuck in the barrel of a gun due to insufficient propellant (powder). At 0.3125" diameter, this rod will work perfectly in any 9mm, .38 Special, .357 magnum. It will also work fine in larger calibers like 40 S&W and .45 ACP. The 12" length is perfect to ensure that even super long handgun barrels (like some long revolvers) can benefit from its use.

Do not be fooled by that cheap third cousin twice removed electrical tape. This is the prize you desire. It will not turn to goo and fall apart in the heat. Nor will it become a rock in the cold laughing at you while trying to peel it apart. It stays useable in just about any condition you want to be working in, and most you do not want to be in as well. That is where it really counts. If you are not a hack, you buy this tape. If you are a hack, aspire to be better and buy this tape.

4218	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	No, I'm not a surgeon, but I need a sharp knife to help me with my home projects. One of the most common honey-do projects is painting. If you take pride in your painting first you must tape your jobs off. When taping doors, woodwork etc., you know how difficult it is to tape off a complex corner or around the base of a door jam. Taping the item off and then using this knife to cut the wood's profile will make painting, and not getting paint on the floor, much easier. Of course there are many other things you can do with this knife, but most require a medical license.

Now, granted, the 115 *is* described as being designed for "soft" materials, and I *had* looked at the fluted Tungsten Carbide cutters, which are described as being "for hard materials", but I wanted a larger cutting head and, most especially, something with a cutting surface on the flat end, not just the sides.

I Received these rods today in a well protected container of cardboard tube.  They are straight, good stainless steel and will go into making a forever crab trap of my design. I love it and they are reasonable cost and delivered free with Amazon Prime if you have it.  It is well worth the cost, and other benefits come with Prime membership.  They just need to lower the cost or not make Prime covered items more expensive.  The cost of these two rods was $15.94 delivered. If I could have gotten it local, I would have, but at a much higher cost.  Stainless Steel is like a precious metal to retailers, but I appreciate being able to locate and purchase this type of product.  Thank You for making it available.

9908	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The qualities that I want from duct tape are good adhesion, decent tolerance for heat and moisture, and value for price. This seems to fulfill all requirements and has six-month clean removal to boot. I haven't yet tested the removal process after months of use, but if you mis-apply and pull it off soon after applying, I can say that it removes clean without residue. The tape seems to hold quite strongly and does what you'd expect duct tape to do. I like the color of this duct tape better than the standard issue silver. I also have black duct tape which is relatively shiny and this is more of a matte finish so it's less glaringly obvious that you've taped something up.  I also checked online pricing for a similar quantity of tape and found that Amazon's price is competitive, if not cheaper.

6220	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I've gone thru 3 different Voltage Ticks lately because the others were completely useless. This one is only partially useless. The problem is that most will light up even on low voltage DC current, which does not suit my purpose. As a home inspector I need to verify if it's high voltage 110v AC or Low Voltage like 5-20v DC. Low voltage can be exposed but high can't. This one sometimes will light up on low voltage but mostly not. Don't know what has changed lately but I don't recall having this problem years ago.

I will use this to calibrate my pH meter about once per month and use it to measure the wort in homebrew. I have found that calculations from Bru'in Water are pretty accurate so just use this to confirm and to adjust for future predictions. Darker malts generally go a little lower than predicted and lighter malts a little higher.  Since a lot of the mashing completes pretty rapidly, adjusting the wort after the fact is less useful.

All in all, however, I'm happy with this. It makes it much easier to clean grout lines on my kitchen counters and floors, which is the main reason I got it. Again, it's not magic - you still need to put some work into it, but it's much, much, MUCH easier than using a scrub brush. What works well for me is to spray on some grout and tile cleaner first, let it set for a moment, then hit it with the steam. Wipe up with a clean microfiber towel and move on to the next section. I can do an entire room in the time it used to take me to do a small area with my trusty scrub brush.

As others have mentioned, when you are done and your carpets look very clean, it pays to take the extra time to go over the entire carpet again with plain hot water - no cleaning solution added. Believe it or not, the cleaning solution leaves a very slight residue that actually attracts dirt. Your carpets will stay clean much longer of you perform the clean water rinse. I've done it both ways and I can attest that the clean water rinse is definitely worth it in the long run.

9078	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have many uses for WD-40 but bought this primarily to spray on my lawnmower blades after each mowing.  First, I clean off the blades with a hose and wipe off the dirt, then I give a good spray on the edges of the blades to help prevent corrosion and keep the blades sharp.  Once it's sprayed on, I just leave it wet, don't remove the WD-40 or wipe it down.  I've heard it's good to spray along baseboards and outside the house along the foundation to repel insects but I didn't really have an insect problem anyway so I'm not sure it's the reason I'm pretty much insect free in the house.  I also use it in the winter on snow shovels  and my snowblower chute to keep the wet snow from sticking.  Cooking spray works well for that too but this is a review of WD-40.

The process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.

1534	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	You will have better luck using this sort of foam if you apply it to the door rather than the molding... so that it compresses rather than scraping across something or having something scrape across it.... won't work well that way.  If you put it ON the door, on the side that you want sealed (not on the edge of the door, not on the door fame, but right ON the door) it will look terrible but will seal and stay in place.  Put thick foam like this one where you feel the most air coming through, and trim it or put thinner foam on the hinge part of the molding, so that the backside of the door presses up against it.  Putting it on the edges of the door, especially UNDER the door will not work more than a couple of times.  Adjust the thickness with a box knife or scissors so that the door can still close, but not pop back open without you noticing.  The cheap hollow-core doors tend to warp in weather changes, so it's good to buy plenty if you have doors you need to have sealed.

3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naphtha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off "white glue" and clean up with a moist paper towel.

Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BAZIC-Super-Glue-3-grams-0-10-ounces-6-Per-Pack/dp/B003BSF7ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per Pack</a>

Fast forward to the UPS drop-off, and the cheap tape was already lifting off the box in numerous places. Argh.
Ordered this one and one from HQRP at the same time to see which was better. They both seem to be of equal quality and brightness. Big difference is shipping speed. The TerraLUX I had in 2 days and the HQRP took a week and HQRP is quite a few states closer. 5 stars because of the fast shipping. I will buy a few more for my other lights.

I used this white Duck Brand electrical tape (and some of the same brand white duct tape) to patch it up. It does a great job of making the damage unnoticable and also will hold the fence section very well structurally. It was great for getting some protection and support around the smaller cracked areas. Electrical tape is a must have item around the home, and I like having a roll of white in addition to the usual black. Also makes great ad-hoc labels - small piece of white tape and a sharpie!

By the way, when ordering metals through Amazon check the prices for various lengths of the same stock - often a longer piece is considerably cheaper per foot than a shorter piece. And if it is listed through Amazon prime the shipping is the same - already included.

4522	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Broke at the hand pump neck. Waste of money in my opinion. I went and bought another set that was only 18 dollars. It's the ordinary one you see doctors hand around their neck. Works a lot better and is a lot more efficient than this one. The reason why I say this one is less efficient is because you have to hold the pump with one hand and that hand is tied up. I find it cumbersome because of the pump. I'm faster with the cheaper one.

2932	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	The unit works well as I expected.  Most of the values are under 0.5%, which means during use the resulting value is very close to the expected value.

While a starter hole is a help, it is not needed with this bit.  Where a bit like this really shines, is for sheet metal use, or enlarging an existing hole.

1974	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	100% Silicone is one of the best types of sealants, and this may just be the best I've used. But be warned, it is extremely difficult to get a nice perfect bead, even if you're good at caulking. Basically you can only touch it once- as soon as you lift your finger for any reason (to wipe away excess caulk, or continue the bead), it's nearly impossible to continue from where you left off without messing up the bead. And if you try to go over the bead again to fix it(big mistake!), you'll make it much worse- so for minor imperfections, it's better to just leave it.

But, this J-B epoxy works terrific.  I have never been disappointed with it's performance.  Even though it is advertised as being "clear", I noticed that the material is a dark brown/gray color as it is being mixed.  Perhaps it does dry clear.  But, I can't say for sure because I haven't been able to see much of the epoxy after it has cured.  Whenever I need a strong epoxy, I will stick with J-B or Devcon.

All the above has proven true since that was written.  I thought to add to this accounting of events that I put the power on the wifi down to 25% and it took the signal strength down to more minimum levels around the bedrooms, yet, all of our wifi equipment works perfectly.  So this is good to know.  Be aware also that we receive a LOT of "stuff" from places unknown coming into our environment..... radio station signals, TV, etc. etc. so we do need to exercise care at least on our own end as to just how much we add to this cumulative amount of radiation that we have to live in. I found that our GE microwave emitted a large amount of wicrowave energy out of the lower bottom area of our unit just below and behind the door opening. It is a high end over-the-counter type of unit. Not much I can do about that except do stand close up to it while it is cooking something, ha ha!  I just thought this might be of interest to you. The one draw back to any quality unit is that once you have used it and corrected the problems, you may not need it again for a long time, so it just sits unused and wasting your money.  But, it just may be worth it anyway!  Be wise, Gary

One of the rods has a 'micro-adjuster'  in the center of it that is supposed to let you make small adjustments in the indicator position.  I find this feature to be pretty useless.  The joint is unstable, moves too easily, and it can screw up your measurements if you're not careful.  I usually avoid having the micro-adjuster in the setup by moving the indicator to the same side of the adjuster as the clamp that joins the 2 rods.

The one thing that kept me from rating this a 5 was there were no specs for the size of the threaded shaft. I assumed it was a 3/8 shaft and had welded ends on my table legs as such only to get the wheels and find they have what appears to be 7/16 threads or could be metric. I am pretty irate since I have to cut off the end of my table legs to accommodate the larger size (another 2 hours of work plus material). I will go to a hardware store to find out what nuts fit the stem.
There are two separate sets of output controller PC boards and a smaller third one for the 5 VDC and 3 Amp output port.  The rear of the unit has a large aluminum heat sink that dissipates any excess heat from the voltage regulators.  I show the inside of the unit in the attached video.
8879	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this item to use to make acrylic skins based on the recommendation of several artists. So far I have only used the sheet wrapped with parchment paper although you can use heavy plastic bags or an old shower curtain. I have tried the sheet not covered with parchment paper with paint that wasn't very good quality & the results were mediocre. I am going to try to make skins with a pouring medium & golden paints & I suspect the results will be better. Recommended for acrylic skins by several artists.

Dislikes: cannot disable turntable:  Every other microwave we have owned with a turntable, had a little roller mechanism that engaged the drive hub, and carried the turntable.  If you had something that wouldn't turn inside, you just lifted up the table, removed the little roller/hub mechanism, and the plate was stationary on the bottom of the oven.  This one has the drive hub engage the turntable directly, so unless you physically put something underneath it (you can use a large microwave safe dish) the drive hub is always trying to 'grab' the lugs formed into the turntable itself.  The problem with raising it up, means you have that much less space.  It is not that big a deal, as it may only be an issue once in a great while, if at all, but thought it worth mentioning.

The ding could be a bit louder but honestly it's not a deal breaker. It's easy to use, the inverter technology actually works. With our old microwave we had to put foods on the outer ring to make sure it was heated all the way through (and even then it often had cold spots) I've not had cold spots in hot food even when I don't put it on the edge of the turn table.

I ran into feed problems every so often and I probably would not have noticed it if I had not also had to go buy more of these, but a different brand, from my local hardware store. They were GripRite and once I started to run those, I did not have a single misfire and all of the grip rite nails drove in to the proper depth. It was like they were lubricated and the B&C were not, though neither actually is. Anyhow, I could have easily gone through the entire project and been happy with these nails if it was the only ones I had. Price wise, I think the big box store was as good on price if not better and came in a larger quantity. So I probably would not buy these again if/when I have to. My recommendation would be to shop around.

It's a little thin with only 1 application. I would imagine for most projects, you would use to layers. I used it in conjunction with expandable braided sleevinng and it filled the nooks and crannies no problem. But you had to push it in as the viscosity as said earlier is like pudding.

This stuff is not as effective as the big bricks from Allied, but for a home shop they do okay for buffing brass instruments.

The plastic case comes with a hole in the top, and one on the side so you can choose where to mount the eye bolt, but the gap you have to weasel the nut into is too narrow to fit a socket into, and too wide to lock the sides of the nut, so you can't really tighten the nut all that well.

They are obviously sturdy little bottles.
The biggest plus is the price. I've looked at steam cleaners for years, but was always put off by the steep price tags. Some of the high end European models run $1,500 or more - for that kind of money, I'd rather pay someone to clean for me! So, a low price is a big plus.

Try filling the other barrels with mulch and carrying them around, you'll rip the handles right off..
9596	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	First, let's be clear.  This is not a set of probes with permanently attached leads. If you want the version with leads permanently attached, you want the TL175.  These TP175E are modular probes with a shrouded banana jack on the back end.  To use these probes you need to purchase at minimum a set of leads with banana plugs on both ends.  An excellent (and highly recommended) example would be the Fluke TL224.
It uses an inverter, which is like an accelerator pedal in a car.  It lowers the output power by reducing the output of microwave energy. Most other standard brands just cycle 100% power using an "on and off" method.  (at a 50% setting - half of the time 100% power is turned on, then half of the time zero power off - in a 10 to 15 second window that repeats to vary the power over time).  Imaging driving your car this way; pressing the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor to hit 100 mph, then coasting back to zero and repeating again.  You may average 50 mph, (like a 50% setting) but the repeated cycling on and off tears up your vehicle, simarly the 100% to zero then back on to 100% cycle on your food in a microwave is not the same as food cooked in a Panasonic inverter controlled at a reduced power over time.

Consider Gorilla Tape duct tape (or "duck" tape if you prefer) on steroids...or at least on a hardcore workout regime. In my opinion it holds tighter and lasts longer than other similar heavy duty tapes in most situations.
This magnetic base, stand and indicator seemed of relatively comparable quality to ones back in the day that were hundreds of dollars.  The only place I could notice any difference in quality from a more expensive one was in the dial indicator itself and the magnetic base.  The actual dial indicator seemed a slight bit more flimsy and not as durable as pro grade ones and the base's magnetic clamping force seemed a bit less but this was still fine for my use as I only needed this to setup a one-off automotive ring and pinion gear swap.  Most importantly it seemed accurate enough.  This set also came in a decent blow-molded plastic case for storage which I appreciated.
8415	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I can't tell the difference between this and the 3M auto body repair tape.  This tape has a paper liner and the other stuff doesn't, but once you separate the liner it seems like the same stuff.

7496	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I used this to cut holes thru fairly thin, painted metal.  It made the holes like a hot knife going into butter.  No oil needed at all, no overheating, but I had to make sure I did not apply too much pressure, as it can easily cut the hole to the next larger diameter. Remember to do a 'back  cut" from the other side, as when you drill from one side, it tends to push jagged metal out of the way onto the other side. So, light pressure from the back side will get rid of the jaggies and it all will look perfect.
It would be nice if a version of Gorilla Tape had nylon filaments, similar to strapping tape. While strong, Gorilla Tape does not have the tensile strength provided by such reinforcing fibers. This feature would then allow Gorilla Tape to be employed in a number of other applications where it could serve as a structural element instead of merely a bonding medium.
Adhesive keeps tape where it belongs but is also easy enough to remove is necessary.

The only reason I took one star away is because I see no other way you could use this product without running your hand or some form of tool over it to force it into cracks or to ensure it adheres to the surface of the object you are applying it to.

The tensile strength test really surprised me. I took several samples of each brand and folded the tape, adhesive side in, creating double-thickness strips 1/2-inch wide. I placed one end in a bench vice with padded jaws so the metal would not break the tape. I placed the other end in the cushioned jaws of a Vice-Grip. (A piece of bicycle inner tube works great for this purpose.) A new Rapala digital fishing scale hooked to the Vice-Grip would reveal at what weight the strip of tape would break.
I really like having the small tubes instead of large ones.

I taped a plastic crate that I use for hauling packages to the Post Office.  The side of the crate had cracked and needed to be repaired.  I used a a good three foot strip of tape that extended half way around the crate.  After a few weeks of use the tape completely failed - it literally split in two like masking tape.  I simply pulled the crate out of the back of my car and one of edges of it (the crate, not the tape) caught on the bottom.  I tugged a little and that little bit of pressure popped the tape right in two as if it were nothing.  I have never seen duct tape behave like this, not once.

8823	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I am using this as a printing surface for my 3D printer.  I saw the name brand poly printing surfaces and did a bunch of reading and ended up here for $5 instead of there for $15.  Overall I am very happy with it.  I cut it using a metal straight edge and initially cutting with an XActo knife blad.  Then I reversed the blade and scored over and over making sure to cut fairly deeply in the front and reverse sides before trying to bend and snap. I am holding it to my print bed using binder clips and it is working fine.  I read where people said they could print PLA with no heated bed but I could not.  I tried none, and then low bed temps and always got curling and failure to stick.  I went back to the 55C bed temp that I had been using for blue painters tape and it sticks fine.  I was worried that I would not be able to get the part off the bed when finished but so far it has been easier than painters tape by far.  I haven't tried ABS yet but PLA works great.  If  you have trouble getting your part to stick just up your bed temp a little and make sure the nozzle is pressing the bead into the surface.  if the bead is round the bed is too low.  If the bead is flat then probably too high (you don't want the nozzle to hit this surface).  If the bead is oval and flattish but not completely flat then it should stick just fine.  If you still have issues just clean the surface lightly with alcohol and then dry completely.

6680	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this scope to replace a Prestige Clinical I Stethoscope that I recently returned. This scope is worth every cent of the higher price. I could barely hear anything from the Prestige, but can hear sounds much more clearly with this scope. Plus it is much more comfortable, there are fewer "static" sounds from touching the tubes, it comes with extras and a clearly written instruction manual, and it feels built to last. It is more adaptable to different needs and would be suitable for anyone whose hearing is not 100% or works in somewhat noisy conditions. All in all the Prestige Clinical I Stethoscope seems a cheap knock off of this scope.

Mixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!
This sealant cures extremely quickly- nearly instantly, in the hot & humid conditions I used it in. It also had very little odor when I applied it, and that didn't last long.
For what it's worth, it cuts fine on the table saw, on the router table, on the jointer, etc. Just don't let it burn (obviously) - other than that, it's a snap to machine into whatever you need it for around the shop.
8875	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Ordered the 1" x 12" x 24" sheet.  Far from perfect cuts, but ok for the price.  Locally, these are way, way more expensive.  Therefore, Im ok with it being short by 1/4" in length and width.  Also, one edge is not even cut straight.  No worries.  At this price, its still a great deal.  Seriously, if you planned on using every single square inch of the sheet and then being shorted 1/4" inch ruined your project, then really its your fault.  Im just saying, you always have to account for your mis-cuts, loss from blade kerf, etc.  You should always allow yourself a minimum of 10% loss when estimating the material needed.  If you are doing something very intricate with difficult and complex cutting/working, then at least 25% extra should be ordered.  If you needed 12" x 24" for your design, then you should be getting larger and cutting to size.  Realize, this is a raw material.  You will have to make it into a finished product and that will involve loss of material.

Now the $25 question.  Are they worth the extra expense.  YES!  However I do have a few complaints.  Mostly with their marketing.  First is that these are not included as standard equipement with most of Fluke's meters.  That's complete and utter crap!  Second is that my $7 Sinometer leads are almost as flexible and they come with caps for the banana plugs and the tips!  Are listening Fluke?!!!  Protective caps!

9789	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I have just returned this product.  The switch was working well until, after less than a month of use, it quit.  I took the unit apart and found that a tiny - REALLY TINY - white piece of plastic was what connected the top of the foot switch to the electrical device.  It was the trigger that make the switch go on and off.  That pice of plastic had broke.  IF they had made the switch with a metal piece instead of plastic the thing might have lasted a lifetime.  This will forever be a mystery to me.  Why would a designer make a critical part that will take stress both small and plastic?  Why not increase the diameter of the part (in this case very easy to do) and make it out of something that will last?  The plastic part was about 1/16 of an inch square, maybe less.  Why?  A 1/4 inch piece of good plastic would probably last 10 years.  A 1/4 inch piece of quality metal would last forever.  What would that cost?  Maybe another dollar or two max?  Incredible.

2568	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	5-Minute Epoxy is a must have for every household.  This brand is highly recommended by experts.  The 9 ounce size can go a long ways, if used properly.  Also, pierce the cap with a small drill bit, instead of cutting the tip off -- this will ensure proper fit of the caps and will keep the air out, and the product fresh.  The strength of the bond is probably about as good as can possibly be.  The speed of the curing is ideal, if not a bit too fast.  One must learn to plan a job as a sequence of incremental steps, and mix small amounts that can be utilized in a three minute time frame.  Working with this 5-Minute epoxy is a hundred times better than most other adhesive choices.  The 9 ounce size will be much more cost effective than those syringe style epoxy dispenser.

Before I started using it, I read that it has too much adhesive on it, but I disagree. It has the right amount of adhesive...to stick to porous surfaces like brickwork and wood. And when you peel it off, there is hardly any residual adhesive remaining on the surface. I also read that Gorilla tape smells awful, but it does not....it smells like licorice and paint thinner...and you'd literally have to have the tape right against your nose to be able to smell it.
7399	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product to have around, both for hobby use and other main electrical connections.

The old one I had broke after a drop off the ladder, but I had no doubts as to which one I was going to buy again. I like that it is a simple on/off tester. Simply hold down the power button to turn on and it will give you a loud "BEEP BEEP" and will silently flash red continuously to let you know it is on and working properly. All you have to do is place it near a live wire and it will give a constant "BEEEEP" an turn constant red to signify that the cable is live. After you are done using it simply hold down the power button again and it will turn off. It also has an auto off feature which will turn it off after a short period of time not using it. I have used other testers in the past but some are too complicated as they flash different colors to signify live currents and others you have to hold down the button while testing for a live wire. This is simple and I love fluke products as I think they are far superior to others when it comes to electrical testing.

I used it for an air tool connection, and though the threads are not very deep on either side, I simply used some Teflon tape sealant and accomplished what a rubber o-ring or washer otherwise would have.  Would buy again if needed.  This will last a lifetime, though.

It's half-hard meaning its fairly stiff for its thickness. It cuts, drills, and taps nicely - obviously easier than mild steel, but harder than aluminum. When drilling and tapping I suggest using a light machine oil or WD-40 to save the wear on your bit and make the job go better.

6480	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this digital caliper to measure both the filament going into my 3D printer, as well as to create precise measurements for the designed objects I was looking to print. This has been a fantastic tool to help me accurately plug in the average diameter of my filament and has yielded superior prints ever since. There is one small con though on this product. When I am using this one handed, I tend to pull back the caliper using my thumb and forefinger and often times when my thumb is on top of the caliper as opposed to the side, it slides the battery cover off. This is a very minor thing, but it happens quite frequently, enough that I might have to put a small piece of tape to keep it in place. Other than this one small issue, the caliper has been performing superbly.

The nails look like someone made them by hand. The coating is very thick and not uniform; so the "ring" portion is a hit or miss affair, leaving some nails looking as though they had virtually no rings at all.

6-7 2016 - After using this cart for a time I have decided to redo my review. I found it hard to maneuver even on a cement garage floor let alone an uneven surface. It was loaded with tools, etc. The top surface of the unit has began to break away from the rest of the cart. There was nothing done to cause this to occur. The locks do not function. The drawer locks would no longer line up to allow locking of the drawers. Since they all lock together, they must line up. The locks broke and the drawers do not slide as they should. They slide and line up very poorly. It now can not be locked at all. The price is already way too high, but with the quality of this unit so low it is not worth purchasing at any price.

  -- first, blue Loctite is supposedly for larger screws or bolts (they say 1/4" up to 3/4").  For hardware less than 1/4" in diameter, they recommend purple Loctite.  However, most often, when I've been attaching a scope or bipod or sling, I've had a bottle of the blue on hand, but no purple (and purple Loctite is not nearly as available as the blue, so I have to go a long way to get it).  So, I've used the blue on hardware as small as 1/8", maybe even smaller, and so far it has worked well for me, and I haven't had any problems (...knock wood).

Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.

If you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.

The Hydrometer arrived in a box that was well packaged and protected with bubble wrap and cushioning paper, It also arrived sooner that I expected.
For anyone new to JB Weld though, be really sure you mix the two parts in very very close to equal amounts. Otherwise it will never completely harden.

This one is inexpensive and works fine. It cleans their teeth well and they're happy with it. For a little over $5.00 each, it's worth it to just buy a new one every three or four months but they ware going to look for the replacement brushes and check the prices. These work as they are supposed to and are not too harsh on the enamel. They are easy to hold and have been doing a good job for a while now. I wish I could use this type of brush but, for some reason, the vibration causes dizziness so I am stuck with a manual toothbrush. But if you want an inexpensive, good spinning brush, Arm & Hammer's brush is inexpensive and cleans teeth well. I took a star off because I don't know how long they will hold up as they have only been in use for a month. So far so good though.

2854	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Very smooth action, repeatable readings, well built, best reputation on the market make this the best choice for a caliper.  This is probably more than you need if you are reloading bullets but it can be your only caliper you will need for a lifetime.  My only complaint if anything is I wish the face was dull WHITE instead of a LIGHT GRAY.  I guess with my aging eyes lighter colors are more appealing to me but thats only me.  I use this primarily indoors so light reflection is not an issue which the gray face may be an advantage.  The storage case it comes in is made of very sturdy plastic and outstanding in my opinion. Outstanding caliper and still Swiss made.

To be fair I do NOT own one of these; this semester it came down between the Lightweight and the Littman Classic II SE and the later won due to the heavier weight (in my mind this equates to more durability, though nothing against the quality of the Lightweight). I also felt the Classic II SE was slightly louder.

I used this hose with an aquarium pump and small float valve to fabricate a continuous fountain/water dish for our cat.  This project works well and much better than any commercial product.  We had to replace the cat water fountains and/or their internal parts on way too many occasions.  This hose is thin but tough and should last a long time.

Might as well pony up a little more money and buy this family size.  This adhesive is much better than anything out there.  I bought Gorilla glue and it was worthless.  Only thing with this adhesive is that it takes overnight to really harden so you have to keep the pieces together somehow until it fully dries.  Also if there is any water or dampness it is not going to work that well.

6634	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	My garage contains several cans of sprays, lubricants, penetrants for various applications.  Last summer my friend who works on vintage motorcycles told me to get a can of Aerokroil when I was unsuccessfully trying to knock the slugs and jugs free on a locked up bike I had.  I had to hunt around to find Aerokroil and finally got it at a machine shop.  It's expensive at about 13 bucks a can (a smaller can than normal too.)  That's why I reserve it for only really tough jobs.  Also, we call it the 'cancer juice' assuming anything that penetrates rusted metal better than PB Blaster is going to give you cancer if you work around it long enough.  I make an effort to not get this onto my bare skin or get drips of it into my eyes/mouth/nose.  So here's the run down of commonly known penetrants on a scale of their effectiveness:  WD 40, Liquid Wrench, PB Blaster, Deep Creep, Aerokoil.  That list is in order by price too. I use WD 40 to keep things from developing surface rust and to clean grease off of motorcycle chains.  I no longer stock Liquid Wrench and use PB Blaster on nearly everything that's not rust welded.  I don't use Deep Creep because I don't need it now.  Aerokroil sits at the top of my known penetrants to free up things that lesser men will just snap off, break, or cut out with a torch.  If you are a long time PB Blaster fan, you should get some of this stuff to see just how much better it works.

One thing to be careful of on these Torin jacks (and other bottle jacks) - the pressure release screw on the bottom - it does not have a "stop" when you unscrew it, and it will allow you to keep turning it until hydraulic fluid comes leaking out.  I know because when I asked my son to release the pressure and lower the jack, I looked over and saw he over loosened the nut on the bottom, and fluid was leaking out.  So be aware that it only needs a couple of turns to release pressure, and it can be "over-loosened" to where fluid will leak.

One more thing is worth mentioning, which is that for applications that don't have to be 100% water and air tight (like for various craft projects and some electrical work involving conduit), you can use a one-stage glue/primer combo to glue up PVC pipe. The nice thing about this one-step glue/primer combo is that you never have to deal with the purple primer getting on your pipe. The purple primer can be a bit unsightly, so avoiding "the purple" can be disirable in some instances. However, this two-stage pack is essential for the best, water and air tight PVC connections.

In addition, I use this tape to tape wires running around my house. I am fully confident that the tape is strong enough to tape down the wires and at the same time gentle enough not to damage my flooring when I pull them off the ground.

6262	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this item instead of others because it's a Fluke and I know I can trust it to work and work properly. Using it is easy and the flashing light to indicate proper function is a welcomed feature. The audible beeper can be turned off, but I don't do that. It's nice that it comes with batteries, and that they are AAA which are easy to come by anywhere. However, opening the device to change them is a little difficult. The reason I gave it four stars and not five is that it takes a bit long to sense live wires. Sticking it in an outlet is faster, but putting it against a wire takes a bit longer. It definitely isn't a near instant response. Also, as others mentioned the item I received was not in any sort of packaging. Not a box or clamshell. It was just a plastic bag with the device and instructions in it and an Amazon sticker describing the product. A little strange. I saw no indication of where it is made.
823	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I like it except for the piece of wood that is supplied with the kit; used to make a base for the hole punch.  I've used it to punch holes in cloth and because the wood is not hard enough, it cannot make a clean hole.  But the tools and the grommet are great.  I was thinking of using a piece of metal instead of the wood but I was afraid that I would dull the punch.  All things considered, it is a good deal.
936	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	We have hard water and lime, so I was using this with toilet bowl cleaner and it seemed to make the plastic bristles start to chemically melt.  It seemed to be well made though and I can imagine how it would have worked well to get into hard to clean places.

The arms were ground down crudely for some reason.  There were grinding marks through the finish.

This is a question that many have struggled with.  I own both and I can say that acoustically they are quite similar.  The difference comes down to details.  If you are a medical student or will see both peds and adults (especially family medicine), I would probably recommend going with the Cardiology III.  The small side can be converted to a traditional bell or pediatric head for your peds rotation (the cardiology III comes with the accessories to change the head which takes about 5 minutes).  Once you get started in residency/practice, you may find yourself not needing the peds head so much (I'm in internal medicine), and only keeping the bell on.  I consider my cardiac exam to be fairly thorough but I only use the bell on about 10% of patients (mostly to listen to carotids).  On the other hand, the master cardiology has a great feel in the hand, that tends to steady my scope placement.  The one downfall to this is sometimes a patient's position is not ideal for use (consider vented patients and reaching over wires/leads) you may not be able to get the flat of your hand the way you want it.

It is used to lift a 200 lb fifth wheel hitch from the bed of my truck when I need to use the truck for other than towing a fifth wheel.  An eye bolt with 3" flat washer slips into the hitch jaws.  I lift the unit a foot or two, drive out of the garage, and let the hitch down onto a furniture dolly (Harbor Freight) and push it over where it's stored.  I have the cable doubled mostly to slow the unit down when setting the hitch back down into the rails in the truck bed.

9793	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	TEN STARS---EXCELLENT product.  Makes using the router (in the table) so much easier-  you simply press the foot pedal and voila- away it goes.  I wish it had speed control- its either on or off.  I love the fact that I can turn it on/off for a quick little cut and go on my way.  My router table is in my table saw so its really a pain to turn the router on and off.  With the pedal however that is no longer an issue.  I tried it on the table saw, drill press, disk sander, thickness planer, and it works on all of them.  Obviously some of them are inconvenient and unnecessary- but it works on all of them.  Its just an on off switch operated by your foot.  Its a great product and I highly recommend this to anyone with a router table especially one in the table saw.  YOU MUST BE CAREFUL HOWEVER----I would still turn it off via the switch before changing bits-(or unplug or both) You could get very seriously injured if you were changing or adjusting a bit and inadvertently stepped on the switch.  Just use common sense- and enjoy it.  Once you try it you will be hooked.
625	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	The messy, black smudge that can be seen at the edges of this electrical tape can be removed by wasting more tape.

Many brands of duct tapes and electrical tapes use inferior adhesives that will disintegrate if left exposed to the sun.

Some, such as "Marine" and "Automotive" may be more UV resistant. So, at least for indoor use, I suggest buying the cheapest. In the local hardware store, "Household Goop" is usually the cheapest. At the time of this writing, "Plumbing Goop" is the cheapest on Amazon. As far as I can tell, E6000 is the same as the various varieties of Goop, but packaged for industrial use.

If you used that method they could send you 120 pieces that were 1" long and say you got 10ft..
Note the one start review must be for a different product.  ("One of the channels failed...")  there is only one channel on this... a single output.  And so far, mine is working quite well though I've only had it for a short time.

4544	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to modify my BBQ and Turkey Fryer. I purchased a 15" hose and this to hook to my 1,000 gallon propane tank. Unfortunately, the setup did not have the pressure I get from my 5 gallon tanks, but it had nothing to do with this quality product.
I'm not sure it's worth the current Amazon price ($8,800+ dollars). I would say a decimal is misplaced. Considering the cost of other utility carts I've priced, $880 seems reasonable.  I looked on Rubbermaid's site for a suggested retail price and didn't see one, but I did see the same cart for less than $1000 in a few other stores.

292	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	very good grinding wheel.
Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.

768	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this switch for use in an on/off application in a line powered (120 Volt..) project. It is a double pole switch so both the power "hot" lead and the "neutral" can be effectively switched. In most cases there is no real reason to switch both legs of a 120 Volt circuit. In most cases it just adds a little redundancy to the switching circuit. There are, however, certain applications where double pole switches are very popular.... it just wasn't really necessary for my use. Nevertheless, I chose this switch because of my familiarity with Gardner Bender. I felt certain that the switch would be high quality and would handle many on/off cycles. This bit of added confidence on my part made the choice an easy one.

8949	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Use this stuff to make re-useable tops to re-use my Kuerig coffee containers.
9623	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I use this with my dust deputy shop vac setup. Drilling the top for the cyclone was easy and stays out. I used a crap ton of silicone to ensure it was air tight and it's great. Holds its shape and does not buckle under vacuum force. As this fills up, the saw dust will accumulate around the sides and the bottom center is bare. I do not expect this to be capable of filling 75% of the container and still work, but it's so large I'll barely ever had to empty it. Happy with the purchase. I plan to put this and my vac underneath a workbench and this is just barely short enough to fit my setup. I ordered a 2-2.25" silicone elbow reducer so the dust deputy top connection is not as tall. Works great.

7987	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Good quality metal, laser cut, well packaged and protected for shipping.  The material was excellent, the finish was great.  The one thing that caught me off guard was that Amazon didn't present the size choices well, so at first I bought a sheet that was too small (used it to practice cutting) but had to go back and explore a bit to find the also-bought with links that eventually got me to the page that presented multiple gauges and sheet sizes.

It's an educational issue.
I'm very satisfied with them.
These are not made very strong especially in the locking teeth.  While they will work fine with small low-torque situations, they are not professional grade material.  For most people they will be fine.  Buy they are not replacements for medical grade forceps.

On a guess, I replaced the ear pieces, tested the stethoscope, replaced the diaphragm, tested again, and each time the sound quality improved dramatically.  Its now superior to 2 older Littmann Cardiology stethoscopes that were not as heavily used.  The improvement suggest age related parts deterioration, regardless of use.  I used my own A2-P2 heart sound split as a test of functionality.

3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naphtha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off "white glue" and clean up with a moist paper towel.

Handy to have on hand and I keep some in the car as well. My mom uses them when she dyes her hair as they're much better than the ones provided with the boxes on sale in stores and since she started doing her hair with another product that doesn't provide a set, these are really the easiest way to keep her hands clean in the process. She also uses them to soften her hands by putting some hand lotion on her hands and then putting on the gloves. In our climate, it's the only way to combat dry hands.

CONS:
9471	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this set for my 1/8" pegboards.  These hooks fit well.  When I purchased this set I was not quite sure of the exact content of the package, so I copied the content in the list below and one of my photos has all the hooks spread out on 1/2" grid so you can see exactly what you are getting.
The instructions say to cut the top strip to the width of the top of the garage door. I did that, and came up 1 inch short, likely because it was stretched along its length during fitting, then was not stretched as much during installation. That corner left a huge unsealed gap and there was no way to fix it without.

It does an excellent job of measuring the quality of water processed by reverse osmosis, but it did not accurately measure water hardness that is processed by ion exchange.  Internet literature hinted that it would, but since these softners exchange ions and do not remove solids, It is not the meter's fault.  There is no manual to explain what it does and what the readings mean.  Instructions are written on the box which is not easy to store.

9540	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	If i had to come up with something to whine about - it would be that the capacity of my p635 nailer could take about 20ish more pins than one of these rows of pins - so it would be possible to refill less often if the strips of pins were longer. I appreciate the design of the box - and the tool in general - and the tech support team is wonderful.

2103	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I like all the Loctite products.  This one, the "blue" variety, is medium strength, so you can break it loose with tools. Good for mounting scopes or bipods on high-power rifles.
4906	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Very interesting stuff. It has two layers so when you knead a chunk the inner and outer layers blend and the hardening begins. I used it to repair fiberglass and vinyl body pieces on a motor home and it did not adhere very well. The one drawback is the setting speed. It is very hard to cut it knead it and apply it before it hardens. If you take the time to press it firmly in place and smooth it you may find that it has gone brittle and won't hold up or stick. You need to work fast and if you are doing more than a tiny repair you need to work in smaller sections to avoid having it harden before you can get it in place. A ten or fifteen minute version would be better. Who is in that much of a hurry?

535	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	PERFECT for removing or installing the doors on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler JK. These doors are much heavier than the ones on my older TJ, which are essentially hollow, with just the window glass and no wiring or any real crash bar (sadly). The JK doors are like 80 pounds each, and my little wife can easily lift up the door hinge pins from the hinge halves on the body tub, then carry the door to the car port where we hang them when not on the vehicle. She also can easily carry them out to the Jeep and lift and align the hinge pins, dropping them home, with no assistance by me. This is not what this tool is made for, but it does the job PERFECTLY!

My generator used to shut off at high temperatures due to flashing fuel line since the fuel flow to generator is so small.

Save me money & wasted material in long run buying through Amazon for short lentgths. Recommend iit for those who need such stock.
2) Wear ear plugs if you're working in a small room (such as a bathroom). The noise level can really get to you after 20 minutes or so.
For now, they perform fine.  We almost bought the 8", but this is much easier to handle and just perfect for its size.
Joining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.

over all I would recommend this product, IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, cleaning out your die and lubing it are super important.

Tom's makes natural products.  The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf.  It contains "flavor," whatever that is, "saccharine," and "propylene glycol."  The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze.  One advantage of Tom's toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.

I still use my bottom pour pot for .45 ACP/LC bullets because they're much lighter, and I can cast more and get more consistent results.
1572	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	100% Silicone is one of the best types of sealants, and this may just be the best I've used. But be warned, it is extremely difficult to get a nice perfect bead, even if you're good at caulking. Basically you can only touch it once- as soon as you lift your finger for any reason (to wipe away excess caulk, or continue the bead), it's nearly impossible to continue from where you left off without messing up the bead. And if you try to go over the bead again to fix it(big mistake!), you'll make it much worse- so for minor imperfections, it's better to just leave it.

I was looking for a cheap digital calipers for getting some measurements on rough prototype 3D printing.  I have my engineering calipers for the serious work but for knocking around the workbench I wanted something I wouldn't mind getting beat up a bit.  The Neiko's accuracy falls within the limits I require but if your trying to measure down to 38 better get a more accurate caliper.

7182	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	The product itself was OK but it's pretty ridiculous that they don't say you will get separate pieces that add up to 10 ft.. If I order 10 ft., I expect to get 1 piece that is 10 ft. long not one that is a little under 9 ft. and 1 that is a little over 1 ft.. They do not say that in the description. If you used that method they could send you 120 pieces that were 1" long and say you got 10ft..

9627	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Purchased to use with the Oneida Super Dust Deputy to make my dust collector into a two stage Cyclone unit. Works great, holds up to the 2HP DC without any signs of collapsing. I don't see or hear any leaking of vacuum around the seal. Band is a bit tight but still very easy to get off and makes for an easy way to dispose of the dust/chips that are collected. Would recommend this for anyone that is upgrading their DC to a cyclone using the Super Dust Deputy!
2096	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It's locktite and the name speaks for itself. Not much I can say that would add to it's reputation of how it performs. Other reviews have said it is runny and seems watered down. As a mechanic on everything from lawnmowers, car/trucks, jet engines and nuclear missiles I can tell you that if yours doesn't seem to run with an oil like consistancy then it has probably exceeded it's shelflife and should be thrown away. Give it a few miutes of being exposed to air and it will thicken just as designed to do. I've never had a nut come loose after using locktite on it, regardless of vibration or condition.

3849	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	J-B Weld is a good quality 2-part epoxy mix.  It is fairly easy to mix and use, and hardens into a solid mass with great strength.  Surface preparation is the key to making it work, so before mixing, be sure you have thoroughly cleaned, degreased and roughed up the area where you will apply it.  it is great to have around just in case, and stores well.  The only downside, as with most epoxies, is that it can be messy, and it spreads like Chicken Pox to hands and other surfaces and is not so easy to clean off. I recommend wearing plastic gloves and using something like a popsicle stick for mixing and applying.

1361	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It always amazes me that simple products like tape are still being improved well into the 21st century.

3673	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my brewing.  Seems to be pretty good, though sometimes it does leak at the end where you can attach a spray nozzle.  I've checked everywhere and it looks like the leak sometimes gets through the welding spot of the end where you'd screw the above attachment on.  Not sure why this, and it happens to both hoses I have of these.  Possibly pressure build up?  Otherwise they do a great job in making sure I don't get any noticeable flavors in the water I'm using to brew beer.

I know these aren't for medical use, but I wanted to see how they'd do in that role. A trip to the store yielded some pig's feet for suturing, and I went to work after making a 4" gash in one. The forceps worked just fine for two sutures. One was a straight gash, and the other was a semi-circular gash. Both were 4" long and about 3/8" deep. The forceps didn't bend, they held the needle just fine, and they didn't unlock when pushing the needle through. No, these aren't for medical use, but they could be. Once or twice. After autoclaving them.

"When healthy, the pH of blood is 7.4, the pH of spinal fluid is 7.4, and the pH of saliva is 7.4. Thus the pH of saliva parallels the extra cellular fluid...pH test of saliva represents the most consistent and most definitive physical sign of the ionic calcium deficiency syndrome...The pH of the non-deficient and healthy person is in the 7.5 (dark blue) to 7.1 (blue) slightly alkaline range. The range from 6.5 (blue-green) which is weakly acidic to 4.5 (light yellow) which is strongly acidic represents states from mildly deficient to strongly deficient, respectively. Most children are dark blue, a pH of 7.5. Over half of adults are green-yellow, a pH of 6.5 or lower, reflecting the calcium deficiency of aging and lifestyle defects. Cancer patients are usually a bright yellow, a pH of 4.5, especially when terminal."

1)You should only and only buy the smallest bottle possible. As it'll harden up very fast even if the cap is on tight.  Maybe they fixed this by now as I'm reviewing this from experience many moons ago.  2)This glue foams and expands, so you will need to judge how much to use and also a proper way to clamp properly.

Instead of having to push your ply along the ground and hope you don't hit a crack or get stuck on something, this deceivingly simple , but well built device lifts the panel off the ground for easier maneuverability. The body position when lifting is also easier on the back and shoulders, then trying to jerk it around. It's well built, but I think a bit overpriced.

7901	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this rod to use as a squib rod, primarily. For those unfamiliar with that term, a squib is bullet that gets stuck in the barrel of a gun due to insufficient propellant (powder). At 0.3125" diameter, this rod will work perfectly in any 9mm, .38 Special, .357 magnum. It will also work fine in larger calibers like 40 S&W and .45 ACP. The 12" length is perfect to ensure that even super long handgun barrels (like some long revolvers) can benefit from its use.

If you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps. Just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf.

My first use of this product has been to use it to patch a roof to my well house. The roofing material is metal awning, and it had a couple drill holes that needed patching. I decided to use this tape and paint over the tape to hide it. It looks great and waterproofed the holes which was the purpose. It adhered perfectly to the metal without being tough to use. I was able to paint over it too, without any peeling up of the tape.

The MAJOR issue on the other hand, is the front panel they sent me.  It's apparently for some other kit they sell because I had to drill out two of the slide switch holes and also the holes for the potentiometers.  (the holes for the banana jacks were they though, which is weird)  It definitely did not turn out as "pretty" as it could have had it been pre-drilled, but this is crap.  I'd ask for my money back but I had already decided to just drill it but after seeing the ugly results, regretted it since now I can't get my money back.  Apparently no QC goes into these.

On gaps that were larger than one inch we would spray it, let it cure and go back for another round. It is very easy to trim with a razor or knife and can even be sanded for a more seamless finish. Just always remember to wear gloves when insulating as this stuff is sticky! It is possible to use it more than once, but the plastic straw it comes with much be thoroughly cleaned. I used paint brush cleaner on a bamboo stick with a little cloth (think giant Q-tip) to push it through a  few times cleaning out the insulation before it dried.

I took them back after I tried to use them, and realized how flimsy they were. No one in town had this brand, but Amazon had them, of course!  I laughed that, my old box had a $1.29 label still stuck on it. Since this new box was considerably more, I am left to wonder just how long ago I had purchased the old box!  The genuine part may cost a little more, but as for most things there is no substitute for quality.

I have never had the head of a Kreg screw break off, and the square drive hole is nearly impossible to strip out; although, I have managed it a time or two.  These course screws enter the wood very quickly and will need a pilot hole in many applications in spite of the "drill it while it screws itself in" point.  I have split a number of pieces of wood with these screws and often use the fine screws instead to prevent splits.  Good in particle board, but not on the ends.  You MUST drill a good sized pilot hole to prevent these screws from splitting out the particle board.

We live in the country and have to keep our cans locked away in the shed so bears don't get to them.  We've gone through a set of 3 rolling cans on an annual basis. This set is far sturdier and the hardware is significantly more heavy-duty than the $35 cans I keep replacing from the hardware store. The cans/lids to go with this set cost about the same amount as a pull-along, so the only real cost difference is the caster. The casters we had at work lasted for YEARS, so if we get 2 years out of this set without replacing pull-alongs, they will pay for themselves.

The brush goes too fast, the brush is too small and the hard plastic handle hits against your teeth, and rattles on them, if you don't have the angle just right. Also, when you brush your teeth normally, you turn the brush around and up and down; thus, water running out of your mouth, goes all over the housing which allows water to get inside the housing.

This product worked perfectly.  I needed something that would withstand temperatures of up to 145 degrees C, and this product far exceeds that. JB is not recommended for very high pressure, which my tank is subject to, but any pressure would be pushing from the weld side into the metal and there were no actual holes; what I needed to do was reshape the edge, fill pits along the edge, and get it smooth enough so it would seal. This product did a great job, but I did have to do it in a couple of successive applications.

Applied some tape and they screwed right one without any problem.

This unit is a bit too big to use on stairs.  If you're very strong (and desperate), you can probably do an OK job.  But overall, you're better of assuming this is just for large, flat areas of carpet.
This service cart arrived in rough shape. The shippers had not been gentle. The center brace and right hand drawer support was knocked out of its lower sockets which made the drawers operate poorly and skewed the  right side door. It was fifteen minutes of work to pull drawers, knock the brace back into position (literally with the heel of my boot) and put the drawers back in. And... the cart is fine now. So, while the shipping damage was annoying it did serve as a great test of how rugged this cart is. A metal tool cart would not have gone back together like this.

All in all it worked. Solid as a rock. No leaks. Used some white silicone caulk around the base.

One thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the device was not supplied with alkaline batteries. The old style zinc-carbon batteries are good enough to get you up and running but for a device of this nature that may be in storage for a long time between uses I think that they are a poor choice because they don't remain potent for long periods in storage and often corrode ruining the device they are stored in. So replace the supplied batteries ASAP with alkalines, or at least remove the batteries when storing your tachometer so that you won't have it ruined by corrosion.
1387	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Might be too good for "just" shipping light things, but this is a very noticeable heavier tape, and it lasts way longer without oozing or loosing its grip. Can be used for durable long-term repairs as well as long-term storage and sealing. Yes it costs more, the best stuff usually does.

I like it, good purchase
Ok ok you knew it was going to happen. Yes the hose did come off and glue spewed all over my shoes and toilet. Cleaned it off and we are done almost. Remember the glue does expand while it dries filling up gaps as it forms it bonds. I was ready with a box cutter coming back in every ten minutes to inspect and trim.

Hammering in the nails above your head wears out your arms a lot faster than one would think, and it's really hard to hammer the nails in straight since the door and/or trim are in the way, especially in the corners.

I've been using a Sonicare toothbrush for many years.  It was initially recommended by my, superb dentist  dentist, a man who chairs the dental program at a major NYC medical center.  I suffered from the beginnings of gum disease and, a month after using a Sonicare toothbrush, it was gone.  When I briefly stopped using it, it came back.  When I started using it again, it went away again.  The engineering and construction of the Sonicare products is impressive; very few products, of any sort, are made this well.  This battery model - which I plan to use while RVing - is another example of the company's superb products.

Just snip the tip, it comes out a bit thick, like a thick silicone gel, and hold it into place for 5 minutes.  Then, it needs to harden for 24 hours.  I followed the directions and I'm very pleased with the results.  I would use it again.  It was more than enough for my project.

6282	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these low-voltage NC testers after owning the Fluke 90-1000V 1AC-A1-II NC tester for a while. It works well and I like the overall design of it, although I really don't use this one as much as the other higher voltage model. I do find that it sometimes comes in handy though for quick voltage checks, without having to undo any wiring connections, when troubleshooting 24V control circuits on HVACR equipment, alarm systems and even some doorbell/chimes that are using 24V transformers rather than 16V. I've found that it can detect the 90V of a ringing POTS line, which was an interesting discovery, but not sure if that will ever be of any use to me. To my eyes, other than the blunt round tip, this tester looks practically identical to Fluke's other higher voltage NC tester, which has led to some confusion when grabbing it out of the tool bag in a hurry. Even though this tester was a little expensive and I generally don't use it every day, I'm still glad to have had it available on several occasions.

This is a handy little caliper suitable for virtually any small work where measuring inside or outside is needed.
6401	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Do not rely on this digital caliper for accurate measurements.  Unfortunately my return window has closed so it is a just a loss for me.  I really do not understand the high ratings from some people.  I took measuring bars from Rockler and used the calipers on them.  I would continuously get a different measurement simply by remeasuring the exact same brass bar from the same place on the caliper.  Sometimes as much as 0.01 (note that is hundredth, not thousandth) in difference.  Mostly I would see about 0.003 to 0.005 in difference by simply measuring and remeasuring the same brase bar.  It simply is not consistent.

If you drill a 1/8" pilot hole, take it nice and easy, this bit works like a champ. I used liquid dish soap as a lubricant / cooling agent, and finished the holes with a file. I had absolutely no problems with this tool. I'm sure there are better quality bits being offered, but for this price point and free shipping, who's complaining?
2528	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use, you don't have to be a chemist to do the tests.  This kit tests for the most common and important pollutants and is cheap enough that you can monitor your well often.  It does not, however, test for everything.  If you live in an area that is industrialized or where pesticides or herbicides are heavily used, or where radon is common, you must have a certified lab do the testing as recommended by your local health department or EPA. This kit showed my water to pass all its tests but I still use a carbon filter like a Brita for my drinking and cooking water.

The old belt had rotted in at least three parts, which could attribute to the excessive noise.  I can't remember if it was that loud when I first got the belt sander, but the only way to really find out is to either buy a new belt sander, fresh from the box, or get a standard non-grooved V-belt and try it out.  I'll leave that test for someone who wants the challenge.  As far as I can say, this belt may be a little more quieter than the old belt, but again, that may have been do to the cracks in the old belt, or the stiffness from heat cycles over the years.  Nonetheless, the sound is not as SMOOTH as a standard V-belt.  The grooves definitely give it a different sound profile, like off-road tires on the freeway sort of thing.  The end result should not sound quality, although sound quality affects the overall work environment/atmosphere, but the real important factor is longevity.  It seems like a solidly built belt, and I hope it lasts as long as it looks.
The units are really stiff and heavy, which is good, but at first it is difficult to figure out exactly how to use it.  Follow the directions EXACTLY and you'll be just fine.  Trying to look at it and figure it out will result in injury.

1) An opened tube thickens quickly.  Store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid.  Old thick Goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  It is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface
The smaller two bits fit standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal. This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers. In my non-magnetic Makita impact driver the bits had slightly more in-and-out play than usual, but it did not affect drilling performance in my testing.

So... all in all, if you want a good function generator, just get a "good" bench function/wave gen.  (Rigol and BK Precision have "cheap" ones that are pretty good for the price for entry level hobbyists)  It's not fair to compare this product to a real function generator, but it sort of is a fair comparison considering you can get a used Agilent, HP, or Tektronix waveform generator on ebay for $50-100.  The brand new Rigol ones start around $379 and they'll do arbitrary waveforms.  BK Precision has ones for $269, and a true DDS one for $309.  I'd recommend going with a used one on ebay or getting a Rigol or BK precision.

It works well and bonds seem to be very strong.  I generally use glue as a supplement, not as the only source of bonding (if possible).  I've repaired some non-wood items as well.  Some have worked fine, some not.  As another review mentions, you can peel the dried glue off of the nozzle when you're opening it for another use - so it's probably not the best choice for plastics.  I've done some ceramics and it's been fine - the foaming as it dries can of course make the end results look less-than-perfect.

Little bits of wire break off (!), they can puncture your fingers while you're handling or grasping them and generally become very fragile all of a sudden towards the end of their usable life. So I purchased this having read the details about the product and how it works (flexible bristles impregnated with abrasives).

A pen would fit comfortably inside.  Those red tipped hooks are too short for a garden hand trowel .  Plus, they are too thin for the peg board holes so they hang down too much.

I'm the guy in charge of wrapping things for mailing. It's a tough job but somebody's got to do it. Of course, one of the tasks is to securely fasten things in mailing boxes. For this, I chose Scotch Packaging Tape and I use so much of it that I order it in these six packs. It's a somewhat expensive outlay, but a six pack lasts a long time.
5490	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	Mine only lasted 2 1/2 years on a 3 way bedside table lamp.  I know this because when I selected this item Amazon told me I purchased one on April 5, 2015. This is many years shorter life than expected for this type of switch,  which is only used 2 or 3 times daily. I'm buying another brand this time.
It would have been nice to include screws, but I can see how that might not be helpful in terms of length. A quick trip to the Home Depot remedied the screw problem.
The clips are attracted to a magnet so I know they are not Aluminium and could probably be souldered if I wanted to (that's good).  I checked them with a Ohm meter and the connections were all good. The boot is soft and flexible. Well worth the price for those of us that are DIY's.

8939	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Ordered the 1" x 12" x 24" sheet.  Far from perfect cuts, but ok for the price.  Locally, these are way, way more expensive.  Therefore, Im ok with it being short by 1/4" in length and width.  Also, one edge is not even cut straight.  No worries.  At this price, its still a great deal.  Seriously, if you planned on using every single square inch of the sheet and then being shorted 1/4" inch ruined your project, then really its your fault.  Im just saying, you always have to account for your mis-cuts, loss from blade kerf, etc.  You should always allow yourself a minimum of 10% loss when estimating the material needed.  If you are doing something very intricate with difficult and complex cutting/working, then at least 25% extra should be ordered.  If you needed 12" x 24" for your design, then you should be getting larger and cutting to size.  Realize, this is a raw material.  You will have to make it into a finished product and that will involve loss of material.

62	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).

8876	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I needed a little larger cutting board.  This worked perfectly.  It arrived precisely on schedule.
No matter. At $6, it is a bargain and perfect for play. I cut about 5 inches off the tubing with regular scissors before attaching the head. This was to make it shorter so my daughter didn't step on it or trip over it. I don't let her put the ear pieces in her ears. The fit was tight when I tried it on so I only let her wear it around her neck. So far so good.
The Intertape Polymer Tape broke at 14 pounds. Not bad.  I can live with that.

6360	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have this and a similar sized starrett caliper and a cheap plastic mitutoyo.. I bought this one because I use the starrett so much but I didn't want to leave it out all of the time on my workbench in case I dropped it - so I thought for 90% of the work I could use a cruder tool.. It turns out this one seems as accurate and I might buy one for my office as well. a great great bargain..

Life Lover Highly Recommends this Product.
This is actually a very good price, and Amazon actually beat out McMaster and other suppliers on pricing for this washer set. It is standard 18-8 stainless and made very well. I have no complaints about the quality. It is only slightly magnetic.

It assembles quickly and easily - I was impressed with just how sturdy it is!

This tubing has the same inside diameter as standard aquarium tubing, so it fits an aquarium pump's air fitting perfectly. My feeling is that if an aquarium pump won't kill fish, the air produced is probably safe for food. The food is protected from the bath with a plastic barrier, but it seems to diffuse a bit, you can smell the spices from inside the bag in the water bath, and what diffuses out will diffuse in. Thus I didn't want to use standard aquarium tubing in the water.  Even silicone aquarium tubing.  I probably could have boiled standard silicone tubing, changing the water at least five times, or until no dye leached into the boiling water after five changes.  But this stuff, well, I could just use it.

There is a hollow metal ring on which the hose rests when not extended. Beneath this metal ring is a thick ring that fills up the space beneath the metal ring, This thick ring, which seems to be made of some type of plaster material broke into three pieces. I glued the three pieces together and then pushed the metal ring down on top of them to keep them in place and clamped together. Gorilla Glue came through again.

Thinking they would be too expensive to buy but for some reason I saw these.  Good price.  They came and sat for a while then I cut my finger I wrapped it up in water proof tape but still hard to work in the kitchen and keep the cut dry so it would heal.  Then I remembered the box I have used them since.  I eat red beets daily and to cook them peel etc they dye your hands for a small period but not now.  I find I am now using them often.  These are authentic gloves just like the ones at work.  You have to go some to tear or rip them for they are plastic none powdered glove.

While epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.

The wheels are not cheap, but it seems you get what you pay for.  With both the wheel and swivel locking, it makes whatever they are attached to rock solid.  The lock is a bit of work to disengage (if you are wearing soft shoes), but doable.  So far over two months, no flat spots.  We will see what the summer heats does.

 - There *is* a technique to it, to be sure - it's a Dremel tool after all, not an industrial super-router ;)  It will also make the wood smoke and start to burn if left in one place too long, and that's on the minimum Dremel speed!  Also, if the wood is pushed into it *too* hard, it will "choke" to where the Dremel tool can't spin.  But with patience and keeping the wood moving in a smooth motion, this little burr definitely does what I want to do, HOORAY!!!

366	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I believe in name brand when it comes to wire wheels. I do not like the bits of wire that break off of cheap brand wheels and stick into my arm. Dewalt wire wheels do hold up and last longer than others.
1663	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I capitalized heavy as the unit is about 5 pounds. They apparently overcompensated for the complaints of ease to break. The main arm is 5/8 dia and the second is 1/2 dia  - plated steel. The stays and stay screws are spring steel with plastic finger tabs. The spring-loaded adjustment on the secondary arm is really cool and easy to use. The magnetic base has about a 15-20# holding force. It is plenty to hold the indicator and stand in any position. The previously mentioned would be my only complaint - it is large and heavy. Movement on the dial indicator is smooth and accurate. The type of tool you would expect to find attached to a D8 caterpillar or locomotive engine... Size could be an issue. I have not checked but a job like measuring ring and pinion backlash could be an issue due to the tools size. For my machining purposes it is very usable and quite accurate. For $22 I am very happy.

2375	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Used this twice and then it simply stopped working - it simply would not turn on.  I would have returned it, but it was outside the Amazon return period.  Cannot recommend.

I have these installed between our coffee machines and city water line. If you let them sit too long the spring will end up getting rusty and corroded on you, but if you soak it and clean it out it will be good as new again. It only happened to us once, on a machine we didn't use for several months... but daily use they have no issues.

6636	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is great penetrating oil.  I have a gear box on a rotary cutter that has a pipe plug (screwed in) that needs to be removed to check the proper oil level.  I've never been able to get it off. In fact I usually just stick a piece of wire thru the fill hole to make an estimate of the proper level.  Today, I was looking over the rotary mower and decided to check the gear oil level.  I remembered I bought the Kano Aerokroil oil some time ago (this past July) and decided to give it a try.  I squirted a small amount on.  It just so happened nature called , so I let it penetrate for several minutes.  When I came back, I applied my vise-grips and the plug screwed off like it had never been stuck.  In previous attempts I had used other popular penetrating oils but they did not work.  Like I said, I had given up all hope of getting this plug unscrewed.  So I'm very happy.

It gets really annoying to have both a peg and clip fall along with your tools when you grab them.  The whole point was to keep things in place.  I would say they work about half of the time.  If I am very careful about lifting them out of their place gently, they tend to stay in, but even then some of the clips still pop off leaving the hook in place but still need to fumble the plastic clip back into place.  Not what I wanted.

It's not as strong as the original formula JB-Weld but if you don't mind sacrificing some tensile strength and temperature resistance, this is a handy alternative to the long cure variety.
I have been using this as a 3D print bed running almost non stop since I got it.  We have printed a fallout 4 T45 Helmet, A combat shotgun and a 10mm pistol also from fallout 4 and a bunch of other stuff.  I have done prints out to almost 8 hours.  They have all been PLA so far so no report yet on ABS but the PLA has been flawless.  Sticks when it should and comes off easy.  It is easy to cleanoff and so far the material hasn't even scratched .  You have to play with temps to get it right.  I normally used 55c bed temps for printing PLA on blue tape.  With this stuff 55C stick so hard I can't get it all off.  I tried 35 C and it didn;t stick well enough.  45C seems about right BUT if you are printing small or tall things with a small footprint then add a brim and maybe a raft if the item is very tall.  That way it still comes off pretty easy but sticks well enough. 5 degrees either way seems to matter a lot so if you try it, play with temps before you decide.  For me, there's no going back for PLA.  I just bought 2 more pieces to keep handy just in case the original piece breaks.

That aside, this stuff is, indeed, great. Fills gaps, like around dual-glazed windows which were otherwise UNINSULATED. The potential for applications is huge. But READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, like keeping the can inverted and ventilate the area very well. It DOES expand, not like the 3x expanding foam, but GO EASY when you fill gaps. It does expand.

I find my opinion of Amazon decreasing as I discover they carry such total garbage.  And the clowns who write positive or blaise or non-critical reviews of technical products, well, maybe they should go overseas, too.  It pains me that such garbage products have been put into place and have put out well-made products, American or otherwise.  The commentator Gerald Celente mentions a "Made in China" backlash that's been long brewing.  Total garbage products like this junk frenetically propel that eventuality, but not nearly enough.

1344	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these at my workplace for years. They make the "chore" of taking out the trash a lot more pleasant. Unlike a traditional rolling trash can, these wheels can turn in multiple directions for pivoting and turning. With a "pull along" can, the wheels only move forward and back which makes navigating turns or narrow passages difficult. At times you will end up stopping, lifting the can, then resuming the roll-along. With this commercial set, you put the cans on, lock into place and roll away. They move easily and feel light. Naturally, they work best on mostly flat surfaces, but because the wheels turn in any direction, they can navigate hills and bumpy areas much more successfully than a pull-along.
One of our storm windows was cracked by a tree limb in the last storm. I was terrified to remove it and take it to the repair shop (I thought it would shatter in my attempt to remove it and slash me to ribbons)! Instead of masking tape (which I did not trust but was told to use), I applied this over the crack and very, very gently pressed it in-place). It stuck, we got the pane to the shop with no issues, and the glass was replaced without a drop of blood spilled.

Liquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.

Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elmer-s-E701-Carpenter-s-Wood-Glue-8-Ounce/dp/B000QH5MUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-Ounce</a>
  this two pack of wet mop pads is the best deal going...they are washable, have velcro on the back and cleans like a microfiber cloth should.  we put the reverse sticky back velcro on an extra large swiffer mop head and this pad fits perfectly.  a little spray of cleaner/polisher and it is off to the races.  the hex shaped spanish tile looks immaculate and the travertine shines like diamond.  the little bits of fluff that gets attached to the microfiber can just be taken off and thrown away.  sometimes it is a bother, but the 18 inch surface of the pad makes the cleaning time, cut in half.  it will be a long time before another order is placed as the pads can be washed after each use and there are two pads in the order.  it is too bad that it is such a good deal and product.  if MPO or any company would make things as good or better than this deal, they would have a customer for life.  this is an excellent product and it works so well we are quite satisfied...yea...
5348	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This item was bought to join two short shower hoses; which it's probably not for, but it is the closest thing I could find to what I wanted, it does ok, but it (even with plumbing tape) leaks, but that's because it's not a plumbing fixture, which is my fault, not the item.  Too bad someone couldn't make one specifically for plumbing.  Tried to use to join to shorter hoses for use with an adjustable shower head (i.e., settings).  The original hose broke and I didn't feel like returning them, more trouble and cost than worth, but in hindsight, this, plus some other hoses, and so on, it might have been better to shell out for a long(er) hose.  Note to anyone who reads this review "the cheap route isn't always cheap".  My "Frankenstein" approach will work for now, but probably need a longer hose.  About a 6 foot one should do.  (I have a hose in mind, on my Amazon wish list, maybe I can get that and use this as a back up.)

I tried putting this on plastic a few times and the weld frequently came apart as I tried to increase the shape of the mold each time, increasing the surface area that was contacting each part so it would hold better. One of which was due to not quite getting the mixture right and it never fully hardened. I could have tried to one last time really get the mixture right and maximize surface area, but I simply used JB plastic weld instead which worked excellently right from the get-go.

 - The multitude of "mini-teeth" on this are sharp enough to bite into the hardwood, are juuuuuust large enough to not clog up, BUT small enough so that they don't "catch" onto particularly hard and/or convoluted sections of the wood grain;  the 115 cutter has flutes, and they would catch of those sorts of areas, and literally grab and fling the wood out of my hands unless I kept a constant "death grip" on it, which I just can't do.  I had bought something that was described as being a double-cut tungsten carbide burr (a diamond-shaped pattern rather than the straight flutes), and it didn't do much more of anything other than burn the wood.

***Special thing for you to know: I have gingivitis and if I brush too hard or use a medium or hard toothbrush, my gums bleed. Not good. This toothbrush may say medium, but I found it is kind of soft and very gentle on my gums, hence no bleeding gums anymore.
Use fresh "thin" Goop.  Apply a thin layer.  If you are trying to glue a large surface, such as all or most of a sole, it is best two apply Goop to both surfaces---but as thin as possible.  A wooden "popsicle stick" may be useful to spread the Goop. In most cases you need to clamp the layers together.  There are a wide variety of clamps available for woodworking which may be helpful in specific situations.  If you happen to have a solid-wooden shoe stretcher, it may be helpful in clamping.  As with woodworking, firm clamping is important, but clamping too hard causes problems.  In some cases, you may be able to get by with clothespins and heavy rubber bands or blue painters tape.  In anycase, it is essential to let the glue cure for at least three days before using the shoes.  I recommend waiting a week.  I've used Goop to repair leather watch bands and belts.

The 1/4" and the 3/8" you only get 10 each of those. This kit is not worth even the little it cost. I would not have purchased it had I known the sizes and quantities ahead of time.

9702	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I brought this good item(s) and did not have any issues with it OK; the packaging is somewhat hard or tricky to open, But if you know how to open it, then it's all good !  You just have to carefully break or cut around the middle section part where the labels are intact. It worked perfectly fine for me, as I had no problems at all, even when I opened it up too get a tube out & use it. You just gotta know what you are doing, otherwise you will end up in all sorts of bother?, but Not likely at all. So just be careful with opening it, and DO NOT use a sharp utility knife too open it okay !

The only glitch: I am not a very handy person, so I am not sure if this is normal or not.  When I cut the spout, I had trouble getting the silicone to come out until I broke the seal formed inside of the tube with a small screw driver.  The application was easy, the silicone gave me some time to work with it until it set.  I found that the gloves were getting in my way, and I used my bare fingers to spread the silicone.  I was able to clean up fairly easily with applying rubbing alcohol to my hands after the soap/water round.

My first observation with this particular brand of duct tape is that it is extremely difficult to tear cleanly by hand. It is much better to cut it with sharp scissors or a good field knife when using it. If torn, it leaves a very tattered edge where the weave separates from the actual plastic print, which makes for a messy edge. This is important to consider if you need a very clean wrap.

Exactly what it says - it is a high-quality product.  It handles very hot (up to boiling/brewery temperatures) without degrading in shape or firmness.  It can be hot to the touch - gloves are a good idea when using it with hot liquids.

9707	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Very affordable way to buy super glue! It's not a good idea to buy larger sizes because unless you use them quickly, once you open them, the glue begins to harden.  I've had 4 oz. bottles that after opening and storing for a couple of months, it's hardened and useless.  With these small tubes, you get to use what you need and you don't waste so much if you store it. The only complaint I have is what everyone else says; the packaging is difficult to open.  What I did was to slice the labels on the front and rear, then slip a thin blade screwdriver from either the front or back side and slide it to the edges where there are some dimples to keep the top and bottom covers together.  After spreading the dimples a little and wiggling the top cover back and forth, it comes off.  I then heated both dimples on either side with a micro torch just enough to get it to soften a bit, then slid the top cover back over the bottom shell and that expands the dimples to it's now easier to open and close the package halves.

I recently got a new push lawnmower through the mail, and it arrived with one of the wheels crushed, so the axle bolt was partially pushed through.  Well, the customer service for the retailer I'd purchased it from said it would be 2 weeks before I'd get a new wheel, but my lawn couldn't wait that long.  The wheel is  pretty thick plastic and was mangled pretty bad, so I had to "flatten" the wheel in my vice so that the hub was reasonably back in shape.  I used about a 2" wad of this putty and strategically reinforced the wheel on both sides and left it to dry overnight.  I fully expected the mangled wheel to spring back out of shape once I loosened the vice, but the putty held.  I ended up mowing the lawn on that patched wheel for a month because it was working fine.

6061 Aluminum is, by most any measure, the most commonly used aluminum alloy. It is specified in most any application due to its strength, heat treatability, comparatively easy machining, and weldability.

The results are always a 4-10c drop in CPU temperatures under load. You will not notice a huge difference at idle. The real gains in heat dissipation come when the CPU is being pushed. Also, don't trust the board maker's proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like RealTemp 2.41 or Everest for free (use google to find them). Either will give you more accurate numbers than Asus PC Probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.
When fresh this has a nice balance between too thick and too thin as some other brands. I had to repair some burnt wires 4 years ago, in my jeep when the bracket came loose and the harness lay against the exhaust manifold. I put on 4 thin coats letting it dry a couple of hours between applications. I just discovered that the harness has disintegrated because of heat and exposed the wires. The liquid tape did their job as the wires are fine. Bottle had a metal lid.

The original part this replaced had chewed up teeth and was binding in the screw drive. This went right on and works just like it should. Install took about 10 minutes. With the door closed, the lever was pulled to release the original part, I had to loosen two bolts at the end of the screwdrive by the garage door and pull the cotter pin out of the original part to unhook the linkage to the garage. Once loose, I simply slid the old one off. Once off, I slid the new one on and tightened the bolts back down. Inserted the pin that attached the linkage to the door, Installed the pull string, moved the lever up to the lock position and tested it. Worked great.

I used it with RD soap, so I could get a good compare, I don't think that will hurt the unit and it's expensive, but some of the best cleaning fluid out there.
7607	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I use these a lot in my pickup truck.  If you have a pickup truck, you need these straps.  They should be standard equipment on pickup trucks.  I leave a couple of 15 foot straps connected from the corners of the pickup bed into an X configuration all the time so they're right there when I need to strap down a load.  I have several more stored behind the seat for larger loads.  My old truck is parked outside, and the straps are exposed to sunshine and the elements.  The UV eventually weakens the nylon so I replace the straps in the bed every few years.  They're so much better that the typical tie-down straps.  Much safer too!  You won't lose your load with these straps.  I've been using these high quality straps for probably twenty years or more, including their intended whitewater river use.  They'll definitely keep your kayak on your vehicle.  If you are strapping a yak to the top of your car, be sure to tuck and secure the strap ends, and pull over and redo it if you hear thumping on the car.  The heavy duty nylon is rather course, which helps keep it from slipping under the ratchet even when wet, but if the air moving over your car at highway speeds causes the strap end to slap your car it'll remove the paint, or at least the clear coat.

One note- the rubber on this hose seems to be 'stickier' than the original Katadyn hoses, so it seems to be a magnet for any bit of dirt or lint. Not a big deal, but it's annoying.

A few words of advice - have all your supplies laid out and waiting before you mix the glue.  Prepare the surface you want to glue, have some tape ready, and use a disposable piece of cardboard to mix.  This glue sets up in just a few minutes and you don't want to be searching for anything while it hardens.  Also, save the little inner plugs for the bottles - it will help keep it fresh and ready after you've snipped the ends of the pointed outer caps.

I just removed the old belt and installed the new.  If anyone has the same application, the old belt is a standard non-grooved V-belt.

There is a more important issue that I encountered though, that required me to change my wrapping methods. On a container with a rounded edge on the bottom (like a peanut butter jar), the tape does not maintain adhesion when wrapped over the edge and it slowly pulls away from the surface to which it was applied. It seems to be worse with this brand than with another brand I use. There is a work-around, and that is to minimize the amount of edge-folding required. In short, on a round container it is best to use flat sheets and trim right to the edge, which seems to give excellent adhesion.

Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.

Goop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.

For this reason, I recommend using transparent caulk when possible, since these minor imperfections will be less obvious. I also recommend cutting the caulk nozzle smaller than you think you'll need. The next time I use this caulk, I'm going to try using 'CAULK-EZ' brand tooling aid (http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ILFLH2Q). I haven't used it yet, but if it works half as well as they claim, it will save a lot of time and frustration, and be well worth the cost. And as always, use a good dripless caulk gun (I use 'Dripless Inc. ETS2000 Ergo', best one on the market imo, http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0002CKG1O), and if your poker isn't long enough, just cut up a wire hanger to make a poking tool.

Only issue with this glue or any other, they DO HAVE A SHELF LIFE, so I've been buying the smaller bottle.

2129	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	These are good for picking up small items or for holding them in place manually.  When the jaws are fully closed, they lock into place.

6370	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a great caliper for the price. I use it for a multitude of projects, and it comes in handy for measuring major diameters of screws and minor diameters of screw holes. It also comes in handy for quick conversions to metric and fractions.

Its a very shiny tape and feels pretty strong, although I did not use it in a heavy duty application.  I used it to make a reflective interior to a fishtank light ballast.  It does the job well and doesnt let any light escape.  I also have some heating ducts in the basement with duct tape falling off... I think I'll try my hand at replacing that with this tape and see how it holds up.
3613	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This duck tape is so far ahead of Scotch and the others it is hard to believe. This tape does not shread in pieces when you get down to the middle of the roll.
2254	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Where applicable, this may be the strongest glue available. It is certainly very strong and versatile. I have used it for everything from model airplanes to a cast iron candle holder. However, it must be clamped while it sets, as it expands while setting. It does not not harden in the bottle so any amount not used can be used at a later time. The glue is water activated, one side of two pieces to be attached should be moistened. When set the joint is waterproof.
6227	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a must have for electricians as well as homeowners. A non-contact voltage meter is a very quick way to identify live wires, and to narrow down electrical issues. Of course the safest method is to use a multi-meter before working on something, but this is a very handy tool to have. I have been using this tool for 5 years now on the original batteries and Fluke spared no expense when constructing a very high quality tool. Their meters are legendary in industry and very few brands compare to the same quality and consistency in their equipment.
Reviews on duct tape are all over the place. So is duct tape. I was specifically interested in the adhesiveness and tensile strength of the 3 leading brands of black duct tape.

The results are always a 4-10c drop in CPU temperatures under load. You will not notice a huge difference at idle. The real gains in heat dissipation come when the CPU is being pushed. Also, don't trust the board makers proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like RealTemp 2.41 or Everest for free (use google to find them). Either will give you more accurate numbers than Asus PC Probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.

Very sticky and the adhesive does not give out in hot weather. Highly recommend you store it in the container that it comes in. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's not even an option. Just use the plastic container.

I must say that ordering through this website is a much more pleasant experience. First of all the package arrived in half the time it took from the other merchant.  The pint container was a little different than I'm used to but the stuff inside is Weld-On #3. However, the price I paid for it was over 30% lower than what I'm used to paying. I think that's great.

4324	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Three years with no problems, and ya can't beat the price.  This thing gets used and abused 8-10 times a day and performs flawlessly every time.

7002	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time and as advertised
This is a full flow check valve, unlike some models at my local Lowes or Home Depot, which partially restrict flow.  When a sump pump comes on, the valve flap swings completely out of the way, to allow maximum flow.  When the pump stops, the flap closes to stop water from going toward the pump. The rubber seal part of the flap will eventually leak a bit, I suppose, but there is so little pressure on it when it's closed, that it should last a long time.

8896	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Excellent sheet but did come in warped, a little time in the oven fixed it.
8331	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I needed a small 7/8" diameter 12" long piece. This was a great way for me to not have to purchase a full length piece locally that I would not of used most of. Fast shipping.

3527	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	If you're using this to take your own blood pressure DO NOT BUY. In order for an individual to successfully take their own blood pressure the chestpiece on the stethoscope must slide under the cuff because you don't have enough hands to hold everything. This one is far too large to it under the cuff, it's meant to be pressed against the arm just below the cuff.

You will find the cord is short  and you might have to plug in throughout the house, but that is part of the price for having a vac you can store and easily move around without drapes of cord on the back of it.  Also, just plan on removing the filter cup after each use because it will need it.  This vac gets everything.  I don't use a little brush on the filter yada yada like instructions suggest, I just pull off the hair and rap it on the side of the trash can or take it outside and tap it on something.

I happen to own some low cost import step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.
9898	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I'm using it on rubber irrigation boots that have developed cracks.

That having been said this concept is GREAT and for $15 you can't beat not have to swap out the plug.

I've been taking this stethoscope to work with me to try it out the last few days (working on a 911 ambulance as an EMT). I swapped it out every few calls with my regular stethoscope ( a Littman Classic II S.E Lightweight) every few calls. This stethoscope works surprisingly well! I truly couldn't hear a difference between this scope and my Littman! Even in the back of a moving ambulance, with the sirens running, I oculd easily and clearly hear breath sounds. This stethoscope is definitely a great buy.

7723	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to seal up some of the gaps in my cheap vertical smoker.

I have used it to install door gasket in the past but it gets crumbly and came out.  I like silicone much better for that purpose.  I like this for seating firebricks, filling gaps, etc.

The only thing duct tape isn't good for is sealing furnace ducting. It'll hold for a while but after a year or so the heat if it's in an attic or dampness or cold weather if it is under a house will cause it to loosen and come undone. We have had experience with that back when we thought duct tape was for sealing ducts. I don't know if this brand would work for that or not. It is pretty sticky.

2496	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I chose this fan because it was the best one I could afford. It is now installed in my 25 by 25 foot garage, in the wall behind the workbench. Anyone who has ever stunk up a garage with fumes or overspray knows that a normal house fan will not do the job. This fan is not beautiful, and it is not silent... but the motor alone weighs more than most complete fan assemblies. It has 2 speeds: fast, and hold on to your hat! :) Sometimes I spray paint out there and this thing does a much much better job with the stinky cloud of overspray than the 2 window fans it replaced. The shutters shut tight all by themselves when it is shut off, and they are edged with rubber so they seal smoothly. While it's running I can actually see the overspray moving out, clearing the whole garage so fast that it pretty much stays clear if you turn on the fan before you start. A great addition to any mechanic or handyman's shop. Not for sissies, however... :)
The more expensive and higher quality fittings would be dipped into a waxy solution, which quickly dries and protects the threads during the shipping process. The wax-like protection is then very easily peeled off just before its about to be used.

Note: when joining two pieces of wood with pocket hole screws, it pulls them in really tight, so you need to make sure the ends are SQUARE, else the screws will pull the joint crooked.

3237	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	My outside AC unit (14 years old) was not working correctly - the compressor was not coming on, and the fan required me to push it to get it going.  These symptoms are usually associated with a bad capacitor, and I ordered a new one.  I also found out about this product, which gives existing capacitors extra power on startup, so I ordered this as well.  The hard start relay came first, so I hooked it up to my old capacitor, and just this addition was able to get everything working.  When my new capacitor arrived, I installed that, and kept the hard start relay hooked up.  My AC unit fires right up, just like it was brand-new, and everything is working as well as it did when it was brand-new.  Although I technically did not need this hard-start relay, but I think that leaving it in will extend the life of the capacitor by helping ouyt with teh compressor startup (which puts the most strain on the capacitor.  overall, I'm very happy with the product, and saved thousands of dollars by not having to buy a new AC unit.

Which is better for emergencies, latex or silicone? Let's say your working in a restaurant, and you have a customer restroom sink bowl start leaking that stays wet almost 24/7. You can't  close the bathroom for an extended period of time because of constant use. Do you use latex or silicone? I have been in this situation and at first chose latex because of its faster drying time. The problem was, because latex is water soluble and it was exposed to dampness constantly, it never dried, and eventually just washed off. When I switched to silicone, it was waterproof even when not fully cured. Although exposed to the damp environment it did eventually cure, all the while stopping the leak.

1220	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I got this vacuum for free as a throw in for buying a saw.  I'm real disappointed.  This vacuum in meant to be hung on a wall, if you don't it tips very easily.  Operation wise it is reasonably powerful, but very loud.  The most frustrating thing about this vacuum is the small diameter of the hose, which caused it to clog very easily.  Definitely not a 'shop' vac.  Best use that I can find is to vacuum the sawdust off my tools, everything else use a full size shopvac.
If you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.

better choice.  For joining metal "J&B Weld" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick).  Some are packaged in a dual-syringe---but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.  Previously, a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored (usually white)---but now clear epoxies are available.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/J-B-Weld-8265-S-Cold-Weld/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">J-B Weld 8265-S Cold Weld</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CLEARBOND-H-3S-Clear-Strong-Epoxy-Adhesive-Syringe-85oz/dp/B001J9J6VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85oz</a>

6735	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Although I haven't tried to cut a penny yet, these shears work very well on everything else I've tried to cut. One thing of note: The way the halves are assembled makes them difficult to open and close. I assume this is to prevent the halves from separating under the stress of cutting. You should just know they're going to feel like they're grating against each other. So far, it doesn't seem to have affected their workability.

I let the Lamp dry over 15 Hours, until next day, and when I checked the Leg on the Lamp was as Good as New. "J-B Weld Reinforced Epoxy" made a very Clean and Strong Bonding Fusing together the Copper Leg into the Lamp, in fact since there are four of them, I have to look for the one that was broken and sometimes its Hard to See, now I have to Find other Metal Items in need of Repairs "J-B Weld Reinforced Epoxy" did a Great Job on my Lamp!...Thank You D.D.

What I did once I recognized this potential source of trouble was to get into the software setup program for the wifi and reset it to 80% power and see how it all worked.  At 100% I was getting signal strength levels up in the 800's to 900's micro watts in several areas where it was NOT expected at all.  At 80% it reduced the overall "hot" exposure levels to approximately 550 micro-watts,.... and when I reduced it to 60%, it lowered the general levels when tested in various previously "hot areas" to around 390 micro-watts / sq. meter.  We still have a functional wifi signal within our home, the computers on wifi still say it is a good signal and perform flawlessly, and more importantly, I am not awaking so often as I did! (Regularly 6 or 7 times per night!) That correction is a VERY good thing for me personally.  I am a Licenced Master Journeyman Electrician and an electronics techie.... yet, I had NO IDEA that these things could effect a person so profoundly!!!  I will use this tool a lot more in the future.  This tool seems to be functioning or aiming more at the higher end of the spectrum of frequencies than the lower, so for cell phones and microwave ovens and lower frequencies below, a person may wish to buy one of the cheaper low fequency type of detectors to marry this up with as a pair.... just a thought. (Thinking of something along the Tri-Meter type of tool.)

4708	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Surprisingly great glue. Totally different and much, much better than a regular one-dollar Crazy Glue. Repaired three different sets of headphones and all are holding strong. To my surprise, after using it twice, then keeping it closed for three weeks and opening it to use again, there were no signs of any hardening, the glue was flowing and working as good as new. Bonds very quickly, so you've got to be fast while working with it.

Other than that - it is duct tape. It feels like duct tape, it flexes like duct tape, it tears and cuts like duct tape, it sticks like duct tape. I'd call it duct tape.
However it does ship in some sticky grease-like oil.

1929	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This 3M Scotch Transparent Duct Tape is an excellent product. It's a 3M product so you know it's good stuff. It's as good as any 3M duct tape and it's very clear. Last Summer I had a glass window that got hit by some flying grass edger debris that put a hole about the diameter of your index finger. For the time being I put a piece of this 3M Scotch Transparent Duct Tape over the hole until I could get it fixed. You couldn't tell anything was over the hole unless you stood really close and stared at the hole. Really good transparent duct tape. I got some more after I started using it.

The only negative I have with this oven is the height of the cooking cavity. The advertised size of 1.6 cu. ft. is right but that size is mostly due to stretching the length and width and sacrificing height. The ceiling of the cavity is so low, we can barely get some of our larger drinking glasses inside. I am seriously doubting whether we would be able to get a large ham or turkey inside.

The board is clearly marked with silk screen part locations.  It worked first time with no difficulty.  Good hobbyist level kit and is adequate for tasks that do not require extreme accurate frequency settings.  Recommended for anyone who needs a handy signal source.  Good value.  I put mine together while watching TV in about an hour.
Zinc jinx: I heard on "Rick's Restorations" that paint won't stick to galvanized metal, so the pros apply vinegar to it before painting. In my efforts, this epoxy also does not stick to galvanized steel, even after using vinegar on it. I have to grind off all the galvinization before the epoxy binds to it.
7573	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this bit to add an extra hole to my kitchen sink for a soap dispenser. The only drawback I encountered was getting the drill chuck tight enough to keep the bit from slipping. After resolving that issue with some channel lock pliers; the bit went through the stainless steel like butter. These bits are reaqlly expensive at my local Home Builder store and reasonably priced on Amazon. Again Amazon wins out for quality, shipping, and value. I recommend this bit but have no clue as to its extended use.
6833	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	i couldn't believe the price when I saw these listed. I ordered two of these because at that price it is still cheaper than buying just one of these everywhere else. I have the more expensive Fluke IntelliTone Pro 200 Kit and use this when I am tracing wires in the analog mode and because it keeps the wear and tear down on the pro 200 kit. They work great!
6354	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Very nice solid caliper.  I like all the different options it has for measuring.  It's really nice to know what size drill bit to look for instead of figuring out the mm to fractional inch math.  Seems to be very accurate, as well.  Comes in a nice case. Another nice thing is that it has the depth measuring bar that comes out the back end as you slide it out.  My cheapo plastic ones didn't have that.

5822	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Good
3382	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I suck at using this stuff. I was using it around a window air conditioner to get it sealed back up and I managed to clog the plastic attachment that goes onto the nozzle and focuses the spray of the foam. Supposedly you just rinse it off, but somehow, it was beyond that point. There's still plenty of liquid in the can, but I guess I'll just have to wing it if I need to use it again. The can is actually quite tall, and you get a lot for the money. Just be careful with that plastic attachment thingie, because the tall can ain't worth much if you can't make use of it. Having said that, a more experienced person may have better results than me.

2145	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I wanted a long pair of forceps for reaching things and this definitely is long.  Because of the length it is not as positive as I hoped it would be but it works fine.

I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 thick fir plywood when I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2 holes you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bit cut quickly and cleanly through the material. Of course this is a very special case, but I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.
Regardless, arrived quick and worked great for the project I needed. Fairly easy to grind, drill and tap.

So if you want something cheaper, consider that.

5455	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works pretty well but the sample bottle is easy to crack and the solution WILL stain things the second it makes contact so be careful with tabletops
Update,  I'm actually using this a lot more than I expected and it is turning out to be invaluable.  It's a solid product, good carry case too.
and well worth the small difference in price.
I bought a box of these and although the dispensed product works well I would not recommend this and I will not be purchasing further items with this type of dispensing mechanism. It is a pain to have to start every use dismantling and clearing the nossle and using a pair of pliers to push the valve because the plastic threads have overhauled. I would not recommend this dispensing mechanism unless you intend to use the entire contents in one session.

It also arrived with several scratches. This seems to be due to handling during production. The material is relatively soft like a soft wood, which will scratch from pieces rubbing together with dust between the pieces. This was not a problem for me since I used it for industrial purposes. Basically, what you are getting here is somewhat of a rough piece that you then cut, shape, and sand according to your needs, much like when purchasing wood.

Don't depend on tightening the screw to pull the tabs to pull barbs into the wood, unless the wood is soft. Use a hammer to drive the T nut into the wood.
The only thing I can see to make it better would be to integrate a polarity checker/tester into it.

White Glue:  For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.

This NEIKO tool is not suitable for extremes of measurement, but for really simple inner or outer measurements, it is fine. The digital window is small, but readable, it measures in both MM or INCHES. It comes with a simple, but sturdy plastic case and one extra battery. As long as you replace the battery every so often, keep the tool dry and clean, it should last for quite awhile. It is not designed for precise engineering or architectural measurements pertaining to internal combustion, hydraulics, pneumatics, medical tools or scientific instruments, etc., but it will certainly tell you the outside diameter of a metal rod, or the inside diameter of an ordinary hole.

Anyway, printing small things like brackets, fan covers, or little things is not a big deal.  What if you wanted to build that cool Iron Man mask, or the full life-size suit?  That would be super cool!  But these printers just don't have the kind of build volume.  I'm at the point where my designs are too large for the printer and I need a way to extend the size of my parts without extending my machine or buying something bigger.  After searching the Internet for some sort of clue, I came across this, and I decided to try it.  It's not a lot of money, but it's also not cheap, but I did do my first test today (with PLA).  I did not sit there and wait for it to cure so I don't know exactly how long it took, but about an hour later, the two test pieces that I glued together are now one piece.  Trying to pry the smaller piece away resulted in "breaking off the tabs", per-se.  There is no gassing or rather, no vapor burns.  I simply used the "drip" that occurred when I snipped the bottle tip.  It went on the first piece rather heavy and I didn't think it would turn out well.  It turns out, it went on like a small pool of water, then I placed the smaller piece.  About an hour later, the pool of glue vanished, like there wasn't any glue.  Now, they are just two pieces of different color PLA stuck together.

Well 1/4 sheet adhesive backed paper is WAY too expensive, and I have not found any full sheet sticky back.  I was just about to toss the sander in the garbage when I stumbled across these rolls.  I decided to give them a shot and I'm so glad I did.  The adhesive sticks well to even my 20 year old rubber pad.  The sandpaper is very durable and long lasting.  I'm using this mainly for wood, but won't hesitate to go after metal or fiberglass (should the need arise).  At only 20 cents a pop this is one of the most economical adhesive backed options around.  I'm gonna have to order a couple other grits cause this stuff is great.

The most important advice I can give is: don't buy too big of a bottle unless you really use it a lot.  When you're done using it, squeeze as much air out of the bottle as you can.  I've never been able to actually finish a bottle of this kind of glue, because as I get to the last third or so, it usally hardens or there's so much dried glue at the top of the bottle that I have to cut apart the bottle to get to the remaining glue.  Squeezing out as much air as possible before closing the cap will mitigate this to a large degree, but at some point you just can't get enough air out and so you start to see the crusty, hardened end of the life of your precious bottle of glue somewhere on the horizon.  It's the circle of life.  For glue, anyway.

I needed to sand a couple rooms worth of drywall/joint compound.  I tried sanding with my Dewalt Sander with the vacuum attachment.  The shop vac was shooting out the exhaust a fine dust cloud.  Basically, the standard filter is not enough to stop all drywall dust.  And, after a short while, it totally clogs the standard filter.  However, when used with these bags, you basically get no dust shooting out the shop vac.  And, your standard filter stays clean.  Highly recommend for doing drywall or other fine dust collection application.  Clean up is a snap.  Simply take the bag out and toss in the trash.  Without the bag, its a big dusty mess.

9808	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Seems to work great in my plastic shop. I currently have this running a Belt Sander. I am considering purchasing more for a couple other tools. The only complaint I have is like many other reviewers, The cable coming out of the side seems very impractical. Most likely you will use this with the  top portion of the pedal facing the device you are using, there for the cord coming from the device will go that way and most likely the outlet that it will be plugged into. Due to this set up, the cable coming from the pedal sticks out to the right. This set up could cause more of a tripping hazard. Also, if you do not have the pedal mounted to a board or to the floor, the very nice and study cable pushes the pedal around, so depending on your set up you may need to move the pedal around each time to get it into the desired position. This may not happen if the cord came out of the top.

I used for a small job repairing the side wall of an electric solid body guitar's output jack hole that had been stripped by years of use (for Fender Telecaster owners out there you know exactly what I'm talking about).  The master luthier Dan Erlewine himself has recommended this type of epoxy mixed with sawdust for this very repair.  It worked fantastically!  My guitar cable jack feels as good as new.
Location of suction area makes it possible to clean and extract right up to against the wall where carpet and wall meet.

If you've got Herk hands or keep this in a warm place that should not be a problem. Be carful to lot let any of the mixed compound get on the tip of the tube unless you want to cut the lid off.

There were a couple of issues that prevented me from awarding 5 stars.  The first one is that the bolt that holds the dial indicator to the rod clamp is quite difficult to tighten.  There is no screwdriver slot or socket head, so the only way to tighten the bolt is by using your fingers on the round, lightly knurled, small diameter head.  It's difficult to get your fingers between the indicator body and the rod to exert enough torque to keep the indicator solidly in place.  I may try to grind a screwdriver slot in the head so that I can use a tool on it.

Tired of buying the little tubes and given all the uses that I have found for this I figured I'd buy a bulk pack. I've used this for fixing just about anything you can imagine. Most impressive was a patch job on a steam boiler. The patch held for 3 years under heat and steam pressure until the boiler was replaced.

CON:
5728	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It is weather stripping with a sticky side and a non-sticky side. The sticky side holds enough to hold it in place while you install it.

The purpose is to help create a seal for the storm window.

7212	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I wanted to replace the output hose for my Katadyn pocket water filter with a longer hose, and after several attempts ordering the wrong size, I found that the right size is 3/16" I.D., 5/16" O.D. (and 1/16" Wall). It's not exactly the same as the Katadyn hose- the inner diameter is larger, and the wall is thinner (see the photos I uploaded), but it works. The metal clip fits around the outside, and the hose fits tightly around the output nipple of the filter. I'm only using this for output, so I can't say for sure if it would work for the input hose (where a tight seal is critical to maintain vacuum), but I think it would.

5930	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	As another reviewer mentioned I don't think theres any difference in which Goop you buy other than the packaging that encourages folks to buy it for the specific purpose stated. I use it for everything from shoe repair to the leather seats in my SUV and it has never disappointed me and whether its the RV or the All Purpose I cant tell the difference. The only reason I dropped off a star is that it often hardens after a tube is opened even though the cap is on tight. Other than that the product itself is 5-stars all the way and a lot easier to use on many things than Contact Cement because its forgiving in the application process.
The addition of frequency filters for source analysis is the important added feature here, not as much the extension at the lower range.

Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ScotchBlue-Painter-s-Tape-for-Multi-Surfaces-2090-75A-3-4-Inches-by-60-Yards-1-Roll/dp/B00004Z4BB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 Roll</a>
The fractional mode is less handy than I had imagined.  The problem is that there is no way to set the desired fractional resolution or any kind of rounding method.  So, measurements come out to something over 128 almost half the time, which is kind of a pain because nobody ever measures anything in 1/128's.. What is lacking is a way to set rounding to the nearest 16th, 32nd or 64th.  The way it is, it may be faster to use it in decimal mode and use a decimal/fraction conversion table (which a reasonably good machinist has memorized anyway).

Compared to many stethoscopes, the tubing on this one is rubbery.  I can't say that I like that feature - it may prove to be harder to clean than the more vinyl tubing of other stethoscopes.  Also, there's no carrying case.  Sure, I plan on wearing this around my neck most of the time, but its less pretentious to keep it in a storage case on your way to work.  Plus it stays cleaner that way.

It is a stiff material, compared to the usual epoxies, so a toothpick was handy to mix it completely.  I have used other J-B Weld products and they are all superb.  One advantage of this particular package was its use of two small toothpaste tubes compared to the big hypodermic plunger package, which dispenses the two liquids unevenly and wastes a lot of it.  This sets up quickly but i always let it sit for a day.

The copper sheet arrived without any scratches, cut well (no jagged edges), and even coloring.

4073	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I have always used Krazy glue for most of my glue projects but that glue doesnt always work for certain types of materials.  So I decided to try this glue and bought this locally to try on a wooden utensil rack that was beginning to come apart.  One of the downsides to this glue as opposed to KG is that this takes from one to two hours to dry and harden and takes a bit of prep work, which includes dampening the area with a cloth that you are planning to glue before applying.  That immediately made my project a bit more work and a bit messier than I had anticipated.  The glue is a bit runny and you have to be careful not to use too much because as this glue dries it expands into a really ugly and noticeable yellow bubble type foam.  The glue is really sturdy and tough once dried as it held the wood pieces I glued together like concrete.  Unfortunately, because of the other issues I had with the glue, the wooden tray wasn't as clean as I had hope it would be with the noticeable foam glue lines.

6204	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I am not an electrician, but I have long since lost count of how many "small" electrical projects I have taken on over the years. I always try to use a voltage tester before digging into any existing wiring, although I have a few wire cutters with that familiar little notch in the blade where I cut a live wire. My existing Klein tester finally died after 10 years or so, and I didn't like the look of the new ones, so I gave this model a shot. I always associated Fluke with nearly indestructible test equipment.

I used a couple of these to make a temporary connection with a romex extension cable and a window fan.  Okay, not an "up to code" sort of arrangement but it was initially for "testing" purposes.

The metal is not as thick as some competitors premium stuff.  The heat shrink sleeve environmental seal is premium quality though.  Thick and seals well.  If you have an el-cheapo heat gun you will take extra time to shrink it.  I am using these on the boat and have confidence that the seal will not leak and allow saltwater to corrode the crimp.

8567	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	As the advertisements suggest, this tape will stick to brick and virtually any other surface. Be careful though, because it might just strip the paint upon removal. This was the painful lesson I learned when trying to temporarily hold some video cables to my wall and ceiling.

Not only keeping the hot, humid Houston air out of my room; it's also keeping the creepy crawlers out!  Glad I bought this stuff with my recent portable A/C unit. My room is comfortable around the clock now.
828	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Overall a good gas can, but the sheet metal could be much thicker, dents easily.  When storing this can, whether empty or full, be sure it's not on the ground or on concrete, the bottom and bottom rim can rust.  Always put it on a piece of plywood or other water resistant material.  I have the 5gal & 1gal sizes, the 1gal is terrific, handles easily.

3365	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I had a gap where my framing meets the slab - my washer & dryer are in a closet on the other side - crickets and small spiders would enter the second it started getting colder outside.  Vinyl siding covers it on the exterior, and I could lift up the lower edge of the siding and "feel" the spot. I tried a caulking gun in the past, as well as wide caulk. The press-in-place caulk wouldn't adhere and the caulking gun was too large and awkward to use.
The capacity is impressive though you'll still be emptying it about every 5 minutes.  I timed it.  You can could probably only handle a little bit more capacity before you'd find it a burdent to lift the tank around for emptying.  Commercial cleaners at the grocery store probably hold twice as much water but they are setup like buckets and have handles that make them easier to carry.

As far as performance... it does work.  Fairly well I suppose.  The sine wave isn't very accurate at all.  Square wave is fine.  Ramp looked ok too.
7615	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	The strap I ordered was described as "One Person". There is no description of length anywhere. It is only 12 inches long including the buckle so unless you are Barbie it is pretty useless for anything personal except perhaps securing your paddle to your kayak. The buckle is over 1 inch wide so it is ridiculously large for the length of the strap. Overall this strap is pretty useless. I obtained a 3/4" strap 24 inches long with a more appropriately sized buckle for less cost. All other NRS straps state their length and the "One Person" is shown after the 3ft, 12ft and 20ft so the assumption is that the list is in size order. Despite complaining there has been no change to what i consider a VERY misleading description and it would cost more to return than the price paid. I am a VERY dissatisfied customer.

4538	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this. When I reviewed my order it appears I was switched to a blemished one in bad packaging at $13. It probably works just fine but I don't appreciate the tactic. It will go in the trash as I don't know what else is wrong with it. Was too late to cancel. Would not order again.

The glue tubes themselves are nicely designed so that they stay sealed until it's time to use one. Then, it's very simple to screw down the dispensing cap after removing the collar, which punctures the seal. No mess, no fuss.

8677	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It's not great. I would like one that isn't two sided and is wider. I needed to hold a few scrap pieces together to use a scrap in our bathroom while we decide on what to replace the removed carpet due to a flood. We didn't want to paint the floor as it might encourage mold. Even with anti mold packet added to paint if it's a damp area...prone to water spills at the sink etc. We opted to use some scrap carpet saved to make cat scratch posts out of some day...while we argue over putting in vinyl or ceramic tile or carpet again. Never liked the carpet in the first place...but hey it does make it nice to stand on. This seems to hold the small little pieces we had to fill in around a larger piece for now just fine. Vacuum seems not to yank apart or up either. I did not unstick the other side...left the paper on the exposed side so as not to leave any residue glue on the underlayment.

I would have no problem recommending this caliper as either a primary or a backup caliper - I am not sure about QC on these, but the one I received is accurate and has worked well repeatedly for over a year now.
The last thing to remember is that this glue is activated by moisture and will set up in the nozzle and the bottle if you are not careful.  So, here is a professional tip for you.... You can squeeze the bottle slightly to remove the air before you put on the cap. This is what the manufacturer recommends...and it works okay as long as the bottle is nearly full. As the bottle empties, it is harder and harder to achieve the "full bottle" situation.  SO.... When you are ready to end your project and wish to keep the rest of the glue for next time..... Remove the cap and drop CLEAN and DRY marbles or steel balls into the bottle. REMEMBER, clean and dry.!!  The balls will take up the available space and force the air out of the bottle as the level of the glue rises toward the top. When it gets almost to the top, replace the lid TIGHTLY and then gently squeeze the bottle to remove the very last remnants of air before tightening down the twist cap.  If you can keep the bottle full (in some way..) the glue will last a lot longer in the bottle. It will still eventually harden....that is one of the detractors of this glue.... but it will last a lot longer.

7512	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I had some trouble going through stainless. I have cut one pilot hole and it was difficult. I tried the 2nd one going fairly slow and using cutting fluid.. The bit never got hot at all but still will barely make a dent in the stainless. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I wouldn't recommend it for stainless steel. There are plenty of positive reviews on this bit, that's why I bought it, but it's not working very well for me.

As such I would say that in the past 5 years I have shot a thousand or so of these nails through my P-C Bammer gun and I can count the times it misfired on one hand. As long as the gun is set properly you should have no problems with jamming or with setting these nails below the surface of the wood.

There are some saying Arctic Silver 5 didn't lower their temperatures.

First and foremost, because the bristles aren't as firm this product won't strip off rust from a stud frame wall nearly as fast as a stainless steel version. That aside, this thing is freakin awesome. The flexible bristles mean that I can fit these much more comfortably into corners of a work piece. It doesn't kick back so suddenly like a stainless steel brush would if you hit something like a lip or edge. Very much unlike the old stainless steel cup brush, this thing is quite uniform in the work it does. It's almost surreal how different two sections of stud wall turned out using the old product and the new.
4190	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	When I first received the cups, I found them awkward to use for measuring heavy opaque epoxies since it was extremely difficult to read the measurements on the side of the cups when I have stuff in them. To remedy this, I now rotate the cups on a table and mark all around the level I need with a Sharpie.  I find this to be better than other "marked" cups. I had also chosen these cups specifically as I didn't want any internal support nibs and didn't see any in the picture, but they do contain small nibs.  Finally, because they are flexible, by squeezing the cups I can get the epoxy components to quickly level off, something that would not have been possible with a rigid cup.
739	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	it's a very good, sturdy switch... just as expected
Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.

Third and fourth plate holes to be drilled almost reached the 1" Step, but again, not to the 1-1/8" Step I needed. I used a Drill press, at a slow, steady pressure, to no use. No directions included.

I needed this NPT adaptor to fit up an over-pressure valve to some high pressure 3/8" tubing. It worked better than I could have hoped. The finish on the fitting is good and the threads are within specification for NPT. I have purchased several fittings this year where the NPT specification was NOT held, but NEVER an Anderson fitting. They always seem to line up and tighten down exactly like they should. This particular fitting is a pretty standard item. You can usually find them at the local "big-box" stores and some local hardware stores. Usually Anderson fittings are about the same price as those found at the other locations or maybe just a tad bit less expensive. AND I can get them delivered to my door so it saves me gas money too.!! I LIKE Anderson fittings. I have never received one that was outside of specification.

I can't recommend this product enough!  It holds like iron, it's relatively inexpensive, and because the two products are in separate bottles it won't get hard and be ruined like Gorilla glue and Super Glue tend to do.
The drawers and door can be locked though I don't think they would keep anyone except a small child from getting into the unit. All drawers lock at together and they must be maneuvered into place in order to do this. It was the push one in and the another one pops out scenario. The drawer slides seem very strong.

This stuff has a pretty pliable final set, maybe more than I'd like to see, but it does work well.
This kit does not give any such instructions, not even to run the water for a while. Since this is a water well test, the idea is to get the sitting water out of both your holding tank and your pipes by running for a while. That way you'll get to the "real" water as it comes from your well.

I glued a plier cushion handle back on.  The excess oozed out, which I was able to cut off with a knife.  JB weld won't cut off with a knife, so you know it dries softer.

5909	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The tool for pulling out T-Posts is the Pow'r Pull. It is a simple, straight forward tool, but it still can be a battle to get out stubborn t-posts. I'd recommend watching some YouTube Maasdam post puller videos. You will see men hang from the lever bar with all their weight on it. Other guys literally jump on top of the lever bar. Here are my tips: first wet the ground around the t-post with a soapy water solution (the water softens the ground, and the soap acts as a lubricant between the ground and the t-post). Then use a two or three foot 2x6 as your base under the puller's small base. Position the puller's t-post grip so that the lever bar is at a slight upward angle in relation to the ground's plane. Position the base bar as straight up as possible on your 2x6 base. Then apply your weight or pull down with a goal of pulling the t-post up 2 or 3 inches. Concentrate on going straight down. The lever bar may bend if you do not go straight down. Be thankful if you get the t-post to move up. Reset the puller grip lower on the t-post and repeat. If the post is stubborn, try more soapy water. I have also dug a small depression or hole around the t-post so the soapy water is absorbed near the t-post and does not run off. If the post comes out, celebrate with a cold beer. If the t-post does not come out, have a cold beer ... You deserve one and probably need one!
That said, I'd not hesitate to purchase again; very pleased despite these anal cons.

4279	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I had this shipped to my son's house as he keeps all my tools and painting supplies since I don't really have room and since this is over 100 pounds it seemed like the sensible thing to do! Because my "stuff" is scattered over his garage I thought this would be good to organize my items all in one place. I was very generous in telling him he could use the top for his circular saw and drills. It came last night at 9:35 and he assembled it--mainly the wheels, handle and a few other small pieces. He put it together and called me at 11pm to tell me it was together and my tools/painting supplies were in it. Went over today and lets just say I've lost a tool cart to a bedazzled son. The cart comes with four drawers and a cabinet with an adjustable shelf. My stuff is in a box on the bottom of the cabinet and his tools are lovingly laid out in the drawers and on the top shelf of the cabinet. His circular saw and drills are on top. He spent a good half hour extolling the virtues of this cabinet. The power strip. The locking wheels. The ease in which it rolls around the garage (yes I got to see him push it all over a two car garage). He showed me the drawers where is tools were carefully laid out. I got to see the little holders on top full of the things he uses most often (screws, nuts, bolts, nails). I got to see the cabinet where my tools were stuffed. He showed me how great the top of the cart was for his circular saw. I jokingly said maybe you should put my tools on the shelf in the back of the garage where your power saw used to be. Guess where my tools are now? Yep on the shelf. My daughter-in-law and I went inside and had a good laugh. He is absolutely over the moon about this cart. And that in itself is a recommendation because he rarely gets so enthusiastic over anything.

But I cannot give them a bad review because they are good quality and work well.  Use a 1/4 nut driver instead of a phillips screwdriver as this style screw is easy to strip.
While they label most of the packages as say Q313A 1088 etc.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Honeywell-Q313A1188-Thermopile-Generator-750-mV-35-inch-leads/dp/B0006UPOHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Honeywell Q313A1188 Thermopile Generator 750 mV 35 inch leads</a>, this product DOES have the same Q313A Thermopile piece, but with a different naming convention on the packaging only; actual piece inside says Q313A.  That being said, Honeywell makes several different versions of their Q313A Thermopile Generators.

- when applying your glue, work quickly since it dries fast; it can be tempting to apply glue to three or four fittings at once, but just do one at a time as you'll want to hold that fitting tight to avoid what's called "push out" -- the pipe will push out of the fitting if you don't hold it for 15-30 seconds after you set the glue

Too tight to fit on the rafters?? What are you 10 years old?! Whip out your palm sander and slim that sucker down! Still too big? Bolt a correctly sized 2x4 into that same rafter!(with a few 2x4 spacer blocks between them) Got engineered trusses? COME ON, You are Joseph the Carpenter! Don't let 2 extra inches of timber screw you over! Screw some ladder hanging hooks vertically into a 2x4 then hang the rubberized part over the truss(you'll need at least 2)(or you can use the 2x4 and spacer method mentioned) Gosh these reviewers.

Non-gluable plastics - yes it will stick unlike with CA glue or epoxy or urethane or basically every other glue.
One thing to note is that it will not bond to poly resin. The great thing about this stuff is how easy it is to use. You mix it one to one, rather than your standard 5:1 that gets messy and confusing. I used this in several application on my boat and have not had one issue with its strength etc. Highly recommend!

If you, for instance were working on a directional signal problem and took too long (switch needs to be on), you should remove the negative lug connector to stop the pump while you are working to prevent the loss of the pump.  If you cannot be careful then buy a spare and put it into the circuit with the wires disconnected.  This pump primes quickly as it is a continuous flow pump that DOES NOT PULSE. which is a requirement for successful Weber installations.

3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. DO NOT USE TOO MUCH! If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the CPU locking mechanism, your hands, etc... It makes a real mess. Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.

(Really bad construction- no foundation at all.) My 4 and 6 ton didn't work because of the small base. The large base of this was wonderful. I added supports and the deck was level. My next project with these was pushing up a floor where the joists had rotted. There was no sag over a couple of days. Getting the thing to retract was an XX canine; just like some others have noted.

I am here to tell you when I was a kid in the 1970's Panasonic was a name you could more than trust you could bank on it.  Almost anything Panasonic made was great and lasted for years of faithful use.  Like my youth the days of Panasonic products you could trust are long gone my friends.  Today buying any appliance is a crap shoot.  You might buy a treasure or you might buy a lemon.  The Panasonic Microwave I brought has been a treasure as reflected in my rating.  My Panasonic has been extremely gently used.  My Panasonic Microwave is lucky to be used 4 to 6 times a week but when used its always there.  This Panasonic Microwave like anything else made these days feels cheap in construction.  The plastic door has lots of flex give when you open and close it like a toy.  The door to this Panasonic Microwave flexes and gives so much you almost think it will break when opening the door.  The locking mechanism is also cheap so I am always careful to help open the door to this Panasonic microwave oven which should not be necessary but is.

However the delivery valve and mechanism leave a lot to be desired. I use small quantities over a number of weeks and after about 5 screw-on-screw-off uses, the threads on the valve begin to overhaul, the valve fails to shut completely with consequential hardening of the silicone in the dispensing nossle and necessary removal and shoving a screwdriver into it to unjam the solid material.

Now the review, This is perfect for my SUV (GMC Envoy) It lifts it effortlessly and has plenty of lift space. One thing I learned is that the top of the jack, the checkered piece is an extension! Just twist it counter clockwise and you get an extra 2-3" of lift. The only thing I don't like about this is how you release the pressure, it can be a pain if your handle is slippery or if your hands are greasy. But it's not a big deal at all :) If you have a vehicle with at least 8" of ground clearance, I'd definitely recommend this for you. And what's great is that it's not big or bulky at all!

I have no idea how these would work for wall anchors :)
I think this would be perfect if the brush is smaller.  It is hard to control the amount of liquid tape during application because of the size of the brush.  I also think a white liquid tape would be better so it is better to see if there are any parts that I missed coating.

The Artic Silver 5 compound has an aging time of around 200 hours and the temperature will improve by about 2 to 5 degrees after the aging process is done.  To properly age the compound you should use your computer until it heats up (about one or two hours) and then shut it down and let it cool off and use it again.  Do this multiple times.  This heat and cool procedure sets the compound up properly and improves the thermal interface.  Good luck and have fun!

1446	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Certainly this is very strong tape.  No doubt about that.  But.  . from my experience.  . it really doesn't stick very well.  Though it looks like it's stuck to the box. . . it comes right up if you pull on the edge.  I send a lot of packages to soldiers in Afghanistan.  In the past I purchased Tartan brand tape on Amazon and was very happy with it.  No, it's not nearly as strong, but it sticks well, and I always make sure I once along the seam, and then twice across the seam (like an "H") no matter what type of tape I'm using, and I've never had a problem.

I feel a lot more secure using this on exposed electrical wires than I do with tape. I've had taped connections become exposed again because of heat and humidity causing the gloue on the tape to degrade and pull away for the exposed area. With this product the fix is permanent and as water proof as the original wire casing.  This is one of those must have items for any home or shop.

3341	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	Anyone who uses this knows how unforgiving this stuff is if you get it on places you don't want it, like your clothing. To lessen your odds of keeping clean, they thought of this nice trigger that screws onto the top, that constantly unscrews itself while using it. Then the foam starts shooting out the base of the nozzle all over your hands, floor and clothing. Most of the time I use this I don't have the luxury of keeping the can away from my body. I'm usually on my back shooting up in cracks or whatever. Please redesign this so the damn trigger stays put.

Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges.

So for biological concern, what do people care about, magnetic or electric fields? An engineer in the field that has been following this noted that in the 70's it was electric fields, in the late 70's and 80's it was magnetic fields, and now it's really both. Most inexpensive units are only good for detecting the PRESENCE of stronger fields (vs. measuring them well) and many only measure magnetic fields, and if they do measure electric fields it usually isn't accurate. If you need to measure accurately and/or measure both magnetic and electric fields, I try to help out in this review with some leads later on.

We use these PSUs to power small dc devices that we need to test at a specific voltage and current. In most cases we are running at fairly high percentage current draws of 3-4Amps and switching the equipment on and off repeatedly throughout the day. Although we always ramp the voltage up before turning it on and down before turning it off, the unit gets a lot of use perhaps 20 -30 cycles a day.

I'd never used sticky-backed before but now I'm a convert.  Very quick to stick on.
When I first got the unit, I noticed that spinning the fan blade by hand was more difficult than I expected. The sleeve bearings are too high in friction so you pay for electricity to overcome this as well as create a lot of heat that tends to eat up lubricant.

3910	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	If you need a tough epoxy that is nearly as strong as metal, JB Weld is the only way to go.  This particular one is NOT a quick set epoxy - takes approximately 6 hours to start firming up, so you have plenty of working time.  Consistency is a little runny, so you have to dam it with tape to keep it from running into places you don't want it while it sets up.  I have used JB Weld to repair "impossible" breaks and have always had good results.  You have to mix both ingredients equally to get it to start - so stores well until you need it.

1. Remove the old thermal compound. This is accomplished by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. I recommend purchasing an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ArctiClean-kit/dp/B0007TOR08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ArctiClean kit</a>. For minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.

However, if you are looking for repeatable precision, where you get the same reading on a consistent basis, plan on spending more on a better meter.

My only quibble is that the colors of the kits may be the same in name, but in reality they vary. So if you're doing a large area and need multiple kits, buy them all at once so they are from the same run. Otherwise, just figure out a good transition point where a slight change in color isn't as noticeable.

To use the machine, remove the clean water tank (the top one), fill with hot water from the tap (as hot as possible gives the best results), add appropriate amount of the included cleaning solution (if desired), snap the clean water tank in place, set the desired brush speed, plug the power cord in and turn the machine on by pressing the power button with your foot on the left side near the bottom of the machine.

3209	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I rely on PC-11 (white) and PC-7 (grey) for all repair/rebuilding jobs. It's thick and tacky so it can be placed somewhat upright and it will hold its shape. If you don't want a rough surface press Saran wrap or packing tape on the wet surface and peel it off when it dries a day later. If you want something that flows more freely and will fill a mold, use JB Weld instead. All are very strong.

In my house hold, all WD-40 cans have been replaced by Breakfree CLP or Corrosion X. With either product, and for the same price, you get a penetrating oil that will get into stuck nuts and bolts and free them up. The lubrication will last much much longer than WD-40: squeaky indoor hinges will stay quiet for 2 years+ AND stay grit free. Rust is also prevented much much better. I use CLP to coat my outdoor padlocks and they stay shiney and operate smoothly for at least a year in rain or shine.....they would rust up heavily after 1 week if only coated with WD-40, and all sorts of dirt gets sucked into the mechanism.
2286	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).

You can also wrap plastic or a tarp to make a three-sided paint booth, or you can use them as a barrier wall when spaying kitchen cabinets to control overspray. Im sure there are many other uses for them. I believe I need to purchase another set in order to get the most use out of them. The legs and supports hold well; the jack inside the poles allows you to tighten a tarp or barrier against a surface without having to apply excessive force and they are easily removable, The swivel design near the bottom of the legs and top of the supports allows you to use them on uneven surfaces or at angles as well. They are very well designed and very well made.
White Glue:  For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.

Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.

Put it on a big shop floor after it was used for a paint shop for 2 yrs and a mechanic shop for 2 yrs. There was a lot of soaked in grease in the concrete, mostly in one area, and auto paint on the concrete. Used a diamond 4 in wheel for the paint (till 'I' ran out of gas). I had absolutely no problems with new paint where I kind of gave up leaving old paint on. (maybe because it was car paint???)  Where the mechanic grease, oil, and who knows what else was, the new Rust-Oleum went on and dried fine, looked perfect for about 2 weeks. Then I saw some yellowish oily goo in small areas. Thought they were spills of oily stuff. Wiped em up and a day or two later, there back. The concrete was pushing out the goo and even made a few bubbles (dime size). Man oh man, I don't want to redo that whole area. So I poked tiny holes in the bubbles, pushed and wiped. I'm a mechanic too and was going to clean the floor almost daily anyway, I'll live with it. Two months into summer heat the concrete spewed its last bit of goo. No chips where the popped bubbles were...WOW, lucky me. I did clean it with diluted muriatic acid as instructed for prep work, but that stuff was deep. The only thing I would have done differently was to use the glass beads that came with the kit at the area I work and spill liquids...it is a bit slippery when wet. Two years on, the floor is a bit scratched from equipment but better than any other floor paint I have used before at other shops. Traffic areas have no signs of wear, others do. All in all love my floor.

They closely approximate Stimpson grommets which are the gold standard (and which I used professionally for 4 decades).  Conversely, the General equivalent is made in India, apparently as a cost-cutting measure.  The two [General] boxes that I sampled were only 71% of the weight of their Stimpson equivalents, denoting thinner stock.  Two grommet washers were cracked, and one of the male parts was so greatly deformed that it couldn't be used.  Another crumpled on being set.  My results aren't conclusive since two boxes makes for a small sampling, but since they were bought several months apart [from different stores], the results are indicative.  Stick to Osbourne, Lord & Hodge, and Stimpson.  Avoid all off-shored sources!

At LOWER FREQUENCIES we can measure magnetic fields (in milligauss (mG) or microteslas (uT)), and higher end units also measure electric fields (V/m,W/cm2, etc.). Unlike higher frequencies where magnetic and electric fields are strongly coupled together, at lower frequencies you measure them separately.

This silicone tube is as good or better than anything you'll pick up at a shop, while being significantly less marked up.

I'm here to tell you that it does at least that, and sometimes even further depending on your particular setup. I use this product with all of my own builds, I recommend it to other builders that I know, and I use this product for my customer builds. It doesn't take very much of this to do the job, only a "pea sized" amount placed in the center of whatever you're going to use it on.

Hot Glues:  In short, if you really need the glue to set quickly, particularly if you've got alot of gluing to do -- consider hot glues.  As several commenters have pointed out, there is a whole world of hot glues (which come in the form of glue sticks which are used in glue guns), many of which work better, or are more convenient, than comparable cold glues.  In general, the most important attribute of hot glues is that the glue sets very quickly --- in some cases -- within seconds..  Since most hot glues set quickly, it is tempting to apply them too thickly.  Even with hot glue, for maximum strength, you should use the smallest amount that does the job, and apply moderate pressure until the glue sets.  Unfortunately, I have only limited experience with hot glues, and cannot supply specific suggestions for specific purposes.
4001	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This stuff is not too stinky so you don't have to use it outside. It bonds very well to anything I have tried it with and sets up quickly, but not too quickly. One thing I used it for was cementing the dryer exhaust vent to the house. Just be sure to mix it up with something disposable -- I use a paper plate and a popsicle stick. It will dry to a gray color, so don't use it on something that needs to be clear.

1686	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I was wondering if i was wasting my money when I ordered Plasti-dip, but it works well. It is easy and near fool proof. A couple of tips would be to move slow. Dip slow, extract slow. Start with a good clean surface and don't try to push the drying time. Again, be slow; with patience the results are great. Take extra care in sealing your partial can. If air gets to it it will start to harden. I found a bit of grease inside the rim of the plastic lid makes an effective seal and keeps my product ready for long periods.

This Littmann Lightweight II SE is a great stethoscope for those of us who are starting out and don't need to/want to invest money in a cardiology-grade steth.

Silicone can have different formulations that change it's characteristics slightly. All silicone's are highly waterproof, but some formulations are even better for 100% water immersion (like on a boat hull). Some have a wider temperature range. Some dry slightly faster, etc.  Permatex makes other more specialized formulations which are top notch (mostly for automotive applications), but this particular package is just great plain old clear silicone sealant.
7808	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	My only complaint is that these would not fit within a .25 bore bearing.
796	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	Not for man hands. Tools are tiny. The anvil and punch are ok but the cutter is useless. Using a 12 oz hammer I still couldn't get the hole punch or "cutter" to go through so ended up cutting a slit with a razor. Once the grommet is in place it seems to hold good.
If you have ever been shocked, this could have stopped you from risking your hand with old sparky.  Simple to use, just place the tip on a wire or in a socket (like you tried with a fork as a kid) and the end will light up if the wire, socket, etc. is hot.

Ran the magnet test and it is completely non-magnetic.  It in an "Austenitic" grade (mostly meaning low carbon which causes the rust but reduced strength).  This means it can not b e heat treated.  However, the description states it has been "Annealed" which not only relieves stress in the rod, but typically removes surface carbon particles to reduce rusting (to almost nothing).

5541	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Well, if you're looking for Twist-On wire connectors that both Twist and Connect wires,....look no further!  These work great and are probably way cheaper than anywhere else you're going to find them.  I highly recommend them.  They come in a nice clear plastic container with a screw on top, just like you'd get if you got them from any big name store.  So far, they have worked exactly as I needed to.
Pros:
-When the plastic clips securing the rear panels  of *both* front seats failed in our 1998 Nissan Maxima (exposing the interior springs and other parts of the seats), Gorilla tape successfully re-secured them. While it's hardly fine auto upholstery, we prefer the look of this repair to viewing the springs and other innards of the seats.

4294	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This weather stripping is easy to install songs is just what you need to keep out the cold.
For this reason, I recommend using transparent caulk when possible, since these minor imperfections will be less obvious. I also recommend cutting the caulk nozzle smaller than you think you'll need. The next time I use this caulk, I'm going to try using 'CAULK-EZ' brand tooling aid (http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ILFLH2Q). I haven't used it yet, but if it works half as well as they claim, it will save a lot of time and frustration, and be well worth the cost. And as always, use a good dripless caulk gun (I use 'Dripless Inc. ETS2000 Ergo', best one on the market imo, http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0002CKG1O), and if your poker isn't long enough, just cut up a wire hanger to make a poking tool.

Be sure to match this with the Arctic Silver Articlean kit if you are doing an upgrade rather than a clean install; it makes cleaning the old thermal paste off of the old heat sink/CPU a breeze.

For me, standing here holding, comparing, using these two calipers - I would deduce they were made in the same location.  Maybe Starrett uses higher quailty stainless steel, maybe they have a higher standard / tolerance for preicsion, maybe there are differences that the eye cannot see.  But, I am having trouble seeing those differences in measuring, using.  And the fact they weigh the same points to being made of the same composition material / metal.  Am I saying these two calipers, $70 apart in price, might actually have the same origin?  Well, yeah, I am.  The bottom line is, knowing what I know now, I am not sure I would spend $100 for the Starrett.

The only downside, is that they only come in Black. This is a better color than silver duct tape, but I'd also like to see it come transparent for glass work reinforcement, but as it stands, this is some of the best duct tapes out there.

1466	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Ought this glue kit primarily for woodworking projects, used the Jel glue to glue together some scrap trim that was being used on a hobby project. Saved me a trip to pick up trim to finish the project. Used the thin glue to repair a Bluetooth headset that had been previously glued with cheap dollar store glue that failed to hold. The ability to activate the glue for truly instant results is amazing. Love fastcap products and this one does not disappoint
If I made a list of all of the possible things this could fix, Amazon would sue me for taking up all of the characters on the Intrawebz.
But overall, this is a good labor saver. It doesn't make a 50+ pound sheet of 1/2 inch rock any lighter, but it DOES make it a bit less unwieldy, and more likely to make it to the project area without any cracks, scrapes, or dings.

The thicker 7/8" OD was definitely worth the price although I ended up getting a bit more than I need - better to go long than vice versa with this product.  Exactly what it says - it is a high-quality product.  It handles very hot (up to boiling/brewery temperatures) without degrading in shape or firmness.  It can be hot to the touch - gloves are a good idea when using it with hot liquids.

* This meter definitely errs on the side of reduced false positives. If I put my old Klein meter next to a 110v line encased in metal conduit, it would scream at it. Likewise, put it anywhere near a live AC outlet, and it would alert. Of course it had an adjustable squelch, and it was always a bit of a calibration exercise before I used it. The Fluke is much quieter. If you hold it next to live Romex, it will alert, but not a live outlet, and certainly not an wire encased in steel conduit. As a result, it is both more and less useful, depending on how you think about it.

I've bought several other inexpensive forceps - some not very useful - but these actually work as intended.
Silicon Glue:  Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  It is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier.  Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GE-Silicone-II-Household-Glue-2-8-oz/dp/B002J998DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 oz</a>

It works great, I probable have 50 wires and I can easily tone out the one I need.  The only trick I ran into is that on shielded wire you need to use the shield as one of the conductors for the toner, if you don't then the shielding does it's trick and makes it hard to tone out.

4159	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I am an experienced DIYer, and I also have a bad back in addition to recently hurting my wrist. I recently undertook a major renovation of a room in my home, and the weight of the plywood, MDF, and sheetrock wasn't agreeing with my 44 year old body. I originally purchased a panel carrier that supported the panels from the bottom, and it worked well enough. But the weight during the lifting and carrying was still on my lower back, which is a no-no for me. The lifting of the panels with the single handle was also aggravating my wrist injury, so I looked for another solution. I saw a review of this carrier in one of my woodworking magazines, and bought it hoping that the design would make handling 100 lbs panels easier with less chance of injury. This thing is excellent -- the heavier the object, the harder it grabs onto it. The design allows you to lift it without bending over -- good for my back. The handle is nice and thick, with a rubber-like coating for a firm grip. The jaws that clamp your material are also coated with a non-slip material. Well worth the money -- I wish I had bought this one in the first place.

Everything functions as I imagined.  The wood piece is small and isn't really that hard.  Its hard enough to punch holes through the fabric with the hole punch.  I would not say the hole punch is super sharp, but it does work.  I went through 2 layers of Sunbrella Marine fabric with ease, and I can see this working with up to about 4 layers.  Your best bet is to use a heavier hammer and swing light, as opposed to a light hammer with a heavy swing.  I found that a 2.5 pound hammer was ideal.  With this hammer, the grommet installation is a piece of cake.  Just tap lightly a few times, check it, tap a couple more times, check it, light taps to snug it down.  Do not over hammer or the anvil gets stuck in the grommet and can be difficult to unstuck.

I've had this extended to it's full size and piled high with equipment -- though only a couple hundred pounds worth, nowhere near the rated 500 pounds.  It turns out that getting the smaller, front wheels over obstacles and rough terrain is problematic once you get more than, say, 100 pounds on it.  But the back wheels do fine.  I also worried that I might bend the handle by using it to drag a 200 pound load down a gravel path and over stepping stones and low curbs, so I treated it gingerly, and often had a helper push on the back handle while I was pulling the front.  Maybe I was being overly cautious, but on the way to gigs I take no chances.

I have one that is trimmed all the way down to the largest cuff and permanently attached to my Makita 2703 table saw dust port and another along with a 2" rubber Fernco connector that is permanently attached to my Delta 28-150 band saw so I can quickly connect my 2-1/2" Ridgid shop vac hose whenever I use them. These adapters are a little expensive for what they are, but have work well for my needs and really do seem to last. Some of mine are probably around ten years old now and have had heavy use, but are still fully functional, so I think they were well worth the expense.

The back of the bottle does not indicate any glue remover such as mineral spirits, for example, that could be used to clean off the glue from the skin.

It sucks up the water thoroughly (not leaving it soggy wet) and it cleaned the carpets really well.  It only has the one tank where you mix the hot water and the cleaning solution together, but the tank is large enough to finish an entire room (where we previously have had to refill once or twice to finish our living room).  The brushes seem to work really well and you could see where you had run the machine over the carpet, and where you had not.  This helped make the carpet feel softer after the entire process was done.  We vacuum the carpet, run the shampoo over the carpet with the cleaning solution, and then using a tank of just hot water, run the machine one more time, let the carpet dry and then vacuum.  It looks great when it's done, and since it sucks up the water really well it dries quicker than other machines we have used.  The cord did not get hot during use.  It is a simple, sturdy carpet cleaner with no bells or whistles, but does exactly as advertised.

This caulk worked very well but I would recommend a longer drying time than it states and you absolutely must make sure that the surfaces of the material is clean.  It even recommends the use of rubbing alcohol to remove soap scum and any soil on the surfaces before caulking.  I can tell you this is critical.  I cleaned the areas thoroughly before I started and those spots worked fine.  I had a little caulk left over and I put it on a spot just to dress it up but I didn't use alcohol to clean it.  Two days later I easily wiped it off with my finger nail.

Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.

A quick amazon search of Irwin Unibit" reveals that the price of these bits is largely related to their size - for example the largest bit (#4) is roughly half the cost of the entire set. If all you need is one of the smaller two bits, either can be had for under 16 dollars with prime shipping. If you can live without the largest bit, a set of three can be had for about 43 dollars (there is no case, and the third bit is slightly different than the set reviewed here, but seems comparable).
4223	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This is the strongest suction I have ever encountered in a vacuum! Gobbled up dust, dirt and spilled water on the garage floor. But when I tried to get water out of a carpet, the intense suction would not allow the vacuum to move. Not forward, not backward! The info never said it was for bare floors only. I had never had a shopvac before, perhaps this is common knowledge.  If you need to clear any uncarpeted floors, this is for you !!! Unfortunatelyi, I had to return it because I need it for carpet too. Perhaps some sort of re-design would let it work on carpet. The brush on the one tool didn't hold it off the carpet high enough, and that suction just attached itself to the carpet!
It works great like this!
4545	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Super high quality. Positive shut-off when disconnected. The male half has a bar across the opening which pushes the valve open in the female side when connected. Not sure just any male fitting will work because of the shape. I bought 2 so I would have a female end on both propane generators, allowing the use of gasoline once the propane hose is disconnected. The female closes air tight without the male connected. I put the male on my supply hose so I can use it on either generator. The supply hose is shut on and off by a control handle on the propane piping.

The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go. The other benefit of an aluminum rod is that it can be used to tap parts without marking them, if done carefully. This is a good all-purpose tool helper to keep around. It weighs almost nothing and can be kept in the range bag or tool box.

The Gorilla Glue Company makes many different glues, in different colors and container sizes. The one I am reviewing is the 2 oz. size of the original brown colored Gorilla Glue. This glue will dry out in the bottle, so I do not recommend buying larger bottle sizes, unless the glue will be used in the near future. For most of us, we use a little glue, and put the bottle away until needed the next time. This glue is interesting, in that you wet the surfaces, add a thin layer of glue, and clamp the surfaces together for 1-2 hours. In the meantime, the glue will expand and turn into a hard foam. After application, any exposed expanded glue may be peeled away or squashed back down a bit while it is drying, so that the repair is not so noticeable. This stuff will eventually dry as hard as a rock. Overall, I would give this glue an Amazon rating of four and a half stars, rounded off to five stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.

The zipper pull has a large ring on it to aid opening. It is a key ring, so you can easily put keys there if you wanted. The only con I have with this BP cuff is that it isn't Latex-free. If this ever becomes an issue, I can put cloth between the cuff and person's skin.

What I Like:
1699	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	These wheels are functionally very useful and sturdy, however, that functionality is vastly overshadowed by their noxious and offensive odor. If you're planning on using these wheels in an open-shop environment I am sure they will work well, but any confined space or environemnt where air quality is a consideration should be avoided. The odor is reminiscent of petrochemical or tar production and is overwhelming if there is not active and forced ventilation. It's been over 2 weeks since I cleaned and attempted to let them off-gas and the odor just seems to be getting stronger.

The main difference is simply the adhesive. It's super sticky like regular duct tape, but instead of getting brittle and gritty and crumbly over time, the adhesive stays fresh and flexible.

I happen to own a low cost import set of step drill bits (a Neiko 10193A set, in near new condition). It is immediately obvious that the Irwin bits are better quality than the Neikos in appearance and legibility of the step-size markings. Ill post a picture showing an Irwin and Neiko side by side. In use the Irwin bits cut sheet metal faster, producing smoother edges (less burrs) and more well rounded holes. For rough work on a tight budget the Neiko may be a good choice. Otherwise Id recommend the Irwin bits.

If you need lots of these then you might try velcro cable ties, but I'm not sure how suitable they'd be for holding gels onto the front of a flash or other applications that don't involve cable management. Anyway, the sticky velcro can be used to make cable ties as well as faten other objects together.

2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is "repositionable" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or "reposition" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.

This is much thicker than your typical duct tape (and much more expensive as I am sure you have noticed).  I have found it cheaper on other sites, but the quick shipping of amazon is awesome and when I find that I have run out I always order it here.  Better quality and heavier duty than any other duct tape you would typically buy.
1654	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	On first use the threads in one of the tightening nuts stripped.  As I had not used this item before I was slowly creaping up on a the force required to secure the arm.  The thread stripped before I could get it tight.

4) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS! PU glue is waterproof and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage. There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution. There have been MANY cases - just search Google "Dog Gorilla Glue" Wear gloves (rubber or vinyl) and use lots of wax paper.

This little test kit is a brilliant idea. You don't need to take a sample and send it off to a lab, paying whatever fees, and waiting weeks for results. You can do these series of tests at home, in less than an hour (except the bacterial one, which needs two days in a vial at room temp to see if the nasties are going to have a breeding party).

Other notes:
I've only had it a few days and will update if I run into any problems.  But right now, I'm in love!  LOL  I DID buy an extra filter since it really fills up the holes with dirt.  I want to be able to use it each day and rinse the filter.  Having 2 allows a day for each filter to dry before putting it back in.
3240	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is truly the best stuff money can buy.  Pricey yes by a few dollars but goes a very long way on trim, splices etc...  An RV youtube channel Nomadic Fanatic referred me to it.  Pay the extra $ for this over the other stuff & you'll thank me later as will the next guy that buys your RV someday.  Try to use the tube up because it will go bad which goes to show you it's a powerful product.

2392	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is not a Zip Wall System. If you want to erect a plastic dust containment system, buy the Zip Wall. It's far superior for that purpose. If you want a "3rd" had to hold sheetrock against a ceiling, or other heavy duty overhead, or even some horizontal tasks,this is the one to buy. You can exert considerable force with these and if you work alone, you'll find many uses for the 3rd hands. I agree the pins are a little hard to depress,  and the bag is a little too small, minor issues. However this is a heavy duty system that compliments the Zip Wall. In my opinion, buy them both, you won't be dissapointed.

9188	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I was introduced to WAGO products at work, where we manufacture custom training equipment for airlines and the military. WAGO is a european company that specializes in high-quality, high-reliability electrical connection products. In the past few years, WAGO has begun marketing some of their products to consumers, and their line of LEVER-NUTS connectors is one of those products. These are also sold to industrial and professional customers -- they aren't some cheapie knock-off. These connectors are amazing -- with one device you can reliably join wire from 22 gauge to 12 gauge, solid or stranded, mix-and-match. And the connections are SOLID -- these use a variety of WAGO's "cage-clamp" connector that uses spring-loaded contacts and geometry to create a connection that actually tightens under vibration and tension, rather than loosening and failing like screw connections, wire-nuts and IDC connectors.

The precise tip is good while working in narrow spaces. In contrary to how it looks you don't need to squeeze it to get it out. Flipping it upside down generates a small amount of liquid glue which is enough for most cases and all the glue is in the tubing not at the base. So I guess the bulky base only works as a handle.
9272	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Fast Shipping Great Price
I selected this tubing, even though it was more expensive than other tubing, because it was food safe and rated for temperatures well higher than boiling.  Nothing else came close - but I would have bought 1 meter if I could have.  Or a half meter would have been enough.  It is not cheap, but I didn't allow price to affect my rating, I knew what it cost when I bought it.

I did some research, and these were popular for having consistent readings and good construction. You want the measuring side of the device to be even and flush so you get the same measurement when using the outer and inner measuring surfaces. From my testing at home, that is the case with these calipers, with variation of no more than .02 mm. That's certainly good enough for our needs.
8806	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Price, convenience (i.e.: spool), and quantity make this the best way to buy all gauges of copper wire for jewelry-making.

If you use copper, make your own jump rings, head pins and eye pins, etc., and wrap a lot, this is the way to go.
2407	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	not a very good product as it has only one stripe that goes under the product you are trying to carry --one stripe is not enough as it will not keep the balance at all where the safety comes to a question.

4715	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I normally use the gold version of this tape, but thought this might be a little more aggressive. I think I must have wasted a half a roll. More of the tape ended up inside and all over the machine then it did on the artwork. I just couldn't seem to get it to stick to the back of frames for dust covers. I changed angles, pressed really hard, etc. and the tape ended up everywhere except where I wanted it. Complete waste of time and money to me. I switch back over to the gold variety, and had next to no problems. Never again for me!

For this price shipped, I expected it to be 12 inches long, which it was. In appearance, it has a standard quality mill finish. It's what you would expect from any established steel vendor.

 cooks evenly, the best of any microwave I have used.  I credit part of it to the inverter technology.  What this means is that on reduced power settings (anything under max power) the oven puts out a steady, but reduced output.  Most microwaves reduce the power by cycling the magnetron 'off and on' to reduce the power, so you get bursts of full power, with a moment of no power.  The steady, but reduced power seems to provide for more even cooking.  For just boiling a cup of water on 'high' you won't notice.  However, try warming a couple slices of pizza at half power compared to our old microwave, also at half power, and it is heated much more evenly.  I quite often use reduced power settings, as it tends to heat food up more evenly, even if it does take a little longer.  This microwave shines in that category.  Also, it defrosts meat without 'browning' it, far better and faster than any other I have had.
What this material is better at than wood is that it is slick and good for woodworking jigs. It is also more stable than wood during humidity and temperature changes.

3376	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Works very well. Took a few moments for me to get the hang of working with the spray, but once applied it seems to insulate against the draft that formerly worked its way into our basement. Wore disposable gloves as recommended, so cleanup was not an issue. Would be a little hesitant to use in a situation where it would be visible, say, in a room within the house, as it is not elegant in appearance. But it's quick and is not expensive.
The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers.

One thing to be aware of is that this hose is not as wide as a 5/8" garden hose (it 1/2" hose).  This reduces the water pressure that the hose can generate.

We also use it for dust/lint removal on black velvet store displays (instead of lint rollers) and it has just the right amount of tackiness to grab the dirt without destroying the surface of the display being cleaned.

I have not had the problems others have had stripping out or breaking the head off maybe because I usually predrill and I don't typically use them in hardwoods either. The only con is that they are more costly yet I am willing to continue if/when something better comes along. I use these in 1 1/2" material.

7120	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This is a brass bar as described. It is rectangular and "half hard" which means it is pretty stiff in terms of bendability. It cuts and drills a bit harder than aluminum but easier than steel. It comes unfinished - meaning like in the picture it isn't shiny when it arrives. However it can be shined nicely with a buffing wheel and buffing compound. If you drill and/or tap I reccomend using WD-40 while drilling or taping - it makes the work go better.
2060	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	These are some of the best test leads around.  They are Fluke's 4mm banana to 90 degree 4mm banana plug set.  They are just about 3' in length and are made of high quality silcone rubber.  This means they provide excellent saftey with a CAT IV rating but at the same time a pleasurable working experience since they don't hold shape following storage.  Undo the twist tie and they fall free and straight!  Beautiful!!!  This is important to me since getting your probes tangled around switch gear is a recipe for utter disaster!  With the opposite end being a straight 4mm banana plug, these can be adapted to a wide range of uses with 4mm plug style accessories.  Large clamps, speciality probes, or daisy chaining test leads (with a coupler)are just a few options.  They are pricey at around $25, but take care of them and they will last a lifetime!  I wouldn't trade these for anything!

The lever that you have to squeeze to get the fuel to flow out is a pain to deal with. You must have a strong forearm just to keep the fuel flowing. If you ne to pour fuel at or above your head (boat), you will likely pour gas all over yourself (through the safety release valve).  I only purchased one due to price.

This tubing has the same inside diameter as standard aquarium tubing, so it fits an aquarium pump's air fitting perfectly. My feeling is that if an aquarium pump won't kill fish, the air produced is probably safe for food. The food is protected from the bath with a plastic barrier, but it seems to diffuse a bit, you can smell the spices from inside the bag in the water bath, and what diffuses out will diffuse in. Thus I didn't want to use standard aquarium tubing in the water.  Even silicone aquarium tubing.  I probably could have boiled standard silicone tubing, changing the water at least five times, or until no dye leached into the boiling water after five changes.  But this stuff, well, I could just use it.

9192	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Be aware these are fairly large and have a bigger footprint than your standard Wago. I think they're perfect for stranded wire as the lever allows you insert a stranded wire and release it easily, as is not the case with your standard Wago, without some effort. I will still use the standard push in Wago's for solid wire because the footprint is way more compact.
Minor quibfle with programming.  It is simple, and straightforward, but takes a lot of button presses.  For example, the 'power level' button reduces the power 10% every time it is pressed.  So, if you want to heat something at half power, you press 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power'.  I would prefer to hit 'power' '5', like on our old oven.  It is OK once you get used to it, but as someone who uses reduced power settings a lot, it takes a lot of finger presses.

2293	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This is a great bin we got for keeping or dirty dishes sorted. It works well and does great. It is sturdy, the exact same type you will see any busser using at a regular restaurant.
4350	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I mistakenly ordered this tape for mailing packages. I always ordered Duck EZ Start tape previously and the green label fooled me. Horrible. Curled and stuck to itself and I wasted about 25% of the rolls because of this. I'll pay more attention next time. The EZ Start may cost a few cents more but it is definitely worth it.

735	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The construction appears to be sound and no other cons can be said at this point.  Reliability over time is the real key.  Consider a flexible boot if the operating environment is severe (moisture, dust, chemicals, etc.).
3929	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Great stuff, FAST delivery, good price and packing.  :-)
2284	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Try to buy only as much as you intend to use. My large bottle went south after one year. By the way, Elmer's is probably as good as Gorilla and costs less.
4058	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	This is a sample of uranium-238, not the much rarer uranium-235 that I was led to believe after visiting the vendor's website. If you want uranium-235 or uranium-234, you need to look elsewhere. On a side note, Images SI does have other radioactive materials for sale on their website.  I was particularly pleased to find some cesium-137. Be warned that it costs more than the uranium however.
912	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I needed a slew of old time looking casters and these are the ones. I got a bunch of them and am extremely stoked on them. These are all getting screwed onto the bottom of my furniture in my shop. I am tired of lifting the tv and couch when I want to vacuum so now I just roll it out of the way. Winner winner chicken dinner.
Another issue to be aware of: Make sure you don't overload the max load rating, or the caster assembly WILL BEND, and stop working due to a jammed wheel.

You go to the big box store and they have them in 2500 or 5000.........okay for the contractor but way too many for around the house.  This way I have a good assortment of the nails that can be used in my gun - without breaking my wallet.  Sometimes when you can't find the nail you need at Amazon, check out the Home Depot that has tool rental - you can get them there in small amounts....they don't gouge you either!  These nails are quality nails and I recommend them without reservation, my gun has never jammed or had a malfunction.

3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naptha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off "white glue" and clean up with a moist paper towel.

4341	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Replaced a 5+ year old Panasonic that had heavy use daily.  On some weekends with family over at our house, this is used to cook several 1 pound bacon packages,  which repeatedly runs the unit 10 minutes at a time.  Definitely the stress from longer operating times are harder on the microwave generating "magnetron tube" and electronics.  Most other namebrand household duty microwaves lasted us only a year or so.
9094	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The WD-40 name comes from WWII when research was going on for a good Water Disbursement agent to protect military items from rust. It was the 40th formula tested. Did you know that the principal component was Fish Oil! Surprised me when I read that. Google WD-40 and check out its history and uses.
It usually tears off in small strips and leaves the white tacky part of the tape
The fit and finish is of good quality, as is the entire instrument. I do like calipers for "down and dirty" quick measurements, but go to my mikes when we get close to finish cuts. This is a good tool for quick reference and I would recommend it to a friend.

The only thing I would like to see is more wrist coverage - they are a little short here unless you deliberately pull them down. Not a big complaint. I would buy again.
9883	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	works well  unfortunately it runs a bit and can make a mess if you don't do a small bit at a time and hold it until you are sure it stays put.  a few minutes at least

7543	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Simply put, if you need to drill holes in plastic and soft metal, you cannot beat this bit for this price. I use it to drill 7/8" to 1-1/4" holes in plastic buckets to install various bulkhead valves for home brewing, and I could not be happier with this bit. If you need to put large holes in stainless steel, however, you're better off with a knockout punchor, taking the work product to a machinist.
1692	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	yes they smell, but honestly being somebody who has worked in industrial manufacturing, mechanic shops and farm equipment repair, it really isent an overwhelming smell. thats mostly opinion though, im sure some would consider it foul, especially indoors.

7809	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Strong and straight.  Just what I needed to construct a house-mounted antenna.  Easy to cut and thread.
Only time will tell if this item continues to perform well. Foreign production, poor engineering and shoddy workmanship seems to be the order of today's manufacturing. I just wish we could get better response from our manufacturing base to get making things back into the good old USA with US labor which we need so desperately.
The seat adjustment is very easy with a knob and screw under the seat. The handlebars will adjust up and down a little bit if needed. Assembly was straightforward with easy to understand instructions. About all you need is an adjustable wrench.

2853	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I don't really understand making vacuum fittings that aren't at least somewhat rubberized.  This is pretty rigid plastic, so whatever you're attaching it to must be exactly the right size.
1586	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I am no expert when it comes to calking.  But I did find this product easy to use and seems to work as advertised.  I ordered the slate gray to match my laminate countertops.  I used the product to seal the gap between the backsplash and the wall.  It looks very good, even considering my lack of experience.  I recommend this product.

7742	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Like the vast majority of reviewers I used these for .22 snap caps.  And they work fine for that.  They can be a bit tricky when using them to test for action function, extraction, etc.  But still a good option.  I was able to cycle them pretty good through my Ruger Mark IV to test function.  On something like a revolver they are the cats meow for snap caps.
404	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I have used these for years, but the current production is of inferior steel. Very soft and does not cut well at all. Suitable only for soft metals. Irwin seems to have outsourced the production to the lowest bidder.

9319	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	The item is exactly what I expected.  The number of sizes, the quantity per size and the particular selection of sizes and thickness  matches my needs.  The value received significantly exceeds the price paid.  This assortment likely will obviate any future purchase of snap rings for the rest of my life.

If you ever have foods that are rated for lower wattage microwave, like 1,000 watts, you can run this Panasonic on a power setting of 8 and perfectly cook your food to match the manufacturer's test kitchen results.  Or you can let it cook on the full ~1200 watt power setting but definitely at a reduced timer setting.
3822	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Handy stuff to have around. Strong bond when used appropriately. I always have some of the regular and Kwikweld on hand. Most people probably know this, but this will not work so well to repair flexible material.
It will not work in vertical applications, though.  I tried using it to hold a cute sign on a door from wobbling when the door is opened or closed, to keep it from marring the surface.  It 'drips down' a little when used this way, and does not work.
4780	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Long enough to secure most wood items, and with driver bit and jig, will help in building items with pocket screws; need bit, next on my list.  Kreg quality as advertised on home improvement shows.
9619	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I use this stuff on my glocks. Same as what comes on a new glock. Works great when applied with a toothpick along the rails. I have also used it for many other applications as well. If you are using it on just guns it will probably last you a lifetime. Good stuff!!!
487	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	A great compromise between kitchen-type paper towels and cotton shop towels.  I use these all the time when working with metal and wood projects.
8045	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It was a steel rod...which is what I ordered. so Perfect.
I finally tried ABS.  It sticks so well with 80C beds that it basically ruins the bed.  I had extra so I cut a new one.  Be careful and do tests starting at low bed temps if you do ABS cause I have not found a magic number that works yet.  If you make a mistake and get the temp too high the bed piece is probably ruined.  Still love it for PLA though.
6753	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the other battery powered brand for over a decade, and decided to try the Sonicare Xtreme.  This model cleans better, and is easier to use.  As far as the leakage - the bottom is sealed by an "O-ring" (black plastic ring on the bottom).  To keep this seal intact and working, smear a SMALL amount of petroleum jelly on the O-ring all around.  This, plus some common sense care has kept our two Sonicare toothbrushes dry and corrosion free.
8661	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is our 'generic rating' for any good product we have purchased from amazon that works as expected.  With all the products we buy on amazon, we usually don't have time to write individual ratings for the good stuff.  If you see this review coupled with a 5 rating you know that
2961	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Easy kit to assemble. Waveform gets a little distorted at high amplitude.

2921	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	works real good
6268	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	This unit is over rated. The Klein Tools NCVT-2 is way better. For starters, the plastic tip is too large and you either have to file it down or accept that it will wear down your outlets prematurely. Secondly, you can't hold it up to a light switch to test for voltage, so it is not that sensitive. Lastly, there's about a 250 ms delay before it detects voltage. I find this annoying. The Klein NCVT-2 has none of these issues and you can set it to a low-voltage mode to detect live switches. The 1AC-A1-II will serve as a door stop.
8230	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Just as described.  Fast shipping.  Worked great.
As I was removing the multipurpose foil tape I noticed that it was made of a plastic & foil segments and thought I am so glad I got the 3M High Temperature tape as plastic can't be a good sign. I covered all the joints and am happy with the results.

HOW TO USE JB-WELD
7658	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I initiated a return immediately after getting it.  It leaked oil and would not pump.  Terrible paint job all over and the relief valve was painted into position.  Obviously poor quality.  Thank God for Amazon returns.  It is all packed up and will mail it back tomorrow.  Looked for a higher quality bottle jack by reading the reviews on the site, seems they are all badly made.  So ordered a Craftsman, and will see.  Why isn't there a quality bottle jack at a reasonable price?
This thing can carbonize a bag a popcorn in a heart beat.
6935	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Stainless steel nuts are great.  Size and finish is consistent throughout the package.  They are great for food items where corrosion can be an issue.

7730	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Best Duct tape I've ever used.
6495	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Where has this been all my life? Using a normal caliper is fine, I suppose, but reading "somewhere between" two lines can be trying at the best of times. This caliper removes any doubt. It gives you two significant digits past the decimal even when dealing with millimeters. It has a quick-reset calibration button and a button to switch from metric (why would you want to???) to the system used by only two countries: The US and Burma. But hey, if that's how you roll, they provided you that crutch. It's easy to use, and accurate. And did NOT cost much. I am very happy with this.
9219	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works 100% as intended. High quality.
7722	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. I couldn't find a replacement panel for my cracked refractory brick, but this works well enough for me to feel safe now when using the fireplace. Some of my cracks were large so I should've went with several applications like the instructions tell you to. Parts bubbled up, but if I have to reapply it yearly to use my fireplace, I'm ok with that.

6837	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This tool has paid for itself in a short time, allowing me to trace wires of several different types (CAT3, CAT5, coax, speaker) that were run through walls in the house I just purchased.  Most of the wires were not labeled, so my first job was to identify were they were all running.  The PRO3000 was just the tool I needed to get this job done quickly and accurately.

Virtually all degenerative diseases including cancer, heart disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, kidney and gallstones, and tooth decay are associated with excess acidity in the body. While the body has a homeostatic mechanism that maintains a constant pH 7.4 in the blood, this mechanism works by depositing and withdrawing acid and alkaline minerals from other locations including the bones, soft tissues, body fluids and saliva. Therefore, the pH of these other tissues can fluctuate greatly. The pH of saliva and urine offers a window through which you can see the overall pH balance in your body.
2265	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Terrific waterproof glue. I like the expansion quality. A little goes a long way. There might be stronger wood glues but this product suits me just fine.
8843	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Arrived in perfect condition. There is a good side and a bad side and I only needed it to be one sided. I used this to trim out an exhaust vent for a range hood (8"). The material works as easily as to be expected for PVC and is uniform in thickness and appearance.
1444	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It appears that some batches of this tape have a problem with stickiness, however the package I bought works well.  I use this tape to attach PayPal labels to my packages as well as taping the packages themselves.  They work very well, and the clear tape allows me to use paper labels rather than more expensive self-stick labels.  What I like about this tape that it is not as thin as some other packaging tapes I tried, so it is easier to control - it lays evenly where I put it and does not stick with bubbles or to itself.
8630	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Nice for the price
5313	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have used this in the past. The color change is a great idea. I purchased this to have a brush, to apply my industrial strength super glue. Bob Smith industries is 2 oz for only $12 and is much stronger. I will empty the container and place the BOB SMith super glue in it. It gives me more control.

I have to use a rubber band to keep it closed. Not a big deal when my other pins are in a cardboard box and they get torn, broken, and tossed! This keeps everything nice and neat!
I am more than upset, I did a lot of searching to find a worthy Microwave unit.  In today's economy, It is shameful for Big Business to take the money I paid for this Microwave unit, I expected more from a well known company but found out that both my MONEY and the "Panasonic company name" were both worthless!!!.

Sorry Panasonic. I am looking forward to the day your patent on inverter power supply runs out so others can do this.  You make a great microwave oven. Others should be able to do this. Inverter (over transformer) changes the game in energy/cooking/health/weight.

I own a "human" otoscope and was hoping this would be similar.  After attaching the head to the handle, the head actually "rattled" and moved.  It was not a secure or a tight fit on the base handle.  I took it apart a few times and tried to adjust it, but it stayed the same.  It also came with broken, plastic ear pieces which would not attach to the light head.  I sent the entire item back and have not purchased another item yet.  If you have any experience with medical equipment, this item does not even come close to professional equipment.  I wouldn't even keep it for home use because it just seemed cheaply made.

If you like to keep it around your neck (like 95% of people out there) make sure you wipe down the tubing periodically.  It sounds gross but the oils from your neck will penetrate the tubing and harden them, making them more susceptible to cracks.  (I also have a colleague that got MRSA cellulitis on his neck from guess how.)  You can replace the tubing but it's not cheap, and you can spare yourself this trouble with just a bit of cleaning.  I like to grab a handful of alcohol pads from the phlebotomy carts that I keep in my pocket to wipe down every so often.

Boy, this stuff is really tough. It was even difficult to peel off the role and took a lot of strength. It's a very high quality tape. I only used about a four-inch length and wrapped the antenna as tightly as I could and cut off the excess. It looked fine. A casual observer would never notice. It was good and strong. And if it ever did come loose, we had a lot more tape to re-fix it. So there you have it, a Mercedes held together with duct tape.

Controls easy to figure out:  Once you figure out where the buttons are, working the oven is very straightforward.  There is a chart inside the door opening, that tells you what foods correspond to each number.  You just look at the chart, find what you are cooking, and program accordingly.  One comment I might make, is that whenever you use the auto-cook mode, it gives the option of 'more' or 'less', and for me at least, the 'less' choice is the one to use.  I like to use a spatter cover, so that may have something to do with it.  About the only gripe I have, is that to program in food number 4, you don't press 'program' and then the '4' button, but rather press the 'program' button 4 times.  It works OK, but thought I'd mention it.

A few surprises were that it did not set as fast as I thought it would based on some other reviews. In order to fill pits along an edge, I found that the best solution was to first apply a section of duct tape to give something I could ply the JB into. Ironically, the JB sticks to just about anything and this particular duct tape does too, and is tough to get off. Yet the two did not stick to each other, and a light sanding got rid of any residue.

8672	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	As a concept, I like this tape because it helps with holding down a rug in a difficult spot.  However, it's a bit of a lightweight.  That said, I have to admit that the spot in which I am using it is a high traffic area, so the rug is not being held down as strongly as I'd like it to be held.  I am not giving up on this tape, though, because it has excellent sticking qualities; it's just that it's thin.  What I plan on doing, and I think this will solve my problem very well, is that when I have to replace the layer of tape I put down, I will simply double the layer of tape and I'm sure that this will do the trick very nicely.  It does stick better to the rug than it does to the rough wooden floor that is under the rug and that is also a factor to consider.  On a smoother surface, I think this would be even better, but it's not bad, really, just a bit light for the high traffic and rough floor, but nothing that doubling it won't help, I believe.

8717	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	This device works great if you are working in the 1000+ RPM range.  I found it struggled to give good readings with slower RPMs, especially in the sub 100 RPM range. I would have expected the accuracy to be a little better in the lower range since the product description does state that it works for "0-99, 999 RPM".  However, it did allow me to get in the ballpark of where I was looking for in finding the RPM of the parts I was looking at.  One thing to note with this, if the surface you are attempting to measure is reflective at all, you'll get a lot of bad readings.  You have to find some way to eliminate the reflections so that the only reflective surface it is reading is the tape that you place on it.  This is really to be expected because of the method of measurement, but it seems important to note.  The surface doesn't have to be mirrored, I was having some issues with this on some slightly glossy plastics.  I found that a coating of baby powder often did the trick, but this might not work on all parts or with very high RPMs.  Plus, I would hesitate to dirty up some moving components like that.

Based on your feedback I believe the bottle might've opened a little during shipping. This could've caused it to be thicker and a little dry on the top.

Drill Chuck Required to hold shank: 1/4
The ad for the drill bit states: "Self-starting, no walking and center punch is not required." When I started to try to drill through the center of the bottom of the cup, there was no "self-starting," there was a lot of walking (I presume this means instead of forming a hole where the tip of the drill is applied to the metal, the tip of the drill slips all over the surface without forming a hole). So I got out the center punch, and finally, after about an hour, I was able to focus the tip of the drill bit in a little tiny pin-prick hole in the steel. After about 1/2 hour more of drilling, the hole was visible to the naked eye in a good light.

Amazon came to the rescue. I did a search for ceramic adhesive and was led to this Dap 00688 sealant. I applied the sealant to both the birdbath base and to the two  broken pieces. I was unable to clamp them in place for drying but they fit quit nicely even though not held in place. I let the repair dry for 24 hours and when I checked it out the pieces seemed quite sturdy. I set the bath portion on the base and everything looked good and the Dap held fast. Although I have been a handyman for many years this is my first experience with ceramic repair. Dap came through like a champion and everyone is happy. Almost everyone.

The graduations are small but easy to read as they are sharp, crisp, clear, molded in markings. I appreciate that they are crisp and clear since many molded-in markings can be rather indefinite.  I like the multiple scales because I am usually interested in ratios, not absolute numbers, and with all the choices you can nearly always find some combination that works.

No doubt, it is very VERY strong when wrapped and stuck to itself in particular. There is no give to it, so no stretch/cling wrapping.
7416	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love liquid electrical tape. This stuff works great. You wipe on with the self contained applicator brush and it dries quickly. The thinner the coat, the quicker it dries. After it dries, if you want a thicker coat, apply more and allow to dry. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired thickness. It is a little hard to maintain a consistent thickness throughout simply due to the nature of the compound and how quickly it dries (or starts to become tacky).

Mount your heat sink and I like the aftermarket heat sink fan assemblies or water cooled blocks as they install with screws and you can make sure that the heat sink is firm and tight with the CPU.  The factory supplied heat sinks with push pins bother me as I have seen many people swear they are tight and they are not.  You will not get ideal cooling unless you do a professional job of installing these key components and you may damage your CPU.

Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.

This polyethylene sealer is good for lots of odd jobs. You can seal ammunition cases and repair military equipment quickly, for example.
Just put a generous dab of this on, slap a small piece of scrap ABS over that, and let it cure.  Worked PERFECTLY. (e.g., my radiator doesn't leak anymore).
Spring load valve (grad and pull open) not perfect but easier to work than the plastic nonsense.

The cups are flexible so you can kind of squeeze the top to make a spout to pour stuff out of them into other containers (such as loading epoxy into hobby syringes) or if you need to smush a wider brush into the tops of them you can get that done too. Top lip is about 1 3/4 inches in diameter, but by squeezing the top to elongate the lip I was able to coax a 2 inch disposable paint brush into one well enough to load the brush with paint for touch up work.

Great for identification of small cables as well as insulating them.
There are complaints of defects, but if you get a cheap unit, its very easy to fix.  The HOT line of my unit is solid copper, while the neutral line is a black insulated wire.  The ground line uses red wire, all the wrong colors per NEMA but it works, and you don't see the wires anyway inside.  The male and female sockets are anchored security into the body, and won't pull loose.

Nice quality.  For my purposes (largely woodworking) it is perfect.  I did not check it against a gage block for accuracy, but it's as accurate as my more expensive dial calipers, and that works for me.  I like the digital readout better than a dial, since it is so much easier to read.  Even the plastic case for this unit is nice.  I recommend this product.
2383	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Mine arrived this afternoon. It only took 5 minutes to assemble. It's a bit heavier than I expected, and it does fall over. So plan on hanging it somewhere from a hook (I looped nylon cord through the wide handle hole) or prop it up in a corner somewhere. A closet? It works very well. After all it has an 8.2 amp motor. It picked up quite a lot from the kitchen floor, including smaller spilled dry dog food & food crumbs. Dust cup & filter were easy to open & clean. I didn't find it excessively noisey, after all, it's a vacuum. I only bought this for kitchen, hall, and bathroom tile, so probably won't use the power bar much. It looks great! Candy apple red and seems well made. UPDATE 1/2009: Be careful with the slider switch that holds the receptible tube in place. It can break easily. Still, I am happy with this purchase.

7417	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love liquid electrical tape. This stuff works great. You wipe on with the self contained applicator brush and it dries quickly. The thinner the coat, the quicker it dries. After it dries, if you want a thicker coat, apply more and allow to dry. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired thickness. It is a little hard to maintain a consistent thickness throughout simply due to the nature of the compound and how quickly it dries (or starts to become tacky).

4828	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I like the clear epoxies in general, but what I like about this one in particular is the longer work time. It claims 30 minutes, but I am getting 10-15 before it gets a little too viscous to work with(to be fair, I'm using it in an application where it needs to be pretty thin, so you might be okay with it thicker than I require). Regardless, that's a lot better than the 5-minute stuff when you need the extra time.

The flukes are also very pliable further assisting in not getting knotted.
Despite my lack of success with the hair dryer, the only area where I have seen Gorilla Tape fail is in moderately-high temperature applications. For example, I wanted to use the tape to patch small leaks around the exhaust hose of a new portable air conditioner. The warm air would simply soften the adhesive over time, causing it to fall off.
The new "Smart Straw" is a simple but very clever innovation that allows the WD-40 to be used in wide spray (for covering a large area or put on to a paper towel) or directed in a stream to a specific area (like into a mechanism), with just a flick of the nozzle.

Not unique to this one, I haven't seen a bottle with a better base, but it would be nice if someone would design a bottle with a slightly wider base, which would prevent it from tipping when the bottle is empty or near empty. Because the spray lever is a good chunk of the weight, and is off center, these do have a tendency to tip over on the shelf (not after they are 1/3+ full, though).

3824	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I use a surprising amount of epoxy, and JB Kwik is my default. Granted, I don't usually need the super-strength of the original product, so whatever the strength of it is, it's always held up fine for my applications. I appreciate the fast cure time so that I don't have to wait around for hours, which is why I prefer it. If you need maximum strength, use the original (which is what I do on those few occasions that it's necessary), but for most jobs, Kwik works great.

The only other thing that comes to mind is that regardless of whether you use JB Weld, another epoxy, a standard Super Glue, Gorilla Glue, or whatever, is that you want to ensure the surface is pre-treated correctly because even the best bonding agents will fail if not used properly. In most cases, this is as simple as degreasing and removing any surface material (including paint) and roughing up the core material being bonded with something such as sandpaper or a file (for example, bonding two painted pieces of carbon steel together without removing the paint will then make the paint itself a critical component on the longevity and performance of the bond, and obviously paint is not designed for that purpose and so you are left with a subpar bond that now has a weak link added that can be avoided by simply removing the paint so that the bonding agent is directly bonding the core components, which in that case would be the two pieces of steel themselves rather than any outer coating(s).)

NOTES:
I called the company and they would replace the sink free of charge (not install). I asked them if I fixed the hole in some way if it would void the lifetime warranty. They said "try it" if it doesn't work we will still cover it. That is where the J-B Weld comes in. The black color of the epoxy is almost a perfect match for the black sink. Since I've used the J-B before I know it is strong. I carefully filled the hole. Later I asked my wife if she could find the repair and it took her some time to find it. It has been about a year since the repair and it is still perfect. Unless you knew the repair was there you would not find it.
7332	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This stuff works great. I used it a few times mainly to "waterproof" and protect wires and solder joints. It covers well with a few coats and takes about a day to fully cure. So far it seems durable too.

A few pretty easy things could have been done for improved low resistance accuracy. Perhaps the easiest would have been to have one additional switch that shorted across a 0.77 ohm resistor, and marked as "1 ohm residual". A variation of this would be to have another terminal with the 0.77 ohm resistor, so if you used the "low resistance" terminals, it would start at 1 ohm plus the selected values. I'm guessing that the cost of one addition switch or terminal, and a 0.77 ohm resistor would not have made a significant price difference in the device. Still another option would have been to add 4 more switches, with 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4 resistors, which would have allowed you to connect an external ohmmeter and null out the series switch resistance, also extending the range down to about 0.25 ohms, although 4 more switches and resistors would likely cost a bit more. Still, for a few bucks more, it could have been a much more accurate device at low values.

Super-Glue (Krazy Glue):  Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast.  In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required.  Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects.  Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, and clear epoxies have become available.  Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BAZIC-Super-Glue-3-grams-0-10-ounces-6-Per-Pack/dp/B003BSF7ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per Pack</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Krazy-Glue-KG92548R-Instant-Krazy-Glue-All-Purpose-Brush-0-18-Ounce/dp/B000BQSFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Krazy Glue KG92548R Instant Krazy Glue All Purpose Brush 0.18-Ounce</a>

This is a good all purpose type of outdoor sealant. I originally got this from a big box store and have used this for a variety of uses as it works on about any surface including glass, metal, and plastics, among other things. This also works well at protecting and repairing electrical wiring and sticks to most surfaces.  Being silicone it is waterproof and is easy to apply and mold to spot you need to apply it on.  According to the instructions this is capable of extreme temperatures, -75F to 400F, although I can't say I have tested the cold extreme but I have used this on wiring that is subject to extreme heat in an engine area and it has worked well for that in addition to areas subject to the hot summer sun.  Being silicone this resists water penetration and weather pretty well.  This dries quickly and leave a good seal after.

There are two stirring schemes in common use - one is to use a small liquid pump that goes into an aquarium or fountain. Those pumps have a problem in that they won't stand up to temperatures higher than 150F or 160F.  They seem to work OK at 145 and they work great at 131. But at some temperature short of 180F, they fail because parts soften.  Bad pump, no biscuit!  I wanted something I could stir simmering water with - I was not going to stir something with body, beans or polenta or such.  Mechanical stirrers on Amazon got horrible ratings with the exception of those built into a pot.  But while you can't stir beans with a bubbler, you can stir water with a bubbler - it is the being stirred that keeps the fish alive - more water is exposed to the surface.

Note however:  This is the first time I bought-used these; and I was surprised the amount of force it took to lift the lever all the way up.  At first I thought they weren't working - or that I bought the wrong size.  The lever didn't seem to open - and only lifted up about 15 degrees; and when I pushed a wire into the bottom segment of the hole insert - it didn't catch or stay.  You need to push the lever up hard.  I thought I was going to break it.  and then - Yes - the lever opens up a full 90 degrees.  Then the wire inserts into the hole and on the top of the internal insert mechanism (not at the bottom as I thought initially).  When you close the lever - it is a very tight hold on the wire indeed.

I use it for many different things. Because this is liquid, I put it on anything I want to protect. Works perfect on bare wires. I have used it as cushioning between two objects.

Once it dries, it is nearly impossible to get it off and forms, what feels like, a soft rubber film.

6273	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	First off, I'm not a professional electrician. I'm just a DIY homeowner who'd rather spring for the proper tools than to pay a pro to do a mundane rewiring job. When I purchased this item (the Fluke 2AC Voltage Tester), I had a couple DIY tasks in mind. The first was the need to replace a pull-chain switch on a closet ceiling lamp. Since I've never had to do this in that particular closet before, I wasn't sure which breaker switch controlled the power. Because the existing switch was broken in the off position, I couldn't very well depend on the lamp to tell me whether the power was still on or not, so I moved to Plan B  a voltage tester. I didn't need all the bells and whistles the pros use. I just needed something to tell me if a wire was hot or not. This was a perfect solution. It's got the perfect level of sensitivity for a job like this. I even pre-tested it by placing the tip against an appliance power cord that I knew had current running through it, and sure enough, the device lit up as it should. That allowed me to proceed with confidence when I repaired the pull-chain switch. Worked perfectly. The closet is now as well lit as ever.

As noted elsewhere in the review, for biological exposure it is suggested to play defense and keep prolonged exposure from lower frequency Magnetic Fields to under 1-4 mG (preferably under 1-2 mG) but there is no definitive consensus as to the long term biological dangers, and where the safety lines are.

When I saw this Shop Fox caliper on Amazon, I bought it primarily because of the price.  I did not want to buy too cheap a caliper that it was not accurate, and the reviews here helped to make a decision on this one.  I also require a caliper to have fractional readings, as this is critical for woodworking.

Update: I just had a plumbing leak for my home heating system, and it was a weekend the day before I was going away for two weeks. The part that I needed was hard to find, and it would take over a week to get. A plumber and I turned off the house water to stop the leak, then we dried it, then I put this glue into the gap and sprayed it with accelerator. I then repeated this for at least 10 layers. I also saturated pink fiberglass insulation with the glue and built up layers with that, spraying accelerator each time. So far it has held and no leak.

It's easy to connect this device using a clamp screw.  To remove the device, or slip one end off a pipe, loosen one of the clamp screws and slide the pipe out; hence "union" in the name.  This feature allows removal of the sump pump for service or replacement, without cutting any pipe.

Edited to add:  If you do a lot of packing, this isn't the best dispenser because after each use of cutting the tape, the tape falls back down and sticks to the roll.  It takes a few seconds to peel it back up again for the next use and if you've got dozens of boxes to ship, those seconds will add up.

I have a solar garden light on a table in the garden, which is new.  The first one lasted a good long time, but when I went to change its rechargeable battery, I found the battery compartment full of water.  A ring of readily removable silicone seal keeps the water from the new one, and can be easily replaced when the battery needs to be changed.

9824	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	This ladle works but... The metal portion is too short to rest on the big dipper furnace without resting the wood portion on the heated surface. Love the smell of burning wood but not in this case. It is also very difficult to dip beyond about the half-way point. The metal portion is a very poor fit into the wood handle and tends to fall out. Don't I would buy this again.

7698	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.
6920	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	While you can get okay results with a wire brush, this specialty tool is definitely the right tool for the job.  I clamped it to my work bench, and cleaned about twenty files in a short amount of time.

9969	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't find anything shorter than 1.25" screws at the local big box home improvement stores.  Fortunately these were available on Amazon.

9077	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I found the bottles I got from the hospital were so useful, I went and bought my own lavette bottle.

Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.

1774	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It's super glue. What else can I say. Of all the glues you can buy it is the least forgiving in so many ways.  BUT read up a little on it's uses, get a bottle of accelerator, and you will find this is your adhesive of choice 90% of the time if you are a tinkerer.  Be very careful in cutting off the tip to the absolute smallest opening possible.  I keep a bottle of this and the super thin filler and use them constantly. Of significant importance is that this brand has a very good cap seal. The only time I have had a bottle solidify on me was when I did not snap it on all the way. Experienced SG users know what I mean. If you can remember to keep the cap snapped on this is also the cheapest way to buy SG.  If you are an occasional user you are a lot better off with one use tubes. BTW VERY strong fumes but that goes for all SG.

For the right occasion and material this glue really does the trick, I use it only for wood and only where it is useful still use plenty of white glue and epoxy just use what is the best choice for what you are doing, there is no "Universal Glue" that is a do-all.

The handle is angled away from the face of the sheet, is comfortable, and just the right length, leaving your other hand free to balance the top edge of the sheet.  I'd give it 5 stars if Stanley improved a few things just a bit: First, if they reduced the front-to-back depth of the bottom just bit and made the retention lip a bit higher, the sheet would feel a little more secure (it's not worth carrying more than 2 sheets anyway, as it becomes too hard to balance).  Second, if it could freestand a little more securely, it would be that much easier to get a sheet on the thing.  It's a pain in the neck when it falls over.  In spite of all that, it's still the sheet carrier I reach for most often.  Cheap, strong, and reliable.  Bright yellow makes it hard to lose, too.

It's pretty simple, really. You get a sample of water directly from your well (we have a tap near the wellhead, before the water is softened and filtered). I took a squeaky-clean glass jar and filled it. Most of the tests are in the form of chemically sensitive patches on strips of paper -- like litmus paper -- which are dipped in your well water, and react in the presence of heavy metals and other contaminants. (You could, of course, test your municipal tap-water as well -- it does tell you if there are unsafe levels of chlorine, which are not present in well water). And in fact, the litmus test is included -- one of the oldest ways to discover the Ph level of your water or if it is acidic, alkaline, or neutral.

The only two criticisms are, that I really prefer nylon tape for real strength; but with that said this tape was too tough for a packing tape holder/cutter I had, yet it cuts easily with scissors.

Bottom line, you get what you pay for. We bought this to replace the radio flyer piece of junk that would only tip over. This "trike" is so much better with a nice wide and stable wheelbase. Just don't overpay for it. Like I said, check around including Sam's and Walmart.

I now have detailed experience with the drawer slides (see reassembly comments above).

The "quick minute" button allows you to place food in the microwave, press this button once, then hit start.  Also nice feature- while it is cooking, let's say that you realize the cheese is not melting, so you need to add more time.  You could wait for the timer to run out and then restart then oven for another minute. But you also can hit the "quick minute" while it is cooking and it adds one minute to the running cook time.

Super-Glue (Krazy Glue):  Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast.  In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required.  Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects.  Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, and clear epoxies have become available.  Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tightly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BAZIC-Super-Glue-3-grams-0-10-ounces-6-Per-Pack/dp/B003BSF7ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per Pack</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Krazy-Glue-KG92548R-Instant-Krazy-Glue-All-Purpose-Brush-0-18-Ounce/dp/B000BQSFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Krazy Glue KG92548R Instant Krazy Glue All Purpose Brush 0.18-Ounce</a>

450	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Last year, I purchased a #2-plain General grommet-repair kit from Amazon to compare it with the equivalent Lord & Hodge kits.  The contrast was remarkable!  The Lord & Hodge sets were domestically-manufactured and met all of my expectations.  The General set, in contrast, was cobbled together in India and was garbage.  A couple of the grommets were pitted on the margins, and one of the male components was bent.  Two more set imperfectly and had to be removed, a problem which I haven't encountered elsewhere.  I finally got around to weighing the respective grommets and found the General submission to be roughly 30% underweight.  Brass foil.  Although the first commentaries could be considered somewhat subjective, the weight differential isn't.  Additionally, I strongly suspect the setting tools are inferior to L&H's, a rough brinell test having indicated that the anvil material is softer.

I bought this Unibit to drill 15/32 inch holes in steel sheet metal for mounting toggle switches .  This Irwin bit quickly cuts clean holes, with no burrs on either side of the hole.  Amazing !

Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).

I selected this tubing, even though it was more expensive than other tubing, because it was food safe and rated for temperatures well higher than boiling.  Nothing else came close - but I would have bought 1 meter if I could have.  Or a half meter would have been enough.  It is not cheap, but I didn't allow price to affect my rating, I knew what it cost when I bought it.
I needed this close quarter street ell for a specific application where there was restricted access. It looked like it would fit, and it did. The finish on the fitting is good and the threads are within specification for NPT. I have purchased several fittings this year where the NPT specification was NOT held, but NEVER an Anderson fitting. They always seem to line up and tighten down exactly like they should. This is a "barstock" fitting which means it is machine cut from bar stock... not cast as a fitting. I like fittings like this. They are stronger and easier to hold with tools.
1488	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	They're pricey for spray bottles but they're great. They have different settings, you can shoot a stream of water or spray a fine mist. All 3 have a purpose in my household. 1 is used for a vinegar/water cleaner mostly for the kitchen counters. Then other is kept in the bathroom with a vinegar/soap/water solution.

Granted the shorter the tubing, the closer you are to the source and the better the sound.  However, 22inches is just TOO short.  Sometimes its nice to have a little distance between you and your patient (you know the ones I mean).  Also with the 27" you don't have to completely lean over the bed to find the heart (remember we exam from the right and the heart is on the left).  Consider also Intensive Care Units with intubated patients and lines everywhere, navigating that jungle of wires and whatnots it helps to have the extra slack.  Those 5" are VERY important.  Having owned both the short and long ones, I can say I didn't hear much sound improvement, I just felt awkward with the short.

9190	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I like these Wago 222-413 LEVER-NUTS 3 Conductor Compact Connectors 50 PK, and I have worked in the electrical maintenance field for much of my life's work and have done all of my own electrical work where I live.  These are not as hefty as the use of a wire nut seems to be more permanent, as I use them, with the solid wires twisted and secured, though this requires effort to remove and replace them.  Will they last, deteriorate or degrade?  Only time will tell.  They won't be around long in the marketplace if this comes to be, but for now they are a handy connector for use in 120 vac use and for wiring in the home.  I will use them for a while and if I feel they do not perform, I will revisit my review here and give the reasons why and lower the star rating I have given it.  If they outperform my expectations, I will also revisit and make changes that show the better performance.  For now, they are functional to make 120vac connections for the home and can be removed and reused.  They hold the wire tightly and securely and should provide a good connection for electrical use around the home.  We'll see.
better choice.  For joining metal "J&B Weld" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick).  Some are packaged in a dual-syringe---but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.  Previously, a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored (usually white)---but now clear epoxies are available.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/J-B-Weld-8265-S-Cold-Weld/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">J-B Weld 8265-S Cold Weld</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CLEARBOND-H-3S-Clear-Strong-Epoxy-Adhesive-Syringe-85oz/dp/B001J9J6VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85oz</a>

If there is a down-side, it is in the casting, boring process where the center hole can end up slightly misaligned with the HEX head. I don't find this to be a problem, but I am NOT using these fittings for a purpose that requires great aesthetic value. Another question that arises is the "value" of the fitting related to its price. I have come to the conclusion that this is something to be determined by each user. I find these fittings to be somewhat expensive. Probably more so than necessary. However, they are no more expensive than any others and less expensive than some. So.... "Value" is determined by individual perception....

The disappointment was my fault though, as I thought I had ordered a 3MT, upon rechecking my order, I found the mistake (on my part).  Having screwed up, I chose to keep it because the spinning head is actually solid, and rolling on what seem to be really high quality bearings.  It was a simple matter to get a sleeve for the 2MT shaft that adapts it to 3MT.  I have used it a couple times now and I am pleased with it, especially at such a cheap price.

It works just fine for testing my watering solution in my hydroponics garden.  Readings are very accurate (I'd have to guess within 2% most (90%) of the time (when tested with a more expensive laboratory model--I've worked in a chem lab for 40 years).  You have to keep it wet  or wet it for a few minutes before use, and the calibration MUST be checked often.....that's just the way it is with these types of meters. The TDS meters I use in the chem lab cost hundreds of dollars, are just a little more accurate, just as fragile, and require calibration often.
3M makes the good stuff.  Sticks much better than other brands, and is very pliable and durable.  I've never had it come undone.

IF you get the black material anywhere you don't want it, it is a mess and hard to get off! I've found that you can clean it up right away with acetone (available at most hardware stores). If it dries, the only way to get it off is abrasion (I use a wire wheel on a drill). Also, since this it plugs up the applicator tube, you can considered it "single use." I like to have enough filling to do so that I use the entire can. However, if that's not possible, you can try cutting the end of the tube applicator oof -- about an inch.

As someone who has used over 30 types of tape both around the house, in a home workshop and in research laboratory, I have learned to appreciate access to the right tool (or tape) for the task at hand.  What I especially like about this particular tape is that its flexibility allows for conformation to curved surfaces.  Even when the particular application doesn't require its high tensile strength, it performs better in most applications than alternatives such as duct tape or Gorilla tape.  Moreover, the Scotch adhesive isn't as gummy as those products, so cleanup is less labor intensive.

I've used GG (and other brands of the same type of glue - which, incidentally, seem to be identical to the point that I don't really have a preference) for countless things over the years:  I repaired the broken frame of a Nordictrack skier that developed a crack (I glued the crack and clampled it, as well as glueing and screwing a piece of wood to the side, along the crack and a few inches beyond on either side), put a kickboard on the screen door of our front door which is starting to deteriorate at the lower corner, built a small playhouse ladder, and about a million other things I can't recall.
Paint it on exposed bolt threads once you've got a nut threaded on. It'll hold the nut in place and add some weather resistance to the fasteners. Still able to disassemble the parts if needed a day later or a decade later. Just cut or wire brush the black rubbery stuff off.

Certainly not as smooth as my "older" B&S caliper, but in this price range I didn't expect that. I am hopeful that this caliper will hold up reasonably well it seems to be "not too shabby" and I am pleased with it so far. November 16,2014 update. I have to downgrade this caliper to two stars, Initially I was pleased but recently they started sticking when trying to open them from the zero position.

Because this is a use-specific product, this and other brands of duct tape are NOT made for packing carboard boxes...use packing tape instead! Packing tape is made to stretch before it tears. Packing tape is made to be cut by a knife or scissors; and packing tape is made to stick to cardboard. If you use Gorilla tape or another brand for packaging, the tape will eventually tear at the edges of the cardboard box (where there is motion), so don't use any duct tape for packaging...duct tape is not designed to perform like packing tape. Also, duct tape is not designed to be used as painters' masking tape....with Gorilla tape's extra adhesive, it would be a disaster when you peel it off and find out you took pieces of drywall or plaster with it! Duct tape is not masking tape, so don't expect it to perform like masking tape.

3185	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I had my hesitation about using this but it was recommenced by a friend. My Miata (1997) soft tops glass window separated at the bottom driver side. Water was getting in and I wanted to seal it. After purchasing this I made a little line around the open section and let it dry for 24 hours. After opening and closing the top several times it separated again. YIKES! After a little research I decided I didn't put enough. A small strip was not going to cut it. After cleaning the opening, peeling the old seal, and this silicon seal, I filled the opening all in the seal and pinched it together with two strong magnets (2 sets). Waited 24 hours and ran with that. It has been a while now, Texas HEAT, and lately Texas downfall of rain and it still has not separated. I have opened the top maybe 20 times and i'm still good. Happy with this product for the purpose that I used it for.

We've all been told in medical school not to use the head of the scope as a reflex hammer, but the people who said this probably didn't own a master cardiology.  Its a subtle difference but the Master Cardiology has a much thicker head profile (about 5mm) than the Cardiology III (about 2mm).  That means alot for patient comfort when using it to check reflexes.  I've actually gotten quite good a eliciting them with my master.  The Cardiology III is just too thin and can be very painful to patients to be hit with (try it for yourself!)  The master is a different story.  I say go ahead!
8681	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to hold a scrap piece of carpet in place in front of our woodstove. We have low-pile, indoor/outdoor carpet in our basement, and had a piece left over. We use that scrap in front of the wood-stove in case an ember falls out while loading. The scrap piece always shifted. Tried some 3M cushiony-type carpet tape that only had adhesive on one side, and that didn't stick to back of scrap, or keep it from shifting. The Intertape 9970 tape IS adhesive on both sides, and DOES keep it from shifting. Works perfectly.

The bit has a hex shank for positive slip-free use in standard drill chucks. This #2 bit also fits in standard 1/4 drill drivers, impact drivers, etc. At the time of this review, the amazon description states they have a 3 flatted shank which is not accurate - mine has a six sided shank, also known as a hex shank.
So in a week, my hole has increased to 1/4", and I hope that today I will break through to 3/8." Since the diameters of the holes are in layers on the drill bit, I am hoping that although one diameter may wear out the sharpness of the drill bit, I have proven, with the first 1/4" layer, that after a lot of work it can "break through," then I will start on the next diameter where the drill bit sharpness is brand-new. (Pretty sad that I have this sort of time, but that's another story.)

Often the need arises to measure something down to the tenth of a millimeter or so. Decided to give this Neiko caliper a try and very happy I did. Measuring items in my lab at the university with much more expensive equipment yields the exact same answer as the Neiko. For the money, this is a great little caliper which is easy to turn on and off and easy to set from metric to English units. It also uses a very popular watch battery size that is easy to find at Target or Walmart. I suspect I will have this for years to come. Very happy customer! Five stars.

These are not very absorbent; they work well for cleaning a surface, but don't expect them to soak in a bunch of liquid for you.  And they are permeable so you still need to wear gloves, but for a tough wipe that won't leave residue, these are a great choice.

Useful tip:  Drain the water out after use, and screw the ends together, loosely, to keep dirt and critters out of the hose.  Loosely connecting the ends allows the hose to balance pressure and vacuum differences due to temperature fluctuations.

Check out the videos on You Tube that show how to best use these tools. On 100% open lines you connect the tone generator to TWO conductors and trace the line. When you think you have found the far end you short the two conductors together there and the tone changes. If the tone doesn't change you have the wrong pair. Because of the signal splash-over this is important to know. This is essential in tracing lines in bundles as the splash factor would otherwise drive you crazy.

The attachment is a friction fit, without threading, so care is needed to prevent pulling the probe out of the TP88.  I use these tips with a set of TP175E probes, and they work great for hitting fine traces on circuit boards and for probing connector shells.  If your boards are conformal coated, this will go right through the coating to give a good reading.
3972	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this just to have around as an alternative to urethane glues and PVA glues. Sometimes you just need to bond something quickly, and instant superglue is too difficult to use. THis gives you just enough set time (15-30 seconds) to shfit your part around and then hold it while it sets. I have used this all around the house and on a variety of things in the garage. It's a little pricey, sure, but it's lasting a long long long long time.

I've had a few times where when I close it that it says it's still open to 0.15 mm but after a second it goes to zero.  Overall as a hobby and not a precision hobby/job I think these things are perfect for the cost. I don't need to be super accurate just to a working range and I suspect that's what most people buying tools on amazon are doing as well.

2829	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this thermal grease to fix my YLOD (yellow light of death) on my 1st Gen PlayStation 3.  A buddy mine recommended that I try this Arctic Silver thermal grease.  This grease is awesome!  I was expecting it to be more like a thick liquid, but it was really thick and easy to apply.  I have seen videos online of how to fix PS3's, and most of them use a much thinner grease that is harder and messier to apply.  I just put a dime-sized ball in the center of the chips, and pressed the heat sinks back on.  Just to make sure that I was doing it right, I removed the heat sink.  The Arctic Silver had flowed perfectly and evenly from the center and was razor thin with absolutely no air bubbles.


I've used it for a couple of other, much lighter duty repairs, too, and it's been great.  Yes, it smells - I'm sure all epoxy smells.  The two compounds are in the tube, squished together side by side.  This can make it difficult, if not impossible, to make sure you're getting equal amounts of the two. This may not be a huge deal, I don't know, but it's a bit sloppy to work with.

Last but not least it is pretty strong. I used it to glue difficult plastic and wooden surface, where there is no proper overlapping areas and the connection is through a rough tiny area, but it really held well almost instantly and after a day it was as if it never broke. Be careful not to touch it with your fingers since not only it does not go off easily but also you may touch other parts of the object you are gluing and that may leave a nasty smear behind.
Make sure you clean the surface before apply the tape for a good and durable bond, simple common sense.

(25.8mL) (UPC Code: 0 75611 35120 9), and yes, it may be hard to find, as kids used to get high (and sick) from sniffing the fumes from it in a paper bag.  Most model cements nowadays are safer to use, but do not stick as well.  The old stuff would literally melt the plastic pieces being glued together.  At this point, I am beyond putting together plastic models, but I find that the Testors glue is one of the best for plastics, and today, just about everything is made from one type of plastic or another.

You will need to keep the plastic bushings lubricated if you are going to load this up heavily (I routinely exceed the weight rating and sometimes have to give it a nudge to get it started but then it keeps on turning on its own).  I use silicone lube putting a drop on the spinning shaft next to the bushing (the ones that mount in the frame NOT the ones that the drum sits on) and it is pulled into the bushing.

Our sump pumps were installed with a check valve within the sump basin, since the discharge level was less than a foot above the sump basin.  When the pump shuts off, if you don't have a check valve, all water still in your exit pipe that's higher than the pump will flow back into the basin.  Otherwise, the only water that will flow backward into the basin is the small volume of water between the pump and the check valve.  In addition, a check valve prevents mice, insects, etc. that crawled in through your exit pipe, from making it all the way to your sump pump.  When the water comes on, critters should be washed away.

Highly recommend some oil or other lube on the wheel axle and also the swivel bearings right away.  It appears as if these are pretty far down the ladder as far as the price scale, so I must assume they would be for economy and not super high quality or durability.  Will update after some use and observation if needed.

6798	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I wanted to learn to take my blood pressure, but when I tried using this stethoscope I could not hear anything, even right over my heart. I figured it was user error. But then I came here and I see that many others have had the same problem. This stethoscope seems to work when I tap on the diaphragm, or use it on a mechanical watch, but not for a heartbeat. My wife had the same problem. The earpieces are also very uncomfortable.

Note: There are several extremely similar versions of this product. I bought these locally at Lowes to guarantee a fresh product, so it may not be exactly the same one. I'm reviewing GE Silicone II, non-paintable, both white and clear. The white version says '30 min rain-ready', the clear might have been 3 hour, and one of the clear tubes I used said kitchen & bathroom on it. As far as I can tell they're all pretty much the same (obviously the white has a much different appearance).

Note: This glue will not stick to plastics very well, so for that, I use the old style Testors Cement For Plastic Models, No. 3512, 7/8 fl. oz. (25.8mL) (UPC Code: 0 75611 35120 9), and yes, it may be hard to find, as kids used to get high (and sick) from sniffing the fumes from it in a paper bag. Most model cements nowadays are safer to use, but do not stick as well. The old stuff would literally melt the plastic pieces being glued together. At this point, I am beyond putting together plastic models, but I find that the Testors glue is one of the best for plastics, and today, just about everything is made from one type of plastic or another.

I have not tried them with the more aggressive solvents like acetone or lacquer thinners, but the mini plastic "water cooler" cups I was using previously dissolved in the solvents of my alkyd paint ("oil" based house paint) in about 30 minutes, and the paper version just turned to mush in about 10 minutes. Alkyd paint solvents are mostly mineral spirits and/or naphtha.  These cups do not suffer that fate.  ** update: I have since tried both acetone and lacquer thinner in them with no problem. Overnight might be an issue, but for the 1/2 hour or so I'm working with them they are fine with these solvents showing no sign of degradation. **

Brush it on some any-color wire and it becomes a BLK wire. I used it specifically for separated RED/BLK zip cord.

The epoxy holds up very well, I don't have any scratches through the color but I do have many light scuffs to the clear top coat from abuse and using my garage as a garage, in the right light you can see the scuffs but the floor still looks great.  If you do a lot of grinding or welding this product probably isn't the best option for you.  I do a little welding, cutting and grinding here and there.  The hot sparks tend to 'melt' into the floor but the scattering of color chips hides this nicely.  Sweeps up very easy, way better than bear concrete.

I have used about every type out there and always come back to this whenever I need a quality tape job that is exposed to anything like under the hood or outdoors. I have used those less expensive bulk brands because I tend to cheap out at times and I usually end up regretting it unless Im using it for something I don't care about like holding some wires together in an enclosed box. Those cheaper tapes will not hold anything for long when exposed to heat, oils, sunlight and/or cold. I wrapped some connections  in my engine compartment with this because the tape that was already there was a gooey mess and not holding anything together as it should this tape looks as good a year later as it did the day I put it on. Its pricey but well worth it if you want to tape something thatll hold. I noticed that when the power company connected my new 200-amp service they used this tape to wrap the connections for the service entrance and its holding fine in blistering desert summer heat and sub-zero winter cold.

I've already used it a lot the 1st day since it arrived.  It opens and closes to a good zero range.  It should be zeroed after each measurement.  For accuracy more detailed than hundredths of an inch you should be buying a more expensive unit.  This one was cheap but met my needs.  It also comes with a solid plastic carrying case and an extra battery.  Be sure you are hitting the off button when you are done measuring rather than waiting for it to do so automatically and you'll save battery life.

Cons: The center of gravity isn't to low, and combined with "The pedal always free spin backward regardless of the locking position" makes it impossible for the kid to control the speed, using pedals, to slow down, going down through inclined sidewalks.

Like many items used for water, you should clean the battery compartment O ring and its sealing surfaces thoroughly before resealing it.  The head usually has toothpaste on it that is abrasive and gritty and will break the O ring seal if not washed clean out. All a user need do is during a battery change, use an old manual toothbrush to brush clean the open end cap until its clean of all debris.  Wash the O ring with soap and water.  Let both air dry to avoid getting lint on the cap or ring. Use a clean finger to wipe clean the interior battery compartment to insure its clean or clear of residual toothpaste, as this is the other half of the sealing surface that contacts the O ring.

The first was for multiple joints on a flimsy Ikea Malm chest of drawers.  The second project was the reattachment of a shoe sole. Both projects were successful. However, the significant expansion of this polyurethane adhesive caused quite a mess.  This degree of expansion (~4X), while beneficial in many regards, is something every user should anticipate.  As an experiment, I also tried Gorilla Glue on third item - a plastic handle of a pair of scissors. This was a failure as the glue didn't hold for more than a few uses.

It's also cheaper than my Littmann, so I won't be too sad if it 'grows legs'. The Prestige Clinical I is a traditional diaphragm/bell setup - none of this 'press firmly to hear higher-pitched noises', etc. As I said, it is just a matter of preference, but I want to keep the instruments simple while I learn to listen for what I need to hear. But I'm off topic...
One note- the rubber on this hose seems to be 'stickier' than the original Katadyn hoses, so it seems to be a magnet for any bit of dirt or lint. Not a big deal, but it's annoying. This hose also appears quite a bit whiter than the Katadyn hose, which is fine (makes it easier to tell the hoses apart).

Goop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.
Thinking of a digital caliper for use around the house - go for this one, I doubt you will be disappointed.

8338	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Worked perfectly for my project. I needed a flat piece of steel I could use as an anvil for restore a knife sheath where the original "easy rivets" had decayed. I went with post and burr rivets and needed something long, hard and narrow as a stable platform to set the burr and peen the post stub. Worked like a charm. I beveled the edges of the bar so it wouldn't cut the leather, the sheath and bar rested on a bench block. I started with a 2lb baby sledge, later got a rivet peening hammer. I ran the bar into the sheath so I could attach the flap of the belt loop back into the back of the sheath.

2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is "repositionable" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or "reposition" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.
3028	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Excellent for the use to which I applied them - clamps on a 2.5 ft tank.

I finally got it mixed, but it did not harden very well either.  Loctite usually makes a good product, so I think maybe this was just kept on the shelf too long.

3367	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This stuff is dangerous. If you get any on your hands you will have to remove skin to get it off, to me it's not worth the continued risk so I threw mine away after the first (unfortunate) experience with it. The black stains over my hands, which no solvent would remove, even after 30 minutes of scrubbing, will have to wear off, I hope. But there should be a very clear warning about this included with each purchase, not to do so is irresponsible.

2003	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	A line splitter is a essential piece of gear for anyone interested in how much power a appliance is drawing. They allow you to measure power consumption and voltage while shielding you from the 120VAC line voltage. This unit has two square holes for use with a clamp-on amp-meter.  One hole is for measuring the current as-is (i.e. 1x), while the other hole has the hot wire looped around it 10x inside, allowing you to make more sensitive measurements with the current clamp.
My pump flow is rated @ 75GPM @ 10ft lift, and the check valve flapper only opens partially, so I suspect this valve is causing some amount of pressure drop which will reduce flow (my installed lift height is about 10 feet.)  I intend to measure pressure before and after the valve to quantify the drop and will post the data when I get a chance.  There are other "full flow" check valves on the market that do not have a return spring on the flapper.  These will suffer from water hammer, but I suspect their pressure drop is very minimal.  I opted to get this one due to the clear housing and silent operation.  Hopefully my test results show minimal pressure drop...

2268	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I've used this over the past few years and many items have now come apart. The glue seems to get brittle and break. It also bubbles up to yellow/orange tint which is annoying. I guess if your using the glue to seal 2 pieces of carpet together or something that will be walked on, it works fine. But for items you intend on handling it's a joke. And I've followed the directions so don't suggest this. I now use E6000 glue.

1883	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	These are almost what I expected. They are a little thinner than I anticipated, though. I can exert more than the 30lbs max load listed, and the clasp did not slip. It will be OK for the intended use: tying light bundles of 2x4 or similar to throw in the vehicle. Given my experience in lashings for Class IV whitewater, These will do OK for a small bundle of customer drybags. Anything more and I'd recommend a heavier strap.
3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. DO NOT USE TOO MUCH! If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the CPU locking mechanism, your hands, etc... It makes a real mess. Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.

6140	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Seems like a good product- threading is correct and it sealed well, but it doesn't actually act as a check valve. When I received it, I tested it just by blowing through it and you can blow air through both directions. I tried cleaning it which still didn't help. I installed it anyway thinking maybe it will seal low pressure water better than air, but unfortunately it didn't function as I expected.

I have an Intel I5 760 Quadcore processor with the stock intel heat sink.  With the RS silicone base, I was getting CPU temps of 99C at 100% load! This is the core max temp and is obviously not good for the processor. I achieved this max temp within 30 seconds of running Prime95 torture test and within about 1 minute of running a heavy TIF file export out of Lightroom3. I needed a different solution. I tried dismounting the heatsink, reapplying the RS compound - same deal. (I applied properly with a thin layer, evenly spread).  All to no avail.

Another trick I use Gorilla Glue for is cutting in holes in lath and plaster ceilings without destroying the plaster around the hole. If there is access from above I build a frame the size of the hole using 1/2 x 2" stock then clean up the back of the lath and plaster carefully removing the plaster keys to give a good surface to glue to only in the exact spot of the frame so as not destroy the plaster keys that hold the plaster to the lath.  Then I glue down the frame in the attic in the exact location of the hole using gobs of gorilla glue on each lath to insure plenty of area of the frame bonded to the laths.  Place some weight on the frame so it will bond, Once cured, carefully saw the hole from below(I use a DeWalt cordless jig saw as it has variable speed and cut as slowly as possible so as not to cause wild vibrations that can literally bring the house down on you, well the ceiling anyway)and the surrounding plaster remains totally supported by the laths that are bonded to the frame, the ceiling feels totally solid no give like when you have unsupported laths.

2809	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I use Artic Silver for all of my home custom builds, most recently on a budget build a couple weeks ago, as this is better than the standard stuff included with the CPUS that you get.  All you need is  a thin layer on the CPU and you will be set.  This keeps the CPU heat dissipated and I have never had any failure using it.  Usually around 5 bucks is the standard price for this.
My only disappointment so far is that all my time travel experiments have failed, but I'm working on it.

2249	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have been using different versions of this type of product for many years. This is a urethane based adhesive. There are several of them available on the market today, and this is the best known of the bunch. That doesn't mean it is any better than the others, but certainly not any worse either. When you make this purchase you are faced with the question of how large of a bottle to purchase. I would recommend that you think carefully about this. For most wood applications, it doesn't take a lot of this glue to do the job. Here is an example... I had to completely refit and glue up a set of eight (8) dining room chairs. All of the original glue joints were working loose. The original glue used was one of the standard white or yellow "carpenter's" glues. They worked well for more than ten years, but eventually failed due to rocking motions and sliding them across the floor. I completely refit and glued up all eight of those chairs with this one 4 ounce bottle. So, only choose the larger bottles if you have large projects or you are "sloppy" or "over generous" with your application rates (Incidentally...more is NOT better..!!).

Bottom:
It would be nice if a version of Gorilla Tape had nylon filaments, similar to strapping tape. While strong, Gorilla Tape does not have the tensile strength provided by such reinforcing fibers. This feature would then allow Gorilla Tape to be employed in a number of other applications where it could serve as a structural element instead of merely a bonding medium.
When I apply it I use it sparingly as you only need a very thin layer. I use a razor blades edge to smooth it very thin and even. No air pockets at all, and no exposed cpu should show. Then you tighten down the cooler and BOOM! your done.....
Disadvantages to silicone is it has a very strong vinegar smell while curing, it is not water soluble so it's harder to clean up, and paint doesn't stick to it as well as latex. If you are sealing around something that doesn't see a lot of heat extremes and moisture, and/or needs to be painted, you may prefer latex. Because it isn't very paint-able, silicone is available in several colors.

8469	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	There is a lot of tubing - 40', and in a variety of sizes. However, the sizes indicated are a little misleading in reference to standard cylinder/pipe/tube sizing. I knew this would be thin wall, and aware of its shrink ratio, but I needed a one inch tubing. I figured I would just stock the rest for other projects. The 1"  and other sizes the description refers to is actually half of the circumference (pressed flat and measured across the width- it is not a 1" diameter measurement, it is actually less than 7/8" in diameter.  So I did find some other tubing with a true as described 1" diameter. Now I have a bit more to stock for another project. And chalk these up as knowledge learned. They do work properly and at a fair price at .30 a foot. Just be aware of the non-standard size if it is essential.

All resistance substitution boxes with switches will have some intrinsic switch resistance and since we don't have negative resistors, some strategy to account for this error is appropriate. Comparing this device to the much more expensive device like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/IET-LABS-RS-201-RESISTANCE-DECADE-BOX-0-TO-9999999-OHM/dp/B00HPLQ9HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">IET LABS RS-201 RESISTANCE DECADE BOX, 0 TO 9999999 OHM</a>, if you read the spec sheet it says the "residual" resistance is <= 0.39 ohms (<= 0.056 ohm per decade). These more expensive devices look like they use a rotary switch per decade, so 7 decades is only 7 switches, vs the 28 switches in this device. If the switch resistance on those expensive devices is similar, then 1 ohm + 0.06 ohm switch resistance is still 6% off, for that other device that costs almost 10x as much. For less than the difference in price between this device, and the IET device, you can buy a Kelvin probe capable LCR meter, and build real Kelvin probes, and buy six 4.7 ohm resistors to compensate for the switch resistance for low resistances. Don't get me wrong, IET makes great products (like they sell my LCR meter).
This glue saved me. In life you come across small things that work their way your heart for how well they help you or serve a purpose. Your uses and millage of course may vary. Good luck always.
My favorite feature so far is the "sensor reheat" - I've reheated pizza, frozen precooked kolaches, TV dinners, regular reheated foods and all of it has turned out fantastic. I was amazed at the temperature of the pizza without getting that tough chewy crust you normally get when reheating pizza.

Cons: Mine arrived with a low battery (Measured at 1.2v. Normally 1.5v) and display was dim. I presume that this is because of the auto-wake feature (it turns on automatically when you move it away from 0mm). I guess it was on during shipping/storage, but overall it is a nice feature.

Ali Julia review
6451	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This digital caliper is the worst I've ever owned or used.  The numerals are not uniform in size with the first being larger followed by 3 more which are much smaller.  It is thus hard to read and not convenient.  This, in my judgment, is a substandard unit and I'd never buy it again.  In fact I'd really like to return it for a refund and for the first time ever I'd state without equivocation.....DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.
2251	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Old faithful product that I continue to use.  Use as directed and it works just like the commercial less the helping Gorilla.
4147	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This item is an accident waiting to happen.  When holding plywood as demonstrated the plywood frequently slips out of the gripper and heads directly for your toes.  If you are not wearing steel toed shoes this could cause a bad injury.  I can't help giving this item one star because the ratings don't go low enough to do otherwise.  It is well made and structurally strong but the physics of this method of carrying plywood just makes this device impossible to use safely.
9944	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Great product

This coupling isn't really a sawed-off pipe section; it's a molded piece with good dimensional tolerances and finished edges. It is an external coupling, so it grips the hose ends around their exteriors, and uses a good friction fit to hold them together. Since it couples externally, it doesn't act to decrease the vacuum hose diameter at the point of connection.

It does the job and works as advertised.  However, if you put your cans at the curb, then you will have to pick this up and carry it back up the drive way.  It rolls very easily, and can move in all sorts of directions.  It doesn't move so easily without the cans as it is low to the ground, so when you leave the cans at the curb, your only option is to pick it up, or hunch over and push it folded.

1687	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I have purchased four or five of these containers. EVERY one of them has gone hard and dry in spite of properly sealing the container after use. I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement. They refused. They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers. The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement. Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge. The manufacturer also told me that the container is a "TEMPORARY CONTAINER" !!! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container! It is a little too late for that now it appears. I'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day. It works fine when the can is first opened.

3225	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This Subco uses a Positive Temperature Coefficient Relay (as stated on their website) not a Potential Relay.  Not Good!  Only use Hard Start Kits that use a true Potential Relay. The RectorSeal Kickstart (2 wire) and the 5-2-1 Compressor Saver (3 wire) hard start kits use a Potential Relay. I recommend the Kickstart (it uses 2 wires that connect to the Run Capacitor - HERM and COM). But the Compressor Saver is also good (3 wires with one connecting to the common / ground on the Contactor relay). They both work the same way - the Potential Relay detects the pickup voltage (back EMF). This causes the relay to disconnect the start capacitor when the compressor reaches about 75% speed (usually less than a second).  Note:  Supco does have hard start kits with a Mechanical Potential Relay (Models 3W1, 3W2, & 3W3).

It is very forgiving during application. I mistakenly was in the habit of thinking glue is always quick-drying when mixed from two components, so when I started using this, I thought I had to rush. Wrong. The thing to remember when use this epoxy is to take your time and concentrate on application after mixing, because it gives you the time to do so.

The turbo defrost works really well.  You select type of meat, weight and load food into the microwave and hit start.  It follows a programmed power setting that starts off high, then reduces, and beeps to remind you to turn (or flip over) the food item abouth 1/2 way if you choose to do so.

Other reviews say this is to small for their shop or can't pick up chips or dibres. Well.... you can paint a house with a sash brush. It just takes a very long time. Same with this vac.

The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.

Less torque required. With wider diameter holes, a standard drill bit is engaging the entire diameter of the material at once. Whereas a step drill engages a fraction of that. This results in easier drilling, and less torque on ones wrists and hands. The workpiece is also less likely to be torn out of your hand when your grip is not firm enough.

Also, the cost of this tape is CRAZY EXPENSIVE.  No only look at the cost, and the number of rolls. . .but also how much is on the roll.  It's usually a MUCH better value to purchase 100+ yards on a roll as opposed to 54-yards.

9421	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I have been using a lot of NPT brass fittings recently. After some experimentation, I have settled on using Anderson fittings whenever possible. I purchased several of these in three different sizes and all functioned perfectly. That is not to say that the finish was perfect (it was not..) or that the casting was perfectly centered (it was not..). However, the fitting threads were well machined and were well within specification for NPT. I have had many fittings over the past year that failed miserably because the threads were not cut to specification. Some were difficult to start, others were undersized to the point they would not tighten leak-free. These Anderson fittings do not have those problems.
Worked like a charm. Seemed to be a quality part and we had no trouble installing it.  Fixture is working and instead of paying $30 bucks for a new fixture I paid less than $7.

I`ve had Sharp,Oster and Panasonic in the past and Panasonic was the best. This new one the key pad was harder to use in that you had to press hard on the number buttons. The display was harder to see as it was yellow and so was the back light. The ones b4 were much easier to see the display and had nicer buttons. I`ve had Emerson,Oster,Gold Star and Sharp. Panasonic has always been the best. Going to another brand. And yes-they have bad ones also. This  wouldn`t cook more than 3 minutes when it was working. It smelled like burning electricity.

THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT FLAW, THIS IS A HUMAN FACTORS ALERT ON HOW TO PROPERLY USE. While these affixed items aren't going to fall on their own there is the possibility that when you go to pick it up (say to dust it off)  and it resists (like you should expect), and so you grab it again redoubling your tug. It's at this point, when you apply more force, that it will suddenly release, it's not a gradual stretchy kind of letting go, it's a let go all at once kind of release. So long as you expect that it's not a problem, but if you're not prepared that sudden release could cause you to fumble the proverbial football. So, grab it firmly knowing you are going to apply a steady motion of increasing force and that it's going to release all at once. Note: How this handles is likely to be subject to climate (head,humidity, cold, surface conditions on piece and on shelf, etc). Warn others that go to handle your valuable collectibles.
In this little jar you get at least 100 little strips of paper that are ready to test the pH of something. It also came with this little piece of paper that you see in the picture. The paper has about 14 different pH levels that you can compare the paper to so that you can get an accurate idea of the pH you are measuring.

440	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Well for the price, but better on thicker material. Like other customers, they recommended going slow when using the cutter as well as "crimping" the grommets with a hammer, utilizing General Tools grommet kit. Installing these grommets on polyester shade material, the grommets cut through, but "installed" reinforced packaging tape on both sides, with the tool cutting a perfect hole. The tape worked very well. Used inside a green house so not worried about corrosion or heavy duty strength, very little weight applied on these grommets with no wind.

1281	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I have recently had workmen tromping through my house doing some fix-it stuff, and my light beige carpeting was pretty dirty. This Hoover carpet cleaner is pretty easy to assemble and, since I own a smaller Hoover carpet cleaner, I had no problem at all figuring out how to use it. The dual water tanks hold about a gallon each, so, depending upon how dirty your carpet is and how large your rooms are, you can get a lot of cleaning done before emptying and refilling. The best thing about this particular unit is the agitator brush rollers, which I set on "high" to get the dirt out. This cleaner works admirably and has a wide cleaning profile to get your carpets cleaned fast. My carpets were left nice and clean and the nap, which had been crushed down, seems a bit higher. This is a large, heavy cleaner, so if you are older or don't have much strength, you might have a problem with it. Storage is another consideration. I don't know if it does a "commercial" job on carpets (it only partially removed old, ground-in stains) but it cleans nicely and leaves carpets fresh.

5616	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought my first Carter fuel pump in 1990. About 1996 I bought a new one and I am using the old one as a spare as I go Jeep'n in the back country. The power should connect thru the oil pressure switch so in case of accident or rollover it will stop pumping gas. There are also after market devices that will turn the pump on for a few seconds to pump gas to carburetor as soon as you turn on switch. Because the pump pulls fuel thru the fuel filter (filter a must), the fuel filter needs to be replaced about twice as often as the one mounted after the old mechanical pump. As the mechanical pump causes vapor lock it needs to be bypassed. I believe some of the bad reviews could be because of these issues.

457	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these rags in a box for about ten years now for clean up in my woodworking, auto, and leatherwork. They are a great, tough, absorbent, cheap (around 0.06 cents apiece in bulk), disposable alternative to more expensive cotton rags.  No, these rags are not made out of cotton but are a felted wood fiber. They are super absorbent, better than cotton, and when you get them cruddy you can just toss them rather than face the wrath of your significant other after you run a bunch of oily rags through the washing machine! They are not affected by oils, alcohol,  or any solvent you might find in normal shop use. One great benefit, at least for me, is that they do not "shed" little pieces of fiber like cotton rags do when you are applying,  or cleaning up, stains or wipe on finishes. One final caveat is to be sure that you are buying these towels from "fulfilled by Amazon" so you get the 8 box case rather than the scam artist who is selling the single box  for the case price!

2920	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	My device arrived today and checked it out in the lab. I used a DE-5000 LCR meter (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DE-5000-Handheld-LCR-Meter-with-accessories/dp/B00S298KJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DE-5000 Handheld LCR Meter with accessories</a>&nbsp;with Kelvin probes (which for some silly reason you have to make and can't buy premade), accurate to around 0.01 ohm, to measure it's DC resistance as I toggled each switch. The first thing I noticed is with the resistance set at 0, all switches off, the actual resistance was actually 0.23 ohm. Flipping the 1 ohm switch actually gave 1.23 ohms, a 23% error. The device is made by putting 28 resistors in series, and a switch to short across each one (off position is shorted). The end result is the resistance of 28 closed switches is 0.23 ohms, which is less than 0.01 per switch, about as expected. The resistors used are 1% tolerance, although due to the series switch resistance, values below 23 ohms will not be within 1%. The 1% tolerance variations will also accumulate, so the overall set resistance may or may not be within 1%. Assuming the resistors were exactly their marked values, setting 23 ohms would give 23 ohms + a bit less than 0.23 ohms series switch resistance, for an error of about 1%.
1675	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The price was great, buy them when they're in the $5-6 range if you can.  Why buy a swivel for double the price, if you can just buy these and lock or not lock them at your choosing.

This can is a nice METAL design, made in the USA. For another few dollars a metal can with a wire mesh flame arrestor seemed like a no-brainer. So I ordered one to try it out.

I had eczema on the sides and bottoms of my feet. The creams that the doc prescribed work but it's difficult to use them on your feet. Either my socks would rub away the cream during the day or my sheets would at night. Also, I needed to use a really heavy moisturizer in addition to the prescriptions. The only way I could think to keep the creams and moisturizers in place was to use a bandage and hold the bandage securely in place so that I could wear socks and shoes and go about my day without everything bunching up. I started out using the Tegaderm-type of BandAid transparent covers that I get at a local store, but the are quite expensive and they come in small quantities. Tegaderm is very expensive from what I could see. That's when I ran across these here on Amazon. So these solved my problem of keeping bandages in place and my eczema is clearing up faster since I've been able to keep the creams in place.
We bought 2 of these for the kids. One of them stopped working after a couple of days. Amazon sent us a replacement. Then, both of them stopped working a few weeks later. Eventually, we  bought our kids some good quality Sonicares and they never failed.

437	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	A good-quality grommet kit (made in India) that is affordable for small jobs. Depending on the fabric or the material, the most challenging part is usually punching the hole. The hole size needs to be precise and clean. For some materials, I trace the size of the hole, fold that material through the middle or diameter of the hole and cut out the semi-circle with a pair of curved finger nail scissors.
The sizes that are advertised are not accurate. It arrived " shorter in all directions, but it was exactly the thickness that was advertised. Get a bigger sheet if you need that extra little bit.
My only complaint is that it only goes to 9990 ppm, however, for the price I cannot reasonably expect a higher range. All-in-all it worked great for everything I through at it.
Now, with the above, you will have to ream the hole a bit. Takes about 10 minutes with a spade type drill bit, or a couple of seconds with the right size forstner bit. On the inside of the tank, you will have to use the drill bit to remove a very small amount of plastic from the support ribs on either side of the hole. The plastic used for the one I listed is like PVC. It is hard and tough. The nut also threads on much deeper and has a much better grip on the bulkhead "passthrough" portion of the fitting. Buy the alternative and save yourself a bunch of money over the long run.

5819	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Oh my gosh, much thicker than duct tapes, several layers. This was made to hold the Empire State Bldg together. This is about the equal of 3 layers of duct tape, and has a tough adhesive. It's a bit hard to tear off, carry a pocket knife. When taken off, which is very hard, it left some adhesive behind, but easily cleaned off with denatured alcohol or Goof Off. I would use this on more permanent problems, and not for temporary use. For the utility, I think it's a good buy. If using on shop stuff, home repairs, toys, outdoors where a long term and strong solution is needed, this is the one. I recommend you try it and you won't go back to regular duct tape. When it arrives, you'll notice because of it's many layers and materials, that it is a large roll per feet, and is VERY heavy....that's good.

The compound has Teflon in it, so the friction when torquing the fittings together is so low you can feel the sudden increase in resistance when you have reached full thread depth.
Can be set off quicker with mild heat when needed.

It takes about 24 hours to fully set (or as much as 48 hours if the air is humid). Once set it will last for years before needing replacement. Of course, a good bond requires completely cleaning out the joint before caulking. No caulk can stick well to a surface that is not properly prepared.

I used these outdoors on a wood pole, indoors on wood attic framing, and on metal paneling on the inside of a shop building. Mounting to wood, they all worked perfectly. Mounting to the metal paneling, some of the screw points were able to drill into the metal with no pilot hole and others were not able to. It seems the sharpness of the screw tips varies from screw to screw. Some drilled right into the metal with moderate pressure on the drill, others refused to bite until I drilled a small pilot hole.

Accuracy and repeatability are on spec, at least out of the box. It would likely pass a formal gauge R&R. There have been some discussion about repeatability at the sub-thousand's level, and mine was fine, but you should also ask yourself if you are going to sub-thousand's why you are not using a micrometer.  Right tool for the right job.
The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go.

There are two stirring schemes in common use - one is to use a small liquid pump that goes into an aquarium or fountain. Those pumps have a problem in that they won't stand up to temperatures higher than 150F or 160F.  They seem to work OK at 145 and they work great at 131. But at some temperature short of 180F, they fail because parts soften.  Bad pump, no biscuit!  I wanted something I could stir simmering water with - I was not going to stir something with body, beans or polenta or such.  Mechanical stirrers on Amazon got horrible ratings with the exception of those built into a pot.  But while you can't stir beans with a bubbler, you can stir water with a bubbler - it is the being stirred that keeps the fish alive - more water is exposed to the surface.

You place a small strip of reflective adhesive tape on the surface you want to read the RPM's for and aim the tach's laser dot at the tape from up to 6-feet away. The tach then reads the reflected laser light. The tachometer came with a storage case and a small roll of white reflective tape, but you can buy a larger 50-foot roll of 1/2" wide 3M tape here on Amazon that should be enough to last for several years of use. For such an inexpensive digital tachometer, I find that it is quite accurate. The display is not backlit, but has large digits and displays up to 99,999 RPM's with Min/Max memory for the last reading. I've seen this tachometer with the same specifications being sold under several different names now, but don't know if there is any difference in build quality.

After stripping the desks and removing the edge trim from the tops, I used Gorilla glue to attach furniture grade oak plywood to the black surface.  After making a new edge banding and using traditional finishing techniques, the desks look like a million bucks.  I experimented with other adhesives, but found Gorilla glue to be the absolute best for strength, working time, and cost.

Panasonic has really crapped up their products over the years.

1684	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Back around 1998, I purchased two cans of red.  I used these to coat around 8 or so lead 'bullet' diving weights.  Fast forward 14 years.  Some 2,000 dives later, the coating is still solid, red and protective.  Couldn't ask for much more.  I would never ding the product in a review for the fact that the lid does not keep the volatiles from volatilizing (an unrealistic expectation).  Unless you freeze the product after opening (as I do with a high volatile content rubber repair compound), don't plan on being able to use any remainder.

7704	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I didn't count to determine that I received 100 washers, but it is in the ball park - no complaint.  However, the washers were all lumped into a single package, requiring me to sort them.  On top of that, they all seem to have the same inner diameter, although different outer diameters.  I needed something on the order of a 1/4" or 5/16" inner diameter, but they are all much smaller.  The manufacturer should (1) sort them, and (2) let the buyer know what the inner diameter is.
Let me begin by saying that Sashco is a great company. They have been making quality products for many years. Their entire line of professional caulks and sealants are top of the line. I am very comfortable having their products used on my jobs.

As soon as I opened the package a flamethrower-wielding grizzly bear warrior-priest kicked in my door and threatened to burn my prize collection of antique wooden top hats. My wife was crying, my dog whimpered, and the 15 year old daughter I didn't even know I had screamed louder than a teenage fan club at an all-you-can-eat Justin Bieber buffet. Without wasting a microsecond, my Stanley TRA708T Sharpshooter staples exploded out of their plastic case and formed a protective tornado around my family. The bear priest, unable to fathom my incredible defensive magic, had no choice but to turn his flamethrower on himself in a desperate attempt to preserve his honor. I owe my whole family's life to these staples!
I used 3-m tape at my employment for years, large telecom company. we had switched to another company for a while and wow what a difference. I am sure there is other good tapes out there, but I am willing to buy 3-m because I know their product.
What is a real bonus for me is that these also take inside gap measurements AND depth measurements. So, for a very competitive price, I have added a very versatile tool to my collection.
1.) Back in summer of 2008, I was hiking and camping in Belnap, CA redwoods. I only brought 1 pair of shoes: Coleman Hiking Boots I got from Big 5. During the 1st day, the sole seperated from the rest of the shoe on both shoes. CRAP SHOES! Unfortunately, they were my only pair. I used my friend's duct tape to tape the shoe together, and they held up for a little bit, but the duct tape was shredded and worthless after a few hours of hiking. Luckily, we also packed the Gorilla Tape. I used that next and they help up the whole weekend of me hiking through mud, dirt, stream and lots of rocks. A great tape that saved my camping trip experience.

I used to sweep the floors with a broom, but that was a mess with piles of hair and dirt, prop the broom on something, then go get the pan and brush and hope nothing has ran through your piles of debris before you get back. You never get it all.  I found myself only wanting to sweep a few times a week because of this drudgery.  This little red vac just sits up against the wall by my desk and I now run over the floor EVERYDAY because it is so effective and worth while and reaches under so much and so flexible in the vaccum head it makes it fun!

5186	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I've always wanted a nice gas can. Other than being lighter, I absolutely HATE using plastic cans with that ridiculous safety/fume nozzle they inflicted upon us. It is heavier, of course, and because the hose is flexible I can't rest it on the lip of the tank being filled to take the load off. I have to hold the can higher in the air on my own. Also because I can't rest the filler against the tank opening, once in a while I slip and spill some gas, but not often and not enough to be a complaint. I read some complaints about the lever being too difficult to work and I have no such problem. I find it opens the valve and lifts the rear cap to vent quite easily. I'd say I have average sized hands.

Most of us have been in a home repair situation that just keeps getting worse the more you get into it. When that happens worse means more cash to fix the problem. There are those who say just "do it right" or don't do it at all. You know who you are. I can agree with them, when there is money to use, but when there are no funds there is..... Gorilla Glue. Well here is my story.
Definitely recommend having in your "go to" type things when there are squeaks or when certain items need lubricated.

If you do alot of packaging in a quiet environment, such as a library, then this tape may be very advantageous.  It does not "screeeeeech" as it comes off the roll.  Some brands of tape require real muscle to pull off the roll, and so, a day of sealing boxes can be a workout.  The EZ tape rolls off the roll almost effortlessly---so much so, that you may have to find ways to slow it down with some professional dispensers (an easy adjustment with most).

Meters not designed for it avoid 0Hz since that is the natural ground DC static field and we usually want to ignore that for measurement. Also there is often comparatively little EMF produced 1Hz-40Hz (some European train systems do FYI - 16.7Hz). Thus meters often aren't missing much EMF in the low frequencies when we buy meters that don't cover below 30Hz-40Hz.
