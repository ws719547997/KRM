I also used a lightweight (50 weight) thread by Aurifil.  So far, it is sewing great.  No more "punching" through the fabric, glides easily, and am certainly pleased with the result (with the use of the particular thread I am using).  It's also used in a Bernina sewing machine.  I have not used this for embroidery, but if it sews the same, then I'd buy them again.  For embroidery, my main concern would be for the way the embroidery thread goes through the eye of the needle.

2202	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I bought these based on reviews, but they were kind of a waste of money. When they work, they're great. However, the paint inside is corrosive and eats through plastic and acrylic which limits what I can do with them. The pens themselves don't flow well, I had to resort to dumping the paint on a plate and dipping the pen in, quill and ink style. A few pens randomly lost the tip and dumped paint all over my project, which was a real bummer. I definitely won't be buying again.
8435	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The fact that these stretcher bars are made of the more expensive finger-joined wood stock is especially appreciated, as solid wood pieces tend to warp over time.  That was a hard-learned lesson!  The pieces fit together snugly, and easily hold the tension of tightly stretched canvas.  The price is good, too, even though the shipping is extra.  All-in-all, a very satisfactory purchase.

5981	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Red Heart Super Saver yarn is a good quality, inexpensive yarn. It is a bit scratchy, however, and can irritate your skin while you knit or crochet with it.

I have tried two brands of these gold-plated tapestry needles and both have been well worth the extra expense.
Just to be clear, these are fabric shears, not regular, everyday scissors. They're specially shaped for cutting fabric without lifting it off the table. The handles are slightly padded, so they're comfortable to hold, and the grip is wide enough that it doesn't pinch your fingers, the way some scissors do. I always recommend these shears to my students, and it's one way that I can judge how serious a student is about taking classes. If they're willing to pay a little extra for the "good" shears, I know they're dedicated. If not, they'll buy a cheap pair of shears, which are difficult to cut with.

8837	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wow that is a lot of ink!!! I bought this since it was only $2 more than the 16 oz. and I definitely got my money's worth. I don't feel guilty for practicing my calligraphy at all. Will definitely buy again provided it is still in this price range.

When the box came and I gave him the scissors, he was literally moved. I was surprised to find out that his entire life, he has never owned a left handed scissors until now.

For adult women, it's almost impossible to find decent makeup with a guarantee that there's no lead or some ingredient that is not super safe. In that regard, though, if one is that worried about a few pollutants touching the skin once in a blue moon, then just google how to make your own organic face paint out of veggies or something. If you're going to use this on your kids OFTEN, I would advise against it because some claim there is lead in this paint (I haven't verified myself). But for a few occasions just a few times a year for a couple hours? Fuggadaboudit. There's probably way more junk landing on our skin on a daily basis just from air pollution and other stuff. Heck, we're getting too much fluoride from the water we bathe in constantly. My point is, can't live in a sterile bubble with your organic chia seed cake and have your face paint party, too.

5423	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this thing.  It works perfectly even for my fairly small-eyed embroidery needles.  The needles must have the long opening, though, This threader won't work for the small round openings in quilting needles.  I put fairly strong matching round magnets on the inside and outside of my plastic box of embroidery thread--so they are back to back on each side of the plastic cover.  They hold one another in place and give me a magnetic spot both inside and outside the box.  This gives me a place to keep the threader inside the box when storing as well as one outside for when I'm working on something--hope that makes sense.  This has made it much easier to keep track of this small, thin threader while embroidering.
737	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	After hours of researching which brand of watercolor paint I should get. I found Winsor & Newton has a great reputation. Not very cheap but I have to say it's the best watercolor paint I've ever had. It gives vibrant colors and a perfect size for traveling! I would buy it again from the same company.

I love that each crochet hook is a different coordinating color, so you don't get confused as to which hook is which. You get four crochet hooks, sizes F (3.75mm), G (4.25mm), H (5mm), and I (5.5mm). I bought it specifically for the G hook, which was terribly expensive on its own. I already had the other sizes, but I figured this way, I'd have brand new spare hooks, just in case I lost one.

My one star off is because these come completely loose in their box (no inner plastic wrap to hold them in place),  and they were a mess: the different colors had wiped onto each other, leaving no "pure" tips on the sticks. I tried to clean some off by hand, but mostly I just had to waste product by drawing out lines until the smudged dots were worn away. I understand that this is the Junior assortment, so these sticks aren't boxed up with the same care as expensive art supplies, but it was still disappointing to see my new colors so mistreated.

Other than that, no complains! They were the same as the ones I bought at the store, they were individually wrapped in plastic, and I received them super quick!

Stickles dries with a slightly raised surface and you can apply it in a thicker coat if you want more dimension.  Just remember to leave it alone until it's dry so that you don't end up with a halo or even a big smear -- unless that's the effect you're looking for.  Which is what I always claim when I've been impatient and moved the project too soon.  "Yes," I say confidently.  "I MEANT to create that blob."

2609	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I had tried the little rubber adhesive backed feet and the sandpaper dots, but I was still searching for the perfect solution to the slippery backs of the quilting rulers. For me, this doesn't seem to be it. In a class I took 2 or 3 years ago our instructor told us about this product and how wonderful it is. I bought two packages to make sure I had enough to cover the backs of all my rulers--I have more rulers than I really need. The application didn't go quite as smoothly as the instructions indicated. It just didn't want to stick to some of the rulers (all of which were the same Omnigrid brand). It is supposed to work on the principle of static cling, I guess, but I ended up having to dampen some of the rulers to make this product stick. There is no adhesive involved. This is a plus when it comes to removal if you decide not to keep it on your rulers--no sticky backs--but then, maybe that would be the solution I am looking for.

I started using Bic Markers back a few years ago and I buy a 36 color set, then buy a 24 color set to fill in the ones used up. I have started doing this with Prismacolor as well, bought this then take a list of what other colours I need to local art store and fill in the holes.

It came with everything a child needs to try their hand at face painting.  The project book was great.  The pictures were clear and instructions were understandable, even for a 9 year old.  She did every face in the book, sometimes twice! Hours of fun for everyone. I will be ordering from this seller again.  This is a great summer fun purchase.

If i Do that, I will post a follow-up picture. I'm not sure any paint will cover up the numbers with one coat. Gesso maybe. But I would hate to Gesso then paint.

7859	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love these gel pens. They work well with the coloring books and they do leak through, but I expected them to.  I put a piece of cardboard behind the one I'm coloring..solved that.
7160	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful addition to a wood-carver's toolbox.  This tool is extremely useful in marking wood carvings in a manner that can easily represent the indentations of a sewing line.  As a carver, you can make four lines of marks in a square, paint the inside a different color of the surrounding area and making a realistic sewn patch on your item.
I'd recommend these over even the Sharpie paint markers!
5883	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	The yarn itself is great, and exactly what I use (I use about 20 skeins of Mexicana a year for lanyards), but the description for what I bought said 364 yards. The skeins I got were only 244 yards. I went back and looked at the image after my order came in, and the picture does show 244 yards, but I trusted the description when I ordered. I didn't mind paying 7.87 for 2 of the 364 yard skeins, but that is pretty high for 2 of the 244 yard ones.

6709	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	To quote a local colloquialism - it's better than sliced bread. It dries clear, the fine tip is fine, broad tip glues a wide swath, and I believe, makes your paper "harder" when dry. Your paper is definitely stiffer when dry, when you are using "cheap" paper, is a plus. Love it.

2809	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Yes I have found them useful in threading needles both some hand and on a couple older sewing machines I have in my collection which do not have needle threaders.  Their length is perfect for hard to reach machine needles.
5149	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I used this to make squares for a mine creeper blanket.  I liked the multi-tone effect.  Much easier than making many different blocks with many different colors.  It works up fairly nice but is slightly thinner than the super saver black, which is why it only gets four stars.

The tooth on this paper is perfect. Not too rough but just right allowing fabulous results with dry brushing. I ordinarily use these blocks for paintings, not for exercises.

4081	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Everyone knows about Super Saver.  If you need a large quantity of yarn this is the way to go but it is rough.  I used shampoo & hair conditioner to soften my project after I was done.

905	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This Field kit is fantastic and the paints are creamy soft when moistened. They remain soft for several days due to the tightly closed kit. Even non-painters are impressed by this compact kit. The paint brush included is a good quality. Having this and maybe another, larger, travel brush should be sufficient for most painting projects.
9575	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	You can't go wrong with Simply Soft. I use this yarn for so many projects. I bought this color because my mom wanted a yellow hat. Simply Soft knits easily. I'm not a fan of acrylic yarn, but this is soft enough.

9789	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It's autumn and I am back into knitting chunky blankets and scarfs and for a project I needed a circular needle for a very chunky yarn. These circular needles stood out to me in price and were the size I needed. They are of good quality and it's easy to work with them. I like the shape of the needles, but it does make it difficult sometimes to thread the yarn back onto the needle because of the cone-like shape that can alter the size of the loops. But with a little practice I found that there are some solutions. I wish the needles themselves would be a little longer, because, for larger projects I keep finding my options rather limited.
9719	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	These are okay but they're hard and hard to put on the hooks. I ended up slitting the side of one and putting it on the hook. I wouldn't buy these again. Arthritis grip aide tubing works better.
3423	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	For a value yarn it is very soft and strong. Good stretch and works up well. The colors are vibrant and I haven't had any trouble with colorfastness or bleeding. All in all, a very good yarn for the frugal knitter.
7589	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Super sharp blade, easy to grip. I like this better than the smaller size I've been using to cut my quilting fabric (45mm I think).

8041	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I read some reviews on another site that said, "winsor orange" paint was almost a red orange.  And that they got the color wrong.  Well, it's not.  It is almost exactly the same as cadmium orange.  It may ever so slightly lean towards yellow compared to cadmium orange.  But that's almost imperceptible.  I see no reason to get cadmium orange over this.  Great color, and paint. The color that you see on the label is the color you get. Also. They sent me a pack of 3 for the same price.

5376	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This shade of Jade is a beautiful greenish blue. I am using it in an afghan of crocheted shells in colors of water from light to dark.  It is really beautiful.  Super Saver is not the softest of the Red Heart yarns but it is extremely durable and washes very well I like it for projects such as afghans or amigurumi or stuffed toys for my grandchildren where I want a sturdy yarn.

290	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I just received this little book, and absolutely love it!  After looking at all of the patterns included (more than a few times), it is really difficult to choose one to start working on.  Photos are included for each shawl pattern, and I feel this is not only a great feature for the crocheter to know what the shawl will look like when completed, but also to aid in choosing which shawl to make for a particular person.  I love this book and its easy instructions, and I'm sure with each shawl I crochet I will love it even more.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crocheting.

3626	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love this yarn for amigurumi. It's stiff enough that it doesn't stretch or split when using small needles and tight stitches as you do for amigurumi crochet, and cheap enough (especially when it goes on sale at the craft stores, which it often does) that I can stock up on whatever colors catch my eye to tuck away for future projects. I just wish they'd come out with a good "flesh" shade for making toys!

The only tricky thing is to cut it nice and straight, but it comes with practice.
8447	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have had several of these awls over the years and use and abuse them until they're bent like fishhooks--but still punch holes!  Great product that works over and beyond the point of wear that other awls will handle.  Thanks so much for a consistently quality, comfortable, and affordable product!
My only complaint is the paper instructions. I bought this for myself, though I'm not a kid, figuring a kid's knitting set would be easy to learn. Wrong. The paper instructions were pretty hard to understand. Maybe I'm a video-type learner, but I couldn't make much sense out of the instructions. But Alex makes another knitting kit, here: http://www.amazon.com/Alex-Chunky-Funky-Beginners-Knitting/dp/B000BWYN78/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372067853&sr=8-1&keywords=alex+knitting. The instructions in the video is SUPER clear, and I think anybody could learn from that.

3568	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The product is good. There are some tangles sometimes in the middle. Keep in mind that Walmart sells this item for $1.88, so unless you are opposed to Walmart, it is often far cheaper to get this item there. I have seen it two or three times the cost, even as an add-on item.
7627	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Easy to operate. Cuts through multiple fabric layers very easily. OLFA's product is a great product. Very easy to change blades. I bought this along with the pinking blade so that I can use this as my pinking rotary. At first I was concerned that changing the blades would be a hassle. It is not. Changing the blades is so easy that I remove the pinking blade and put it back in its case to protect the cutting edges from other notions in my sewing box/tray) when I'm done with pinking. Buying this also gave me a space regular OLFA blade as I already have one on my other OLFA rotary cutter. So now when my regular blade turns dull, I have this one to use and I did not even have to buy another blade. Bonus!
2249	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice set for the money.
7502	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I loved using my Olfa ergonomic cutter in the 45mm size and I so I tried the 60 mm size using this blade. As advertised it is very sharp and cuts through multiple layers of fabric very smoothly. Lasts a long time as well.

908	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE these watercolors. I had the smaller w&n travel set, but wanted badly to add some other greens and blues. This set it wonderful. Not as small, but the colors are great. The pigment is so saturated only a few swipes on my palette and I've got a good, deep pool of color. (A palette tip: use egg holders for palettes, like the kind to hold devilled eggs, there are 20 spaces on each of the 2 plates I got for about $10.) I'm able to lay out a lot of colors and let them dry between painting sessions. Just add water later and stir a little. These paints are wonderful.  I prefer pans to tubes and I seriously love these.

6574	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is like the mama bear. Not too short -not too long. I find this to be my go to ruler now.
9823	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are an absolute dream. Don't think that just because these are wood they'll snag your yarn, because they won't. They're so smooth! I would liken the tip to the Susan Bates style, so if you prefer Boye you may not like these. I do wish they made more sizes, but it looks like Clover does not manufacture any other sizes at this time.
475	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I am using this to make christmas ornaments on wooden disks.  The only complaint I have is the finest tip is not holding up very well.  I will have to replace it only 15 ornaments in .  Overall it's a great tool but does get very hot so watch your fingers and be sure to put something under the stand as it gets VERY hot.
2495	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great product
6190	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love this batting for several reasons. It is 100% cotton and feels wonderful, and has good weight. It quilts like a dream; none of that strange poofy-stuff going on like nasty polyester batting. This cotton batting washes like a dream and holds up extremely well.
5280	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great price and product, cheaper than local craft stores.

This gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.
5462	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am very pleased that I am able to still find these somewhere, because I prefer these compared to the wire threaders.
5969	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.

5631	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I'm a beginning knitter and I bought this yarn because its pretty. Upon getting it and working with it, I am very impressed by the beautiful colors. It ranges from the softest lavender to a deep jewel purple and it just really pretty. Its also easy to work with. However, the plies (is that the right word? strands?) easily separate and I'm constantly finding sections of the yarn untwisted and as many individual threads instead. Still, it seems nice enough for the cost, and like I said, the colors are gorgeous!
1884	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use these for my painting class. I searched around for the best deal and these were it. Art stores want $50 for a set of three, which is what I needed but for this price it was well worth it! So much cheaper and they are the exact same product as what was in the hobby lobby and Joannes minus the fact you got more markers. I like also that there is a fine tip and chiseled tip. Ink lasts too. Have had them 2 months now. I recommend these markers! Ya can't beat it!!

The typical Moleskine strap helps keep miscellaneous notes stored in place inside, and an accordion pocket in the back helps with that as well. It comes with a couple of sticker sheets to allow you to mark off certain recipes with "love this!" or "what if..." or more. There's also a sticker sheet of categories that you can use for the pages with blank tabs ("My Favorites" or "Cooking Courses" or "Websites" or "Table Setting" or "Veggie/Vegan") but you can always write in whatever other categories you'd like instead (I've written in "Frosting" and "Miscellaneous" in mine but find the sticker idea clever and they have lots of options).

Yarn that is made at different times, will be slightly different colors. That's just the nature of yarn. To avoid having a visible place where you joined a new skein, you can alternate skeins when you join a new one - do a few rows with the first skein, then a few rows with the second, for awhile.

Aside from the fact they were very expensive, I am very happy with them. They are very durable and very kid-friendly. The blunt ends are great for young 'uns. And the light-weight plastic handles are perfect for even the smallest hands. I love that they can be used for either right or left handed children. And I adore that they come with a little plastic container that keeps them all neatly aligned. I use it and have taught the kids how to nicely put their scissors back in place.

Instead of listening to my class assignments, I'd try to stick the corner of these erasers up my nostrils!  Luckily I only managed to push them up there part way- not enough to cause sinus issues or anything, hehe.  The outcome of my little shenanigans is that these erasers smell much stronger to me than they would for the average person who uses them.  Other times I'd chew on them like a dog and spit eraser particles all over the room.  You see, I had a hard time paying attention to my daily assignments so I had to find ways to entertain myself... and eraser munching just shows how bored I really was sitting in the same darn seat every darn day.  Those were the days.  Anyway these erasers are guaranteed to last you a really long time.  I mean REALLY long time- as long as you don't give in to biting or sniffing them, just one eraser should last a whole year.  With 3 erasers... do the math (since I can't).  3 erasers equals a really long time.

119	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  Just got my copy today and it exceeded all my expectations by a long shot!  I seriously was only interested in the milk can block after I saw a quilt made from the pattern online but I had no idea all the blocks in this book were designed for both 6" and 12" blocks so if you didn't want to make a whole quilt, you could take any of the 6" blocks and use them to make potholders which is just about the only thing I really have time to make right now.  I also loved the mason jar block which I've seen in one of her stand alone quilt patterns so it was a bonus to get this in the book as I didn't already have it.  Lori did a fabulous job pairing the fabric colors to each block theme and tying together all the block themes into farm related  motifs.  She has managed to design quilt blocks that I would think would normally be approached through paper piecing with simple squares and rectangles to get the most charming shapes like cherries, barns, little chicks, etc.  If you are a Lori Holt fabric collector you will get a big kick out of seeing many of the prints from her fabric designs in the blocks as well which really inspired me to want to pull out some of my fabrics to get started on my favorite blocks.  Although there are no sewing, knitting or other needle art themed blocks in the book which would really be a nice addition to the farm house/home made lifestyle theme of the book, there are plenty of prints with sewing motifs in them which made it extra special to me.  I noticed Lori used her classic color palette that she used in her last book Quilty Fun, but has added more grays and newsprint fabrics which I thought was awesome, giving the look a bit of a contemporary feel to it.  The other plus I found that I loved in the book is that most of the squares are based on 1/4" and 1/2" increments, only a few required cutting squares in 1/8" increments which are more challenging for me to get accurate cuts (I rely on Accu Cut and Sizzix quilt dies quite a bit for my cutting which are all based on the 1/4 and 1/2" increments).  I seriously cannot believe the huge amount of work that went into the making of this book.  It was well worth the price, there is just so much in there, it is jam packed with not only the blocks but many quilt patterns as well.  Well done Lori, so proud of you!  I know the Fat Quarter Shop sponsored a sew along online using this book so you can do an image search on Google to get a really good sense for what people have done with the patterns.  The theme of this book is so timely as more and more people are re-embracing home gardens, farm fresh produce, and our connection to the farmers that grow our food and yet the theme is also very authentic for Lori as she was raised on a farm as her parents and grandparents were so there are some very precious vintage black and white photos in the book that are just adorable.  I never knew that about Lori, it was fun to read a bit about her childhood growing up on a farm!  For some reason this book makes me want to go out and buy some seeds to start growing a little kitchen herb garden that I have been wanting to do for a good long time now!

5246	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use this yarn a lot since I 'self taught' myself to crochet. Red Heart does really well for the wobbly looking things I make. I am doing a little better though. I have used this yarn and made some pretty decent caps and pot holders. The yarn products that I have made wash well and make it through the dryer. That made me happy. The afghan I am attempting with Red Heart is going well. The colors are nice and the yarn feels good on my fingers as I diligently crochet. By the way, crocheting keeps you from eating while you watch television, too. I recommend Red Heart especially for beginners like me because it does well and it does not hurt your budget terribly. It is a very good product.

This paint is a really nice flat white. Like most white paints you need to build up some layers. Luckily this paint dries relatively fast. I let each layer dry in the sun and the result is a nice even white.

9190	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a good quality serger thread that is not expensive like some of the other thread brands like Madeira.  You also get more thread on the cone than some of the expensive brands - 3000 yards.  The yarn is 100% polyester but feels like cotton.  I've had no problems with thread breaks and its not too "hairy" which makes threading the needles and loopers easier.  Maxilock places a product label inside the bottom of the cone so you can easily identify the color and dye lot of the thread when you need to purchase more.  The thread doesn't slide off the spool so you don't need to use thread nets to keep it under control.

I also like the wider felt tips for fill in.  One word of advice, these will not do well if you have a heavy hand.  I found they work best and fill in just fine if you use them lightly.

As for the paints themselves I'm not really one to be judging quality but as I said I swapped out the white and sienna straight away. Even if you're looking for a nifty case just go for it and fill with your own colors. I'm planning on buying a second one just to put my more rambunctious colors in for days when I'm feeling funky.

The price didn't make me feel like buying more until these are completely worn out.
I have never had an X-Acto blade or handle fail, even though some were grossly abused. I purchased this set because my old ones were ... abused and no longer pretty, and trying to get all that sticky gunk and stuff cleaned off wasn't much fun. My bad.
799	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This product is a very good size for taking along with you when you travel or just want to have some art supplies with you when you go out. The color selection is nice and includes most of the basic colors. The blending area is sufficient for making a few different colors even though it is small. I haven't had the opportunity yet to use it much, but tried the set out when I received it. The colors are very easy to work with and perform well. They flow nicely with the water and blend very well.

First, with the watercolor cakes coming out of the pans. I simply took the cake out of the pan, put a big drop of water underneath, and stuck the paint cake back in. After a bit the water makes the paint a bit gummy, so I simply gave it a firm press, and I haven't had a problem since.

UPDATE:  I looked this yarn up on the yarnspirations web site and found the example photo to not contain any blue.  from now on, before I order yarn, I'm double checking the color example's provided on amazon.  I know it hardly seems fair to rate the actual product by a photo description mistake, but the rating is a reflection of my disappointment in what I received compared to what I thought I was ordering.  if I had been able to see the correct product color photo, I wouldn't have ordered it.  for anyone ordering the "rainbow" yarn from amazon, just know there is no blue in it ... the photo is wrong.  it's just lilac, pink, yellow, and bright green (absolutely no blue!).
5269	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great
I would give the yarn itself 4-Stars as it's easy to work with, soft to touch and has few to no broken/cut yarn in the skeins.  I can't find any yarn brands now that do not have cut, broken or tied yarn in many of the skeins.  I've only found one skein of the many Simply Soft Yarn skeins I've purchased to have broken strands and that was the Soft Pink.

9945	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for myself to help ease wrist and finger tension while working. I must say these Soft Touch hooks are the best I've worked with. The hook and shaft glide through yarn loops like a knife through hot butter! Quickly and effortlessly. The handle has a thumb pad that is cushioned to help was thumb stess and I find that using overhand or underhand holding technique still allows the thumb to comfortably rest on its pad. With these bonuses, i found myself crocheting much quicker and more accurately. I ended up buying lots of them to have as many as possible in my tool collection. Remember, these are your tools for your art, take care of you and your art.

The pants had a hidden seam where the hem was falling out and there was no way I was going to be able to fix them myself.  To take them to the seamstress to get them fixed was going to cost almost what I paid for the pants, so I decided to give Stitch Witchery a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!!  I laid the pants out flat, cut a piece to length, placed it in the seam, and heated with a hot iron (and a damp cloth between the iron and the seam) and the pants are good as new!  No more hem issues, and if they happen to resurface I have plenty of Stitch Witchery on hand to get it fixed up.

I think that for any book about the knitting hobby requires the reader to have experience sufficient to catch any errors which may occur in its text and to modify and expand freely on designs. Membership in a knitting club is also desirable so that other knitters can help sort out problems. I'd not recommend it (or any book at this level) for someone who has less than several years of knitting or who is attempting to use it without peer support.

The only drawback is that it doesn't blow a lot of air, which is great for embossing and delicate projects, but I mainly use the heat gun to get paint to dry, and the little bursts of air that the Marvy Uchida one makes definitely help with the projects. So if you need a heat gun that blasts air as well as heat, and not just radiates heat, you might want to look at the different models.

2703	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Invisigrip to put on the underside of my large, clear plexiglass rulers that I use for cutting quilting piecing and strips.  No matter how much pressure I put on the rulers, I seemed to have some slippage as I cut the fabric with my rotary cutter.  I am a quilter and really want my cutting to be as accurate as possible.  I was pleased that this product was both easy to apply and works!  It is clear so I can still see through my ruler for cutting guidelines.  It was also thicker than I expected, and so was very easy to cut and apply to the underside of my ruler.  It is made of soft plastic sheeting that adheres to the rulers without sticky glue or adhesive, and you can easily peel it off and put it right back on again without leaving any residue.  But best of all, it really does help my rulers stay in place and not slide around as I cut.  I recommend this product!!
Thank you for promptly sending the yarn.

If you have never used a block, it is very easy. It has the gummy stuff you see on tablets of paper all the way around it except for a little over an inch. You can take a sharp non serrated knife or exacto and cut carefully around to remove that page after it has completely dried. Be careful when cutting. I always am my blade slightly downward into the stack to prevent cutting the edge of my painting.
9458	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is nice stuff. I will make something with it, however, it is mislabeled. It says Off White on the label and I need off white for my project. This yarn is definitely yellow. It's a lovely, pale yellow. Nothing off white about it.

7927	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I discovered these when I was in art school many moons ago. These are a godsend to creative kids who've been struggling with those horrible, cheap stick markers that come in the "art kits" and such that friends and family with good intentions give them as gifts. You know the ones. You color in a 1/2-inch square and the marker is hosed. These Pentels are great. Vibrant, smooth flowing, easy to use, nice variety of colors. You can't beat them. Pentel has never let me down, and I'm in my 40s. Great stuff.
8982	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	The title says it all. The product is fine but this seller didn't bother to ship the item until a WEEK after I had placed the order.
i got the regular molding (texture) paste and it does the same job but is physically heavier, takes longer to dry and is a bit more 'grey' than this one.
5517	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I really like this yarn for projects where I want durability.  If I want softness, I spring for a little extra and go for Red Heart Soft Yarn.  The super saver yarn is great for projects for children, Christmas stockings, amigurumi, crocheted rugs, etc.  There is so much color choice and the price is great (especially if you look locally and find it on sale at craft stores.)  I like that there isn't a dye lot issue and once you've used this yarn, you will know exactly the quality you will be getting in the future.  I've crochet with this for more years than I care to remember and it is one yarn that I can always find where other types go in and out of style and get discontinued.

This is a worsted weight yarn, but it's on the thicker side of worsted weight, more like aran weight. This is what makes it great for amigurumi, in my opinion, since those need to be dense. But if you're making something that needs to be a specific size, check your gauge first. Some colors of RHSS are thinner than others, so again, check your gauge.
8770	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected. Sews a quarter inch seam. Only use on edge of quilt. Does not glide through batting,

It says not to use fonts (because more negative space means a chance of more yellowing) however for my project I used fonts. My design plan had the negative space in the fonts filled in which happened to work in my advantage when applying it. I had to cut them out and place them on to the the shirts I was using but to be honest it was really easy and took me about 5 minutes per shirt to do.

6113	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I only use Warm Company batting in my quilts. It is a very high quality batting at a great price. Natural cotton batting is always recommended by professional quilters. Warm Company 100% cotton batting works especially well for Quilt As You Go (QAYG) quilting. The fabric sticks very well to the batting without pins or basting spray. Natural 100% cotton is also recommended for baby quilts. Polyester batting can melt with heat so I always use 100% cotton in my baby quilts and for my pot holders.

9075	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have the Singer Confidence 7470 low shank snap on presser feet.  This gathering presser foot fit perfect.  I did not have any issues with attaching it at all.  Just needed to remove the snap on piece to remove that whole part so I could put this one in its place; as it is attached to its own shank.  So this will fit this model with no issues.  Of course I just started to play and even without instructions I was making my gathers.  Still have to practice because you need to know which stitch widths and lengths and all you want for what type of gathering you would like.  I will need to see few videos again as well on you tube.  I will also write some notes on my widths and lengths so will be much more easier rather than using up scraps to keep thinking which one I liked for what.  Attaching the second piece of fabric that you would use so a flat piece of fabric is sewn right to the gathered piece of fabric at the same time is a little tricky.  I need to work on that one before I attempt to do a project like that.  Holding that piece so it is even isn't that easy and trying to figure out the size difference in your fabrics so your gathers and reg. Match up in length is going to take some practice and notes.  I would say it is a must to do your practice pieces and TAKE NOTES so your not spending so much time On each project trying to match it and adjust it and all.  It fits, it's great, it came fast....Only hard part is just learning how to use it for what you need it to do.  I really like this gathering foot and can't wait to see what I will master and create with it.

It's really velvety and mixes great. A little goes a long way & I can see such a difference in the quality compared to inexpensive chaulky watercolors.

5088	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me. (Plus, it's on the scratchy side; it squeaked pretty loudly against the needles.) I recommend Lion's Brand yarns instead. They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.

7841	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Not really thrilled with these for coloring books. They did not lay down smooth and were scratch and uneven in color...  I was disappointed as I had really liked the color range.  Could be the paper in the books, but I have tried them on all sorts of paper, cardstock etc and just not good. If you are getting them for kids to use then I am sure they will be fine. I'll stick with my Bic and Sharpies and Steadtler pens
2701	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This Invisible Grip for rulers is a wonderful product.

The cold press paper is bumpy in comparison to the hot press and creates more muted tones from the paints. I like to use this for darker subject matter. It is still very easy to draw on with pencils and Micron pens. I also enjoy using water soluble sketch pencils with this paper.

888	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I wanted to love this pocket set of watercolors. I had a smaller pocket sketch set from W&N, but wanted the option of more colors. Unfortunately- this set is nothing like the smaller pocket sketch set. The paint pans do not stay in place. The plastic that is supposed to hold it is flimsy and arrived bent. If the kit gets bumped in your sketch bag, the paints can easily become dislodged. Not to mention if you are holding the kit while sketching in the field, and you accidentally drop it- the paints will go flying!

This paper is definitely more expensive that the stuff I started out with on the big pad from the craft store. But it is worth the price if you are looking for professional appearance and presentation in your works. High quality paper like this is labor and time intensive. When you compare how watercolor paint looks on this paper to another brand there is HUGE difference in depth and color. It really feels like the aper does most of the work!

It can promptly and on time, each pan was individually wrapped, and the name of the color written on the side of each pan, for when refilling or replacing the pans when the color runs out. The set comes with two cadmium yellows one in a pale hue, two reds on cadmium pale hue one alizarin, two blues one ultramarine one cobalt, two greens one viridian one sap, three earth tones in yellow ochre, burnt sienna and burnt umber, and lastly a chinese white. There isn't a really true red in this set (wouldve preferred a cadmium red over the pale hue), but if you mix the red pale hue with the alizarin you get a nice red. It also comes with a small watercolor brush for sketching and painting. It isn't something I would only use, I tend to bring a few of my favorite brushes, with sponges and small water-containers in their own little bag, but if need be i can just carry this around and be set. The pans are four per little case and there are three cases in the set. They can be pulled out easily and rearranged if needed.

They are SUPERB for school projects, homework assignments, art class, but most importantly, they are IDEAL for coloring gorgeous mandalas while easing the mind!

209	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I have the second book in the series as well.  There are both written instructions and charts for each of the shawls.  Once blocked, the beautiful lace patterns are very clear and defined.  Why four starts and not five?  Sizing.  When knitting in the gauge, the shawls ran on the small side for the recipients - these shawls knit perfect for someone that wears a solid medium size.  I adjusted the sizing by adding extra row repeats strategically. As for complexity, I am not a good judge for someone else.  I regularly knit "intermediate" patterns with no issues.  I recommend if you have a stitch that is new to you, to create a sample and practice the unfamiliar stitch for a few rows.  This way the stitch that is new to you will be even when you knit it within the shawl.  Happy knitting!

Shiny but not TOO shiny. I used dry brushing with a bit of brown to make it look 'distressed' and my project looks perfect. Dries quickly and evenly. I had no streaking at all, only needed 1 coat in most spots but some small areas needed 2 coats.

Only problem and for the price/variety and value of the item it doesn't knock off any points, is that the plastic inner for the case it comes with doesn't 100% fit when zipped, so the blades (which are magnetically stuck into the plastic casing) can plop up during opening/closing.
552	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	So excited to try this out & the fact that it also comes with a template for letters and numbers is a big plus for someone like myself a novice engraver.

9675	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I use Simply Soft a lot, great colors and.....very soft!  Drapes beautifully for things you want to drape. What I don't love about it is the way it fuzzes so easily, not bumpy pilling but more of a soft, shreddy kind of fuzzing.  Even before you use it, just sitting in your bag or light handling.
I will continue to buy them.
5956	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great yarn just what I expected and needed  I was able to finish the project I was working on in time
It is "ink" which has to dry before you can apply it to your projects or even touch it because you risk the chance of smearing it.
A terrific deal, I might have to pick up another set just in case!
But, all in all, in terms of smoothness, quality and price, this is almost unbeatable.
One thing that I really like about Liquitex is their tube caps!  This is something that is easy to overlook, but after you have squeezed paint out several times and replaced the cap, it can tend to get stuck to the tube threads.  The Liquitex caps are a large diameter and the extra diameter makes it easy to reopen.  Other brands have smaller diameter caps and can be very difficult to get off.  On some of the competing brands, I have actually had to use pliers to get the caps unstuck.  Never a problem with Liquitex.

It rolls out nicely, the variety of colors is top notch, and the price is SO nice, especially when you compare it to wrapping paper! I love pairing this light blue with red and white candy cane ribbons and bows... it's so festive!  It's super easy to cut, just like quality wrapping paper.  Definitely recommend this over regular wrapping paper, especially when it comes to large presents!
950	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've always loved Winsor & Newton. They have fantastic paints. This set was perfect. It fits perfectly into my purse or jacket pocket. I'm also not sure why buyers were complaining about a black color cake. My set has a white cake( my seller was court house supplies). So either they were getting older versions of the set or a wrong set. My set was perfect. Also,  for those who are like me an always in a hurry or who don't pay 100% attention.  The case is not water tight. So make sure you soak up your excess water or let it dry out before you stuff it into a pocket or you'll learn the hard way like I did. As for my seller, court house supplies, I commend you on the amazing shipping speed. I ordered this yesterday and received it today. Kudos for being awesome!

Once it told me to check my bobbin while I was in the middle of a design, well, I am new at this and unhooked the hoop from the machine and guess what?  The bobbin was fine!  The design was ruined.  I don't know if I could have restarted it to finish the design, I have only had it for 7 days.

717	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice little kit, and it is little. Has more hues than I would have liked, it seems there's no consistent set of colors in the kits, you kind of get what they send. The dinky paint brush is useless unless you need a mini rigger (or an eyeliner) :)  4 stars, because it's still a great little set for the beginner or anyone into plein air. I'm a real novice at watercolor so this is fine for me to get my feet (& fingers) wet. Next time I'll be looking at specific color paint pans or tubes to refill this little kit, but that's how you learn. Nothing against Winsor & Newton, just a few things I wish I had understood before buying. BTW, I probably would have still bought it anyway.

I think it must be a bit sharper than some of my other punches because its easier to punch thicker paper like card stock.  The handle is also quite comfortable and allow me to punch a lot without my hand getting too tired.  Any then there's the fact that it punches hearts.  Not only are the holes cute but you can save the punched out pieces (which are caught in a tiny chamber) for other projects.  I love it!

I then wash and iron my fabric and I am ready to start stitching.  The 14 count is a good one for most projects and I find that when I cross stitch, I use 2 or 3 strands of floss to get the type of coverage I want for the particular projects.  While making 1/4 and 3/4 stitches on Aida is more difficult than doing so on linen or evenweave fabrics, you can still do so by using a sharp needle to pierce the center of the block of fabric in the middle of the stitch.  You might want to use a finger protector when you do this as sometimes you can pierce right through to the tip of your finger.

I really didn't see a lot of difference with regards to stopping or reducing slippage when cutting fabric, especially on the long and large rulers.  I have RA and cutting and "firmly" pressing down on ruler was frustrating.  So I switched to little silicone dots! They work!

The yarn tends to fray a bit at the end which I wasn't thrilled about but as long as you leave a longer tail when you cast on shouldn't be a problem.  Using this for a toddler blanket, like that its one the softer side and machine washable.

I love them because of the way they paint. I can use more water for a sort of wash look and less for a vivid color.  I have been experimenting and this is one of the few watercolors that I can use to actually write my name without it spreading all over the paper.

8983	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is the separation factor. In that I mean that the alcohol they use as a base for the stuff separates from the pigment and when you go to squeeze it out you get a bit of a mess sometimes. The fact that it's in a metal tube makes it almost impossible to blend back together prior to using. But the color is good and once you are able to use it, it applies easily(although watch out and wear gloves because this stuff will stick to your fingers).

This is a nice midweight interfacing that will firm up cottons and is EXCELLENT for stabilizing t-shirts for making t-shirt quilts.

This comes with Ranger's Perfect Medium, when stamping I find I get better results with versamark. I love that this set comes with two pretty nice brushes, they are necessary when applying pigments. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it is nearly impossible to contain pigments around work surface, they get all over the place! Swifter dusting clothes help minimize the pigment spread. Price wise, Amazon sells this product at a good price compared with most craft stores.

This also comes with a nice seam ripper and a pair of snips.  The DVD's contain several hundred embroidery designs.

I highly recommend these.  What a marvelous price, too.
1854	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I have quite a few PP art markers.  When I began doing more serious adult coloring and my own art work with these, I really grew to love, love, love, them.  They are definitely professional grade with prices to match.  I also have some Copic markers, and I love those too.  And I know many will disagree, but I think PP & Copic are pretty much equal in their performance and stability.  I think your preference depends on the type of art work you do and how you work. And PP are less expensive per marker than Copics, but NOT refillable, which can make them more expensive than Copic in the long run.  Finding a favorite brand may take a lot of experimenting and I also use less expensive Spectrum Noir and a number of others to a lesser extent.  I get great results with SN; vivid colors and smoothness and pretty good blendability, BUT they tend to bleed and smear more than PP & Copic. Grade of paper will also affect performance (generally, the thicker the better for all you new to alcohol markers.)  Deco Pink & Ballet Pink are my two favorite PP colors....absolutely lovely!

My complaints about this project are few.  The instructions explain how to do the tent stitch and basketweave, which are very easy.  But they also instruct you to put the needle down at A and bring it up at B, then down at C and up at D, but they never show you where A, B, C, and D are on the diagram!

The only thing that keeps me from giving these sticks five full stars instead of my four is that they are sticks, and anyone who would get excited enough about a stick to give it five stars really needs to find some other bright spots in his life besides sticks.

Back in the day, we had to cut our fabric and patterns with scissors. My how times have changed. These rulers coupled with a rotary cutter and a cutting mat are definitely the way to go nowadays.

3748	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This bias tape maker definitely makes it easier to make your own tape. You need to have your iron ready to immediately press the material as it comes out. I found it actually helped to hold the little gizmo so it was almost straight up and down with the point against the ironing board.  One thing that should be pointed out is the size. I bought the "1/2 inch" size.  Well, a half inch is what comes out as you press the material. If you are wanting double fold bias tape, your finished product will only be 1/4 inch as you will need to fold it in half and press it along the center.

I literally crocheted for hours on end after receiving this set, which says a lot as I also suffer from repetitive wrist injury as many others do. These hooks are extremely lightweight, which is very nice. I delved into my yarn stash and tested these hooks on a wide variety of yarns ranging from heavy worsted acrylic to fingering-weight 100% wool and novelty yarns, and these hooks crocheted them all with ease. I experienced no yarn splitting, and the hooks grabbed the yarn excellently. The hook moves smoothly through the yarn yet is not too slippery. The point of the hooks enters into stitches effortlessly, including back ridges of long starting chain.

A bit scratchy when working it up, but after a washing with some conditioner it softens up dramatically and becomes as soft as yarn twice or three times its price.

Bleed through: 3/5
7031	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	You can rely on a product with this manufacturer.  It is well thought out and delivers.  This color has been very useful.
Bleed-through is a definite problem. Paper quality will vary from one adult coloring book to another, but even on reasonably thick paper and while using light pressure, the ink bled through the back and left some ink spots on the next page. So, a two-sided coloring book will not be a good choice, and a protective sheet between pictures is a necessity.

It's a wonderful little gizmo that does its job and I like how inserting the fusible web is an option which makes this pretty diverse. I give it four stars because 3/8 is pretty small and I actually find it really tough to get the fabric through at first compared to other bias tape makers I have that are almost as small. You need a needle to poke the fabric through, it takes a lot of time, and if you're too harsh with it you could end up ruining the fibers.
2879	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice colors, but the pad doesn't seem to give as much ink as I had hoped. I used one 2x2 inch stamp about 10-12 times on the day I got it, and it just didn't seem to be giving much color towards the end. Maybe that's typical, I was just hope for a bit more.

The liquid comes all ready and it is one of my favorites to use, it keeps fine lines very well and shades quite naturally too. The sepia tone brings back a vintage look which cannot be replicated with regular ink. Pros: It is all natural! Great! Cons: It is all natural, therefore is prone to fading. I would keep artworks done with this ink well out of the sun.

5348	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Way too big for a quilting needle, these are meant for long-eye needles. I use curved needles to baste quilts, and also to tie quilts. This needle threader enables me to VERY easily thread #5 pearl cotton into my curved needles for tying.  You don't have to aim your thread through any kind of hole, large or small; you just lay it over the hooked-end protruding through the eye and then pull the hook and thread through.  Why use anything else? And perhaps best of all, this will NEVER BREAK on you. A magnetic needle nest is a good place to store it, although I just opened the package in a way that I can replace it after each use, because I don't use it that often. That keeps it safe and easy to locate. There is also a hole through this, so you can attach a cord of some kind to make it easier to keep tabs on. Then you can hang it around your neck while using to avoid dropping and losing it. This works well with curved needles and Chenille needles, but don't expect it to work with regular sewing needles because the hook is too large. Most other needle threaders are cheap garbage. I'm thinking of trying the Spiral Eye Side-Threading Needles (no going through the eye...the thread slides into a slot on the side of the eye.)

1822	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Like so many of Crayola's products -- particularly their color pencils -- the fact that they're associated with children's art means they can't, and don't, charge the laughably outrageous prices you'd see for "professioinal" art supplies, even though their products are often of professional quality. But these pastels, while they may not compare with the absolute highest-end, $25-for-a-handmade-stick pastels, are absolutely comparable to Caran D'Ache and other artists' pastels. I'm really happy with the color selection, the texture, and the feel of the sticks in my hand. I'm an avid amateur artist, art school degree and all, and my five-year-old and I love using these. And that's another great thing about these -- because they're so cheap and sturdy, my boy can use them with abandon. We have the greatest time.

The paper itself is wonderful. I tend to do very wet washes and lots of layers. The paper hardly has any waves and the paint flows nicely around the paper. It doesn't soak up the water too fast so I have plenty of time to blend. It is soft but not so much that masking fluid damages the paper when removed.

Pobably why I thought it'd be bigger.  But it's a cute little basket and if I'd been paying attention I would have realized it.

3. With palms facing out, elbows near your sides and one hand on each corner, grasp the outer, upper edges. Grab the stiff part of the edges where it begins to curve downward toward the floor, and make sure to grab both the outer and inner wire loops at the same time.
As for operation, when the sensatizer is added to the emulsion it turns a good medium (not quite emerald) green and will turn back to blue after it cooks out when you burn the stencil. Look for a light-medium blue hue and the uncooked parts under the negative image should have a yellow, jaundace like hue to them. When cleaning out the emmulsion make sure to wipe up messes immediately as the emulsion leaves yellow stains on nearly every surface known to man, including porcelin and the steel rim around my sink. Trial and error for new users will happen, just don't leave emulsion in a screen for a long period of time if you don't want a permenant stencil, and clean the screen completely before letting it dry if you don't want a permenant stencil (yes the emulsion remover may make the emulsion impossible to remove. Don't ask me how, I failed mad science 101).

7226	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Anyone who has been painting with oils for any length of time (or passion) is most likely familiar with the Williamsburg paint line.  This isn't the Grumbachers, Reeves, or even Winsor & Newton oils from your craft stores.  Even many small art supply stores don't carry it because of the higher prices for some of the pigments.  It is considered up there with the other top paints such as Old Holland, Harding, Blockx, etc...much higher quality of product and a much higher amount of top-notch pigment loaded with minimal oil/fillers/binders.  This doesn't mean that it's not wonderfully creamy to use, though.  It just means that when you squeeze out a small nut of paint on your palette, that an equal amount of separated oil doesn't ooze out first and puddle around the color.  While some people might be only familiar with using oil color straight from the tube and actually may prefer the thinner consistency of those oil paints, I much prefer a thicker, higher pigment-load product.  I always figure that I can quickly and easily thin it to the consistency (and flat, smooth-brushing capability) of thinner oil colors by using various mediums or turps.  But when you want to be able to see expressive brush strokes, it really helps to use one of the best.

Not quite as easy as using a pen, but much more like it than I thought it would be.
I bought this paint as a comparison between Winsor & Newton and Liquitex professional and student paints. In order to compare I did a simple gradient test to find the truest and birghtest color when mixed with white. I find it important to note that the professional Winsor and Newton uses the same pigments as the Liqutex student paint. I found that Winsor and Liquitex professional pains have  the same degree of pigment saturation. However Liquitex professional had the brightest color when mixed with white. Liquitex student paint was only slightly duller than the professional and a closer comparison to Winsor professional. The Winsor student paint was not phthalo blue as I expected and had a very strong green shade. By all standards Liquitex professional was the best pain by being true to the expected color, having a high degree of pigment saturation, and remaining bright after being mixed with white. Winsor professional and Liquitex student tie for second though price would put Liquitex ahead. Winsor professional had a higher saturation but was not as bright when mixed with white and compared to Liquitex student. Winsor student pain comes in dead last by an long shot. The paint is the completely wrong color though its pigmentation states that it should be the same as Liquitex professional. The degree of saturation is far less that any of the other paints and it is greatly dulled by the white paint.

It takes heavy pencil, pen & marking pen images quite well without smearing or bleeding. Although it comes off the roll with a tendency to curl it's very easy to flip the paper anti-curlwise, weigh it down & get on with the business at hand. It also works well for the occasional children's art project, protective table layer and even to wrap packages if you want to make your own wrapping paper. I'm glad to have it "on-call" at home to fill in when the situation warrants.

I have a few alcohol based markers that I'm trying to get the hang of and I will say that I don't trust them not to bleed through the paper so put something underneath. It can ruin the next page.

Use the larger rack for thread storage only, as spools easily fall from rack. Two types together work great.

8823	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	It arrived as scheduled, and fit my Brother LX-3125E perfectly. It makes attaching the concealed zippers so much easier for me, especially as a beginner. It helps keep them really secure while sewing.
3312	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good quality yarn for a variety of uses.
3496	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	So bad I returned it. It was like clear paint with some pigment mixed in. (Yes, I shook it for 2 minutes before using). Would have taken 3 or 4 coats to do what Rustoleum spray paint does in 1 or 2 coats. Horrible.
9954	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Since using Clover Soft Touch Crochet Hooks, they are the only hooks I really like to use.  I can crochet for longer of periods of time before my hands start to hurt.
218	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Page 74 tab cast on is the basis to begin a triangular lace shawl. I love this style. You can continue with just the what it's call a yarn over basic shawl or get into the lace. I am knitting page  13 inflorescence shawl pattern. I have accumulated a lot of sock yarn, mostly cascade heritage, solid colors. I am using red for this shawl. I plan to use the 3 different blues in bands of color changes maybe 4 inches each light to dark like a colorwash. I am early in the category of intermediate knitter and feel this book a challenge yet possible. Starting in December knitting gifts for 2014 birthdays and Christmas. I am very pleased with the style this book is written in, easy to follow. Charts are written out, easier for Mr to do than the picture of a chart for me.
9487	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Super soft and a great color. Great for size 7 or size 8 needles, even for beginners.

4358	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice product
a good supply of prewound black and white bobbins for quilt piecing...One color or the other usually works.  Gray would be a nice addition in
666	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I love the paints! Very pigmented! But I don't like all the colors. It should have some paines grey and sepia instead of the white and maybe one of the other colors. White shouldnt even exist in watercolor. It does nothing.
8928	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great for buffing car parts to look like new in classic vette.
9596	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nicely wrapped in plastic, not unraveled,or pulled apart. The yarn is all from the same dye lot too. Very happy!
4680	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Lovely yarn at a good price.  Nice worsted weight yarn for children's clothing.
If you can afford the amount of money and time it takes (you need PLENTY of both) then this book is a must have!!
One can purchase the cheaper paper to play with the ideas that you want to work up but it is going to be supremely superior to go on to paint the final work on the best you can afford. Watercolor is one of the cheapest ways to paint. It takes quite a LONG time to use up your paints.
5610	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I just received the 4 skeins yesterday, 12-6-14 & they are awesome colors to work with & can not wait til I start a blanket with them.  So glad I ordered & I really enjoy Red Heart yarns !!

5148	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Growing up in the 80's, I learned to crochet with Red Heart yarn. We didn't have access to all the luxury yarns available today. As an adult, once I picked up knitting and crocheting again, I dismissed acrylic yarns as somehow inferior to all those expensive luxury yarns. (I wasn't quite a yarn snob, but I didn't like the feel of acrylic while working with it.) But I've since used Red Heart to make several afghans and throws, and I have to say I've totally changed my mind. I now recognize it for the value it really is: it's inexpensive, widely available, and virtually indestructible. (I still have and use an afghan my mom made me with RHSS about thirty years ago.) I also think the yarn has a lot of body and a decent twist. And by far, its best characteristic has to be its easy washability. I love that I can toss this in a washer and dryer and not fret about it. In a house with pets and/or children, that's an absolute must for me. I've thrown exclusivity out the window in favor of function and practicality. I like knowing that when I gift a handmade blanket to a loved one that it's going to hold up and not accidentally be felted or destroyed in some way!

8450	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Sent it back because it was awful quality and not as pictured! The point was dull and the handle was a rough finish!
4536	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful choice for afghans, especially for newborns. It has a soft hand, is easy to work with, doesn't pill very much (helps to place item inside a pillowcase while washing & drying to prevent excessive rubbing). Used this to make my granddaughter an intricately-patterned blanket and sweater, and the tree motif in the pattern was pronounced. Highly recommend this product!
6019	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I enjoyed making this item. The colors are vibrant. Went relatively quickly. As always i do wish they had more distinguishing delineation on colors close in shade. But the diagram did help to make a guess.

Will buy again from this seller.

1141	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	A very nice collection of Xacto handles and blades..I use them in craft work and often need a slightly different blade.  This has a great collection of different blades plus several standard blades.
5709	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I know I can't get it done before Mothers Day (I just got it yesterday!!) but that goodness about Christmas! My mother ADORES Chickadees (to the point where she has a bird feeder JUST FOR THEM!!), and while it IS on the small side only maybe 7 by 12 its still a very cute cross stitch. The colors are just about as described )but as anyone who knows anything about cross stitch knows that the dye lots are different). And most of the time I have trouble with reading the pattern but not on this one! Its bright mostly in red or other noticeable colors.
8632	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This block is an excellent price being sold here on Amazon. In stores they are almost doubled in price. Cutting out the middle man is in dead worth it.

5131	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This has to be one of my favorite color combinations I've worked with this year.  As I was making the scarf I knew that I had to give it to my good friend as the colors were her colors.  The first words out of her mouth were just that.  You know me so well these are my colors.
I will treasure this afghan forever!

1107	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love having all the different blades for xacto knives plus more than one handle! Having the case means I'm more likely NOT to lose them. :)
7889	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	HOW I USE THESE MARKERS: I bought these for an adult coloring book that has lots of detail and tight spaces.
7029	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am using this ink pad to stamp  for embossing. Great for card making and scrapbook pages.  Good quality. Others do not compare. So happy with product.

584	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This awl is exactly what it appears to be. Nice and sturdy, the bulb end fits nicely in the hand.
3461	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Very economical yarn for knitting pussy hats. It's a good value.
2434	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It's clear as day that it says SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. Look at all the color choices. Again, they are clearly sold individually as a replacement of a color you have used a lot. I buy what pencil I need when I am getting low on a particular color. The price is a little high. I wish it was more like $2.00, but it's Prismacolor, which equals good quality, which equals more expensive. As far as lead falling out, I've had this happen with every brand I try on a pencil or two. It's par for the course. I did switch from a cheap sharpener to a better one and have less problems with lead breakage or rough edges. Also, if you push the pencil too far down with force, this can cause lead breakage.
1726	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These is nice tissue paper, bright colors, and large sheets.  Good for many projects.
303	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very good!!!!!!!!!!!

3.  They have stayed sharp through repeated use
7885	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I HATE these markers! They are no better than dollar store quality. The paper "pills" when using them. Some colors arrived almost dry, no flow at all a big waste of money.
446	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	The point of the awl is what I'd expect - like any sharp tool, it needs occasional sharpening, and I have a more narrowly tapered awl for other purposes. There's something to be said for the tang of the awl going all the way through the handle. You see the same piece of steel at the top of the handle as at the working tip. If you drive the awl with a hammer, that might be just what you want.
3536	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	good
9350	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love the very subtle blush of color.
693	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wondeful perfect travel kit. You can take out and replace the halfpans too. I don't want to have another.

7823	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	great quality case and pens except for the fact that if you try and color over the space with eh same color on certain types of paper it will start to break apart the paper very slowly.
7401	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have been using w&n products for 25 years and know that these paints rate with the best
1736	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The tissue colors bleed together and our art projects designed to bleed together turned out fantastic.
2622	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I was hoping for a solution to slippery cutting rulers. This did not do the trick.
2676	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is worth every penny!  No more ruler slipping!  It was really easy to apply too!
2 reds: Cadmium Red, Alizarin Crimson,
6107	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This oriduct makes for some really good quilts and I never go without it. Better than polyester barring any day.
4585	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Candy is a fun color, and I'm guessing my pink-loving grandniece will like it as much as I do.  I always have good results with Red Heart, and it wears well, and washes well.
3554	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Can't complain. I love it.
9098	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great buy. They can be purchased at your local fabric store however. I must have loved them because now I have two pair.
Top trim board of plantation-style wood blinds was held on my plastic clips. Clips snapped. Impossible to find clips. Solution. VELCRO!! Perfect.
Round 2.
9089	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Don't try and make a rag quilt without this great product
4467	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is very nice yarn. I am using this to create a crocheted baby Afghan. I am using a Boye size I (5.50mms) crochet hook. It is working up beautifully. This Yarn is machine washable and machine durable which is perfect for baby items. I will be looking for this type of yarn again! And remember that is 16 ounces of a size 4 yarn (1020 yards).

8646	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	very pricey but good
8534	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter's boyfriend.  He tells me this paper is wonderful for his drawings. He purchases this brand over and over.  High quality.

My favorite thing about Red Heart yarns is that you get a lot of yarn considering how much you paid for it, as opposed to yarn from any other company. Other brands like Lion Brand and Patons are just about the same quality, but more expensive per yard. Walmart and craft stores like Michael's and JoAnn Fabrics probably has the best prices. With Red Heart yarns, you can plan to make a big project without paying $30 or something just on yarn.
9732	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Susan Bates....best quality crochet hooks and accessories.
2979	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The Omni grid rulers are the very best!  Bright yellow is easy to see,  like having consistent unit of measure on each size ruler.
2177	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great little scissors with a really sharp tip. Work well for trimming. I use them with paper and thin foils, but they are as good as any other Fiskars scissors do.
468	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good and sharp. The grip is fairly comfortable. It allowed me to punch holes for hand binding two books fairly quick and easy with minmal wear on my dainty lady hands.
4555	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This came so quickly and I was grateful as I am crocheting a baby gift for a baby shower this next weekend.  The color is a lovely light peach and it is so soft.  Plenty of yarn for a baby blanket. Great buy!
7404	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Amazing and beautiful, takes a while to dry thoroughly but the end result is wonderful. It is very thick and a little will go a long way, spreads easily, there's no clumping the paint is smooth and easy to spread. When you get it the tube is loaded to the neck with paint, when you first open it be prepared like mine did some is bound to come out a tad no biggy
6928	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love Distress Inks and this is a lovely color, especially for fall cards.
3517	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice size ripper that does a good job.
6215	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This has been a great little tool for my polymer projects, and has come in handy on other crafts as well. I make alcohol-ink coated globe ornaments, and occasionally I need to smudge or wipe off a tiny area, this is perfect for that. If the ink has dried I just dab a teensy bit of alcohol onto the tip of the tool and then wipe the offending area clean. Love this thing!
7815	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I got these markers as a gift for my daughter who loves to color. She has had them for about six months and loves using them. She hasn't had any problems with them drying out or not working. I would recommend them.
8339	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great paint not so good brushes
Very well made. Since my whole family is left-handed I got a pair for my daughter, same quality, same smooth fit and easy use. They are built substantially and cut cleanly. Recommended.
8675	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Another additional tool to my already amazing serger.

334	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	First of all, I wasn't sure what they meant by the tri-colored pencils and then when I got them, I saw that the pencils are triangular in style. They are very interesting and super easy to hold. These are just what I was looking for and work well with the Faber metallic pencils I just purchased.  The lead (or whatever it is) is soft yet doesn't break easily. The colors are vibrant and I can't get some beautiful sparkly accents with using these and the Faber metallic colored pencils and I don't need  to use a metallic gel pen. Each of the pencils offers a rich, intense color and when I use them with their matching metallic colored pencils I get a beautiful combination. I am hoping that these colors will give me more inspiration to work in my adult coloring books. Very excited to continue using these!
4724	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice
4709	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful
6691	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff. It washes off easily. If you get some where it doesn't belong then you can rub it off after it dries. It does show when you glue card stock together, it makes it ripple a little, but not enough for me to stop using it.
9450	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Seems to be working ok. I just started so I don't know how it will wash etc. I really like that it doesn't need to be rolled into a ball. There is the string in the center that is easy to access. The packing  bag it came in works well as a holder. I'm into about 1\3 of the skein and no tangles,  knots, etc. It seems to have a rather loose twist so care must be taken to not loose a ply while working. Good value.
I recommend them and the entire Fiskar line
6251	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this when I do machine embroidery.
9780	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Super easy to use and works great! I have these in several sizes and I love them!
5675	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great yarn, works great, BUT in the photo it only shows brown, white, and pink.. just be aware that the light brown in the photo is actually light GREEN in person. I don't have a problem with it, but that is something that still would've been nice to know.
8388	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Got exactly what I ordered! In addition to crochet...I use this hook for all kinds of things! Rethreading clothing with drawstrings,
6198	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Loved it loved it loved it!
5421	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I keep losing these guys and since I crochet I need something to thread my needle these and perfect. Great quality and does just as expected
6778	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice quality! Love this yarn. I've ordered a large loom & will be weaving tapestries. Great quality. Would recommend. Love the yarn.
7006	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have been buying Tim's ink for some time, got this because of price.....
1490	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent strap -- nice handle - sturdy and versatile.  A def good buy.
9785	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	All you need for thread crochet is assembled for you in this kit. The hooks are very comfortable and a joy to work with. They are very smooth and grab thread wonderfully. Even cluster stitches are a breeze with these.

I love to paint while sitting on my back porch and it is so easy to grab and go. I am running out of a few of the colors and will be ordering another set soon. I didn't really like the brush pen, but already have several sets of my favorites so this isn't a big deal to me. The paint alone is well worth the price. I would highly recommend this product.

9697	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This ArtBin is half the height of the regular ones I purchased. I also have the 'cube' that holds the bins in one convenient place.  This small bin has compartments that can be adjusted to fit various notions and equipment. One feature that I really like are the snapping closures. Keeps the bin securely shut, and also the handle so you can carry it from place to place.  In addition it slides neatly into the cube for storage. Because they are translucent you can see what is inside, like threads.  The one drawback is when you want to open them you need to completely remove them from the cube, and if the lid is not shut---well you can guess.

I am a big fan of shawls that begin simply and have their details on the edging so they can be worn as scarves.  The patterns are very clear and the pictures are quite nice.  This is a good way to practice the knitting lace techniques.
1385	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	There are a couple things one needs to know before purchasing these. First thing is the back is very hard to remove after applying the iron. I've had mixed results with these papers. Some turned out good. Some terrible. The paper backing is very hard to remove after ironing on the transfer. I followed the instructions exactly and still had trouble every time. I found wetting the paper a little helps rub down to where the backing can eventually be pulled off but that process is very messy, time consuming and still may not work. Third is the background of these papers are white. If you plan on transferring letters to a colored piece of fabric the white background will be behind them unless you cut each letter out separately.

I am using this skein to make dryer balls. I am happy with my purchase and am considering buying more and making some scarves.

I wanted something industrial strength to withstand the vigors of transportation and triple digit heat in the car, so I chose this brand name Velcro set.

1783	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are actually really awesome pastels for kids. I'm so tired of weak or low quality stuff made for kids. It's kind of insulting. I'm not about to give two year olds Caran D'ache or Rembrandts but giving filler based crappy stuff to kids isn't going to generate interest in the arts or reinforce their self esteem. These have great color output and are richly pigmented. They have a great blend ability and the colors provided by crayola are awesome. This is how you do kids art supplies!  Full 10/10 recommendation for your sweet little artist.

8836	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a great deal for some pretty good india ink. Unlike other reviewers, I bought this to use in an airbrush. I wanted large quantities of ink to use in practicing freehand airbrush (e.g., figure drawing, experimenting with templates). It is too pricey to use good airbrush paint for this purpose. So far I have nothing but good things to say about this ink. It flows well in my airbrushes without being reduced. I have been using it with a general purpose 0.3mm nozzle/needle combination, but I think it would be fine in a 0.2mm or 0.15mm gun as well. It is consistent, doesn't lead to much tip dry, and has a nice sheen on paper. At the price I bought three bottles. For those of us running 0.5mm or larger guns, you can clear out an ounce of ink pretty quickly. At standard prices that gets expensive, but with these bottles it is affordable.

1546	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	As long as you clean the surface you're sticking this to (rubbing alcohol works well if it won't damage the surface), stick it on in warm temperatures, and either clamp it for a bit or put adequate pressure on it when you put it on, the adhesive will stick well.  Bear in mind that is true for any adhesive - there's a lot to be said for surface prep, temperature, and pressure.  I bought this to put on a car cell phone cradle so I could Velcro my wireless charging pad to it (so that I could put my cell phone in the car and have it charge w/o needing to plug it in), and it works great in that role.
5081	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good economic yarn for crocheted baby items.

3. Materials - 108-inch wide black nylon netting (used as an overlay to create an amazing receding effect in several projects), batiste (for triangle foundations), 20-inch wide double-sided fusible web (Ms. Cline uses Shades SoftFuse which will add significant cost to your projects:  each 8x9 inch segment is about 1.00 per piece)
The cap is a twist-off, thus the name.  You may lose it if you don't twist it back on right after using it.  I prefer its more stable bottle whereas the white glue always tips over because of its flatter bottle.

If your child hasn't moved up to oil pastels, consider these. The texture is nothing like crayons. It's a very sensuous experience blending and creating solid blocks of bright color -- your kid will love it. And so will you. Tip: Consider using sturdy paper that can take watercolor, drawing with these pastels, and overwashing with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Crayola-Washable-Watercolors/dp/B000GZCBFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Crayola Washable Watercolors</a>. The watercolors won't stick to the pastels, and the overall effect is really interesting. My boy and I have done some amazing and very colorful artworks this way. His walls are now decorated with our efforts!
7653	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I don't use a lot of acrylics but when I do I lean toward Liquitex because of its consistency and quality. This titanium white is a great example.

7481	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use pinking scissors to cut the edges of some doll clothing for a cute edge look, but pinking scrissors tend to get dull very quickly, and once they're dull, it's really hard to cut with them.. I have three pair, all Fiskars, and none of them are easy to use anymore. There's no where locally to get them sharpened, either.. So I thought I'd give this blade a try.. I mainly use it on fleece, and it works great, but I have noticed it's getting a little dull already.. For the price, I wish it stayed sharper longer...But the price on Amazon is about half what it costs on Joann's website, so the price on Amazon can't be beat, and it is much easier on the hand.. Wish it lasted a bit longer or could be sharpened, but I give it a 5 despite the price because it is easier to use than pinking scissors...

(The color of the handles is also useful because if you buy other Fiskars hole punches, each shape has a different color, making them super easy to tell apart!)

Go bless others today and buy these to share the gospel in a fun way!  Make some Jesus packet/Valentine goody bags for anyone and everyone you know!

The kit contains the Fiskars Shape Cutter plus a cutting mat (use the self-healing side) and four shape templates.  You save quite a bit of money purchasing them in the kit rather than seperate.  One bit of warning: the shape cutter takes a little getting used to.  Practice on scrap paper the first few times and if you're still having problems go to a local craft store and ask them to demo it for you.  I promise once you get the hang of it you'll love it, but it took me a few tries to get it right.

1880	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I was hesitant to use Prisma Color Double Ended Markers both because of price and because unlike Copic or Spectrum the nips are not replaceable, there is no brush side, and they are pricey but not refillable. However, they are smoother than both Copic & Spectrum, and they layer beautifully. I suggest having a few of these in your collection. They are not very economic. You have to replace them, and a lot of plastic and things go to waste. They're as expensive as the other high end markers, but without those features that can make them last forever. Very few of us have money for that. However, I am pleased with my experience with these so far and would definitely recommend them to beginners and artists who are working on a project that is special to them. The other downside to these markers is they are not India Ink Pigment, which we all know is the best archival out there.
932	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Really great for hitting the road to go out drawing and painting. They are quality paints and you don't need many colors when you are out and about. You can make any color you want from these. The brush is just okay, I bring water filled Pentels because they have a nice valve on them and don't leak. Good brushes in several sizes, too. But if you want quality watercolors for on the run, or even if you want to try watercolors in house, these will fit the bill. They're just wonderful.
5617	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love the color

Her art changed dramatically after receiving these and a set of Prismacolor Premier pencils.  Having high quality tools that are right for the job caused a dramatic change!  She uses these markers daily and they have held up to heavy use for 6 months without any change in performance.  The colors are strong without leaving any streaking or overlapping lines.  Every marker is still going as well as they day she opened them on both tips.  These are on the expensive side, but they have been well worth every penny.

The special feature of this yarn is that it is red, white and blue variegated.  But, be warned, you need to know a bit about "color pooling" in order to produce a pleasing color pattern.  Or, you can just go ahead and get an abstract pattern of red, white and blue.

This one works like every other seam ripper I have used, is nicely sharp, and has a little bead on the end.
8633	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	The pad is wrapped tightly with black plastic inside, with instructions to open it with a palette knife. Even if a water colorist has a palette knife, it takes real caution to extract a page without ripping it. I love Arches paper and thought it would be convenient to have pre-cut paper, but it was a bad choice. Very disappointed.
Fourth, separate sheets and pads (as well as binder style) allow people to touch the paper, if not in the store, then in the factory. The oil from a person's fingers imprint on the surface and when you paint over that basically invisible spot, your paint will fail to absorb correctly leaving you a funny looking splotch on your work. The block form is sealed almost completely. You have to use a knife to slip into a small hole at the top to release the paper from the block. NO ONE has touched THAT paper!

I also think the brush is quite nice for an inexpensive travel brush. My only issue was that there really isn't enough mixing space to be practical. It is small enough to put in my plastic box of sketching stuff with another small mixing palette. I wish I had gone for the step up which has the extra fold out mixing area.

I've had it on my primary cutting ruler for several years and it has never curled or come off. Still works great. Recently put some from the same package on a second ruler -- It had been so long I had forgotten there would be no adhesive involved -- and the second one is working great, too.

One of the pens was almost dry, but one out of 36 isn't bad compared to some other sets we've purchased. The only complaint we have is some of the lids are on so tight it takes a strong hand to get the caps off. If we weren't here to help her with that, she would be unable to use several of them. She likes the storage case they come in and raves about these pens to all her friends. Much better for her than the colored pencils were. She gets intense, vivid color on her drawings. She's been using these everyday since she got them and so far, except for the one pen that was dry, they are still laying down awesome color. I was afraid they wouldn't last very long, but that has not been the case. Definitely would recommend these pens to any avid colorist.

8596	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this ink for calligraphy dip pen, but tried it both with calligraphy and with a fountain pen. The ink barely has any color at all, it is very pale.

7936	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I have mixed feelings on these. The quality is great, the plastic holder is handy and sturdy no complaints there. They are very saturated so I think they will last a long time. My big complaint is the colors of the pens are SO VERY DIFFERENT from what the pen actually colors. There is no true red, but a lot of oranges. All the colors are darker than the pens. I have been using them in Dover coloring books and am sad to say they bleed thru some. So I have to pick which side I like better. I usually use colored pencils but decided to try something different.

I had to cut the yarn four times with one skein at a loss of about 1/4 of the skein. The second was worst I was so frustrated that I refused to go through the time consuming process of trying to salvage the skein and threw it away!  Would not recommend this yarn.  I have used other Lion yarns and have been satisfied but this particular product is inferior!

5506	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is a very pretty variegated version of the Red Heart Super Saver yarn.  It creates little spots of color rather than long runs of color change.  I find it really nice for making hats and scarves.  I generally prefer longer runs of color or solid colors that I can decide when and where to change colors.  The super saver yarn is durable but not the softest of yarns available from Red Heart.
5504	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These colors are so adorable together. I made leg warmers for my little ballerina friend. One skein made a set of leg warmers for a middle schooler. The yarn didn't knot when it came out and was easy to work with. I will buy super savers any time over any other yarn.
The colors go on dense and I had to lift some off with a dry brush to get gradations in the color chart.  It's possible to do a watery wash, though, and get lighter pigment delivery.

As far as this color goes, I originally bought it just because it was available on Amazon Prime for a good price (plus it is a pigment that is in a lower price range to start with).  I've been VERY pleasantly surprised at how many times I've found a use for it though.  It isn't one of the mixes of oil colors that you can achieve by mixing a bit of sienna or umber into titanium white.  Instead they heat titanium dioxide until it reaches this color...sort of a creamy grayish-buff color (think of pale latte).  And the uses?  I sometimes use it instead of titanium white for mixing tints...it creates much softer hues when mixed with other colors.  It is finding the occasional palette spot for mixing flesh tones for portraits.  And sometimes it just comes in handy for its nice, soft neutral color.  It started out as a color that I doubted I'd use much.  Now I see myself needing to restock it in the not too distant future.
(GREAT pencils though.)

6851	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Honestly, these distress ink pads have a lot of uses, but the one thing I never use them for even though they are ink pads is stamping. I found that no matter what type of paper I use or what stamps, these will always bleed at some level. I saw a tutorial on google with someone using these inks for stamping and I definitely noticed the same thing. For stamping, I prefer pigment inks all the way. With that being said, I really love these inks to help age paper. The brown tones combined with the blending tool really creates a wonderful vintage effect. All the colors look great blended together and they are really easy to use when it comes to working around a mask for a really fancy effect. Overall, I don't own too many of these, just the colors I need for vintage effects on paper. I really suggest for those wanting to try these to buy only one and try it out to see if it fits your needs. Also I wanted to add that it helps to shop around because some people are selling these for seven bucks which is insanely high because many of these can be purchased on websites other than amazon for three to four dollars which makes all the difference.

7157	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I bought these for transferring patterns onto wood in various carving and scroll saw applications. They are sharp and having three sizes is nice. One wheel was poorly aligned when I opened the package and required some careful work to make it right. The pivot screws that go through the wheel to hold it on the handle, for some reason, have the screw slots ground off after assembly. The one with the problem was way loose and let the wheel wobble terribly from side to side. I took some small pliers and was able to grasp the head of the screw and tighten it just enough to close the sides of the handle together while pinching them to take pressure off the screw. It worked, but their quality control folks should have really caught this problem. I do recommend these tools, just look them over carefully when you get them to make sure they are good ones. The screws are tiny and could break or strip out easily, so if you are in any way unsure of yourself, return them and get a replacement set.
They could just be used as plain scissors, I suppose, but they really are ideal for flowers, and I have seen them marketed elsewhere as this.

1888	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I recently got an adult colouring book as a gift, what a great stress reliever it is. But I got colour pencil with it. Me being a perfectionist I like Rich colour and the pencils were not doing it justice so I looked online for some art markers and these were recommended. Now I tried to choose between the chisel and the brush tip and ended up choosing the chisel because they were cheaper and everyone I asked said it was personal preference. I'm glad I did choose the chisel, the tip has multiple angles that you can use for colouring. I love these markers.

1666	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I used this as wrapping paper for our Christmas gifts and then used a white paint pen over it to give it the "chalkboard look."  I was very happy.  And after wrapping 20+ gifts, I still have TONS left.  I had no problem with boxes of products showing through.  Nor did I have problems with it being too thick.  It is slightly thicker than your regular paper but it's still easy wrapping.  It came in a long tube box, no problems there.

6915	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Not the color you would expect ... it doesn't look like mustard at all.  It's a sunshine yellow.  Love it.
6963	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great for giving a watercolor look to my handmade cards.
  I wouldn't really recommend it for colored pencils or graphite, as it really has no tooth to speak of, and removing pencil lines completely can be difficult.  it's also not particularly thick like some bristol boards, but for ink and marker work, thinner seems to work best. at least for me.  please keep in mind that this is my personal preference, and it may not be everyone's cup  of tea. some people prefer working with a surface that has some tooth to it, or an off white tone, if that's the case it would be best to perhaps try a different paper.
512	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I needed. LOUD, but works great and is small enough it doesn't feel clumsy in my hand.

7801	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I sketch with charcoal so I prefer newsprint, or any cheap paper for that matter. But I wanted to try something new and this also offered a different tone. I was really excited knowing it's really hard to find cool colors other than white and gray. When I unrolled it, it was just thin translucent tissue paper and realized it was not sketching paper at all. After staring at this for a while, I said, "what can it hurt?" So i gave it a try, sketching with soft charcoal, and it still warped and cut through the paper. In the description, it said you could use marker or even pencil on it. I wouldn't recommend it. So those of you out there that have the same idea, all I can say is that you'd be more satisfied sketching on cheap toilet paper, but on the upside I have cool tissue paper now.  :)

I was able to use outside on a project during cool weather and didn't have issues with the paint drying. Nice solid black color. The spray cap (small cap that you press to make the paint come out) was smaller than I expected but it was very easy to use. The paint was easy to direct - very glad the spray area was not extremely wide like some spray paints I've used in the past. I painted a door mat with custom decorations. My cover cap (the black cap that goes on top when finished with product) was broken when it arrived, most likely due to a not so gentle UPS delivery. The cap still fit on so there wasn't an issue there. If I had small children around I might have been concerned since it didn't really allow the lid to lock on properly to secure the paint when not being used. I will buy again if I need more!

I am likely to go with another brand of pro watercolors after this one. It really IS a beautiful Neon Pink that mixes with lots of other colors when you don't want neon pink. I will add luminance to many mixes. It is fully transparent, looks like ink almost.

8499	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I like this glue, however, the bottle is too big and that squeezing out the glue made it difficult to determine how much pressure to squeeze without my craft being blotted with glue stains.  It dries pretty fast, but it bothers me that this glue bottle isn't small to have comfort and control over my project.  Ending in a positive not...it may be a big bottle but it lasts a very long time.  I'm a hardcore crafty so I give this glue 4 stars.

I was surprised to see the many negative reviews here on this book. I will admit that I wouldn't want to make some of the bags in this purse, but then I have seen advertisements for purses that cost over $13,000 that I wouldn't use if you paid me.

The circles are a little smaller than I anticipated but that is what makes them so great.  I can make my own "field box" with these and it's even smaller than the Koi pack.  I purchased the Pentel waterbrush with this and it is perfect to pop these into my purse with a small sketch pad. (I can even make my own small sketch pad buy cutting up larger size water color sheets to make a small book.)  The "lid" to the container makes a perfect little pallet for me. I can even put the water in the center "well" and then have five small pallets for mixing.  With my waterbrush which holds so much water I can squeeze the water into the lid to rinse it easily and wipe it with a paper towel to close up my "little" set of paints.  Truthfully, now that I have this, I don't see me using other bigger and more expensive sets even at home.  I am still experimenting with blending colors so I will update this review if I have anything to add about that aspect but 24 colors in a compact size and the texture of these paints make it a great buy for $10
9766	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	works great
-They last forever. These pens will go on for years. I don't know how this is possible, but Pentel has got the technology. Other markers will dry out within a year or two, these will last.

I still use this yarn a lot. The Hot Orange and Hot Blue make nice Portal colors if you're crocheting for a geek, and Psychedelic is one of my favorite rainbow ombres with frequent color changes and lots of colors.

The paint brush that comes with the set is, I believe atleast a full synthetic brush. The paints are of course student grade cotman, but they're good paints. I prefer cotman paints when I go do plain air sketches. The one reason this did not get five stars is because it come with Chinese White. Now I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to put white in a watercooor set, I just never use it out in the field. So I just replaced it with a paynes grey. Overall, good set.
8762	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I like this 14 incher better than the one that has the vertical metal guide along the side, because you don't have to worry about the fabric folding up on you and giving you an inaccurate 14/ inch.

I decided to try it and see how it would do and look. Wow, it looked great with the brown wall paper trim and it blended right into the black. I even took some of the shabby shutters and went over it. I am so pleased with the finish and so was my husband.

Face painting can be a fun activity for parties and it can just come in handy for Halloween, plays, or whatever other event where you need a fun face design.  The paint also comes off easily (I've had some that leave residue so you end up with a slight tint for a couple days).
7631	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	A wonderful little 'by hand' art knife that cuts out small details with precision. Best of the brands that are available.

I have found that the yarn may be tied a couple of times in the skein (sometimes but not always.)  It is only frustrating if I haven't taken the time the ball the yarn to see where the breaks are.  When I have time, I wind these by hand to check out any potential issues.  At this price and for the quality of the product (which is really good), I can put up with weaving a few ends in.

On a recent weekend out of town, I ended up at Michael's and thought how great it would be to start again .. it's only been 25 years, what could go wrong?  Well, it turns out that three skeins of yarn do not an afghan make (how that afghan is looking right now based on my memory of crochet lessons 25 years ago is a different and slightly embarrassing story).

I was able to hold my large ruler with one hand and cut a 24 inch length of fabric with my rotary cutter.  The only negative is that they sent three rolls of the stuff.  I covered four rulers and didn't even use up just one of the rolls.  I'll have to find some quilting friends and share with them the other rolls.

We are a half hour from the nearest yarn store and I don't want to drive that far to get a single skein of yarn when she runs out of a color! So she tried Red Heart on Amazon and is very happy with it. It's soft, and the price is unbelievable for such a large skein. I order from Amazon often so it's no problem that it's an add-on item.

He's hoping to be able to turn a profit with his knitting skills and these big, bulky yarns make the job easier and produce beautiful products.  We are sticking with Lion Brand yarns for now.

4287	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Let me start with this is a yarn my mom used to make baby blankets.  She had started a blanket before she passed and I finished it for her newest grandchild.  If I didn't find it on Amazon, I'm not sure what I would have used.  I don't know the correct terminology but the yarn could be wound tighter.
I am able to find tension on my sewing machine, which allows me to use Sulky thread as the top thread and maxi-lock thread as the bottom thread. I do this by setting the top tension to zero, and making small adjustments to the bobbin tension.  This works particularly well when the bottom thread is close in color to the top thread. Maxi Lock has a huge variety of colors available. I have a large selection of bobbins with different Maxi Lock colors sitting ready to go to match whatever my top thread happens to be.

3779	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.

1818	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I'm a homeschooling mother of 6. We incorporate art skills into our lessons every day by sketching, coloring, and/or painting illustrations of the things we are learning about. These oil pastels are perfect for my little guys (ages 3 and 4) because they are much longer and thicker than regular art pastels. These pastels are rich in color, and are just as blendable as any other oil pastels we use. My little guys like being able to do pastel drawings just like their older siblings, and they are becoming quite good at blending colors and using different types of strokes and different amounts of pressure. My 4-year-old even decided to peel the paper off of his so that he could rub them flat on the paper for coloring large areas, just like his 13-year-old sister does with her pastels (she has a set of Pentel). These have been a perfect art supply for our homeschool and have really helped my children with their art skills, and inspired their creativity. And, they are of such a fine quality, all the children are able to use these (up to age 18). I am so perfectly pleased with these--and the price is fantastic! Excellent value!

Some paint manufacturers make a version of it that is merely titanium white mixed with a speck of raw umber.  You can mix that yourself; but in my opinion, it doesn't look the same.  Other high-end paint makers do as Williamsburg does by heat-altering titanium dioxide.  I haven't tried their versions yet; but I do highly recommend the Unbleached Titanium that Williamsburg produces.

After using this thread for 5 months I thought I would post a follow up.  I have been using this tread in several of my domestic machines.  I use a Babylock BLR2, Viking Mega Quilter, Brother PQ1500 and Memory Craft 4500.  This thread worked GREAT in all my machines. (I keep all my machines clean and well oiled)  I mostly quilt and piece. (depending on what stage I'm at..I use all my machines)  I have been using Aurifil 40 weight for my piecing and can honestly say it still creates lint and fluff in my machines. I am cleaning often when I use all cotton..(which is known because its cotton).  Aurifil is a good thread...but the $$ it costs I wonder if its worth it.  With this thread...I can sew and sew and sew and have very LITTLE lint...its kinda a joy to use.  Its strong and thin, pieces beautifully and looks great.  More color choices would be nice in this size..but black and white cover mostly what you need.

4241	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Red Heart has an awful rep. I'm a very avid knitter and I know the right thing to do it knit with those lovely hand spun, small batch dyed luxury yarns (which I do often). But when you're looking to knit something that will be hard worn, you want to last forever, and you won't be pissed I'd your husband throws it in the washer and dryer - then Red Heart is where it's at. To soften it up a bit I just soak it in a TON (like, a whole bottle) of dollar store hair conditioner and give it a good wash. Don't be a yarn snob.
The brush is a two-part piece, with the main brush and handle, and a metal cap. This is probably the best brush i have owned for travel, just because of the quality. Holds water very well. All of the windsor newton brushes are fantastic, but I like this particular one because it's compact.
7696	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This "Unbleached Titanium" is an unusual and useful color. It is a warm, opaque color, and excellent heavy working body. This is my second tube in eight years.

I tried following the directions, and I also tried without using the red basecoat (my surface was already sealed).  I got the same results both ways.  One thing that would have been helpful, and which I had to look up online elsewhere, is if the instructions stated that you're not supposed to try to burnish off the extra leaf until you let the size dry overnight.  If you're using this for something like lettering, it will smear.

It comes with a bitty paint brush and if you have a bottle cap you can use that for water. It fits easily in a small bag and is so convenient. The colors are rich and beautiful. I would highly recommend this set.

I do wish there was purple in it already it was easy enough to find one to go in it. I carry it everywhere. It's the perfect size and the colors are nice. If you're looking for something simple or for on the go this is definitely for you. I love it.

She loves the color and has already tried the finished one on and likes the feel of the yarn! The mix of black grey and white is done nicely and is a perfect go to if you're not sure on what color to use on a project! Red Heart has been my family's go to for yarns for as long as i can remember! my Granny was an excellent crocheter and a big fan of Red Heart! Even though I went the other way and learned to knit, I'm glad to say I happily keep this tradition a live! :) I have some other yarns I use too but Red Heart is definitely a top favorite!

2781	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I used these to thread sewing needles from large to small. The large sizes, 4, 5, & 7, threaded easily with this threader. Size 9 required a tiny "pop" to get it out again once threaded. The size 10 also required a bit of extra poking and pulling, but it worked. But these were all Dritz needles. When I tried it with my all-time favorite quilting needles, "Foxglove Cottage Quilting Betweens, Size 10", it didn't work. The eye must be smaller. Luckily, I've found that Gutterman hand-quilting thread is the one thread that will willingly go through the eye without using a threader, so I'll keep using my favorite needles with Gutterman thread until I can find a threader that will work with very tiny eyes.
9702	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I find this is the ONLY way to really get the full benefit of Crazy Glue.  Like so many others, I too was frustrated with how I was only getting a couple of uses out of a larger tube, before it all clogged up so quickly.  I got tired of throwing away half used tubes.  These are very small tubes that allow you to make full use of ALL of the product you purchase.  Once you try these you'll never go back to buying and wasting so much product with the larger tubes!

8017	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My first watercolor teacher recommended the Winsor & Newton brand as good, non-fading colors (most of them) and they also aren't as expensive as some of the other watercolors on the market.  I've been using them ever since.  I used to dream of owning every color in the W&N repertory,  but experience has taught me that I don't really need a wide variety of colors.  It's better to mix up my own, but ochre is a must-have for landscape painting.

5982	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Red Heart Super Saver yarn is a good value. It's cheap, durable and washes well. The downsides are that it's scratchy and can irritate your skin when you knit or crochet with it. The pull skeins often don't work or become very tangled towards the end.
On the other hand, it IS acrylic yarn, and from what I've been told, the items you knit or crochet wear out a little over time. Acrylic is synthetic and cheaply made, so after a few years, I think little fuzzy balls spring up from the work. If you want to make something that'll still look excellent in 10 years, get wool yarn. But if you want some inexpensive yarn that you can put in the washing machine without a problem, get Red Heart super savers. The choice is yours...

8368	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This was an affordable set of watercolors and brushes for a beginner. The first thing that happened is that the inside tray ( a paper thin plastic ) came loose... Where the paints are supposed to be held tight in place, they now flip out along with the entire tray. It's not a "neat" little kit since everything is a big mess when you've closed it up and it's a lot of trouble to get it all back where things belong. The brushes are hard to access because they have layered them with a bit of an offset. ( one part of the set is under the other part )... This is a simple kit of paints and brushes. Don't expect to be wowed or super happy - expect to get some paint and some brushed and a box. The plastic liner is what makes it cheap.
3485	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	As always, great and affordable product from DMC.
9582	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great colors, great texture. For a scarf (which is what I am making) I need to use two strands, but those two skeins will make a full scarf. Very excited. My only issue is that this was listed with size 3 yarn, but this is size 4. So I was upset because the yarn it was supposed to be matched with is a 3 which means this a 4 can't be used with it.

6571	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This 8 1/2 inch square ruler is perfect for making a quilt for an extra-long twin-size bed for a dorm room.  The 8-inch squares that result from using a 1/4 inch seam to sew the squares together, which is standard in quilting, result in a 72-inch wide and 96-inch long quilt.  Some sources say 68-inches by 94-inches is the standard quilt size for the twin XL, but 72 by 96 leaves rooms for some shrinkage from the first washing and also from the final quilting.  This quilt will be 9 (8-inch) squares by 12 (8-inch) squares for 108 squares, total.  So this ruler is very nice and convenient for making quilts for dorm beds.

The lead broke so many times while sharpening that it was 3/4 of the way through with in a week!

-I really have no big complaints, except the tip of these markers sometimes will rub off on certain paper. The surface will come off of the paper and leave behind little balls of fiber, making your work rather scratchy. This might be because the tips are too hard?
6583	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent soft yarn for baby blankets or clothes - or any project where you want cozy yarn.

My only complaint is that it isn't bigger with a higher capacity water bottle, larger palette areas, more colors, and more brushes.  But then it wouldn't be the ideal watercolor field kit.  This one is for quick sketching in the field, not for painting highly detailed landscapes, city scenes, or portraits.  The photo accompanying this review was the first sketch made using this kit in my sketch book with 6" X 4" pages.  (I'm not Rembrandt, so don't laugh too hard)

I'm a beginner so my projects aren't very heavy duty right now. For my purposes, this tool works well and is comfortable in my hands.

I am still experimenting the product in order to be more familiar with it but I must say that with mixable oil painting you do not want to switch back to oil painting. In general, I think that water mixable oil has all the oil painting qualities without its big disadvantage: in effect, no strong odor, and consequently no headache, and no allergy anymore...it is safer  for human and animals and more, it is a good attitude/gesture for our beautiful planet! Think of all the turpentine badly and wrongly poured in the sinks...

2947	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful picture. The colors are so varied and rich. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I have never used a pattern that actually doesn't indicate the half stitches. Others show the different colors on each half. This design doesn't do that, just shows the back stitch line going through the middle of the square that has only one color design on it. Sometimes it isn't even in the middle, but 1/3 and 2/3 of the square. It is very easy to miscalculate where to put half stitches and know for sure what the two colors are. Other than that it is a very rewarding picture to make.

329	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I really like these colored pencils. The main pencils that I use are the expensive Prismacolor, but these hold up well next to those, but are much less expensive, and buying them on Amazon saves me even more money on all of them. I have bought three different Faber-Castell sets and love them all. They offer colors that even my 132 color set of Prismacolor don't. I highly recommend having more than 1 or 2 sets of colored pencils if you are a serious colorist. They may all have light blue or pink, but every sets colors are different and make you collection even more versatile!!!
9005	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	A good product.  This is first time I have purchased as Im in the learning stages of working with clay and all that, but it does exactly what it says.

1873	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very pricy markers but VERY worthwhile buy. i hate it when markers eat up the paper or worse show overlap marks. These don't do that. They are a huge investment but worth it.
4912	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have a small area of my bedroom devoted to quilting stuff.  This ruler holder was great in helping to organize this small space.
I just Coats & Clark would make longer regular zippers as well as single ended separating zippers. I could not find them anywhere. I don't like the zipper rolls where you cut the zipper to a desired length.

9476	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Lovely yarn. Great price.
I am finishing (today) a wood serving table for my church and it's reclaimed pine with just a poly finish.  At 7' long by 30 inches wide, it's a lot of poly to apply and I decided against wiping varnish and am brushing it on. I used these for the first two coats and will use them for the final top coat also.
If you want to do a paint-by-number that is wonderful with paint and coverage pay a little more and go with the Dimensions brand. I've done several of those and reviewed them as well.
972	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Um, ya!  I'm not new to watercolor painting. But it does amaze me the difference in good quality paints oppose to cheap ones.  I wanted something to take with my on vacation and these are great, the pigment is excellent. Bright colors great mixing qualities. If your on a budget for the quality these are excellent paints. And not too expensive.  I will but the next size up for my travels once I've used this up.

8578	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	It is a bit more expensive than some other brands of gel medium I have used, but it doesn't get thick and goopy like some do. I would recommend this anytime you need a slight gloss finish. I do art journaling and like the quality of the Golden brand. I use it like glue and put on the surface and then over the paper I stick down. However, if you plan to write/stamp over it, you would be better served to get the matte finish instead of gloss.

SIDE NOTE AND A GREAT FIND!!!
283	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am not naturally educated or confident about what colors go with other colors. This fits in my purse and gives me a great tool for figuring out what fabrics I need for quilting a particular product. I still have my color wheel, too, but this is such a great help for me when at the fabric store, don't know what I would do without it.

2528	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Used this mark sights on a couple of pistols. Works great and much better than most of those sight paint kits and brushes. You just prime the marker and mark the site. That simple and no mess and once dry does not just flake off. Be sure to clean the painted surface prior to using and it will last longer. I have cleaned and cleaned and it stays on. Great product!

2011	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	They are Crayola crayons, how can you go wrong? They arrived quickly and without issue. I used these for a larger craft project and the colors were great.
1337	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	these are the only top loading page protectors I will use in my scrapbook. They are cheap, durable, easy to use and serve the purpose well.
2242	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I was afraid that the sticks would come broken from being tossed about during shipping.  Thankfully all of them are in one piece.  I have never used water soluble oil pastel before therefore I did not know what to expect.  However, the result from my first try is not shabby at all.  I use the 3 shades of yellow (pale to orange) to fill out the blank area from a coloring page I was working on using US Art Supply's water brush.  The result was satisfying.  The pastel touched the paper between waxed crayon and regular oil pastel.  If I used too much force, bits would crumble.  However, the color is opaque enough that even at a light touch it adhered to the paper nicely.  I like the result and will definitely use it more in color blending.
6758	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I ordered these Fisker deckle edge scissors to create a handmade paper edge on my holiday watercolor paintings.  They worked great.  Smooth cutting and worked continuously.  I had another brand of deckle edge scissors and they were too flimsy to cut a nice clean edge, especially if the paper had any sort of thickness.
7673	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great artist material, came quickly and is easy to use.
898	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a good set of watercolor paints.

5738	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic yarn! I bought it off here because I was working with this color and ran out. The store that I got it from no longer had it. When this yarn got to my house, I was shocked at how soft it was! The skein I got from the store was very course. Loved this new yarn!

2641	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Not sure it works well but it seems OK for now.  CON:  it comes in a roll so you have to fight the rolled sheet -- flat is better but then you get the 36" so a roll makes sense.
6321	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought myself a Xyron sticker maker a year ago. It's handy for making stickers for my planner and for identification stickers. You can print whatever you want, or copy and print and then put it through the Xyron so that the backside is now sticky. I took mine with me when I went to visit my grandkids and of course they needed one too. Now I get calls telling me that they need refills! Just a simple and easy to use product that is fun and useful.

6166	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Soft, natural, and made my couch look amazing :)
Overall, this book is a real winner with clear photographs of the projects and easy-to-read pattern instructions. Some of the photos are a bit sexist for my taste but I can overlook that. They just seem silly. The book itself is a very welcome addition to my knitting library.
149	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Don't like this vellum...its not what I wanted or needed it for..but I assume its my fault for not clearing reading what this is...its VERY lightweight tracing paper not actual hard vellum card stock. live n learn
7332	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I like these. Mine came without the lid but that was quickly remedied by Amazon's awesome customer service! I like the colors, but there is no violet!! Yes I know I can make it in the well in the middle but I would prefer it came with it. I also think it would be cool if it stayed hooked together for a more 'travel' feel. The colors are good quality. I think it is good for someone who is just a little interested in watercoloring for maybe affects on things like cards. Also good for kids desks as they don't take up much space.
7009	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great experience
8754	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This was a great purchase. It's a must-have for every quilter.  I use it constantly.
2759	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	How can anyone bead without these? I love them. The hardest thing is keeping up with them as they're so thin and look like beading wire. I highly recommend them.
It really looks beautiful & is easy to work with.  It has a nice feel to it, & a good weight without being too heavy.

2882	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Works great! Easy to use. The hem I repaired has stayed in place even after washing.
All aside, as mentioned, the paper is somewhat see through. I cant imagine using this for too much else, other than for scrap paper for spray painting objects on, wrapping things / packages, etc....but isn't that what news paper is for?
4701	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	ok

9373	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Is good.
5599	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use this for creating dolls that are washable and won't lose their shape over time. However, I wouldn't wear anything made with this yarn, purely for aesthetic reasons. For a wearable garment, I would go with something involving natural fiber; not something acrylic like this yarn. Color shown is very close to actual!

873	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I'm happy with the colors but the palette is useless as the little plastic dividers that hold the pans in place are bent.  They would fit fine if the pans came unpackaged but they came wrapped in cellophane and had a paper wrapper around the outside as well.  This added bulk to each pan and the pans were placed in the palette with the dividers, hence the dividers bent to accommodate the extra bulk of the pans.  I ordered this and another palette (same thing but with full sized pans) and encountered the same problem.  It makes the fit for the dividers/pans pretty crappy and useless as it doesn't hold the pans in very well.  I just bought a sturdy metal palette to put my pans in to avoid this crap.  Also, even with the dividers that aren't bent, the pans do not stay in the palette very well.
9434	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	bought for my girlfriend. she will only use this name brand of yarn
9741	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very nice hook. Now I've just got to learn how to use it. This tunisian crochet is a little bit harder than it looks.

4505	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	This yarn was the worst yarn I ever bought! It  kept separating and also cost twice as much at amazon then it does in a store. I ordered it because the store was out of it and I had a project I was working on. I thought for the price it was a bigger ball of yarn. [O
They're very soft (which is why they glide so easily across your paper), so if you use too much pressure, they leave behind some crumbs. You can just brush these off with a paper towel or blend them into your artwork with a finger. Colors  (which are vibrant) blend well together, too--not as thoroughly as paint will, but that's to be expected. I like these better than my watercolor crayons because they don't dry as quickly, giving you more time to blend.
3811	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This thread is all white unlike what the pic shows. It doesn't break easily nor tangles easily.

Buff the shine how you want it.
3137	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Incredibly unimpressed with the quality of this hole punch. Admittedly, I was looking to punch holes in an Altoids mint tin, but these things didn't hold up at all. They deformed from hand strength alone. I'd return the item but it's nearly unrecognizable after I vented my frustration.
6351	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	love this stuff for scarves, pillows, and chunky baby blankets. gets softer with each laundering, too. good stuff. . .

1753	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great product, fair price, speedy delivery.
The colors are vibrant with good pigmentation and with varied opacity/transparency. I did a color swatch and some colors appeared to be somewhat granulated and does not produce a nice wash. I compared the viridian hue between the pan and the tube and the tube produces a much more even wash and the pan has made strike marks with the pigments (see pic, upper right corner is viridian from tube). This could be because the pigments are dryer in the pans than in the tube and it might improve with more use, I will come back with an update.
4931	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Thank you

Off White
6850	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is the perfect yarn for a baby afghan!  it's so soft and warm and works up so quickly!  The only drawback is that it has to be worked more carefully because it's so easy to catch extra fibers in your stitch.  The colors are truly beautiful, too.
5893	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Perfect match to finnish a baby blanket. Only place I could find the right color. Using Amazon has saved the day for me. Thanks

4529	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	very good
8735	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Let me first say that i have a thing for pressor feet.  I love this foot because it takes the guesswork out of doing 1/4 inch seams, and as an added bonus if you line up the fabric on the other side, you get a 1/8" seam.  With an all purpose foot this is hard to do because the fabric wants to lift up over the inside of the foot.  The wider part od this foot keeps the fabric in place.  I would highly recommend this foot to anyone who deals with narrow seams.  Besides my overlocking foot (which came with my brother cs6000i), i would have to say this is my favorite.

8205	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	You can't go wrong in purchasing W&N watercolor paint, the Brown Madder is a really beautiful color if you are doing floral watercolor paintings, I use this when I do roses or other rich flowers. It can also be used for tree bark because of the reddish brown, I used to use burnt sienna with a little alizarin crimson but this just had a richer red/brown to it.
9811	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as listed. Arrived well. Great hooks.

The rotary cutter/ruler/self healing board sets make sewing and crafting sooooo much easier, and more enjoyable with far superior results.
6487	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a decoupage project that I'm working on. It's as described. A simply constructed, unfinished wooden box that opens with a latch. I think it will be prefect for a nesting box once it's decorated. I'll update after the project too.
8128	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Winsor & Newton are excellent watercolors.  This is the top of the line, in my opinion!
3021	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	AAAAAmazing!!! Works well, I put the iron on the wool setting and hold for 10-15 seconds, make sure the iron has water in it. This stuff saves a ton of time!
7087	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are my favorite pens. I'm a crafter and love these for making handmade cards and adding details to art. Shake 'em up a lot and then they'll work great for a while. Shake again and you're good to go. They are messy, so be careful not to get your fingers in the fresh wet ink and smudge your project. They're not as great for fine detailed writing as the ink runs a bit but they're so beautiful for larger printing and cursive.
Fifth, the cold press refers to the type of surface you paint on. Hot Press is smooth, Not Press is rough. Like Goldilocks, the middle (Cold Press) is just right (as I think a beginner might have the easiest time).
3708	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love th quality of this yarn!  Easy to use in projects.
8574	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is great! I use it to coat and seal my completed acrylic paintings on canvas. I mix it in water until it's dissolved. Then I apply 2-4 thin coats with a wide fine-bristle brush to achieve a beautiful streak-free finish. The more coats you apply, the more gloss you get. It's a wonderful way to finish and protect your works of art. Enjoy!
2101	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I've been having problems with my thumb joint and these were recommended as making it easier to cut. They do. The automatic opening action doesn't require you to use your thumb to force the scissors open. It makes it much more comfortable on the joint.  They cut well. No forcing, clean cuts.

7455	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised at how well this pinking rotary cutter worked!  I have used it to cut the edges of a variety of fabrics, from leather to soft knits.

705	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This is the second review I've written about a PBN by Reeves company. I love the picture, but so far I have had to buy 4 replacements paints at the hobby store, because the paints were so thin they didn't come close to covering the mat and they separated as I stroked them on. Also the paint board is an odd size 15 3/4 by 11 3/4  and there are no frames to match it. I can either buy a custom frame on EBay that will cost me 2times the original cost of the PBN or I can cut the board down and lose a lot of the picture to fit into an 11x14 frame. I had to do this on my other picture and it really took away from the painting.

 Prismacolor markers have beautiful color. The nibs are versatile and work well. Always use the markers before you use colored pencils, gel pens, chalk, crayon, or pastels. It will stain your nibs and possibly ruin them. Even pencil will do this if you go over a dark outline.
5636	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very nice yarn. I was not expecting that the skeins would be so big! Yarn is a little scratchy, but I have read some tutorials for softening the finished product to the point that it could mimic some of the more expensive yarns.  I purchased ranch red (or burgundy), orchid, white, cornmeal, coffee, wildflower, and light blue. I have already started a scarf with the light blue, and I would say that the skein could make two scarves, depending on the stitch, with quite a lot of yarn left over. Not to mention, it came on time. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.

She said" these are the same. I have tried these  to see how well they blend. Water no, because these are Oil pastels. With something like Turpenoid yes these blend well. There are good video on how to use them. Please, do not throw art supplies away, schools can use them. These are not only for adult use, children can use them to. I think they should keep them out of the mouth. Read directions before allowing small children to use them. Folks at nursing homes could use them. Have a good time playing with these.
Works great

They are truly sealed on all sides (except for small are where you insert your palette knife to separate the pages). I've used other blocks that separate right away and it's annoying; I buy blocks for a reason and if they separate before you even use them, may as well buy loose papers. The paper has consistent, even "tooth" and hold the watercolor beautifully while also providing you time to work the paint as needed for blending/blotting, etc.

I have painted with other media before so I can get most every color I need from this set except good shades of purples when I mix colors.

For figuring out the colors, the canvas is painted and there is also a diagram (printed in black and white) in the instructions.  Some of the colors on the canvas were very similar in color and placed right next to each other (causing my loss of a half a strand of red).  Depending on my light source, at times I found it nearly impossible to tell them apart, especially once I had the sections surrounded by other colors.  The printed diagram in the instructions didn't help much either as the outlines are filled with numbers (or in a few cases patterns) that made me refer back to the color chart to get the thread number and then go to the thread organizer to clip the thread...by then I forgot what I was doing.  Finally, I grabbed a set of colored pencils and did a color by number on the flower that was driving me crazy.  This made it much easier for me to follow.
7195	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I keep this by my machine to make quick little cuts or remove bits of string with my rotary cutter. It works just fine. It's also great for making small cuts of fabric or adjustments to already cut fabric.

Saw this yarn and couldn't resist - loved the bright colors.  After a couple of false starts, settled on single-crochet stitch, created a trapezoid shape, seamed the like sides, turned inside-out, rolled up a brim - and voila! - cute little hat.  Okay, so it wasn't what I thought I would do when I started out, but as Bob Ross used to say - a happy little accident.  :)  If you are going to make more than one item - or one bigger than a hat or scarf - you'll need more than one skein.

168	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this "tool" because of it being suggested by the designers of a paper-piecing pattern I just bought.  Being a "prime" member, it was not sent in the time frame of that membership.  Then when I did receive it...the metal tip of the seam ripper was broken off and inside the wooden cap.  When I found that, the shaft of the whole seam ripper piece came right out as if not glued and/or secured in the handle.  I am returning this for a refund, I don't even want to mess with a replacement.  I also informed CT Publishing of the dissatisfaction with this product.  I would suggest not to purchase this as a "real" quilter's tool.  Not good quality.

I sew. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is a connective tissue disorder. Simply put, it means I am MUCH more prone to getting repetitive injuries and arthritis in my hands. If I have to do a big project that involves a lot of cutting, that means a lot of pain.
1334	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These pages are sturdy and slide easily in and out of the plastic without making me think they might slide out when I don't want them to.  Generously proportioned and perfectly sized to fit into the scrapbook - they also had extended holes so if you're not using the Pioneer brand scrapbook, these refills will probably still fit.  They come with expansion screws, which is awesome, and they're of good quality.  Happy with this product and have already re-ordered.

8834	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This bottle is huge - 1 quart (32oz) will last me at least a year of regular inking and painting with it. I was happy to find that diluted with water I could get a good gray scale, because I also use india ink as a tonal value (shading) underneath watercolor paintings. It doesn't react to the salt trick as well as watercolor paint does for creating texture, however it is a great ink for sumi-e or chinese brush painting. It does make beautiful wicking dispersion patterns when drawn on to wet watercolor paper. Great for expirimenting with for fine art.

6008	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	An excellent product, at an excellent price. This is difficult to find in local craft stores, and on my favorite fabric websites, it's $4/yard. I'm happy to order it by the bolt. I've used it for a number of quilting projects and t-shirt quilts. It is A MUST if you're going to make a t-shirt quilt. When using this, you can skip the rotary cutters/mats and just use a good pair of fabric scissors.

Ranger Heat it Tool:  shaped like a small hair dryer, quiet, gentle.  Pro: Quiet. Of the heating tools I have used, this is the quietest. Heats quickly and melts embossing powders and shrink plastic well. Does not generate a strong wind, only a gentle breath so glitters and papers do not fly.  The shape of the unit is comfortable to hold. Con: Cost. More expensive than other heat tools I have used.
I love my snips--they are light, sharp, sturdy, and lock easily. I use them only for light gardening use, primarily floral. They are most handy for trimming all of the flowers my husband brings in from the garden in summer. I am ordering another because I am so pleased with them, and want one for outside and one for inside the house. They are comfortable to hold because of the padded handle. They are smaller than I'd thought but so far they've handled every job I've done with them. I am being careful with them and not using them for heavy pruning (I have pruners for this). I think that if you want some inexpensive quality snips you'll be very pleased with these.
5898	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Could not find this color in stores in my area and needed to finish a project.  Found on line at the right price, and it matched perfectly.
7219	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These have gotten so inexpensive lately that it would be dumb not to get one.  I am currently building flying models and the cost of replacing my balsa work plank has crossed my mind more than once.  If a four-foot work board goes for fifty bucks or so a ten buck foot-and-a-half-self-healing graduated cutting surface sounds like  no-brainer.  I'm glad I got it!

You would think the colors would be the same across all 3 products, but no.
6435	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Awesome paints and a great price for how much you get. Paints look small but they last a very long time.
The availability of Red Heart Yarns is amazing.  From my experience, if I walk into a store that sells yarn then they have Red Heart Super Saver Yarn.  It makes my life so much easier!  I can't say that I have a 100% grade for finding the colors I need since they are so popular with crafters, but usually it only takes two stops for me to find what I need!
9123	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	They cut cleanly and stay sharp.  Perfect for rag quilts.  I bought one for myself and two more for my quilting club!
4101	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with my purchase.  Was delivered within a day or so!
When you turn it on (the buton is either on or off) it's hot instantly.  It's hot a slight blue to it but it is not strong, it doesn't blow anything away.
4438	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this, it's a large skein of worsted weight yarn. I will buy this type of yarn again.
The case is much higher quality than I was expecting, as are the darning needles and the scissors. Use caution with the scissors; they are scary sharp!
Be aware that the price here on Amazon is about retail (instead of the usual deals you might expect) and unless you are adding this on to an order with free shipping you might be better off taking a look at your local arts and crafts store.
3860	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice smooth needles.

The hook material slides well through any type of yarn
7959	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Rich and beautiful. The tube is tiny but a little goes a very long way. Much better than pans too.
6303	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This stabilizer is very thin and can tear during the embroidery process, which can ruin a project. It doesn't have the stability in the hoop either, if it doesn't tear, it shifts and can get lettering off. I would not recommend this. I waited for a sale at my local craft store and bought a different brand. I like Sulky's other stabilizers, but not this one. When it says, "Tear Easy," take that literally, it tears too easy.

X-Acto is the iconic blade producer, and this set offers a utilitarian's variety of shapes and edges, the same as the boxed set.
404	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great
One of my favorite things about this set is the case - it makes for hassle free storage, just close it and put it in the shelf or in a bag and BOOM you're done. 2nd positive to this set is the variety that comes with the blades and 3 "handles" ... the wealth of options these provide make it easy to tailor the "knife" you are using to the project you are working on.
5270	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use this for threading needlepoint needles.  Love it.
198	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This interesting knitting book has chapters titled Hexagons, Pentagons, Spirals, Phyllotaxis, Fractals and Waves. All of the patterns are inspired by natural forms found in nature The author, Norah Gaughan, in the introduction, states that she has "always been torn between simultaneous desires to study art and science". This book is a good example of how she combines the two and creates beauty. As Norah's life progressed, she realized that what she truly loved was knitting and wanted to make a career as a knitting designer. "The work in this book feels like the melding of my science - and art-loving selves...". "Some of the designs in this book are structurally similar to nature's example." This can be seen by the chapter headings themselves. "In some cases, the structure of the natural phenomenon dictated the structure of the garment (the garments made from hexagonal and pentagonal pieces, for instance). In others, the pattern from nature become a surface decoration imposed on the grid of knitting...". "In all cases, working within the framework of six categories of patterns found in nature freed my mind to look at things differently and allowed me to rethink the structure of garment-making."
I have found that as I work with the yarn it gets softer. When washing, I set my washer to delicate and if I use the dryer set it to AIR DRY. Nothing I have made yet has shrunk or twisted out of shape....

2115	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love these. They are my favorite go to. My fingers fit perfect and don't tire so easily.
2379	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are the second pair I own; one is for sewing, and the new for paper cutting.  A very good pair of scissors for a good price, and can be used with a Fiskars scissors sharpener.

They are absolutely WONDERFUL for coloring those nifty highly detailed Dover coloring books, like the geometric designs and the others - they have a million of them, anything you could possibly want to color, and if I could insert a product link, I would, because they are delightful.  In fact, other than drawing her own pictures, this is the primary way my kid uses these markers.

Stacks nicely.  Be mindful:  this is about 3-4" wide.  Small but very portable.
5343	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I lost count of the number of skeins of Red Heart yarn I have bought and used through the years. It is a wonderful product and I have been very lucky with this yarn and the quality. What is dis heartening is the discontinuation of  colors especially in the variegated colors. I make a fleece blanket out of two pieces of fleece and after creating holes in the fleece do a crocheted pattern around the fleece with a variegated yarn and a solid color yarn to compliment the fleece pattern. I have made hundreds of these blankets and both the fleece and the yarn can be washed and dried and remain in good shape. The vast majority of the time I have  relied on coats and Clark red heart yarn but am now finding with dis appointment  the colors are disappearing. There are other brands to chose from and reluctantly I am being forced to buy from these other companies. Be sure when doing a project to buy enough of those colors needed. I would have gladly given a 5 star review if the product was still available as it once was.  :-(

After removing paint from old door/cabinet hardware, we used this to get everything to match.  I purchased sconces which when received were not the color we expected.  We used this product to get them to match our other items.  Highly recommend!
And they work just like regular needles.

I bought another pair, and would buy  more for sure, please don't stop making them!
1237	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	A good set, the problem is that the extra blades do not stay in place when you open and close the case. I solved that problem with glue and double sided tape something that I should not have had to do but now no more problems with it falling out. Also should still be made in the USA, like they were in the past, quality would be better, and I would pay more for better quality, as it is they are okay.

3306	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great yarn, with great color
This set is great for quilting because of the assortment of ruler sizes. The 1" ruler is perfect for adding 1/4" seam allowances and making straight edges on small fabric pieces. The two larger rulers make cutting bigger pieces easy. They are small enough to keep on my sewing table without getting in the way when I am sewing.
I end up starting a whole bunch of projects and it was nice to start one and have something completed rather quickly.

2716	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I didn't realize this came with a pack of the jewelry cleaner and you have to add distilled water to make up the jewelry cleaner.  Having gotten it from a jewelry store in the past, it was already made up for me.  Having used Hagerty Jewelry Cleaner in the past I know it works very well in getting grime off dirty jewelry, real and costume.  And it's great for cleaning gems.  I'm just careful not to put anything like pearls, opals or other porous stones in it.

I was thinking while waiting for the longer cables to be delivered, i could do with connecting the 8" cables first. Now I have to buy the connectors too.
Blending color can be easily obtained with a variety of techniques/items.

2799	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use these to thread my embroidery machine.  The length and flexibility work well.  I could not manage without these.  I would imagine that they would be very helpful in threading a serger, too.
3776	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	An absolute must for the Women's March.  The yarn is just the right color and price point to be able to make several hats.  I think I got about 2.5 from one skein, so I ended up making one hat striped.  The yarn is, as usual, a bit rough to work with as it is acrylic but for a major event where you are donating to charity and have no idea who is going to get it, you definitely want to use acrylic instead of wool because people can be allergic to wool.  Other people don't realize that you have to hand wash some wools or they don't go in the dryer or they're going to felt.  So this is a good choice when you don't know the recipient and you don't know what kind of care your work is going to receive.  The yarn is also easy care and this particular shade isn't quite as "shocking" as some of their other colorways!  I think "Pretty n' pink" is the most neon of their pinks.  Overall, it's a staple workhorse yarn.
7106	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	So disappointed! Brand new, and they don't work- unless you want pool of gold and silver ink on paper. They don't write at all. They scratch, and all the ink comes from me pressing down. The quality is terrible. Too bad.

The instructions for some of the bowls called for a layer each of both Super Solvy and Ultra Solvy. But when I saw the prices, I decided to just get the Super Solvy and try two layers of that. It worked perfectly. I don't know why the thread-bowl author calls for both, it was not explained.

545	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Before this I used a Dremel rotary tool to do all my engravings and it was nearly impossible to write on anything to the circular motion of the bit. This bit does not move in a circle, it moves in a back and forth reciprocating motion allowing much better control over the fine tip. The stock bit seems plenty strong for most materials including tools such as a hammer and several pairs of police handcuffs. Nothing I have used it on seems to phase the bit so far. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple engraver.

But if you can't afford it make sure you always buy 140lb 300gsm or higher paper. Cold press is the norm for watercolor. Hot press is used in certain circumstances but if you're starting out, you need to read labels and do not buy 90lb paper for watercolor. You will hate this style of painting and wonder how anyone does it. Artists don't use 90 lb in watercolor.

3363	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this yarn
5891	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I have used a LOT of RED HEART yarn over the years but never have I used anything this stiff and unyielding. I bought this because I thought it was pretty. I knew I wanted to use it, but wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make. I ended up using it to crochet 5 squares of a 25 square blanket. This was the most difficult yarn I've ever worked with. On the bright side, my blanket is beautiful...
Conclusion:  Love these paint pens.  They work well once you fully understand how to use properly!  Colors are vibrant and highly visible!  We'll continue to use for the foreseeable future.

Some other reviewers mentioned...
2689	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I was disappointed in the performance of this product. Following the instructions carefully, I applied it to 2 of my quilting rulers. I'll concede that slippage on fabric decreased but not very much. It certainly wasn't worth the price.
5924	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Red Heart is a great quality product. My wife ran short on a project she was working on. Got perfect color match so she could finish her project.
4022	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	We bought this because the seam ripper that came with another kit we bought was just really dull. This one works a lot better. It's not perfect, but is sharp enough and does the job most of the time. If anything it might not be perfect for really intricate work. Still, a good investment.
There are seventy-two markers in this box. The markers are double-ended: one has a thick chiseled edge, and the other has a very fine point. These two options allow you to fill in color quickly and create fine details. The ink flows evenly and smoothly with great color saturation. Since I couldn't find a nice storage case for it, I reinforced the box it came in with tape and transparent duct tape so that it keeps its shape over time.
3528	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Oddly enough I've tried different suppliers, quantities, and have noticed a huge difference in quality. This however was a good weight. Not too heavy, not too thin and the hole spacing was perfect for 2 strands thread. Would buy it again but I wish I could get a big role of this weight and not these small patches.
6561	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The ruler work great, but the new coloring they use doesn't do well with old eyes,
742	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	My first water colors.  Works fine as a sample or test to see if you like watercoloring..  It is enough to practice and follow the tutorial videos.  Seems to have all the colors you needs for that.
For a long time, embroidery machines were sort of the gift for the person who has everything. You had to be pretty rich to own one. It takes a lot of computer power to translate a pixel to a stitch, and embroidery machines were incredibly expensive, and subject to all kinds of problems.  NOT a good financial investment for those of us with other claims on our cash; therefore, the machines were largely in the hands of older, more financially well-off individuals, and the designs available for them tended to be cutesy and trite. Singer has done the most brilliant thing by enabling us to put the computers we already OWN to work running the embroidery machine.  You just hook this up to your laptop, and you can convert any file format to run on your machine.  It has taken all the barriers to designing away with the (optional on the CE-100, included on the CE-200)Auto-Punch software, which enables you to convert any .bmp or .jpeg or .wmf or just about any little image file and turn it into an embroidery design.  There is literally no limit to what you can do with it.  And the stitch quality is excellent.  Think about it--your kids can draw a picture, and you can turn it into an embroidery design!  The mind reels!

4625	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Got two different dye lots.
6479	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice box.  Took off one star because the top and bottom are plywood, not solid pine like the sides.  Also the front latch was screwed on crooked.  Otherwise the top and bottom align well, and the hinges are good.  It does need sanding with 220 paper before painting or staining.  If you stain, use a pre-stain wood conditioner (such as minwax Pre-Stain) so that the soft pine does not take stain unevenly and look blotchy.  A wood conditioner is amazing when staining soft woods, makes them come out looking like a hardwood.  Just follow the directions on the can.
The Body of the paint IS heavy, but not quite as much impasto and opacity as I would have hoped for.

8973	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have a concrete Christmas tree stand and also a large composite angel that I keep in my garden. Over the years they have been knocked, bumped and had dings in the finish. I took a chance that Amaco European Gold was the right color. It was. So easy to apply with a rag and you would never even see where a I covered up the dings. Because you can wipe this product on you can easily control how much you use.

3445	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice yarn for my projects.
All patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, "how to do basic stitches," taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.

8694	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	One of the most important things you have to get right in quilting is a 1/4 inch seam. I have had problems with this so I was happy to see that my Brother CS6000i had a 1/4 inch piecing foot. It didn't come with the machine so I purchased it and I must say, this is really wonderful. It has this little runner on the side of the foot that helps you make a perfect 1/4 inch seam. I would recommend this foot for anyone who owns a Brother CS6000i. I am so happy with mine.
The markers do not bleed through most paper, although with thinner drawing paper and ruled notebook paper, you will be able to see the lines of the drawing through the paper anyway, because the color is quite rich.

These blank tabs, however, leave something to be desired. As other reviewers have mentioned, they don't mimic the style of the pre-set categories with spaces for the recipe title, ingredients, preparation, how many it serves, difficulty of the recipe, etc. The extra tabs are just blank spaces with randomly spaced lines to separate ideas (which I just usually ignore anyway). Regardless, I'm glad they have blank space, because some of the pre-set categories (like "cocktails" for me) just don't get used, while I require a lot more space for things like types of frosting.

9968	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am rather new at knitting, and am sometimes bothered by the feel of the knitting needles rubbing on my fingers for extended periods of time. The clover needles, though, are wonderful. They are easy to use, a good length, and do not bother my fingers at all. I feel so much more like a knitter with these needles, as I am able to work a bit more quickly, and without many dropped stitches.  I LOVE having so many sizes at my disposal. I think this is one of the nicest sets of tools that I have ever owned. The bag is very attractive, is very easy to open and close, and keeps my needles securely in place. I have asked my daughters for the set of Clover Crochet Hooks for Christmas.
9513	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The color is indeed very very close to the picture.  What some of us call "Power Fluid Red."  Caron is a fine, soft yarn and my project with cables should look outstanding in this yarn.
1488	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are wonderful! I use them to carry and secure a stack of 20x30" trays that I use for work. There is no elastic "give", so they hold everything together very tightly just how I need them to, and I have never worried about loosing my trays that probably weigh 40 pounds. I have been using them every weekend for about 1/2 a year now and they haven't lost any of their velcro quality. Highly recommended.

8033	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It works.
9958	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Bought these for an intarsia knitting project.  Fairly good at neatly holding the individual strands of yarn and easy to "unlock" yarn to let more out. I do  have to be careful to ensure yarn is locked in place or it does unwind.  Also, if I don't keep the individual strands very short, other strands of yarn want to wrap around alternate bobbins.

I'm familiar with the Warm Company and like their products.
8887	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	This falls short for ink printing sometimes it becomes hard to fully use the brayer even with a little ink it stops rolling.

6239	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The price was right and the writing kit really has everything that a beginner in sketching might require.  I also think it would be appealing to the more advanced sketcher as the kit contains a lot of different pencils.  Great product and highly recommended.
No more searching for the "best" hook -- for me, this one works the best.
3144	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This was for some that needed it.
However, just because the use I had originally in mind didn't work, doesn't mean these are worthless.  I have used them for securing loads to my rucksack as well as other things, and they are very versatile.  I'm not sorry I ordered them and know they will come in handy in future endeavors.  Highly recommend!

7298	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This brand was recommended by my son's teacher so got him this extra pair for the house. I guess I didn't read the description very well because I was under the impression that I was going to get all 4 colors. Oh well, lesson well taken. I don't hold it against anyone but only myself. The scissors for 1 pair are quite overpriced though.

1466	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worked for intended purpose. No problems with the product.
8471	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to rebind my Mom's Bible. It was very useful and easy to work with!
If you have trouble visualizing what colors will work, just flip over the tool and it will show you several options for each color in the pack...no more wondering about color theory, it's all very simplified for easy use...you'll want several!
Now, that said, I really only love the box. I took the color cakes out and filled the empty pans with tubes of Daniel Smith. I'm sure they're good paint cakes for the price, but once you've used them and are ready to upgrade to creamier paint, you can re-fill with tube paint.

4378	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this yard for a future project which I haven't started yet.  The pattern recommended this particular color and brand so I found it on Amazon.  I must say that I've used Red Heart 'Soft" yarn before and have always been pleased with the result so I'm giving this a five star as I did with the yarn that I did use on my other projects. I would recommend it to other crocheters and knitters.
6085	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Perfect!  I love this batting as it's thin and easy to work with but warm enough to make it just right!
Anyway, off I go shopping for a new heat gun because I love embossing powder!

6951	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love Ranger distress inks.  The antique linen is a very pale yellow that gives the paper a nice soft linen look.  Great for making plain paper look vintage.

947	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I purchased it for the box, NOT the paint. I'm not crazy about Cotman , as the pigment (color,) is not very strong . BUT the little box is just what I want to put my own choices of water color paint into the box for travel. It's a cute little box. The paint blocks dropped right out of the little trays , ready for the new paint. Makes me happy.
6148	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Quality batting at a good price. It feels soft and has some weight to it. You can tell by touch and feel that it's some pretty good stuff.

6470	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	If you want a PLAIN NOTHING box then this is it. If you want a pretty box like shown then you won't get it - I got a plain nothing box. Just a square box with a little latch to keep it closed. No handle, no string/rope or whatever is shown. I still have to keep it because it is a rushed present and the person I got it for lives 3 hours away and I had to give it to her plain and ugly. Also the BARCODE WAS STUCK ON THE FRONT of the BOX right in the middle!! which was horrible trying to get it off there. It took a long time and it took off the "laquered" coating no matter how careful we were in getting it off! Really weird.
5979	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I needed this light sage color to finish an afghan and could no longer find it at any of my local stores.  I had to finish the project by a certain date so went to Amazon.com and there it was.  Good price and reasonable shipping charge.  If I could have found it locally, of course, I wouldn't have had to pay for shipping at all, but when you absolutely have to have something, it's nice to be able to find it.  It arrived well before the date estimated by the vendor too.
5852	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	First time uses.  Great stuff!  Excellent price.
3586	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Best I've seen.  The holes are clear and perfect the fabric is white but not terribly bright.  The fabric is stiff and sturdy, good for someone like me who is prone to making a lot of mistakes and needs to rip out stitches often.  The hand (that is, the feel of the fabric) is very nice.  DMC is a well known, well respected brand for needlecrafts and this lives up to its name.
7484	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I don't know if it's this brand or if I just got a bad blade, but it wouldn't even cut through one layer of fabric. It felt dull to the touch. I ended up just throwing it away and using my pinking sheers instead. It was very disappointing, a waste of time and money.
Works just like the demo on you-tube
2817	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Read where people didn't like them but they are just what I needed. They are very thin and light weight, which is what I needed for very small beads with very fine thread. If I were using larger beads with heavier thread, these would not last that long. If you have ever used the small needle threaders with the little foil end and small diamond shape for threading, this is similar but more light weight. The sturdier, longer lasting threaders were too large for my tiny glass beads.

1450	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The item is very easy to use with clear instructions. The 'stock' was fresh, not dried out like you might find in some retail stores...which makes the transfer more difficult. Modestly priced too!

3204	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Very good tool to have around

I tried to find label with thread number (weight) and I don't see it. There is a label that says 100% Polyester 3000 yards TEX27 AA White. From the look of a thread I can say that it is something around 50 x2 or 60 x2, so it's average all purpose thread for medium to light fabric.

I know he will be pleased that they are FISKARS.
9967	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love the case that you store the needles in. Itself is worth the price
4684	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Works like magic for cutting strips, as long as I'm careful in getting both folds aligned. Align folded edge of fabric with line close to me on cutting mat. Then carefully lift selvages and bring toward me to create second fold, aligning with cutting mat line. With Shape Cut upside down, align "top" line of Shape Cut with fabric fold nearest to me. Starting at the right side at 0, I spread my hand flat to keep the Shape Cut in place, cutting and moving my hand across with my index finger "near" the next slot to cut. If you start at the left and cut toward the right, the fabric fold has a tendency to creep out of alignment, which is no different than regular rotary cut rulers. The Shape Cut just lets you cut more at a time without moving the ruler, and they're all the same size!
902	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	this is a very good set of student watercolors. I would recommend this set to anyone wanting to try out watercolor pans. the only reason i gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because the case is a little awkward and the top keeps coming off of my set. The paints themselves are great for a travel set and I will probably buy a new case and keep using these cotman pans in the future.

I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I can see that I will grab for these hooks first when beginning a project. The price for this kit is awesome too. Crochet should be an enjoyable craft, not a cumbersome, dreaded "chore." Give these a try, I'm sure you will be glad you did.

7312	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought several of these for my art classroom.  These are affordable paints that are better quality than Crayola watercolor trays or Prang for school use.  The kids love using them as well.  I use them for grades 3 - 8.  I generally let two people share one wheel stack.  I let them dry out between uses before I put the lid on.  They've lasted several months already and I'm hoping that they will last the whole school year.  Watercolor is one of my favorite mediums and I tend to linger on that longer than any other...so we'll see if they last.  I'll try to update to let you know if they did indeed last the whole school year.  We use them quite heavily.  :)
2334	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	They are scissors, and they came recommended.  My son is 12 and has difficulty with motor skills. I never thought about needing lefty scissors.

I have never face painted anything above a school paw print before but I got this kit for my son just for fun, and so far I have painted a dragon, a rainbow, a full face butterfly, and a full face tiger and the paint doesnt even look dented. It was easy enough that I could do it on a 4 and 5 yr old in very little time.  I like the fact that even though my lines may not be perfect the paint is easy to work with and get it to look great.  I hope to get a bigger set maybe with screw on lids...that is the only complaint I have (but for the cost I knew what I was getting) is that you have to place tiny plastic saran wrap circles over the paint (that it comes with) to help prevent drying out--it hasn't shown any signs of it drying out but I wouldn't want to leave off the plastic and it means you can't throw away the box as that's what it is stored in.  I know it was designed more for the one time "party" use so I didn't dock it in my rating.  I was really really surprised with the quality of this paint for the cost.
I read a few reviews where people ran out of thread before finishing the project, so I was very conservative with my thread and managed to have quite a bit left over.  This was even after a wasted half a strand when I had to cut out and remove a section because I used the wrong color.

I give this kit an A+ for design, use of color and clearly written directions/charting.  If you're new to cross stitch there is no reason not to "exclude" yourself from trying this or any of Dimensions' projects.  If you love the design, I think you'll be motivated to stitch more often and finish your project.  Give this craft a try!  There are lots of videos online and plenty of stitching groups to explore on Facebook.  Have fun!

I liked everything about it and would recommend all of my crocheter friends to the web site.
If it's splitting a lot, you may be pulling the yarn in the wrong direction. RHSS is wound to be pulled from the center. On the label, it has an "A" and a "B" with arrows. On the side labeled "A", make sure the outside strand of the yarn is out of the skein. Sometimes it's worked its way out before the yarn gets to you, but you may have to pull it out. On the side labeled "B", you need to find the other end of the yarn that's in the center of the skein. Pull that out, and knit/crochet from that side. If you did that and it's still splitting a lot, it's possible the label came off somewhere along the way and was put back on upside-down - try putting the center strand back in the middle, and pulling it out through the other end.

Then I bought the Dremel and it was a big difference in the heat and comfort for my hand. It was easy to work with and didn't leave my hands cramped or feeling extremly sunburned like the cheaper one did. It totally changed what I was able to do and made it so much easier. The tips are quality tips too. Also, an extra plus is that I sold the first project I did with this burner and it turned out great, best of the gourds I have been burning. I got an offer and actually hated to see it go.

Good quality paint, easy to work with, has plenty of pallets space. I am in love with it. very lightweight. Note: because the little plastic cubes come out easily, i used the double tape to stick the plastic to the actual case and for the actual paint cubes, I added a drop or two of water to the plastic case, then the paint such to the plastic, so it never comes off now. Also it is good to double tape rather then glue, so you can replace the color with ease when it is finished. Purchase with confidence, on amazon it is the best price also( I checked all the art supply stores they are selling for double the money)

These markers are a bit thicker, but the points are thin, which I love.  You are offered 36 colors, which is another positive point!  If you color on very thin paper, it might bleed through.  So far, the ink has been lasting very well and the pens are not drying out.  I use these more for outlining and smaller sections on my coloring book.

A couple of the colors of the ink were not a good match to the barrel so it is worth the time to create a color chart to use as a guide to avoid possibly ruining a picture or project by trusting barrel color alone..

3188	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Not only is it good for hemming (granted sometimes you need to retack after washing), but I also use it for tacking things together like applique, I can lightly tack a piece while placing the project and can rip it off and move it if I need to.  I use this for lots of things, wouldn't be without it in my sewing room.
6697	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought a tube of this glue a long time ago.  The lid fits tight enough that it is still usable.  I almost always use the fine tip.  It really is quite small but doesn't ever get clogged.  I have found this glue very useful for certain purposes particularly gluing 3D-type embellishments onto cards and scrapbook pages.  The consistency is rather thin but you can build up a bit around the edges of items if necessary as it dries.  It dries rather slow but I use it when I need an adhesive with that characteristic (i.e. aligning embellishments "just perfect").  Although I'm sure you could use it for paper or photos I prefer a tackier glue stick for those tasks.  One thing to note, however, once you have everthing just where you want it you can accelerate the drying process with heat.  I use my embossing tool.

6231	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	These machines are awesome and powerful, but were getting poor reviews when they debuted in 2005 because of a bobbin problem and a software problem.  Singer has moved to fix both problems.  Newer stock of machines have a much-improved bobbin cover, which eliminates the problem of the bobbin getting progressively worse.  A new version of the software has no known problems.  You can update your software at their website, or call customer service to get the problem fixed.  I have found their customer service to be first rate.  Poke around the website for tons more information than is in the books that come with it.

6780	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I used this to make my own dryer balls.  You need to use pure wool, and just roll it up and wash it in hot water a few times to 'felt' it.  Why pay someone else $15 bucks to do this, when you can buy a skein of wool, give the cats a few hours of fun, and roll your own?  This color is dark, but I've had zero issues with the color bleeding onto the clothes in the dryer, all though I did use them just on dark loads the first few times.  I usually add a few drops of essential oils to the balls before each load, it imparts a wonderful light scent to my finished laundry.

3221	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Krylon tends to be somewhat sheer (not opaque) in application so it is good for layering and nuances but not good for full on 1st time coverage.  Gave 4 stars because this particular product advertises primer/ paint in one so it really should cover better first round.  Also Krylon's spray tops tend to clog a lot (as this one did) but if you call the 1-800 number on the can they will send you another can for free.  I find that RustOleum clogs a lot less often- they are a little harder to spray but just get a spray trigger thing for $4 and you will be golden.  Otherwise, color of Krylon is amazing.  Literally like a bright ripe watermelon.

8161	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My first watercolor teacher recommended the Winsor & Newton brand as good, non-fading colors (most of them) and they also aren't as expensive as some of the other watercolors on the market.  I've been using them ever since.  I used to dream of owning every color in the W&N repertory,  but experience has taught me that I don't really need a wide variety of colors.  It's better to mix up my own, but ochre is a must-have for landscape painting.
5245	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use this yarn all the time.  It is a great product.
Keep in mind that this paint isn't just thick, it is heavy body, which means that you need special brushes or palette knives to properly use it. Hog bristles work very well, as do stiff synthetics.
I found that when the product was new it did seem to lessen slightly the tendency of the ruler to slide across the fabric as you apply pressure and cut. However, it didn't seem to last very long. The more I used the rulers the more it appeared that the film had less and less of its nominal at best gripping power. I haven't taken the time to tear it off of all of my rulers--it isn't hurting anything where it is, even if it isn't greatly helping. But as edges start to curl up I peel it off and I have about half of my rulers with it and half without. I admit that as I work with them I have a hard time telling which have it and  which don't.
5208	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	It will be nice in a blanket or scarves with the rich color blends & dye lots all matching.
Power strips
First, the punch is hard to press. For being a good brand in scissors, I thought Fiskars would offer a sharp punch. Wrong. Not only is it hard to punch, but there seems to be a burr or two on the edge, leaving the paper with rough edgesnot a clean cut.
 It has great coverage and works on paper, wood, chipboard, plastic, etc.

The Fractal section has several nice patterns. I really like the Branching Aran Guernsey knit with wool. "I purposefully incorporated some traditional elements of the British guernsey into this design - the drop-shoulder shaping and the simple ladder pattern between the columns of the cables - and like the way they play against the naturalistic, very modern, branching cables." The Serpentin Coat, knit in browns and blues with merino wool, is perfect for an autumn day. "The sinuous motif used on the yoke of this coat is a Dragon Curve, another mathematical fractal." The Triangle Scarf is in a dark beige and knit with a combination of nylon and rayon yarn. It features triangles based on a mathematical fractal called the Serpinski Triangle.

1386	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I've never used this brand before bit thought I'd give it a try. MISTAKE!! Not even a hour after wearing, it started to peel, I plan on trashing the rest so I don't waste any more shirts.
Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (The ones I  DID like are shown in the last two photos)
I purchased this set to use with the "Smitten" quilt pattern from Jen Kingwell. Perfect!

4770	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the denim and the pastel green. Both colors had the same flaws - the yarn split during winding and was tied together, the strands constantly split apart while crocheting, the yarn is much thinner than any worsted I own, it's more similar to baby yarn (dk), so I had to alter the patterns accordingly. The denim was much softer than the pastel green but another reviewer said that after washing the finished product it was much softer. I haven't tried that because the items are made for other people. I'll crochet a sample and update my review with the washing/drying results.

8521	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	After getting back into coloring over the past summer; and going several Facebook groups about adult coloring; I have asked a lot of questions on what is a better medium to use in the adult coloring books and of course there is some mixed reviews or preferences; but I am very pleased with my purchase and I haven't had any problems with it. It all depends on the quality of the paper, thickness, and if the coloring book is single sides or double sided if I would trust markers in it. These so far I haven't had any problems on single sided coloring books with these; double sided; I would trust them though; like in Johanna's books the Secret Garden and her other books.
1830	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are terrific markers. These are so many things you can do with them given the dual tips and the versatility prismacolor products seem to automatically provide. They blend relatively well. On marker psper the lay down is smooth and even, perfect for illustration, or whstever suits your fancy, professionsl or amatuer. People often compare them to copics, and i would say they are difficult to compsre, apples and oranges.

1390	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This was great! HOWEVER, we had a lot of trouble with getting our printer to actually accept this paper. It got jammed almost every time we printed, then the ink that HAD printed got stuck inside the printer, and would leave ink spots on all the subsequent papers that went through it. We tried it on 2 printers, and eventually gave up. We did get a few good sheets out of it, but it was not as easy as it seemed. However, this might just be a problem with our printers, and not the paper. Also, its really cool cause Avery has a website that will create the template for you! All you have to do is upload your image, and it will flip it for you, and then you can adjust the size, position, etc.
Truly a versatile little tool.  If you're going to be cutting anything over about 4-5mm I would definitely look at getting the 45mm one instead.  Otherwise the smaller 28mm should suit you.

I love blocks for a couple of reasons. First is that the stretching of paper or taping is eliminated. Just flip back the cover and you're ready to go. But the other thing I like is that there is a protective page inside the cover that protects the first piece of paper and this way you won't have to worry about fingerprints and oils from hands ruining that piece by causing a resist of watercolor. I can't tell you how many times I purchased a pad of paper in a store and people handle the pages  ruining it for me. I have stopped buying books in stores because of this. But if you must, then choose from underneath the stack! You may have better luck that way.

The 88 size is the finer tip pen, if you want a larger tip then the 68s are what you need. The great thing about these is that the colors in the 88 set and the 68 set are labeled with their color number, and they match. So you're guaranteed to be using the same color if you need a fine tip and a larger one.

Some reviewers say they've had problems with the pans falling out; I have not. They are securely set in the case. Maybe Winsor & Newton addressed the problem. One reviewer said it took her two hours to unwrap the cakes and put them in the case. This has to be an extreme exaggeration. I've certainly had worse inconveniences than unwrapping cakes of watercolor.

If you're new to watercolour painting and want an affordable set that is reliable without costing the earth and moon, then this is the set I would recommend.  The colours may not be as intense as the professional series which is really pure pigment, but they are still very vibrant and fluid and to gain the intensity of the professional series you will have to layer more.  I particularly like this set because of  its portability and range of palettes. You can easily scale up from small to large paintings because of the deep wells in the second pallet.  With the 12 tubes that come with this set you can make up to 150 colours which I think is ample for any beginner.  Just remember even with the best watercolours in the world your paintings will always be dull if you only use poor quality paper.  With this set, a good brush and a good quality watercolour paper you can't go wrong.
6993	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The earth tones of the brown range in this line are absolutely exquisite!  I use them for all manner of antiquing work.  My only complaint is that in my experience, they tend to go dry much faster than other brands of ink pads.

The paper is a great weight. It's heavier than regular copy paper - maybe more like construction paper - but much nicer. It has a sheen on one side and a light texture on the other. If you're working with paints, chalks, pencils, or oil pastels, I bet you'll get a great effect.

But this is a great heat gun and I'm glad we've added it to our supplies. It's also good for kids- I always feel a little apprehensive with the old-school heat gun because the metal ring on the edge gets burning hot, and this one is much easier for small kids to use without getting burned- the shape and size is that of a hairdryer, so they intuitively know how to use it.

So far, it feels nice to work with and I'm happy with what I do with them.
To soften overnight with fabric softener use one cap full of softener to one bucket of water, mix well, dunk the item in and out of the bucket turning as you go to make sure it is fully coated.

609	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I recently bought these water mixable oils and I'm sorry to say they are awful. I have always painted in oils, but hadn't painted in quite a few years so I bought fresh ones. I figured as long as I was buying new paints I might as well try these since they seemed like they would be way less toxic and smelly. Let me just say these paints are not good. At all. The first time I used them I hated what I painted and blamed it on being rusty since I hadn't painted in so long. Well, I just tried to paint with them again tonight and it's definitely not me. They are nearly impossible to mix (I tried the correct medium and tried plain water, both resulted in gloppy paint that never fully mixed), so if you can't get them to mix properly you can just imagine how hard they are to control on a canvas; you can't control them. Maybe if you are a super abstract artist who prefers gloppy, thick paint these will work for you, but I need my paint to be very smooth and easy to control. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on these.

9388	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are so much fun! I am soooo glad that I purchased these.

Shipping was great arrived in pristine condition.
9553	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Caron has always been one of my favorite yarns, as even their regular weight yarn is amazingly soft, providing more diversity possible.  These colors are brilliant, and so soft it would be perfect for a cowl, or gloves, something close to the skin. Excellent, Excellent yarn.
One of the more cool parts that I hadn't even noticed until several months of using this journal is there's a mostly blank index in the back so you can fill in your recipe titles and have an easier way to find what pages things are on later.

On scrapbooking/altered art projects it just cannot be beat for ease of use, blending ability and colour.  I know many are not fond of it for stamping, but I believe it depends on the effect you're looking for.  I use it for creating antiqued Christmas tags and it turns out beautifully.

The wooden knitting needles were very rough and snagged the yarn when attempting to use them.  I had to take sandpaper and sand them relatively smooth.  The points at first are pencil-point sharp so I had to sand them down a bit too.  Just 8 tiny skeins of yarn, a cheap plastic sewing needle, 1 pair of very course wooden knitting needles, and a crochet hook are all you get, including some hard to follow directions.  I ended up using other knitting directions instead that were much clearer and easier to understand.

6443	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I've been using these for years. These packs are  fun and convenient as anything. BUT they get super messy quick, run out quick, and tend to be blurry for line work.
110	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love the style, format and colors for the patterns in this book. I love that each block can be made in a 6" or 12" size. The patterns for using the made up blocks are ones I will actually make. I hate getting a book and not liking most of the patterns...this one is 100% LOVE... The spiral format is nice for being able to open to a page and leave it open. After going thru the book, I looked up the author on you tube, Love her simple ways without fancy sewing equipment. Using vintage irons, and graph paper for making new patterns. Great tutorial on making simple boards for your patchwork squares on the go, auditioning fabrics and keeping your pieces in order to bring to the sewing machine. I feel like I found a new cyber friend! I recommend this book and I am a city girl...who is country at heart.
3717	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worked better than expected, easy to slide your fabric thru to start.  Once you have the fabric thru the slot, lay the iron on top the bias tape and a pressing cloth, but the metal up to the side of the iron and just keep pulling pull the tape underneath.  I made over a 100' of tape for vines for an appliqu project in less than one hour.

3125	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Red Heart is always great yarn.  This is my go to yarn for aghans & cardigans.  It was a little darker than the same color yarn used for a current project, picked out of a box of yarn but it works for me!  Don't know how many years I had the prior yarn & the yarn people will tell you to make sure you pick enough for your project.  Oh well, it still works!  Very happy & very grateful that Amazon sells this yarn - live in the boonies so no shopping choices!

3647	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love it
258	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I refer to this all the time.  My color sense is not the best and this really helps me decide on color combos.
Like most heating tools (hair dryers, paint strippers, embossing tools, etc) the first couple times you use the tool it may smoke and make a burning smell. It is normal as the extra oil on the motor is burned off. Kinda smells a bit and may be a bit scary. But this stops. and from that point on the unit works as advertised.  The Heat It tool is a joy to work with and worth the price.
5753	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this yarn for my Grandson.  I appreciate the quick service and product, but instead he wanted the Red!  Thanks, I used this yarn in doll clothes for my Granddaughters.  Thank!

3924	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I thought these were a thing of the past until I had to rip out the seams of a very well made pillow. I tried everything I could find to rip the seams and finally gave up and ordered this. When it arrived I went to work and had all of the seams ripped in a coupe of minutes. Never again will I waste my time with other objects. You can't reinvent the wheel and there's no need to as long as these are on the market! Super sharp and comes with a clear cover. This is a must have for anyone who sews or crafts. I keep it handy in my sewing box now so it will be at hand at a moments notice.
2619	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great size, Great quality so pleased with my purchase arrived fast and well packaged / like the other reviews I wished you did not have to waste so much in the begining

9403	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Ranger makes the best craft supplies, ever! This embossing powder is no different. Just made 25 baby shower invitations which had a small detailed sentiment stamped on. Used the embossing powder to make them pop, they popped and looked gorgeous. If you are a card maker/stamper and have not used embossing powder, you don't know what you are missing! Price wise, you can usually find it for cheaper on Joann's website or local craft shop.
5121	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great yarn!
Another thing to note is that the Chalk inks tend to be a little dry going on- they are definitely not juicy. So I recommend buying a re-inker along with this pad, just so you can keep the pad really inked well. But I like the Chalk inkpads matte, dry finish. It makes the stamped images look like someone drew them lightly on the paper instead of BIG BOLD STAMPED IMAGE.

3432	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Although this wasn't the color I thought it would be, it is a very nice green metallic.  I was hoping for a good dark green, but so far I haven't found one in craft paints, at least within my budget.  And I do prefer the acrylic paints, for the cleanup ease.  FolkArt is a good company, and their products are terrific.
9429	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Bright, beautiful, works up well!!
1000	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a cute compact traveling watercolor set, with quality Windsor Newton paints, which have vibrant pigments. It has 14 removable half wells with the basic colors. When used up they can be replaced or the half wells are fine for adding tube watercolor to. The bottom pulls out for another mixing area and it has a VERY small well for dipping in clean water which removes and attaches to the side of the mixing area, leaving a hole to place thumb through for ease of holding. I really can't wait to use it in the field. At that point I will update my review! Oh, also I bought this through Amazon because it saved me a few dollars from store prices.
8903	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is a good brayer for the cost.is sturdy and withstands daily abuse.  Good for applying ink to various surfaces

5992	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The Dimensions Moon Dreamer Needlepoint Kit is absolutely beautiful.  While it is only 5 x 5"  it makes quite a nice statement when finished.  I purchased the other kits in this celestial series.
3456	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered 10 skeins of this yarn and every skein has two to three places where they had tied it together.  I cannot use it for certain projects I wanted to because of that.

3575	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I tried to use this paint on a dark stained craft box. It turned out silver. The best looking metallic silver I have ever seen. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I have ordered several different metallic silvers, and none of them actually looked silver. It stencils beautifully and actually my project turned out Great! I still would like a champagne, but alas, I might be out of luck. Arrived on time.
9421	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worked great for my project!
2800	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It works just like a regular hand-held hole punch, only it makes perfect heart-shaped holes instead of round. It also has a comfy rubbery grip on the handles. Easy to use and pretty strong, can easily punch through cardstock (like index cards or greeting cards).

of fabric a little annoying!  I saw several sets of rulers, but I am not that prolific yet - I just needed a short ruler
Amazon was very helpful on the return of this item.
As for working with it: okay, so it's not cuddly soft like 100% merino, but I've noticed in the last few years that RHSS has become softer. Some colors feel softer than others. After a washing (or a few), the yarn does soften and even "fluffs" up a little bit. The only drawback I've noticed is on particularly humid days in the summer or before a thunderstorm, the yarn gets really squeaky on my needles or hook, and I have a hard time working with it. But other than that, it really doesn't deserve the bad reputation that it has among the knitters of today.
837	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This tiny little set is great!  I love it.
8897	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is my first brayer tool. I had to have one to properly ink my large intricate stamps. What a difference this has made. The stamps I have that just don't ink perfectly, that don't get all-over inking when I stamp them directly on the pad, the brayer solves that problem. I have an inexpensive uneven white stamp pad that I haven't been able to use because it messes up the stamps every time. When I loaded the brayer with white ink and applied it to my stamp with the brayer,  it came out perfect each time. I clean the brayer with baby wipes. Very easy. All the reviews pointed to this brayer brand and they were right. This is the one. Happy Stamping
7454	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great
9276	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this heat tool.  Great for embossing or helping paint to dry quickly.  It's well made and practically silent compared to all others I have tried.  I bought a cheaper brand first thinking I could save money - boy was I wrong.  After the cheaper one melted itself I had to throw it away  and buy this one.  In the end, going with a cheaper model cost me more money.
3481	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Love this yarn. I buy from Hobby Lobby. Have all the brands and then some.
2900	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Fine

524	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great little tool. Powerful and effective in etching and egg blowing crafts. I did buy additional drill heads to make this more universally applicable to my craft needs. Holding the drill and turning it on and off are difficult while multi-tasking in craft work so I cannot give it 5 stars. Also, it is difficult to adjust the changing drill heads due to the very deep and small screw that is the sole means of holding the drill heads in place. A good starter tool for craft jobs.
MY HANDS AND THE CAN.  THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING- GOOD I COULD SAY ABUT THIS PRODUCT.  READ MY REVIEW
(Thankfully these crumbs are not easily airborne nor do not all easily fall off the working surface even when blown onto. I also have trouble imagining the bits getting easily inhaled.)
9658	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is beautifully soft yarn.  I made a shawl for my daughter for Christmas and it turned out beautifully.  And I love the fact that this yarn can be washed and dried by machine - you don't have to hand wash items made with it.  I was very pleased and plan to buy more in the future.
2427	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I was dismayed when this pencil arrived in a simple cardboard envelope. It was tightly in there, but that doesn't stop the shipper from throwing it, piling heavy things on top of it, etc. After reading other reviews of these pencils I knew they are fragile inside. And indeed, when I attempted to sharpen the pencil, I had to resharpen it 3 times (using the Prismacolor sharpener) before I could get it to a point because the lead was broken and kept falling off. Really disappointing, but I'm sure I'll enjoy using the rest of the pencil as it is a pretty color.
8234	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Used for long bench cushion slip covers, holding up well.

476	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is a good multi-purpose tool, but it needs some directions. I burned myself when I first used it looking for an on/off switch, only to find it was already hot! Figuring out how to put the cutting blade on was not easy, either. A directory of the different heads and what they do would also be helpful. As I am learning how to use it, I like it.
5389	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This was supposed to let us thread our chenille needles, but it doesn't work very well.  A thinner needle threader does a much better job.

823	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is my first Winsor & Newton Cotman palette! I am an artist but i have always stuck to drawing pencils and acrylics. I decided a few months ago to try it all! After watching reviews on what paints do what and what to expect; I came to the conclusion that this is a good starter set. I got this a set of Koi, a set of Sakura Gansai Tambi and a tin of prima. I am surprised to find that I love the manipulation of color through water. Completely different than acrylic which has the same density of pigment through out. Also the building of color from light to dark is opposite from what I usually do which is to lay down my darks and fill in light..but since watercolor artists frown upon using white, you just go backward with much forethought and planning about how you want it to turn out. Anyway...This set of watercolors has rich pigment. They have a lovely flow. I love the field kit palette the removable mixing trays make it easy to paint and to clean up. For the price, you really can not go wrong with this set!
4930	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	What can I say about yarn?  Mostly it is a personal preference and I use several brands and weights depending on my project.

If you have seen the yarn prior to purchase and know what to expect as far as color the 6 oz Skein is a good value.  Just know that some of the colors pictured may not be accurate.  In the future I will order only one skein of a color I've not seen in person before purchasing large quantities for a specific pattern.

8105	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	You'll never regret buying professional grade watercolor paints.  Winsor and Newton is the brand I continue to purchase because of their reliable pigments.  I use them right out of the tube, but it's easy enough to buy empty 1/2 pans, then fill them and create your own watercolor palettes.  I'll continue to buy Winsor and Newton watercolor paints, because who doesn't love playing and painting with a new color?!

7664	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This Liquitex Heavy Body Acrylic is nearly odorless, in a good sized tube, and lasts a long time. The white is a color that I use so much, it's great to have extra on hand. I prefer acrylics for coverage, texturizing and ease of cleanup, and Liquitex is a well-respected brand. This particular Heavy Body mixes well with even my cheapest acrylics, providing a nice base for backgrounds or adding weight to my thinner stock. I find I don't need to use much of this paint- a little goes a long way because the pigments are very concentrated.  I highly recommend this company and this particular (Heavy Body) weight of paint.

7613	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The Olfa rotary cutter is being used to cut heavy nylons and webbing that stretches.  The downward pressure used to cut the webbing reduces the stretching and keeps a good straight line cut.  It will cut multiple layers (within reason).  The blade is keeping a good edge after many months but see the need to sharpen or replace the blade after very heavy use.  This is a great tool for the hobbyist and professional.
8832	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice quality.
I'm still experimenting with using pastels on different kinds of paper and other surfaces; so far the only one I have rejected is plain notebook paper (too smooth?). Love drawing with these in my sketchbook and also on canvas. The Sakura website has a lot of very cool techniques to try out with these pastels; I really like the dotting and masking drawing methods.

4938	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	While it may seem slightly rough to the touch it does get better with time. My favorite way to soften it is to wash with a good fabric softener then dry with dryer sheets. It's very durable for heavily used or frequently washed items. I had a blanket given to me made from my grandmother, using this yarn, and even though it's very old it still looks amazing. I really love how the colors are always consistent because the do not have dye lots!

I used this color in a circular tote bag that I made.  It was one of several colors but it made up most of the base of the tote.  I used a crochet method that was similar to fair isle knitting to get a pattern into a band of the bag.  I then felted the whole thing and it came out fantastic.  I have been using that tote for years and it washes fantastic and holds my veggies when I go to a farmer's market.  It too six skeins of yarn to finish the whole thing so keeping the price down per skein was important.
CONS:
7392	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Good paint - nice pigment. Very thick.
I work with PMC clay and these knives come in very handy.

This water soluble ink is a blast to play with, every paper and surface picking up the colour differently ( so play, play, play and experiment before getting into your project!).  I even use it on wooden frames and shadow boxes and give it a good heating with a heat gun after I've found the desired effect.  After that, some sealant and you're set to go... PERMANENT!
6566	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great tool, waiting on my gripper for ergonomic use..
6271	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love this product. I use it on every single embroidery/applique project I do. It keeps the stitches from sinking into the fabric and helps the designs stitch clean and neat. MUST HAVE for anyone with an embroidery machine.
9253	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Of course if it's Ranger, it's good.  Just exactly what I wanted.
9711	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Very sharp with even, smooth action.  Only problem I see so far is the metal does not extend all the way around the handle.  The description says it's virtually unbreakable, and I hope they are.  Tried it on 4x thick upholstery material and it was not a problem.  So far so good!
720	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Strathmore 400 Series Visual Watercolor Journal and these watercolors to go with it to do a traveling watercolor journal. I love them but wonder where to get refill colors when one runs out.
8787	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Its a piercing foot and does its job. Nothing really more to say. When you have a sewing machine, you are kind of stuck buying the attachment that the sewing machine company makes for that model.

1.  The handle was comfortable and didn't cause indentions in my hand.
A couple of suggestions:  don't try to squeeze the last bit of finish out of them or you'll end up with bits of foam in your work piece. That's not the brushes fault; it's the result of too much pressure.  Also, it's a good idea to treat it like a brush; put a little spirits or thinned finish in it before you dip for you first application.  Also, tip it off like you would a brush.  There's a temptation (don't ask me how I know) to use these as a sort of endless reservoir of finish so you never have to go back to the can but it ain't so.  Use these like a brush and they'll do a good job.
8581	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Another great Golden product.  Fast shipping, great price, and Golden is pure quality.
7805	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	cheap letter stickers, there are no straight lines, every letter looks like it was cut out with a guy with a serious shaking hand, they are not very sticky, and they fall off the backing easily.  don't do as they advise and pull off the unused portion so only the letters are left, because it willl pull off half the letters and periods, commas and all the small stuff.  I don't know if its because they are only 1/2 inch, aybe they would be cleaner cuts if they were biger letters, I don't know, it seems like they use a melting process to cut the letters out?  for what I need this is good enough, but if you are looking for something nice and clean, find a different brand.

1229	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice set. It comes with a variety of tips for all your cutting needs. The box it comes in is handsome. Each piece clips into a plastic retainer in the box that has a tendency to slide out, but it does its job.
6216	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is the most amazing tool ever! If you are not perfect and make the occasional mistake, this is the tool for you! It takes paint off so easily! It is like an oil paint eraser! I love it! It has a wedge shaped edge that you can almost use like a squeege. It also has a pointed edge for very fine detail. In wet paint, you could scratch out your name to sign it if you like too. Very handy tool to have around you at all times, well when painting that is.
7147	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good paint.
Maxilock also makes a "Stetchy" thread which is the same as a wooly nylon, for soft and stretchy projects and for making a decorative edge. and a varigated version of the all-purpase thread.
- It's not easy to clean the palette completely
I cannot recommend this product highly enough - except that - it not a toy and I have to scratch my head and wonder why it is catagorized as such.  If you are looking for paper to give to a child for watercolor work, I'd go with something less elaborate and expensive - say, one of the many watercolor pads that Strathmore makes.  If your child is gifted, and somewhat accomplished as a watercolorist, they will find Arches paint surfaces to be a pleasant step up.
7109	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	At first I was amazed by the silver marker: you can get a very smooth and clear line without much effort, and the distribution of metallic pigment is even. The golden one was a catastrophe: on the third shake after it stopped writing yet again, and I was trying to make it as shiny as the silver one, lots of ink came out all over the place, also on fabric. You cannot get it out with neither water nor alcohol even immediately after s spill.
1118	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great product for crafters and work! Love the case it comes in too! Highly recommended for anyone who loves their knives keep in one place and protected. No losing this one! I would buy this again!
457	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Does what it is supposed to do. Has held up very nicely. VERY SHARP!Would have been nice if it came with some kind of cap or some protection for accident prone people like myself, but you can't always get what you wantlol. I would recommend.
6363	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Very colorful but hard to work with for me.  Very stiff to knit with.  Not a lot of flexibility with this yarn.
3681	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	VERY SHARP!! Great replacement for the million year old very dull one I had! The only thing that really annoys me is the design of the cap. You should be able to take the cap off and stick it on the other end (like a pen cap) and this one doesn't! I have to lay it down in my workspace and just like everything else I lay down, then I have to find it.
4381	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this stuff! I use it when making furry hats or hats to look hair and it's perfect!

I've used it for everything from cutting gum paste to crafts (of course I have just one particular blade for gum paste that I use for nothing else).  My only complaint about this is the case it's in is garbage and it leaves blue EVERYWHERE.  I opened it and just from opening it my hands were solid blue, it's leaving blue on the counter where I had it sitting.  Other than that minor issue, I'm really happy with this set!

The kit contains a great assortment of colors that are very easy to mix if needed. Also, having a mixing palette in the lid is great for painting when you are traveling. Lastly, the pocket brush is not amazing, but I used it to paint the suspension cables of the bridge and the result was satisfactory.
7775	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is very thick and creamy heavy body paint. If you want a similar product for a cheaper price, go to Dick Blick and try their heavy body artist acrylics which can be mixed with any acrylic paint or medium for a thicker paint. I use the heavy body paints to mix with regular acrylics to make stencil paint. Be sure to mix with enough acrylic to make it thin enough so it does not take all the bristles out of your stencil brushes. Practice on cardboard until consistency is similar to stencil paint.

Red Heart has always been a favorite yarn for many years, but can be a bit scratchy and abrasive due to its all acrylic content.  It is a good alternative for those allergic to wool.  It is machine washable and dryable, and holds its shape well.  It's a more inexpensive yarn than most, so it is a good yarn for beginning knitters and crocheters to start with if they want to build a stash on a budget.  I ordered this particular skein online because it was cheaper than Walmart.com's price, and the local craft stores were out of this particular color combination.

I hated the soft, fade prone, horrible colored junk I had and remember having used all my life with few exception. Now I have a nice quality paper in better colors for all my project needs.

This went well with the children & the parent's were delighted & impressed with the idea. We used some on my kitchen table during the holidays for the grandchildren to use during their cookie frosting time. It worked great when they wanted to do Play-Dough & when they finger painted on it we cut out & saved their little piece of art. For me it was money well spent on this product.
2152	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I used these for over 10 years until my husband misplaced his pipe cutter and used them on 1/2" sprinkler line.

1047	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this elsewhere but I had this pack when I was a kid so naturally I wanted to buy the same pack and I see I am not the only one who bought these for adult coloring. I don't see much difference in the cardboard to be honest as its as flimsy as I remember, its really something you have to take care of, for kids I recommend a crayon box or plastic box as the box no matter what will get tattered pretty quickly. Its goes without saying that crayola is the gold standard in crayons as other crayons just don't perform like these do, I wouldn't recommend buying any other brand. The pack contains the same colors you remember as a kid along with new favorites like inchworm, laser lemon and macaroni and cheese. There were some specialty metallic crayons in mine along with some Gel FX crayons that I really liked and wish I could find more of. This is the same exact crayon you knew and loved as a kid and it still smells the same and as good as ever. It comes with the sharpener on the back too. It was fun seeing all the new colors and old favorites. This pack probably offers the best value for the price point. I encourage everyone young and old to buy a pack of these as this is clearly a product for all ages and you will not be disappointed.
729	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is by far, my favorite watercolor set. It's from the Cotman series, meaning that the paints are primarily for students, but they are excellent in quality and in pigment.

AND it comes in different sizes, but would recommend this one first as handles are mostly thinner on our paint brushes, might try the original size next but seems that the handles need to be really thick to work and none of my paint brushes have handles that thick.
1497	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I originally bought these for use as leg straps for a fixed blade knife sheath.  Although they worked, they are a bit thin and tend to roll up under moderate usage.  I ended up getting the leg straps for the Gerber LMF II and using them in that capacity.

8394	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I almost didn't buy these after I read the one-star review, but I really needed a pair and didn't want to spend a ton of money. (I can't understand why pinking shears are so expensive!). I am really glad I gave these a try. I don't know if the other reviewer got a defective pair or if the design was changed, but these are plenty sharp and I haven't had any issues with fabric tearing. I also don't consider these lightweight - these are thick, solid and hefty enough to get the job done without my killing my hands. Other pairs I've used required a great deal of hand strength to cut, these are almost as easy to use as regular scissors. I've used them on thick upholstery-weight velvet fabric, regular cotton fabric and lightweight satin - all with equally excellent results. The only two (very) minor issues I've found: I am unable to open these fully, but for someone with larger hands or longer fingers, this may not be an issue. Also, there is no padding to the handles, so a lot of cutting can cause minor fatigue, but nothing bad. Not worth deducting a star - especially for the price. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would gladly buy these again. Great deal!
8672	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I have used this elastic foot three times for making bathing suits.  The stretch of the elastic only works when set on "4".  Anything less does not stretch the elastic for application.  This may be due to the knit elastic that I am using.  Fortunately, the setting "4" seems to be just the right amount of stretch I need.  I see myself just doing it with the regular foot and stretching the fabric and elastic if I need a tighter fit.

4449	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I do a lot of knitting and crocheting and Lion Brand is my favorite.
If anyone has a recommendation about something that has really worked for them I would be interested. My complaint about the little rubber feet is the fact that the ruler doesn't sit flat on the fabric and the fabric can shift a little as you cut--especially at the edges or folds. The sandpaper dots grabbed the fabric too well at times, making repositioning of the rulers difficult, and they are not transparent, so wherever you apply them they obscure the lines on the rulers. This is especially bothersome on the smallest rulers. I had hoped this product would solve my problem, but I will keep looking.
4738	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is a medium yarn and a bright yellow versus the soft lemon shades.  It has more body to it than many of the baby yarns I use and it knits up extremely well.  The finished product softens after a pre-wash ....until then I think the garment or blanket might be a little rough on baby's skin.

A color for every theme and comes in a variety of tube sizes depending on how quickly the artist will use it. Let's face it--some colors are used more than others on the artist's palette so it's nice to have several sizes. Heavy body colors well, and depending upon if an added medium is used, brushstrokes can be shown as part of the artist's style, if desired.
Get this, you will love it.  Price can vary quite a bit, so shop smart, and happy painting!!

There are a few things that make them 4 stars rather than 5. The pens have a few that are very close to each other, so much so that you can't really tell the difference when using them. This is mainly in the blues. Also, while this is a nice set, I would love to see a blender pen included to help blend colors. These pens fit well into small coloring spaces and provide even coverage.

I followed the instructions and even printed off a page to practice on a piece of fabric (The 4x4" piece worked WONDERFULLY) So I tried my full page logo. Read the instructions one more time just for good measure, noting that ironing time for a full page should take about 3 minutes. An hour and a half later, I'm still struggling to get an edge, any edge, of the paper to peel off of the plasticy stuff that the transfer is made out of. I finally get one edge to peel off and the transfer tears in the middle. I carefully place the bit that tore back on the shirt and iron over it again. Finally success! sort of. the edges that I painstakingly ironed with all of my weight against it are still peeling and frayed.

We wrap with the rough side facing out, and it's a nice matte look. Some tape has a hard time sticking, but we've figured out how to make it work. We're going to add blue and brown to the mix at some point.

6861	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to edge a Tarot deck I trimmed. It was so easy to use. Just take your time, I smeared some onto the face of the cards, you have to allow it time to dry. If you notice the smear you can wipe it off but even though I see it, it makes it look slightly aged. The edges look more used and worn it.  I wish there was a gilded gold.
6575	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I'm a new sewer and this was perfect with a small cutting mat I bought.  The squares perfectly match up to the lines on the mat.  It was surprisingly solid, not flexible at all, and overall better quality than what I was expecting to get.  Other reviewers said it slipped around, but as long as you put light pressure with one hand it stays in place very well.
Other than that, the yarn is fairly soft, easy to work with, a pretty shade of gray and inexpensive.  Worth it, if you don't mind spending HOURS winding hundreds of yards of yarn balls and untangling knots instead of working on your project.  I mind greatly.

It also holds up well in the washing machine.
1803	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are real oil pastels that are affordable, colorful and well made. Each of the 28 color sticks feel solid when held in hand and spreads well on paper and canvas surfaces. These are rich and chunky, therefore if you use paper, it should be heavier weight than thin ones. The pastels are easy to mix and at the typical prices this is sold, they are a great value and offer lots of hours of enjoyment. This could be used equally by kids and adults, but for kids I recommend at least to be four or five years old as the colors are not easy to erase if they use these on places you prefer not to be permanent.
The tops are hard to take off at first, after using a couple times the tops seems to loosen.

8069	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	And a good price. If yo can wait for the delivery, it's such a better deal than going to the art store. And mine din't even have Venetian Red. I use Light Red as a basic skin tone when I'm doing figures and Venetian Red is a slightly redder hue that is a great addition to my flesh palette. And I never use anything but W&N Artist colors. Nothing else adds up, in my opinion and it's easily worth the price.
Other reviewers warn that these are easy to lose, but I've got that solved, too.  They're magnetic, so I use my big blue needle and pin magnet as a permanent storage place...actually, I got a second one specifically for these threaders, but you don't have to.

8741	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this foot after I bought my new brother machine. I'm new to quilting.

I wish I had gotten one sooner.
This pack of Pentel color PENS set of 36 are great with a smooth ink flow (no sticking) and bright vibrant colors.

2598	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Wasted more than we used. Doesn't last long and very expensive.
I can only find one Con to say about Red Heart Super Saver Yarn:  Some of the skeins seem to be "scratcthy" and some seem to be "smooth".  I'm not sure if I've just missed the memo as to which are softer than others, but there is definitely a difference between some colors and others.  The good thing though to fix this is that most regular fabric softeners can soften the yarn, but if fabric softeners aren't used, you can definitely tell the difference.

There were some knots in my yarn skein though. My only major issue is that its not as soft as other colors in the super saver color palette. Its very rough and hurts my neck when I where it. Very itchy and scratchy on my skin. I'm trying to use a loose stitch now to see if that helps. I'd recommend this yarn though. Great buy for the price!
This is the perfect solution.  A Must have!!!  And it comes in different sizes and colours.  I have mine assembled and then I mounted each one on a block of styrofoam to make it even taller.  Just cut in a cross and used glue to keep it there.  I will decorate the styrofoam to make look better LOL
3391	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great quality. Worth the price
The elastomer handles have good grip, allowing you to loosen up and abandon that painful death grip you have to use with traditional steel hooks. The hook itself extends through the handle; it is not just a hook tip glued into a handle, so no worries about the tip popping off. Each hook has a plastic cover to protect the hook tip while not in use.

2445	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	These little scissors are great for what I bought them for - cutting curves and other small places where larger scissors are awkward.  They mostly live up to what I expect from Fiskars, in that they are comfortable to hold, make clean, precise cuts, and the spring action makes them easy to use.  Unfortunately, the orange locking button broke off after only a few days of use, and now they cannot be stored in the closed position.  I will be able to deal with that so I will not be returning them.

1942	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Lots of people of switching to copic markers and I totally understand the why - but PRISMACOLOR MARKERS are still my favorite.  I suggest to my art students (adult) when they begin the process of adding color to their drawings and designs.  The versatility of the double end (one a large wedge & the 2nd a fine tip) actually doubles the count to me (so 24 markers = 48 usable ends).  My favorite characteristic of these markers are the layering of hue upon hue and use for highlighting, shadows.  I often use these markers for both designing the finished product of book illustrations.  They are also available in gradations of grey and flesh . . . perfect for monochromatic and portraiture.
3769	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My sewing instructor recommended Gutemann. She showed me the differences of good and no-so-good thread. I really satisfied with this brand so far. It produces beautiful and quality works and doesn't leave lints inside the sewing machine.

The colors are really bright and the sheen wasn't too slick. I find the ones that remain shiny aren't my favorite, as I want it to look less like a transfer and more like a print when done. So after 3 washings, I am not very pleased that the whole sheet transfer print is still stiff and kind of shiny. The partial sheet seems to be less so.

1377	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great little scissors.  These have a nice grip.  I like the pointed tip, they're not too pointed to actually be sharp but much better than the rounded tip.  If my toddler picks these up, I don't worry too much about her causing herself harm while I try to steal them back.

I opened the tube to verify which color it was and it was Winsor Green Blue shade just like the tube stated. Winsor Newton are great products I use them extensively for my watercolor and oil paintings. Winsor Newton products are held to a very high standard and I equate Winsor Newton with quality. Winsor Newton watercolor paints blend well, create gradients extremely well and re-wet  without any problems.

7032	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	THis ink is so great.  Its easy to use and can age and distress your art in a snap. I also got the Linen color too.  I will buy more and pair them for different art.  You could use as regular stamp ink too but to age work it is really nice.  Looks like I will get a lot of use out of each.  They seem not to be drying out at all. 10/10 does what it says it does.
I have been using these markers for over 15 years, and have made some beautiful pieces of art with them. They last a long time too. I have some from my first set in the early 2000s that still work perfectly. These had more of a multiliner on one end than the ones they make these days. Now its a "broad tip/fine tip" but the fine tip is thicker than it used to be. Still great though since you can buy the multiliners separately.
The twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.
If I had to come up with a complaint about this set, it would be that the barrel colors do not always (or even often) come close to matching the actual ink color, and sometimes the barrel color is VERY misleading.  For example, the beige marker that you see fourth from the right in the product picture may look as though it could be used for a lightly tanned skin-tone, actually contains a much darker brown ink - it could still be used for a skin-tone, obviously, as people come in many colors, but for a MUCH darker-skinned person.  Many of the colors are like this, so you have to experiment and get to know the set, and once you are familiar with what the INK actually looks like, it's not really a problem.

It makes great baby items. i also use it in 2 or 3 strand items with larger needles. It is soft and cuddly. It washes well. But as always treat it gently when washing to make it last. Hand washing is always nice but not always practical. I take the baby afghans and clothes I make with this and put them in a pillowcase to wash in the machine. It saves on the stretching effect. Laying flat to dry is best. I do put them in the dryer as well. the new colors that are out give a new look. I just recently got each of the new colors. ! skein can make a small baby afghan.

9208	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Having used a few different types of cone thread, I can say that this is my favorite.  I use this in my overlock machine and it makes a nice, stretchy stich.  I have not had any problems with broken thread from the cone as I have heard about from some other brands of cone thread.  The only possible downside of this product is that it's a little difficult to open.  The plastic that the cone is wrapped in is pretty tough (crinkly, hard plastic, not soft plastic like kitchen wrap).  And while it is perforated, it's kind of difficult to grab onto an edge to be able to peel it at the perforation.  And you don't want to use something sharp because you may break the thread.  The best solution I have found so far is to grab the edge with the tweezers for my overlock machine and pull until I can get the perforation to open.  Other than that, this is a really good overlock thread.

1605	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I was aiming for a roll of blue paper to serve as a "sky" backdrop for my 2 year old's birthday party.  Unfortunately the color on the computer screen is a little off. The roll has a lot more green than blue, so I couldn't use it for a sky and had to buy another roll in another hue.  It is nice quality paper though and I used it as a backdrop for a different party instead.
Bottom line: l love them! (I wish they'd make some metallic ones, though.)
Do NOT have a brush tip, but instead a chisel and slender round tip.

3015	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worked great on glass lightbulbs and steel wire! I came across this DIY Halloween project to make these cool spiders made from old lightbulbs and wire, and thought, I can make those! So after cutting the wire into 4 equal lengths, I bent them around a lightbulb to make the legs. Then I used a bit of glue around the neck of the spider to hold them all in place. Once they were all dry, I gave them 2 coats of this Krylon paint on both the top and bottom. Not once did my can leak or have any issues, and I had plenty to do probably another set of these spiders. Id like to,say you get a lot in these cans, but in reality, you dont. However, they are cheap enough, or at least it was at the time I purchased it. I chose this particular one since it was a paint and primer in one, because I didn't want to have to mess with multiple coats. I probably didn't even need to do 2 coats, but because there were so many nooks and crannies with these, I needed to in order to get the full 100% coverage. Overall, they came out perfect with a nice smooth finish on both the glass body and the wire legs.

As a stay at home mom, price is always something I take into consideration when making crocheted items with any brand of yarn.  With a $2.00-$3.00 price range in most retail stores, I do look for skeins when they are on sale, but even if I have to pay top dollar I know I'm not wasting the extra money on something that I won't like.  Yes, I do like to splurge a little on yarn, but most times I'm making blankets and hats and scarves that will get a lot of wear and tear and I don't have to charge a million dollars for each item if I've only paid a few dollars for my materials.

913	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've tried a bunch of travel/pocket/compact paletes of watercolor in the last few years and this is so far my favorite. Can't really beat it for the price. The paints are great for student-grade (not to be confused with professional paints, which have much richer pigment, more light-fast and wonderfully transparent) and the palette shape and size is perfect for on-the-go sketching and painting. While these are similar or better to any student-grade paints, they are still inferior to most if not all professional-grade paint, so as long as you're not making professional art to be sold or permanently kept, you'll do great with this. This kit is what I recommend my friends who want to start watercolor to get. The number of different paints you get is plenty, you'll learn better and faster to mix your own colors (and therefore understand how colors behave) in a limited set up like this, without redundant pigments to confuse you.

I use these brushes for craft projects or when painting a room in the house to cut-in as necessary.

You can take the girl away from the quilt room, but then the girl just has to take the quilt room with her!

I've noticed that Cricut and silhouette sell printable iron-on transfer papers. I'm going to try them next time. If you find something that works well stick with it and avoid these. These are a hassle and give mixed results at best. In my opinion they are only good as a last resort. As a matter of fact I had better results with the Iron-ons that Avery makes for dark colored fabrics. I would try those on light colored fabrics before I'd use these again.

I've used it as a tablecloth for quick clean up after a cookie decorating party, my children use it for school projects, and we've used it for various art projects around the house.  Recently we decorated the door of my husband's office with this and it led to many questions about where we had found the paper.  I think this is perfect for anyone with kids who want an affordable crafting option without long-term commitments.  I wouldn't plan on saving anything made with this as a keepsake as the paper isn't the sturdiest; however, it does stand up to a lot of wear and tear during project construction, etc.  I'm not sure how soon I will need to purchase this again and it does go far.

They're not expensive, so they're very worth the money.  I don't know that they make a great gift, but they sure are handy when you need them.  Now...if I could only find a left-handed pinking shears...

8844	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I got these to add to my collection so I could have a handle for each different type of blade. They are not made as well as the old school putty colored handles. They are thinner and not as elegantly weighted. But they still function, just without the pleasant experience of the old style handles. Also the blade quality is cheap cheap cheap... the fine "V" shaped parting blade is pinched tighter than the older ones and the sides of it cut the linoleum leaving a much wider cut mark than it should. This purpose of a fine blade is to cut thin lines...this cuts a wider line than the tool is intended for.
If you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.

If you're looking to put them in your palette, just be a bit careful. A couple of them have chipped off and they tend to crack a little. But all in all I support this product and recommend it for those starting out or if you want a cheaper set of paints.
I can use this for hand or machine sewing with no issues at all.

1251	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The item arrived as described, new, and arrived in a timely manner. This item is for a Christmas present and I will update the review afterwards as needed.
Anyway, I bought these because the product description said they cut through multiple layers of cloth.  I figured if they would cut cloth, they would be excellent for nylon thread.  And I was right.  I get really neat cuts through my thread on the first attempt with no fraying.  The cuts are such that it is easy to thread a needle afterwards.  The edges are quite sharp and the tip is a fine point, so you can get in close to the work.  These are not the same as using a thread burner for beadwork, but they're about as close as you can otherwise get.
1857	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	very nice
6393	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It was a great product, the face paint was a nice quality, but I don't think it was worth that much money. My daughter did love it though, and i definitely recommend it.
I used this yarn to crochet an infinity scarf, and to be honest it barely made one loop. The yarn also kept getting tangled for some reason and some of it came apart. The little specks on the yarn that gave it the oatmeal texture easily fell out. I was really careful with the yarn and the scarf turned out alright. I won't purchase this yarn from this user again because I saw it for cheaper at Michaels.

Good quality, would recommend.

5492	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	There aren't a lot of colors which is good since color sorting takes up a bit of time when you first start out. The detail could be better. The wings of the dragon flies are translucent so you're going to be edging the stalks of the plants after you've blocked in the flies and leaves. This is a light colored base so be sure to wash your hands before touching it. I had to scrub mine pretty good and I was careful. It comes out just as the photo shows, the colors haven't been altered in the photo.

8437	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Have you heard the old phrase about "multiplying like rabbits"? Well, I ordered a some of these double ended hooks in various sizes, because I wasn't sure what size I needed at the time. But, I swear those things multiplied between the time I ordered them from Amazon and the time the reached my house - just like rabbits! They just keep coming and multiplying. It wouldn't be so bad if they would multiply in different sizes, but they seem to want to multiply in sets of 2 of the same size. Maybe Amazon should have packed each one in its own package so they couldn't multiply? If I keep them all busy doing Tunisian Christmas projects would they be too busy to keep multiplying?  Guess I'll give it a shot! Between now and Christmas I will officially be found on the corner of Tunisian and Crazy Lady - just forward all my mail. Oh, by the way, with the right sized yarn, this hook does work great.
I laid purple down first and then yellow to meet in the middle for a 'neutral' color. Having put the yellow down second dragged bits of the purple across into the yellow area. There is also 'crumbs'.
Peppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes.

8940	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is really neat stuff.  I've used it to highlight laser engraving on glass.  The only drawbacks are that some colors aren't as bold as others, some don't seem to be quite as they are shown on color charts, and I've gotten several tubes that had the contents separated, so liquid splurts out before the pastier stuff comes out.

Why do I really use Red Heart Yarn?  Simply put, the quailty of the yarn is amazing.  I've only been crocheting since 2009, but there are items that I made when I first started crocheting that are still in excellent condition.  My favorite is my daughter's afghan.  She's had it since birth and has gotten numerous "things" on it, but they have washed out easily without destroying the yarn in the process.

8825	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I installed my first invisible zipper last night and this little foot worked perfectly!  Note - If you have a sewing machine with multiple needle positions, be sure it is set to Center.  My computerized Brother CS6000i defaults to the left and I'm lucky the needle didn't break...not the foot's fault, but mine.  I installed the zipper using a video instruction from Craftsy and the instructor didn't use an invisible zipper foot but mentioned the foot is handy but not necessary.  I disagree!  I can't sew a straight line to save my life and this little gizmo hugged the zipper teeth without bunching, hanging, or snagging and sewed a perfect seam completely straight down the teeth. Without one, the instructor's regular presser foot hung on the zipper top and initially refused to feed the fabric/zipper tape through the feed dogs.  With this foot that did not happen.  When completed, the zipper was hidden exactly as it should be.  The instructor did have a good hint: make your garment seam allowances 1/2" vs. the standard 5/8".  The zipper tape is 1/2" and the edge of the fabric is a good guide for zipper placement.
3833	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	As described and on time.
6483	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This works perfectly for what I needed.  If you are looking for something heavy though this would not be good due to the wood being very thin.

While doing some color swatches of the 12 half pans, this quality is about equal to my Sakura Koi Field Sketch Set with 24 wells. I am satisfied with the pigmentation, the colors come out bright, and have a smooth gradient with no chalky finish, as to be expected with these types of paints. I opted for this set for its portability and compact size, half the size of my Sakura Koi Set (half the colors but they have the 12 main ones that cover spectrum quite well).  I've included a photo of the swatches as well as some smaller swatches of mixing the complementary colors. As well as a size comparison between the two sets.

1136	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	good
5633	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	If you get this product I'd advise getting a floss card, there is no card with this set and the blues and greens are hard to tell apart. The floss comes in two bundles and there is a guide for each bundle so don't take the bundles apart (like I did) and then have to figure out what is green and what is dark yellow green. Since I mess up a bit on these projects try to scan or photocopy the pattern so that if you need to start from scratch you have a brand new guide. The color mix for this product is rich and vibrant, I love it. It doesn't get five stars because of the lack of a floss card and there are two direction papers one for the guide and the other for the floss colors. I prefer all the directions on one paper.

One of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches.

Only one thing I don't like and it's very small and easily fixed: I HATE the thread holder! I mean how are you to put the colors back when you are finished with one? So I just take them out, used an index card and a hole puncher and made my own (I dot that with most threads now).
I use them to cut leather, and other cloth pieces.
One thing I would recommend is to trim as close to your image as possible. I was transferring a circular logo but just cut out a square, thinking the blank parts would not show up. However, blank parts of paper will still transfer onto your fabric as a kind of "clear" paint--the change in texture is subtle but noticible. So anything that you did not intend to be part of your image, trim with scissors! Also, I wish it came with more than 6 sheets. I think I would buy these again though. Easy and fun!

1561	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I am an art teacher so I am familiar with various brands of paper.  I have Tru-Ray Pacon in my classroom already and was expecting the same quality. IT WAS NOT!  The paper was already faded and flimsy.  I bought red and blue for a specific project in school colors but these are all going in the recycle bin.  This paper was an add-on at a very low price and now I know why.  Proceed with caution.
2176	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	If you want a really sharp pair of scissors, these are the ones for you. Even the tips are extremely sharp.

While this was sorta annoying to set up at first (have to unwrap and balance in 12 little thingies) and the case for me at least doesn't stay open well without tape (immediately knocked out all the paints after unwrapping and setting them all trying to use a rubber band to keep it open - this was a bad idea, hah), I LOVE this little set and it is perfect for me.  The quality of paints is excellent, the two trays are small and convenient, perfect for my limited space, and I love the little paint brush it came with.

It turns out that my son cuts with his right hand.  He has bigger hands than I do, so these fit nicely, but they were totally awkward in his hands. He felt uncomfortable and unnatural.  I felt scared watching him try to cut something.  I'm donating them.  They looked well made.

Crewel needles are used with wool. To be exact 1-2 ply wool not thread.

ALSO!! 36 sounds like a LOT of markers. But be forewarned-it is NOT as many as you think. There are about 2-3 shades of each color in here. I know it looks like more, but it is not. So if you ARE using this for an adult coloring book, and you like to go with certain color schemes for certain pieces (like, lots of greens for a garden or something) these may not be the markers for you.

1837	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	There are a lot of different sets under the same listing so for the purpose of clarity I'm referring specifically to the 12 color set.
I like the traditional look of the wooden case, and the way it sits on the shelf over my workbench, but I have to admit there are some advantages to the new case. It's tougher than the wood case, won't crack, is unaffected by water, can bounce around in a toolbox or bag without damage, and it doesn't cost any more than the wood cased set. For many users that's enough to convince them to get the newer set. Really, both cases to a fine job of storing these knives, so in the end, it comes down to personal preference.

The tools aren't the same as the pic - many are coated in black "paint" to cover up their low quality, and the "wooden" storage box is cheap pressboard with a paper thin veneer coating.  I will NEVER buy anything X-Acto again.

If your child is just learning how to use watercolors, learning about art, fine artist potential and I used these when I was in Middle School (which I got into my middles school for art, I went to a magnet school); I would recommend Crayola Artista II Semi-Moist Watercolors - Semi-Moist Watercolors (which I have written a review for).

Another complaint is that the paint pans don't stay in the case. Well, that is true, but again I have a simple fix. I took the plastic pans of paint out of the box, and added just a dab of hot glue, then gave them a firm press back into the palette. This worked well. I tried prying them out, and they stick. When they are gone, you can simply take a pair of pliers and pull out the empty pan and replace. On my other set I used a piece of double sided tape that I cut in half length wise, then stuck the pans back in. I think I like it better then the hot glue. The tape holds well, but the pans can be pulled out just simply using the end of a brush to pry it out. Sticky tack/blue tack/museum putty works well too.

7110	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've used quite a few metallic markers over the years, as I'm an avid paper craft enthusiast. What I like about this pen is the rounded tip. I use them for edging card layers, ATC edges, and I find that by simply placing the pen on the edge of the paper on my table and pulling it down, I can get the perfect edge, as thick or thin as I want, without the fear of running the pen across the front of my papers. That, in and of itself, is an excellent reason to purchase this pen. But I was forced to set aside my craft projects for a few years, and my metallic markers sat, unused for almost 2 years. When I went back to them, I found that the Krylon pens had either dried out or changed colors (gold because ugly non-metallic green, copper became non-metallic brown, ect) while my Pilot pens were just as beautifully golden and silver, and just as juicy, as the day I opened them. I strongly recommend these pens to anyone that enjoys paper crafts and has need for a bright, metallic marker. They are my "go to" marker of choice.
4570	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	The color is the shade of teal I needed, but it is not wool, but acrylic.
I use them at least one of them on every project I have
2306	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These came highly recommended to me and even though I am just learning to use them I can say they are very high quality and a great value for the money.

It can be mixed with acrylics to give the paint a much denser tooth or to be used as a permanent glue.

All in all I give Red Heart Super Saver Yarn an A+++.  If someone is a new crocheter or knitter I would highly advise trying this yarn because of the Pro's I've brought up...and if you're a more experienced artist, do pass up a chance to use a great yarn!

Red Heart yarn is a worsted weight (4) which makes it easy to do a lot of different projects with it. It is not nearly as soft as Red Heart Soft Yarn but when I want a really durable yarn (like toys for children, Christmas stockings, etc.), I reach for this style of yarn. I've used it for years and the quality is high for the dollars paid.

First of all, if you're using it to poke holes in metal (like hammering the top area lightly) the pointy end flattens immediately. The shiny metal you see is just a cheap coating and started chipping off immediately as well. Then, the metal cusp thing that's connected to the wooden head is cheap, after gripping the awl for a couple minutes the cheap glue connecting it to the wood came apart and the metal cusp fell off. Don't buy this piece of s*** awl, please. I'm trying to return mine.

I found the hooks to be very comfortable with both pencil grip and knife grip. The kit is approximately the size of an eyeglass case when folded. As some others have stated, the C hook does have a tendency to escape as the flap covering the hooks is a tad short. I put that hook in upside down and it stays put that way, and I gave the kit a good shaking to test that. You can also arrange hooks in descending order from left to right to keep the pesky C hook from escaping, as all the hook slots are the same size.

2451	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	after reading a ton of frisket reviews I ordered a big bottle of this feeling I would be using this brand the most. I did (prior to this order) pick up the Windsor newton brand which is very nice also, has a bit more elasticity to it than pebeo and therefore will allow you to pick up a very thin line of the stuff and pull it away all in one piece, the Windsor newton brand is quite striking in that manner, sort of mind boggling as to how it stays so elastic w/o breaking. BUT I like the blue color better than yellow (WN is yellow) and the pebeo seems to go on a little thinner and dry a tad slower allowing me to get more of it in place b4 I have to clean off my applicator.
It is gorgeous and was pretty easy to do. My only reservation is that it is more bright fire engine red than coral. I wanted something a tiny bit more subtle to go with the Tulips, but these are just sooooo bright they don't. It is seriously bright red and green!!

The set comes with two palettes that can be taken out, the first one can connect to the bottom, the other can remain in the lid, but if you requite more mixing room it is removable, the only issue is it is a little difficult to take out at first, but I am sure with some love over time it will be easier. This brings me to one of the few issues I have with this palette, it does not lay flat as depicted on the box, it tends to stay up which makes the palette fall over if left alone, This is not a big issue for me, seeing with time Im sure the plastic will wear down or if i take a blade to it and create a grove for it to lay flat.

3108	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	OK. I'm totally pissed with Krylon. This is my third attempt at painting an antique metal too box with their incompetently formulated paint. I've used Krylon on many projects over the years, very familiar with their paints - at least up to now. I had put down a couple coats of paint as describe on their instructions. The next day I wet sanded the coat to get out some minor imperfections. and let it dry thoroughly. As soon as I re-sprayed what was to be the final finish coat - several places fried and bubbled up. Temps are 70-80 degrees in the shade. The first time I thought it might be the base paint. So, I switched to a primer that I had used before with Krylon with success and bought another new can of Krylon in case there was a batch problem. Same thing happened again. Each time this crap has to be stripped, re-sanded and re-primed. I think what is happens is that the Krylon paint I'm using never really cures. When a second application is made the next day the solvents in the paints penetrate the uncured first coat, expand and loosens the initial coat - frying it. This does not happen with a competently formulated paint that cures/drys properly.

8826	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Most sewing machines these days only come with a few accessory feet. And most zippers are the invisible kind, if you go to the sewing store--that's what you'll find. Plus, invisible zippers look so wonderful when sewn in--they become part of the seam. However, if you struggle with sewing them, the invisible zipper foot is what you need. The foot snaps onto the shank, and it rides over the center part of the invisible zipper, allowing you to sew close to the nylon coils. That's the key--riding over the raised coils so the stitching is right on the tape in the correct position. This is a must-have for any home sewing you do with zippers.

2216	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	These are terrible paint markers.  If you push, just a little to hard, the paint comes pouring out.  I have had to remove globs of paint and restart my project.

1867	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The price for these at $20/12 markers was unbeatable. I've used Prismacolor markers in the past and had them all stolen by my students. They obviously liked them, as well! The colors are bright and they don't leave streaks. They do an incredible job coloring illustrations, creating a bright, smooth, solid space. The broad tip is breat for coloring in large areas and the small too is great for outlining or detailing. If you weigh these against Sharpies, there is no comparison. These are far, far superior. Invest a little extra money and get these instead. It's worth it!
1937	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am an avid illustrator and wanted to try something new as oppose to the cross hatching that I normally do. These markers are incredible, providing so much value from 10-100 percent black. I didn't think I would use so many differences in values but as I did, I realized how much better some of my illustrations began to look. I would probably have preferred a 2nd 10% marker than a 3rd 100% marker, but that's probably because I use the 10% like a blender.

2356	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Fiskars makes very good scissors.  They hold up over the years without the two blades beginning to wobble because of a cheap bolt in the middle.  Just like any other scissors, they do need sharpening after a while but start out extremely sharp!  They also have some weight to them unlike those cheap ones.  The grips are large enough that they are comfortable to hold, too.  I highly recommend Fiskars.

5768	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	The yarn seemed more of a vibrant color in the photo. But my main issue  with this yarn is that it was such a poor quality.  It was difficult holding the tension when I was crocheting because the yarn was so flimsy. I'm reteaching myself to crochet after having putting down my crochet needles over 10 years ago.  This yarn started to fray even before I had to pull it apart to redo a couple of rows. In my humble opinion this yarn was not worth the over six dollars I paid for it. I certainly would not use it to crochet gifts for family and friends.
8363	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a gift. I can only say it arrived in a timely manner and it was purchased for an elderly person so they could do something alittle more creative & to keep the mind active. Maybe use the hands. I would have gotta the Bob Ross paint kits because he's awesome on tv. I felt this was a better choice because I'm not sure person receiving gift will enjoy painting. So its financially a better choice for me.

7816	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I enjoy coloring in adult coloring books and I'm always looking for products that provide a nice color range.  I own Prismacolor premier pencils, a large assortment of gel pens, and several brands of markers.  I love the assortment of colors in this set.  As with all the markers I own, these do bleed through the paper.  So, I recommend using them on one sided pictures.  To avoid the color from feathering, I color close the the edge of the picture I'm coloring.  If the color doesn't reach that edge, I then dot it lightl until I achieve the look I'm going for.  If you use these on larger areas, your strokes may show if you overlap them.  I know some reviewers said that the markers damage the paper.  I use a gentle stroke and have had no problem with my paper being damaged.  Also, some reviewers complained that the marker caps don't always match the color of the ink.  I simply took a piece of white paper, colored a stroke from each marker in the order that they are in the case, and then taped the color chart to the case.  I make color charts for every medium I use.  I don't understand people taking stars off for something that is so easily fixed.  I would say that the biggest pro of this marker set is the variety of colors.  I really can't say that I found any cons other than the feathering which is why I took off 1 star.  So, knowing that feathering can happen, I simply used a much lighter hand when coloring near the edges of my pictures.  I am attaching photos which I hope will help you if you are considering purchasing these markers.  There is a list of the colors write on the case..

7916	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	These are a huge disappointment. I read a lot of reviews (on these and other similar markers) before buying these and don't understand the positive ones for this product. Here are the problems with it: 1- The actual colors do not match the cap colors, they are much more intense. So, for a good art project they are essentially unusable. 2- They dry out! After coloring one small area, maybe 4"x2", they dry out. Replacing the cap means that the next day they will color a bit more but that is hardly practical. The only good thing about them is that the tips are very nice but with not enough ink, and unreliable color matching, they are really not worth buying, at any price.

3277	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	First yarn I bought at my local in-person shop. I bought it there for the price (which, quite a bit cheaper from Walmart) but the color was lovely and the material was strong and well made, so far no knots or frays (I haven't gone through the whole skein yet) and this particular color is one of my favorites. I recently bought the same brand's 'coffee' color yarn, and it seems the same quality. great bang for your buck if you're looking to crochet or knit for a decent price
Con: It takes a bit to get used to how it works on which fabrics. And i still haven't got the secondary function of sewing the gather onto the flat fabric in one go down yet but i am sure that is only a matter of more practice. Pull a bunch of scrap fabrics before trying to do this on a real project because it it a bit tricky to use in the beginning.

I have no complaints, this is perfect for me.
Each color was individually wrapped in plastic and a lot of them fell out from the pans. I found it really time consuming and difficult to pick out - unwrap - secure at first then I found out that it's better to just pick up the whole section and push each of the four half pans out with your fingers (saves so much time and protect your fingers! ) The paint cube can easily stick to its half pan if you put a little drop of water at the bottom then put the paint in.

But I mostly love this set because of the water brush! I wasn't sure about it at first, considering how simple it looks, but it goes together easily AND securely, the pieces are tight enough when fitted together that it doesn't leak around the join, even with pressure.  Now the tip stays nice and pointy and seems to be continuously wet, but does not leak a bunch of water out.  That is until you squeeze it, then it does let out large beads above the tip if you push too hard.  I found that very gentle pressure wets the brush without the big drop of water coming out and possibly ruining your work.  This is my first water brush and I REALLY like it.  The tip on this is still fairly small, but I mostly like working on smaller pieces anyway.  You can also fit the brush in the pan when it's filled with water, and the area holding the brush is smartly thought out.  It has inserts that keep the brush from sliding around, so the brush won't slide left or right, risking the tip being smushed against the side.  I discovered also that the tip comes apart into two pieces as well, which means you could easily rinse the brush out for cleaning when you get home, etc.

I was surprised that the price at my local store was better than what I could find on line (both 3,000) yards. I am new to serging but was told by the sales clerk that this was a good serger thread (they did not have many other options so I am not sure that she would have said if it was bad). I have noticed that the thread is not perfect but is fairly smooth. I have sewed a number of little projects lately and only broke one of four threads once. I think the break was largely a user error and not a thread quality issue. I first bought four spools and liked it so much that I went back and bought 8 more spools.

Also I got this particular cross stitch for a GREAT deal compared to a in-store purchase.
810	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought the pocket set to have something compact to carry with me for plein air sketches. The little paint brush is a nice touch, but I didn't try that as I intend to use a set of water brushes when I am out and about. The paints are pigmented very nicely and pack a punch. The pans themselves are very easy to set up and tidy--when I've run out of the paint it's nice to know that I can reuse this palette by filling it with tube paints. I might even invest in the studio palette for use at home!!!
8936	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Used it for cosplay. This stuff is really easy to apply, and the finish looks like spray-painted metal.

My favorite way to buy this yarn is to use 40% off coupons at Michaels. Because there are no dye lots, I just run in whenever I need a new skein. I love not having to worry about stocking up on all of my supplies at the beginning of the project or worrying I'll run out of yarn. And with the coupons, an already inexpensive blanket ends up being dirt cheap. Being on a tight budget, this makes me really happy; it means I get to make more projects than I would be able to make otherwise.

I will probably make up my own sections instead of using theirs since this will primarily be for the bakeshop.  I think the star rating will be great for me since the recipes here will be my own.  A few folks have commented on how little space they have for writing recipes.  Number one, it's a recipe, not The Great American Novel.  How much space do you really need?  Number two.  Okay, so you really do need that much space.  Well, why not cross-reference a page in a later section.  All of the pages are numbered.  On the bottom of the page you find so cramped, write in "continued page 123" and continue on page 123!  I don't mean to be (that) snarky, but it seems obvious especially when so many of these same people claim that the later sections seem to be useless.

855	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I actually got this because I wanted a very small travel box for watercolor pans. I figured I could always toss the paint and replace with my own, but figured I should at least give it a try. They actually aren't at all bad. Much more pigmented than the Sakura Koi. I did a color chart to test out mixing and they did OK, but not great on mixing nice purples and greens. Really only one purple is possible and it's a bit muddy in tone. If getting these for the paints, I would suggest the larger set with 16 colors if you want a purple. It has one in the set that you don't have to mix. But this is a fantastic small box. I've read some state the pans fall out, but if you use it a couple times and get the pans nice an wet so paint seeps down the sides they will stick down. The problem then is really getting them back out! I used a push pin to lever them out when I decided to rearrange the palette. I also did replace the white with a payne's grey which I found to be more useful for creating shadow tones. When the paints are used up I can simply replace with my own tubes or even try out some W&N professional paints perhaps. I can say that if you want a really nice set of paints that mix beautiful purples and greens, try Daniel Smith. I turned my tubes into pans by letting them dry out and they work wonderfully. Very clear color mixes!

Maybe it's because I'm new, but I think it's the yarn itself that's causing this one issue I have. When I go to make the stitch, I'll accidentally poke my needle through the yarn but only a little. Enough to make the stitch too tight if I don't fix it. I think it's because of all the things I love: soft, big, fluffy yarn. Either way, the color is beautiful (I got the coral color), vibrant, and the only problem is easy enough to fix and might be my fault anyway. Would definitely purchase again.

I will post a picture as soon as I know this review has gone live.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: The most recent can I received had a new kind of spray tip. Instead of the typical aerosol spray head (a small round orifice) this had a t-shaped protrusion out of the nozzle that had a slot in it, and you could turn this slot to be horizontal or vertical (see pictures).  It's a terrible implementation! The old spray head would put out a thin, consistent, and predictable cone of spray. In short you just had to be careful not to spray beyond the bounds of what you were applying it to The amount was very thin, minimalist, but very effective and drying quickly. This new head didn't spray reliably in horizontal or vertical positions and movements of my arm back and forth or nearer/further did not help control it. What came out of the T-nozzle instead of being a thin predictable coating was something that looked more like it was trying to create that silly string spray kids play with. I ended up with voids in areas I would have formerly covered reliably/predictably, and other areas where it was piling on and up three-dimensionally with too much adhesive. 3M sounds like they're going to credit me, and while that fixes my wallet it doesn't fix their product. Between the two fixes I wish they'd fix the product. This new nozzle might clean at the flick of a fingernail, but I managed to keep the other spray head clean, and with that former head I could get the adhesive applied perfectly, now I don't have that, or a solution for it.
A nice offering of colors and shades in a small set. Oil crayons are hexagonal and will not roll off the working table. These feel solid to handle and are of a generous size compared to most child-audience art brands.

This yarn might seem just a trifle stiff when you first finish your project, but I guarantee that one quick wash with some fabric softener will make it absolutely luscious.
7477	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I like being able to get a zigzag pinked edge while using a rotary cutter.  It is more accurate that using pinking shears.  I hope this blade holds up for a while because it is not inexpensive, and of course I can't imagine how I could sharpen it.

3590	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I just plain love yarn and buy this brand most often. Never have problems within the roll, and the picture seems to be true to color.
The yarn is nice heavier weight worsted, and works up wonderfully with a size H hook or size 8 needles for dishclothes. When you use a size F hook, you get a very dense fabric that works well for stuffed animals, cozies and double layered for functional potholders. It's reasonably priced as well. The cotton is very soft. Because it is cotton and not wool, it doesn't have any bounce back for the fibers so it doesn't work well for fitted accessories or clothing. It washes very well, but might shrink some in hot water. It won't felt, and shows stitch definition well. Great for kitchen gift items like potholders, dishcloths and cozies.

9588	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I was expecting the yarn string to be thicker, but it wasn't (have worked with yarns ranked medium in weight and this is thinner). If you are loom knitting and want a thick scarf, this is not the yarn for you. If you want a shorter scarf, I would stop about halfway into the ball of yarn.  With one ball of this yarn, I was able to get 2 long and drape-like scarves (or 1 super-duper long scarf).

I mocked up blocks in Electric Quilt 7 so I could figure out my block placement using an asymmetrical layout, but relied on the patterns and directions in the book to actually make the blocks.  They are fun and easy to make and Lori has done an excellent job of providing step by step directions with pictures and pressing directions for each seam.  The one thing I did have to do was put a strip of post-its over the cutting chart for the size block I wasn't making, because I found myself cutting the wrong size!

518	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	The bit was not attached and so I haven't been able to use it because it requires tools to put the bit into the dremel.  A waste of my time.  It should have come ready to go or with the tool needed to make it work.  You need a very tiny flat head screw driver.  Almost like the ines in the eyeglass repair kit.  Which I don't have.  Still sitting on the shelf in the packaging for the last 2 months.

I haven't had a problem with finding the center pull or knots so far and it doesn't split. The reason I can't give this 5 stars is because my skein has only 236 yards, while this is not a big deal for me it could have been if I was working on a larger project.
So I purchased AMACO Rub -n Buff in the color I thought might match. Well...not only did it match perfectly, but after spending only a few minutes to "rub and buff" the drab item came alive.

I especially like it for the last as I like to blend various yarns to give my projects my own look and style.  The project generally goes great until I am faced with trying to thread a needle with two or more yarns of varying weights.  I try to thread them one at a time and it takes forever and sometimes simply does not work.  In those instances, I end up weaving in separate yarns which is a true pain to do.  Not anymore!  I put the multiple yarns in the threader, choose the right big eye needle, thread it and weave the ends in.

These Stabilo 88 0.4 fine point pens are wonderful for writing, which is what I use them for. I also love the diverse color palette. There are 25 pens/markers in all. The writing is smooth, the tip feels fine, though I do not exert much pressure when writing, there's no bleed through when writing (I use regular yellow writing pads though I did notice some bleed through when coloring) and the only flaw is that the caps can sometimes require a little more effort when you're taking them off. Other than that, I love this set. For about a dollar a pen, this set may seem pricey but I think it's worth the splurge since they generally seem to last longer than many other brands found in the stores. I would also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Staedtler-334SB20BK-Triplus-Fineliner-Pens-3mm-Metal-Clad-Tip-20-PK-Assorted/dp/B001CDD1X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Staedtler 334SB20BK Triplus Fineliner Pens,.3mm,Metal Clad Tip,20/PK,Assorted</a>&nbsp;which have a dry safe feature.

Tried a small book to see if my drawing may need weight to keep it up while on display...fell over. Had to rig it with tape and cardboard at the bottom just to get it to stay open. Don't waste your money.
hand held one that works even better.  Also looked cheaply made.

April 7, 2017 edit:  Since writing this review I've discovered the ring is a thumb ring to assist with holding the kit while painting.  Still a nifty ring for snap-ringing to a belt loop or back pack, but the design intent is help hold it while painting.

There are no directions in the packaging, however for my needs, it was easy to determine which tip fit the bill.  The tips heat up super quickly, and maintain an even heat.

even though the article number from clover is the same the text info on the packaging is different, and maybe the sizes have changed and gotten smaller considering my colors are also swapped.  but since i can't use these on my 19mm/US35 needles, which is why i purchased them, they're hardly what i would consider jumbo - especially by CYC standards.

5078	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	The picture (or the product I received) is off.  What I received was simply an off white string/yarn - no color variation at all (unlike the picture).  Had I known that this is what I would get I would have ordered something else.

8878	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I recently got a Cricut Machine and I love cutting vinyl on it, but was having a problem with air bubbles.  My husband had the idea to buy one of these to see if it would help and it really does!  I have used it numerous times to help flatten out vinyl but now also use it every single time I piece together paper as well.  It smooths everything down and makes it look really neat and crisp.  I'm so glad I got this!

8930	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I have three tubes of this: a two pack of gold, and a red one. I was disappointed with the red because it was so dark it hardly looked metallic; but I guess color is a matter of taste. The gold is a nice color. My two big issues are that it is hard to control... you can't apply a little bit, or a thin layer. It's there or it's not. My second is the reason I will not buy again. Out of three tubes, with only two uses, two out of three have broken caps.  They were not even in use when they broke. The stuff in the opening dried so hard that I couldn't squeeze or dig it out, and I couldn't access what's lower in the tube unless I cut it open.
Good assortment/variety of colors -- the colors are true and vibrant

2933	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've been cross stitching for 12-13 years, so I'm pretty advanced.  I had the European Bistro pattern on my Amazon wishlist for months, and I finally decided I needed a new project.  The pattern is very elaborate and there are lots of color changes, but I'm really enjoying it.  I've been working on it for four months (but I also work full time), and I'm about 1/3 done, which is the fastest I've ever worked.  The kit comes with everything you need to begin (2 needles, plenty of thread, pattern, and fabric).  The only thing I would recommend is buying a frame or hoop if you don't already have one.  It's a large piece and you don't want to ruin the fabric by holding it constantly.  DON'T purchase if you are not an advanced cross stitcher! Otherwise it has been a lot of fun to work on!
3933	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worked great for our project.
3212	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	The yardage,is very deceiving. This is extremely expensive for the amount of yarn in the skein. I was expecting 364 yards many others who ordered it, but the actual skein is 236 yards. I will never order yarn from Amazon again.
Perfect for travel or even just sitting on the couch and having your needles already threaded!!
8805	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	is NOT fit for Pfaff 7550

1485	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This has a very strong glue which is exactly what I needed. I was creating a fort in the corner of my daughters room but couldn't figure out how to hold the top on. This holds the top fabric to the chair rail and hasn't budged. Love it

9940	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These hooks are great.  I just started using them and I like them a lot. The price is what you would pay in the store so they are not a great price put the product itself is worth the price
The finish: The box is lightly lacquered on the outside, only. This makes the box relatively smooth and stain resistant on the outside. All inside surfaces are unfinished, with a surface smoothness of maybe 200 grit. Just what you'd expect for a cigar box.
8602	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Consistent product.

5430	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for use with weaving in ends of knitting and crocheting.  It works for all LARGE eyes, but sadly does not work well with anything medium or small.  Wish there was one made just like this for smaller eyes.
Cons: VERY small brush and for me it's unusable (area is narrow so my replacement travel brush does not fit), paints pop out (so added water to the pans then placed the paint back in the pans and that did the trick), depth doesn't make it easy to fit into pockets/purse, took me a while to figure out that I needed to remove/replace the water bottle when everything is closed.

3539	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This yarn is very good quality, and was packeged well. The colors are soft and muted. However, I have made at least one hundred stitches and still have not gotten to the purple. It is mostly green. There are large sections of the same color, making the color variations awkward. It looks like I used several different skeins of solid color, instead of verigated.

194	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I do really like these. They're nice to add to stationary or the back flap of an envelope that I want to keep sealed while moving through the mail. There are two pages of 12 designs, package says 100 + stickers. Not kiddy bright but rather subdued colors. Some of the stickers are rather simple such as bird's nest or the word "bird", I like the tin these stickers come in. Easy to store and just neat organization. The back of the tin shows exactly what's inside. I also use these in scrapbooking. The stickers are oval. Some are quite big. The hummingbird, for instance, is just so attractive. These are not "American" bird breeds but they closely resemble some of ours. The stickers are printed on Italian stock, some images have words behind them. Very pretty!
1260	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great xacto kit!  i wish the case was finished wood, but since it doesn't interfere with the product itself, it still gets 5 stars!  i've used all the blades and they're all sharp and work great!

Naturally I had used all but a few inches of that special color, long out of print, not available anywhere, that tied it all together. I adapted my plan and  finished the quilt, but not before tossing this book in the trash. I would not donate or sell this error-ridden piece of junk to someone else.
It is handy, the cutting edge is sharp and does the job with ease.

7096	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These markers were just what I needed when I needed them. Does that make sense? It does to me. I used these markers on some special library items when I was working in a school library. They did really well and have stood the test of time. If you keep the caps on the markers, they will not dry out. That was a note to myself, too, by the way. Excellent markers. Good purchase and I didn't even make the school pay for them. I did.
Arches is the only favorite I know.
4852	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I heard a lot of old quilters say they don't like this, sure glad I'm new at quilting, I love it.  Injuries to my back make it very painful to stand and cut the material for a quilt. because I'm new it seems to take me forever to make sure I have everything perfect.  With this it's trim the end and the next thing I know it's done.  I know it would have taken me so much longer because of my back.  You can watch videos on how to use this on you tube, very helpful, I watched them before I decided to buy this.  I am super happy  did.
7092	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Not as fine as I would like, there's a big amount of run-off . Come on manufactures - can someone make a real sharp fine tip ?
3618	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great product and service.
So my recommendation is try it on a sheet of paper before you use it because it will be very different. I read some people saying the tips go flat..they don't if you use them correctly. Magic markers take a gentle touch. They tips are great for fine work and on their side they work as broad markers.
The Wave section of the book has several lovely patterns. I really like the Vortex Street Pullover in a green/brown blend knit with cotton. "A phenomenon of fluid dynamics, a vortex street is an organized pattern of spirals formed in the wake of fluid flowing past a solid object." The center of this pullover has a wave section with stockinette surrounding it. The Reflection Aran Pullover is knit in a deep wine color out of wool. "Inspired by the rule of wave reflection, the cables in this pullover 'reflect' off of the edges of the center panel." The Droplet Hat is another Aran pattern knit in a green colorway with wool yarn. "This design is based upon a photo showing a droplet of water speeding downward propelled by gravity, spewing off little droplets as well as a narrow trail of water. My interpretation is rendered in bobbles and embossed leaves."

Since receiving the engraver, I have used it to write my name on everything that I can. My tools, my phone, my laptops, everything. It is the same urge that you get to write on everything with a permanent marker when you have one in hand, or the urge you get to label everything you get with a label maker, only this thing amplifies this urge because it's a power tool, and who doesn't like power tools?

Last week, I borrowed one of my students' brand-new pair of shears to demonstrate proper cutting technique and was startled by how much easier they were to cut with than mine! Apparently, mine had grown dull and it happened so slowly, I didn't even notice. It would have been difficult to get to the shop to get them sharpened, so I simply ordered a new pair. It was the exact same Amazon listing as the first pair I bought several years ago, but the shears I received were different. Instead of being gray and black, with a small orange lock, they're bright orange and white, which is rather hideous. Even my students have commented on how ugly the new shears are! That's disappointing, especially since the photo in the description still shows the old gray and black version. (Or it did at the time of my purchase.)
The actual painting can be a mighty challenge. Oils and acrylics can be pretty much painted over to correct what you don't like. Not so with watercolor art. Don't make it even harder by using cheap crap.

When doing alterations, the long hand helps prevent fatigue and therefore you are less likely to hurt yourself or the garment.  For smaller stitches, it can sometimes be a challenge, but it is easily overcome by a little patience and by taking it apart from the right side of the garment. I recommend always seam ripping in good light to avoid eye strain and putting on relaxing music or the television so you don't grow impatient and rip the cloth.

If you want to sew your way and not have the machine try to tell you what you can or can't do, buy something else.
7779	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Loved how this paint works. You will injoy it. Great color, mixes well. Good buy, bless you and your company.
The color intensity is very good...you won't be missing much in this regard versus top-end oils that cost 2x or 3x as much. Artisan has a slightly stronger and more artificial smell than others...a bit more than just the usual natural linseed oil. Like other water-miscible oils, you can thin with water if necessary - but only a little bit - too much water will result in a weak, matte paint film. Using oil or medium is better.

I searched the Internet for this product and am thoroughly happy with it. It did exactly what it said it would do, and my nutcracker looks brand new. I put a small amount on my finger tip and applied it to the damaged area -- after a light sanding. A gentle buffing when it was dry created the satiny finish I wanted. It was easy to use and cleaned up in a jiffy. No mess, no smell. It can also be applied with a brush in intricate designs or small spaces.

The yellow markings are very easy to see and are very useful for finding the measurement wanted. For example, on the 1" ruler there are yellow markings at 1/4" spaces in the middle of the ruler, and black dashes down the middle section that are labeled with 3/16" and 3/8" from both edges; these  make it easy to line the ruler up just at the measurement wanted. On the edges the yellow marks indicate 1/8" increments.
4761	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This yarn is very affordable and washes great! They have improved the softness also. This used to be very scratchy and stiff, it's now much softer and nicer. After a single wash it's almost as soft as baby yarn. I use this yarn for afghans mostly but it also makes nice hats and scarfs. There are lots of colors so it's easy to make multi colored projects look just how you want them to and there's no risk of color run or fading. I do throw 1/2 cup of vinegar in all of my wash to make the clothes softer, that trick works great on this yarn also.

I don't have the colorless blender yet, it is coming in the mail, so I can't comment about that. These markers don't streak too bad.

There is no way the hinges will stay inside this crap material for long. I will be returning this and getting the same kit that comes in a zippered bag of sorts. It looks better and has to be better than this darn box. The plastic inserts holding the pens and blades is ridiculously tight. I had to pry the knives out with a screwdriver. Just things to think about if you ever use this regularly. Great set, just in a horrible box...
As for the softness, well, it's Caron Simply Soft. You probably know what that feels like, and this is just the same. Softer than Red Heart, not as soft as the really nice stuff, but pretty darn good for the money.

7877	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The colors are great (don't pay attention to the names they give them though).  The best part about these pens, besides being cheap, is that they don't bleed through even notebook paper.

COLORS in KIT: The kit has a great palette but is missing a warm red so you may either have to change a bit your color schema or buy a cadmium red hue separate from the kit. The cad yellow is the only color with a "dryer" density and I use artisan linseed oil for that color to be more buttery.  I also purchased the 200ml T White in addition to the kit.
9425	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is very bright yarn, moreso than I thought, but I like it. It's definitely prone to splitting, which may not be as big a problem with crochet as w/ knitting, but it's still a little bit of a problem. If I catch a stitch from the previous row the wrong way, I have a strand sticking out. I've gotten the hang of *not* catching a stitch like that, but I think it shouldn't be happening. Really soft and yummy to work with and to wear. It's a very light weight worsted though; the recommended hook is an H (5.0mm). Compare that to a recommeded I hook for Red Heart Soft, and a J hook for the Red Heart Super Saver yarn. So if you want something that drapes well, this is great, but I'm not sure how well it would stand up to frequent use, like a kid's blanket. I may be wrong about that, though. I'm making a light weight lapghan right now for an adult (me), and I'll try to remember to update after a few washes.

156	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	I was excited to find this tool on sale at Amazon and was eager for it to arrive. Hugely disappointed! The caps won't stay on, especially on the stilleto side. This makes it a VERY DANGEROUS TOOL to have in your sewing kit. If you have children in your household, do not purchase this item. I am floored by the number of people who reported the problems with the caps, and still gave it a 5 star rating.
The colour fillings are rather small, this is the only consequence but overall it is a great product. Very soft touch so you need to paint with a soft brush.

The others brands do not have anything even close. It is a metallic gold that highlights better because it is so light gold, not the darker ones that almost look brown. It's hard to describe but if you highlight paintings or crafting, try this color.

If I find myself wanting a different or other pocket set I will certainly buy within this line.  In addition any actual paint pans and probably brushes are going to be the cotman line.  For the price it is really so nice.  I am a hobbyist getting back to my previous passions and have worked with garbage quality paints to the highest end options and as I work my way back up from a beginner, I feel for watercolors these will likely meet my needs indefinitely.

I was going to use this yarn for a baby blanket... But I am not sure if I want to use it for a big project.  Still regarlesss of the texture, I would still purchase this yarn again.
7908	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Big Waste of Money.  Sent these back.  So disappointed.  The tips feather and leave fuzziness behind and you have to "clean" the tips before reusing to wipe off the fuzz.  Colors were okay but 30 out of 36 had fuzz issues so these were no good for me.  The Bic Mark-It markers (both ultra fine and fine) were 3,000 times better than these and the colors were better too.

It is full of beautiful designs. One could use parts of these designs for edgings, etc if one didn't wish to make a whole bedspread. (I think most of the counterpanes call for small size knitting needles, like "0" or "00".  I know my metal ones are bent from making multistitch popcorns, etc.)

I don't see myself changing brands any time soon.
You will be surprised at how far the tube goes - several craft projects later and there is still a ton left! I would highly suggest searching for some tutorials on the best practice for this finish - Youtube has several, and if I remember correctly one even uses this brand!

If you need a variety of crochet hooks and don't care about the mini folding scissors, this is a great deal. At the time I wrote this review, the set was cheaper than buying the individual crochet hooks. Boye is a great brand, always the highest quality. Highly recommended!

9244	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have a trusty old heat gun which works great, however it's loud and has a very strong concentrated blast of heat.... it works perfectly and fast for typical embossing and also for use in shaping butterflies made from plastic packaging (the flow is small enough for me to concentrate it away from my fingers or tweezers and not get bured). I needed something however so that I could use it at night and not wake the whole family and also for use with UTEE (my old one would blow the UTEE right off before ever melting it). Yes this one is whisper quiet and it has a much larger spread on the heating which means it doesn't blow the powders off, I can't hold things and emboss them though as it burns my fingers. It also takes a bit of extra time to heat up but once it's hot it embosses as quickly as my old one.
5213	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a very bright neon color of green.  The picture doesn't quite show how neon it is but if you are looking for a bright green, this is about the brightest one that I have seen.  It is a great yarn to use to make a hat for a little one if you are heading somewhere where you want to see your child at a glance.  Anything made from this color is sure to catch your attention.
5864	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	As this yarn name implies it is a NEON green, hence GLOW WORM, and not a light or pastel green by any means. It's really hard to get a neon color in a yarn but this comes pretty close. I also purchased this color with another Red Heart neon color in pink. I like Red Heart yarn because they always come up with interesting color combinations and is easy to work with. I purchased a cheaper brand of yarn at Michael's once and it wasn't worth it - it was thin and it frayed a lot.

2019	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The first thing to go on a pencil is the eraser. It dries up and crumbles or hardens. I purchase these regularly to keep on hand when that happens and haven't been disappointed. They're durable and last a long time even with regular use.

I would return it but it's not worth it.
968	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I like the color selection.  However, be prepared tp spend a lot of time putting together.  Each color is indivually wrapped and most colors will not just fall out to do this.  The plastic pans are clipped together in groups of four.  So you have to pry out the four pan clip, then pry out each indivual pan, unwrap and put back in.  I do like that each plastic pan is marked with the name of the color and it's number.  It took about two hours to get it ready, so don't plan on using right out of the box.
9145	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I was making my first baby rag quilt.  There was a lot of slow, tedious seam snipping with a regular pair of scissors.  I have arthritis in my hands and went online to see if there was an easier way to do this as it would have taken me forever to finish the project with a plain pair of scissors.  Voila! As usual I found what I needed at Amazon.  The reviews were 50/50, but I thought I'd give it a try.  So far they work wonderfully and I snipped all my seams quickly.  Much easier on my hands.
8015	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Staple color.  Good product.

The brush is nothing to get excited over. It is just a small round or liner-type brush. I probably won't use it, as it gives me hand cramps since the handle is so tiny.

7163	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The knife is quite nice and the rubber grip makes it easier to handle than some other brands.

6377	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I am a beginner at the art of crochet, this is my 3rd project.  I made a sweater for my 5 pound Chihuahua for our cold Vermont winter.  The thickness of this is great and helped me make this sweater without any type of pattern.  The colors are great too and the yarn is nice and sturdy.
854	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice set of paints. The box holds more than the usual 12. I did find the pans wanted to slide around so I used rubber cement to tack them down. Worked like a charm! I actually saved the cotman paints to refill my smaller pocket box and replaced with the artist grade Winsor and Newton paints which are a bit clearer in color. But even the cotman are nice to work with. I just find they don't mix quite as well for purples and greens. This set has those colors without mixing making it preferable to the pocket box if you prefer cleaner, clearer purples. I have attached my color mixing chart with the professional paints I used to refill my box. If you compare to the cotman sketcher pocket box mixing chart (also below) you can see the colors are brighter and clearer. But the cotmans are still a great set that I use when out and about. I kept the paints from this kit to refill the smaller pocket box.

These make great markers for sketching, adult coloring books, or just for fun. Recommended.
1971	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	First these are not really washable markers. They say on the packkage that they will not wash off walls or clothing. They will only wash off whiteboards or other similiar 'washable' surfaces and skin. But worse than that is the crayons just fall apart. When you try to sharpen them they just crumble. If you peel back the paper, they just fall apart. And the colors do not show up well on the included board. This is a really bad product.
495	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Does work well as a hot knife but loses heat rapidly if used on anything more than thin sheets. Attempted to cut a 1/16" thick Plexiglass sheet and found no go. Not sure about the temperature claim of 1050 degrees F Used a infrared surface temp thermometer and was able to register only  400 F on the tip after 15 minutes.  However it does seem sufficient for cutting ropes or nylon cords. No doubt will work on stencils.
5578	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Beautiful colors but very thin. It's more like a size 2 baby yarn without the softness than a size 4 worsted weight. Also it cost too much. You can save almost $5 per skein by buying the same brand at Wal-Mart ($2.88 each).

It cut very well through 3 layers of jersey knit.
9705	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I agree with the earlier reviewer that the packaging on this product is perfect for my use. Until now, I would use a tiny dab of super glue on something and by the next time I needed it, the tube would be hard and dried up no matter how carefully I closed it. These tiny tubes have plenty inside for most any single project, and none left over to waste. The plastic container for the four tubes also keeps the tiny tubes from being lost in a drawer or accidentally smashed flat.

Using a combination of clear adhesive laminate cut to size and this silver paint mixed with a bit of dish soap, the scratch off worked flawlessly. See the attached invitation for both a sample of the silver paint color as well as the effectiveness of the scratch off. The color was metallic and pretty and just what I wanted.

I seem to get glue all over if I use it. This product puts the glue where I want it and in case I get it in the wrong place I gently pull it up and reposition it! I would recommend the Xyron 2x2 eraser to get any excess glue off. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is expensive but Amazon's price beats my local craft store (who don't take coupons for Zyron products).

337	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I wanted soft lead colored pencils to use in adult coloring books. These have a triangular barrel designed to give a wider surface to grip and minimize slippage. I haven't used them enough yet to tell if this design is better or worse than any other; right now they just feel a little awkward in my hand. Haven't had to sharpen one yet; they are supposed to resist breakage & work in standard sharpeners according to the box info. The colors are nice & I am very happy this set includes a metallic looking gold & silver toned pencil. The colors apply smoothly & seem more richly pigmented that some of my others...I can't compare them to high end artist grade pencils however, just to brands frequently seen in many local stores. I'm pleased with these and consider them well worth the money. I think these are great for kids & adults or if you need to buy a larger quantity for a classroom. I do like the softer lead and would buy this exact set again in a heartbeat.

When comparing prices to other fusible interfacing, you also need to remember that a lot of interfacing is only 21 inches wide, this is 44 inches wide, as wide as most quilting fabrics, which makes it an even better deal.

1919	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Have used these for years for illustration work combines with oil based metallics as a resist. There is nothing to compare with the beautiful brilliant colors that have a unique depth of their own, unlike any other media. There are 4 edges, which allows you to do very fine work and color larger areas as well. They don't work that well for very large areas of color if you want it to be perfectly even. They also don't last that long if you are working with them and don't last indefinitely if they are sitting in a drawer, they will dry out. They are non-erasable. The colors will fade in sunlight, so I tell clients to treat the artwork as they would a color photograph. They are also expensive in retail stores, as much as 3.99 apiece. This is a great price on Amazon, so be sure to stock up.

Both Fiskars and Olfa provide a high quality rotary cutter, but Olfa appears to require slightly less pressure to create a clean cut.  I would attribute it to the sharpness of the blade and possible to the shape of the handle of the cutter itself.

5786	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I've been using Red Heart yarn for years and it's always been nice and soft and easy to work with.  However when I chose this variegated combination to use in my current project I noticed it's very scratchy and rough feeling and also hard to work with.  It doesn't slide off the crochet hook easily.  I love the colors they make in this combination yarn but there is something about the fabric content that makes it scratchy so I won't be using it again.  I compared the content to the plain colors and it's the same so they must be doing something in the color process that makes it rough.  Come on Red Heart I know you can do better, your yarn has always been so great to work with and such a bargain to buy.  Don't mess it up now!  I'll stick with the solids.

When I first used my stamp on the ink pad, it seemed like there wasn't any ink on it, but there was more than I could tell. Practice stamp first to get the feel of the detail of your stamp.

5993	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I have done a number of Dimensions stamped needlepoint kits.  This one is by far the worst I have done.  The colors of the stamping are so close that even in direct sunlight I couldn't make out the color difference enough to do the stitching.  I ended up having to use the printed instructions like a counted cross stitch (with the help of the picture from the front of the package).  Additionally, the entire kit was cotton floss, unlike some of the other kits I have done, where nicer wool yarn was provided.  Finally, there was not enough of the background color to complete the piece.  I ended up having to use yarn from an earlier kit.  Not a good beginner kit.

And then, I'll be down to the steel itself, and how it holds its edge - or doesn't, my hopes aren't up. I should have been more patient and waited for USPS to bring me a decent set of tools. But noooh, I wanted it right away. Serves me right.

As is true with all of their kits,  "European Bistro" is clearly charted and in color to help the stitcher follow the chart.  I usually start by making myself a "working copy" of section of the chart so I can freely highlight each line as I work through the stitching.  It might also help to enlarge the chart a little bit if you make a copy to stitch from, but it certainly isn't a requirement.

I was a bit nervous about not being there to feel it and actually see the color.  This particular was crucial to my pattern. It needed to accent other colors in the piece.

9878	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I totally love the needles in the case. It helps me identify which needles I am grabbing due to visual disturbances. So far I am lucky enough to still be able to see enough that I can do the mending and some crafts. The needles do not have any burrs so they travel through the fabric very smoothly. Recommend for anyone who is old school like me when it comes to repairing fabrics rather than toss them out.

The only thing I had to do on occasion was blow them off.  I was cutting a kink size rag quilt and the fibers/dust kept getting in the blades and that bogged down the spring action of the handles, but a quick blast from the air compressor and they were good to go.  I had to do this three times for that king size quilt.  Still the best idea.  It saved my hand from having to use regular scissors to cut that huge quilt.

I gave this a one star at first because I felt a little cheated because I didn't see the free 9924 engraving point that was supposed to be included,  then felt really bad once I found the missing 9924 so I'm updating it. This might  have happened to others who bought this item and complained about the same thing. The product does come with a free 9924, but it's a small piece. They placed it within the plastic packaging. Therefore, if you unwrapped it and threw away the plastic, you also threw out your free piece. See the picture for more details.

My order placed April 2016 had a black white and red label displaying some intricate calligraphy scrollwork, which was different than the main product photo at the time on amazon. I'm not sure if they have changed the product at all recently with the label change, but this worked very well for me. I almost didn't buy this due to a review that said it wasn't waterproof anymore, but as long as you let it thoroughly dry it is waterproof. I wrote with it using a dip pen on watercolor paper, waited several hours and scrubbed it with a wet paint brush. It smeared, and continued to smear until after 12 hours. After 24 hours there was no more smearing of this black ink - it just required a long dry time. If you live in a humid environment I imagine it might even take a couple days to become waterproof.

328	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Needed to sharpen over half of these out of the box, so poor quality control. A super sharp sharpener is required to keep them from breaking, they are triangle shape which feels funny to me but they won't roll off the table. The colors aren't labeled on each pencil which can be confusing. They're kind of hard and don't really blend that well.

DMC cotton embroidery floss is the floss that I use for almost all of my counted cross stitch projects. I like the consistency of the material and color. I like that it is easily divisible and that most projects call for the floss by their color numbers. While you might be able to get floss for a little less at a big craft store (especially if you have a coupon), more and more I have noticed that those stores are switching to Sullivan's floss - which is slightly less expensive but is not the same quality as DMC.

I'm not so sure about the "mannequin" that is included?  I twisted it around in a couple different positions, but it feels about as "real" as a G.I. Joe would.  I don't think it's going to help much in the way of the human form, but that doesn't really matter because this case come PACKED with so many different mediums to use!  I purchased this for my son so he could practice with different types of pencils and charcoal that I wasn't introduced to til college.  Get a good head start!

This book ISN'T for beginners... itworks with evenweave fabric you have to work over 4 strands and its not only hard but it took me almost 8 months t finish the dragon because of that fact. The other ones are on regular Aida (you COULD do the dragon one on Aida but I'm a stickler for detail!) The charts are PERFECT... in full color and easy to read, 1/2 of the patterns take up more then 2 pages and each and every page is color. Some projects are small like post card size but the biggest one is the wizard (I am eagerly awaiting fabric or that one!), 18x22 inches!  I TOTALLY think its worth the money, I have had this book for a little over 2 years and i go to it whenever I need a project (my sister loved the Hope (bird) cross stitch and my cousin loved the egyptian style bookmark)...

I also realize a yarn called "pumpkin" should be on the orange side. This yarn appeared to have more of a yellow tint online and it is nothing short of neon orange!

9107	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have made a number of rag quilts in the past few years for gifts.  My first two I tried using what I had on hand to do the snipping, a Fiskars fine tipped snipper.  My hands were in agony as the spring action was too weak and each snip took several tries, often bending the fabric rather than cutting.  I finally ordered a pair of these and was soon snipping like mad.  This is a MUST HAVE took for rag quilts if you value your hands, your time and your sanity.  And you can't beat the price -- other quilt snips are several times more expensive.  Save your cash and buy these -- they are exactly what you need.
1407	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good quality and looks great on the material would def recommend this item
I couldn't understand why this product had so many stars, so scrolled through and realized all of the 5 star reviews are a few years old.  I'm not sure why they changed the product, but these are awful.
It's been several months since using the product on my prop and its holding up well. The prop went through a few conventions and sweaty hands but has shown no signs  of coming off. The material it was bonded to is plastic, smooth cast 300 to be precise. It's worked great. My main suggestions are again, clean the surface, let it dry completely and apply this stuff and work it how you want it. Then, you have to fight the urge to touch, handle, or monkey with it. Seriously, patience is a virtue.
Most colors will be dry to the touch in several days (more or less depending on several factors) ...similar to regular oils. However my Artisan Titanium White is unusually slow-drying. I don't know if this is how it's supposed to be; my other Artisan colors dry at the expected rates. My Artisan Prussian Blue (not in this set) dries incredibly fast as it should...dry to the touch in about 1 day.
326	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great pad with thick sheets! I bought this for my son and so far he's been happy with the quality of this paper.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Donna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.

I don't see the point of copying all of my recipes that are already written into this book.  I do think this is great for anyone, chefs especially, who do any sort of menu development or recipe writing.  I LOVE the index.  That's too cool.  It will make it very easy to find information later.  My only complaint is the cocktail section.  I could do without it.  C'est la vie.  I'll most likely use it as another recipe section.  I bought three of these books and do not regret it.  I only wish I had found these before I started culinary school!
7185	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	What else is there to say?  The hobby knife goes where I want it to when cutting out decals.

In addition to cutting fabric, I also use this rotary to cut paper and to trim photographs.  I did not notice any significant dulling of the blade from this use.  It makes a perfect clean cut. This is one of the most used tools in my toolbox!
I can't explain why, but the 2 blade holders-handles in this and other sets are my favorites, sometimes I need a heavier knife handle to get things done, other times the finer knife handle for detailed trimming.

Probably the pop-out feature is for cleaning, and that does help, but I like to pop out the roller and wrap twine or rubber bands around it to roll in ink/paint and make interesting linear features in artwork.  Works great so I bought a second one because I got the first one kinda icky after neglecting to clean it properly.  Still works for some things (like if I want an irregular surface).

I definitely recommend these to beginner and advanced artists alike! They produce excellent color! I do wish that they had a pink and purple... And I think some of the colors could... Maybe not be in the pack. But, I find that each color does get used a little. At this price, it's a win-win.

5971	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Red Heart Super Saver Yarn is a pretty great bargain. Michael's sells it for about $2.99 (I doubt it's much different at other large brand craft stores) and as you can clearly see, you get a lot for a little and there are a good deal of colors to choose from. The yarn itself is 100% acrylic - part of the reason it's so inexpensive. To some, this can be a serious drawback. Many people dislike the somewhat scratchy feel of it, and I can't blame them. It's not the softest yarn in the bunch, but who can be surprised with such a nice price? I would not recommend this yarn to use for sweaters or other clothing items. Unless you're making it for yourself and don't mind the somewhat scratchiness. (Note: a single wash can help ease the scratchiness.) Another thing to note is many people are "yarn sensitive" and acrylic can bother the skin. In which case, I'd look for cotton and other natural fiber yarns. But on the flip side, Red Heart Super Saver is perfect for stuffed animals, dolls, and amigurumi of that sort. It's durable, especially when you figure that you won't be throwing your amigurumi in the wash that often. I find it easy to work with, especially because it's a tight yarn and stuffed toys generally benefit from Red Heart's tightness. Unless you're making a stuffed toy for a baby to snuggle with, it's great for children's toys. And, who can forget the price! A few other drawbacks, though minor, I noted are that I tend to find a couple superficial tangles in the skeins that annoy but do not ruin the whole thing. Also, I occasionally pick up a skein that just doesn't work the way I'd like it to. For example, I bought a skein of the skin colored one and found that it just didn't work like the other skins of RHSS did. I guess there are lemons in every product, but still a bit annoying.
6673	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I find the SE line of products to be for the most part a good buy for things coming from the east. This was part of a few items I put in a tool box XMAS gift, I was told if you give a tool box somethings should be in it. The reason behind this is to encourage the person to buy more tools so they won't have to ask others to borrow.
9864	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I'm not sure how I haven't used one in 10 years of knitting/crocheting, but this stitch counter is the best. I'm not sure how it is on crochet hooks (haven't needed to use it yet), but it slides easily onto a knitting needle and stays in place easily. The numbers turn fairly easily, but not easily enough to move unintentionally.
Nice, thick hard plastic and crystal clear- it looks GREAT on shelves (unlike the cloudy, cheap brittle plastic storage boxes sold at the big box stores...) and is perfect for *small* quantities of small things.

We live in a world where not too many of us can find the time to write down their thoughts, with a pen and on paper but, again, the Moleskines aren't for everyone. To the extent that there are people who not only love to write but love to write specifically about the movies they watch, the Passions series Film Journal is a notebook dream come true. But, let's examine what one gets.
BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.

For quick scarves that are warm and easy I crochet single crochets length wise to the length you want and then single crochet in the back for ribs. easy, simple and makes a nice warm scarf that is quick to make.

If I had found this set first I would have bought it instead of the compact set probably but I like having both.  The compact set has more areas for mixing, and has a nice thumb hole for holding on to it which is convenient if you don't have a flat surface to set your paint on, and even a little side pan for water (I use it for another mixing spot). The water brush also fits into the compact set if you wanted to take it along in that.  The thing that I prefer about this set though is that the pans are more separated, AND they fit down into the openings for them. On the compact set there are these little bits that stick out which seem to be meant to hold the pans in if you push them down, but instead I found that they either don't do that at all, OR the pans pop back up flying out of the compact completely. So I've just let them be but then they stick up and jiggle around.

As stitchers, we all know that we should be signing and dating our projects, however humble, because they will be heirlooms someday.  I have used the Olde English type script as my signature on a historic sampler and also a cheerful bold one for my son's baby afghan.

HELPFUL HINT: Take those little white round stickers (people sometimes use them to put prices on things at yard sales) you can get from any office supply or dollar store (or just use a piece of paper and tape) and color on them with the markers, then stick each sticker onto the marker of that color. This way you get a more accurate representation of the ink color with a glance than the marker caps themselves. (Seriously, some of them are very misleading.)

9435	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	First off, I love the color but I HATE the yarn. Beautiful color that is true to the picture, but the yarn itself is awful. It's constantly unraveling and near impossible to crochet for this reason. This might be good for a children's craft but the effort required to knit or crochet this yarn is not worth it.  It took me almost an hour to crochet two rows because the needle kept going between the strands of yarn (yes it's that loose).

I just re-started the project only to find out I ran out of this yarn-I am using 3 colors. I went to Michaels and JoAnn's but could not find the color. I tried to use another variegated green but it did not blend well with the other colors. I decided to try AMAZON and I was pleasantly surprised to find the yarn, however I was not sure if it was the correct color-after enlarging the image it seemed to have the colors I needed; even though the price was higher than what it sells elsewhere I went ahead and ordered 2 skeins. I was SO happy when I opened the box and saw that it matched perfectly. It was well worth paying extra because now I can finish my afghan.

The "yarn" is more of a thin string with long hairs sticking out from it.  I ended up missing a couple of stitches and didn't realize it until after i was done.  But this added a nice furry edge to the blanket I was finishing.  I expect it much easier to use if you're more skilled than I am.

The first thing I used it for was to cut the setting and corner triangles for a group of blocks that I was setting on point. I cut according to the instructions and sat down to sew. Waaaiiitt... they were ALL THE WRONG SIZE. Did I cut them wrong? I checked the instructions, nope, the instructions given in this book by well-known and admired authors to cut setting and corner triangles was WRONG.
8218	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Works great! I did need a super long zipper the first use so I'm thinking I'll have extra pulls but no problem! I pulled 1 off accidentally but I used to work with zipper on a roll that you add pulls to so I was easily able to put it back on. Truthfully, it saves a lot of time having them on there ready to go! I used this for a twin nursing pillow, it would work in headliners, couch cushions, purses, really anything! I've also used the black roll of zipper by the same company, it's great!

5484	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely beautiful rich color.  Wish I had bought more.  I live in Costa Rica and it's difficult to get yarn shipped here affordably.  A friend brought me a suitcase full of yarn and this is one of my favorite colors.  One thing I do have to say concerning the Super Saver Economy Yarn in general, I was surprised and slightly disappointed that there was a noticeable variation in the thickness of the yarn, not within the same color, but between different colors.  I had an afghan pattern that called for two shades of green and two shades of purple.  The purples were a thick yarn almost bordering on chunky.  The greens were much thinner, almost like a baby yarn.  I'm making the pattern anyway, since I can't run down to the store and find something I like better but the different between the yarns is noticeable.  And maybe it was my error expecting consistency across all Super Saver yarns but that is what I expected.
9479	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice and soft.
6801	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this yarn to make dryer balls.  It worked great and felted well with only one washing.  I made three tennis-ball size dryer balls with one skein and leave them in the dryer at all times.

My apologies in advance to my family for having day late Christmas gifts this year. By the time I got done with all these reviews, I had to rest my poor hands for a day. However, I'm sure you'll all enjoy the fantastic Christmas ideas I came up with for each of you. You'll love your gifts so much that you won't even want to put my name in the hat next year, but that's okay because I'll just take that as a hint that each of you want to enjoy the fruits of my labors next year. Uncle Bill, you might have to roll one sweater sleeve up so no one will notice that it is longer than the other one.  Cousin Em, you're the best seamstress that I know, so I'm sure you can cut some off one leg of baby Jill's pants and sew it to the other leg.  That will even them up a bit.  Grandma's dog looks funny anyway, so the lopsided coat won't even show, besides it could be the start of a new doggie fashion - you never know. The rest of you - just ignore the laughing people around you. They really are laughing at an inside joke.  The important thing is that these hooks really do work great. They make the best and most unusual Tunisian Christmas gifts you have ever seen! Have fun and Happy Holidays to everyone!!

So no, this is not a bold, dark gray. This is very light and very subtle. If you are looking for a pale gray ink, look no further.
These were really quite easy to use and needed very little pressure to put color down. Layering over the same color did not pose too many problems but putting down thicker layers with heavier pressure did. Colors can be pushed out from under the pastel when heavy pressure and/or too much color is laid down or become muddied and uneven. Layering different colors atop one another might need pre-thought out strategy to prevent color drag.

I tried Paton's several months ago when I found it on sale at a craft store nearby. I bought enough skeins to make a winter hat and mittens for myself. I made the Fair Isle hat but have not yet made the mittens, because I got caught up in other projects that I was making for Christmas presents. That hat is one of the warmest hats I've ever had the pleasure of wearing. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) our winter here in PA was inordinately mild, so I didn't have many opportunities to wear the hat last year. But I'm hoping for a brisk, cold winter with lots of snow so I can get good mileage out of the hat and mittens this year! ;-)

PROS:
1593	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Just discovered that it was sitting in my living room. Haven't opened it because I have no current need for it. Can't wait until the grandkids come back.
I'll brriefly describe the thread bowl process so this makes sense....You lay a paper form down on a work surface first (just for reference), then lay one layer of Super Solvy over that. Then you place all your threads (and other filler) for your bowl on the first layer of Solvy, extending out a bit past the paper reference guide. Place one more layer of Solvy over the threads. Slide out the paper form from underneat to get it out of the way. Pin the three layers together generously (Solvy, threads, Solvy). Sew (a lot) through the layers on your machine to hold everything together. Then pin sewn layers to paper form, so you can cut the sewn layers to correct size. Rinse 'most, not all' of the solvy out and place thread circle over inverted bowl till dry. Carefully remove and seal, and you have a beautiful thread bowl. These instructions are not as detailed as in the book, but I just want to give readers an accurate idea what I use the Solvy for.
It is the heat factor as it seems to DRY it bit. It is really no problem and I don't mind using the fabric softener sheets which are very inexpensive to get yarn to work better. I have discovered this over three years ago and my work comes out great and smells good too! I highly recommend it for the price, quality, choice of colors and the speedy delivery.

My only issue is that the sliding mechanism to close the safety cover after use is a little bit lightweight, so if I try to close it one-handed the black slide presses into the yellow shaft instead of sliding up.  I often have to reposition my hand and try again, which is inconvenient but hardly a deal-breaker.  Very satisfied with the way it hugs the ruler and cuts.

Please be careful taking yours out when you get it. I keep mine in the little box my Boye's split ring stitch markers came in since I have 2 of those and it was handy and the right size.... I would spend the extra money and get the sturdier kind. Just saying.
I understand the seller's right to set the price for the product.  I also understand my right (and budget responsibility) to take my custom elsewhere.
4379	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great
2226	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These are really great.  I use them when stenciling or drawing on my black suitcases. They are called "fine" point... and they are for oil based paint tips. If they were felt tip it would be more like a medium point. I've only used the silver so far, but I've looked at the others. They are bright and colorful.  The lids fit tightly so I feel like they will last for a reasonable amount of time.  They arrived fairly quickly and in good condition.
1915	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love this set of markers. Wonderful quality, quantity, and work perfectly. Some of the best marker for artists out there, beginners or otherwise.
5755	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a good quality yarn. I am happy with the price also. It sure is nice to have it delivered to the door.
1058	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice big set of crayons for my Mom to use when she's coloring one of her adult coloring pictures. She has dementia and had forgotten a lot of things, but still really enjoys coloring. She loves having such a large variety of colors to make her pictures really pop!
1272	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good product.  Works great.  Glad I bought it.
When I recently ran across this tool, I thought it would be the answer to my weave-in woes  and I was right!  Not only does this thread work well for pulling in bulky yarns it also works well with finicky yarns that typically unravel when I am trying to thread a needle (example:  Premier Spangle) and especially when I am working with multiple thin to average (1 to 4 weight) yarns at one time.  Of course, the yarns must be able to fit in the hole so working with two bulky yarns at one time may not work well.

6447	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Our homeschool group was planning a big holiday party for about 40 kids and I was recruited to bring face paint for it. It is really hard to find face paint after Halloween and I needed enough to do a lot of faces. I saw this kit at local craft stores for $29.99 and I was about to bite the bullet and just pay it when Amazon had a lightening deal for $11! Thanks Amazon, perfect timing! It really was enough paint for the party and the kids loved it. The quality is very nice. I brought home the rest of the kit and even after all that painting, it still has plenty of paint. It doesn't look like it when you see the box, but it goes a long way.

5327	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've found that this type of threader works easier then the type you have to insert the thread after inserting the threader through the needle. Makes threading a needle go faster. Also, being steel I can put it on the magnet I use with my project so I know where to find it.
2588	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great product, but I hoped there would be more on the cartridge.

Buy something not related to painting.  I found this item that lets you store your BRUSHES TIP DOWN!!!  Where???  In the make up section off course LOL
728	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice compact set.  Reasonable price.  Only issues are that paint is harder to lift from brand compared to Van Gogh and set contains black and white (which aren't many artists do not use for watercolor).

7150	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Extremely thin with little pigment in it.  Requires multiple coats for even the most basic application.  Very disappointing.
8729	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Purchased for the Brother XR3774.
3853	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	It's a lot of black thread on a spool. I switch for purchasing online and in a craft store depending on who it cheaper. And I love this brand. The thread doesn't break easily and it works well in the machines. I always purchase this brand and size.
One last thing to note - if you push the paper all the way into the device (all the way to the joint) - there's a sharp spot near the joint that will nick the edge of the paper.

These have a wonderfully creamy smooth texture and mix beautifully. They accept water without resistance. They can handle the full range from translucent to opaque. The price is exceptional; you can spend a lot more for pastels that are not nearly as satisfying to work with. Highly recommended.

Moral of the story. I will never get AR coatings again (my non AR lenses lasted 12 years versus these 3 years). but the Armor Etch has been very helpful.

2022	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Not sure how much I can say about an eraser. It's a good eraser. Does its job. Love that it comes with three. =)
I'd say there were like new but there was some rainbow affect that was already in place from before... the AR coating had been peeling and those areas remain a little spotty looking, but on the whole it was great and will probably give me another couple of years with these lenses.

Success! an independent and happy little needlewoman. But I need to purchase a few more, for her sewing stops when she misplaces it, it's that crucial.

I highly recommend these markers to artists who purchase my adult coloring books.

I also played around with it on regular paper, very nice.  I used it to cut some sandpaper, and really a lot of things.  I even used it to cut the tag off a shirt and got a really good form since I would roll it exactly where I needed!  I'm finding it hard to use anything else at this point.  Why use scissors when I can just trace around whatever I want?  For rough work it is very quick and accurate enough.
