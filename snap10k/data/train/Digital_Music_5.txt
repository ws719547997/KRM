5865	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This song has got to be my favorites of all time, of all of Elton Jonn's songs. The lyrics are so beautiful as well as meaningful that they can bring tears to your eyes, if you are in the right frame of mind. The music too matches the lyrics, in that, it too is beautiful. It far outstrips Candle in the Wind, for beauty. It is a song about giving God Thanks, for certain people in his life, that have changed the person's life for the better, no matter what happened to the contrary. It is truly a work of art. Elton was definitely inspired when he wrote this. It will be forever on the top of my all time favorite songs of all time list. I would suggest that you buy it. At least, give a good listen. Maybe a second and a third, until you can hear all the words clearly. He sings things like "I know why roses don't grow in New York" and other things like that you probably aren't expecting. Just buy the song and let it enrich your life. The words alone could be a poem to people we love; who make a difference in our lives. A complete and utter dedication to them - those loved ones. Who could pass up something like that? I know I can't...

5107	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	At the time of this release, Beatles have broken up , and John Lennon  (Instant Karma) and Paul McCartney (Another Day) had already released their first hit singles, (also Lennons Plastic Ono Band/Give Peace a Chance) and albums. It was 1971. Naturally at the time people watch the great song writing team. But then Harrison released "My Sweet Lord", (late 1970) (big hit) and released "All Things Must Pass".  And Ringo Starr released  "It Don't Come Easy", (a George Harrison Song) in 1971. There are the original versions of George Harrison doing this song earlier as a "guide" for Ringo. .  Being a Beatle Freak, I heard the song on the radio, then George Harrisons guitar break (CLASSIC) and was hooked. Ringo's second single (Beaucoups of Blues being the regrettable first) it was a top 5 hit here in the US. How many groups after splitting up can say all the members had a top 5 hit the following year? The song itself had an all star band, (Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Stephen Stills on piano, Badfinger members on background vocals), This song is a classic, hard driving , and has a "spectorish" production but George Martin the prime influence, at Abbey Road Studios. A great song.

Cheap music that I could surpass in artistic and equality in twenty minutes and dumb, childish lyrics are a testament to the continuing decline of American intelligence today. This isn't punk or metal at all. This is a horrible travesty to both genres. Metal is ultraheavy guitar riffs with extremenly loud melody and pounding drums.

It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that "Voice of Truth" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time.

The answer? A resounding yes. For starters, I'm sure most owners of this album have put plenty of wear and tear on it, what better time to get yourself another copy. And even if it's still in perfect condition, the bonus material is worth it alone, for the Weezer fanatic. I don't have to tell you how good the original album is. You've heard it, you know. It's perfect, front to back. The material on the second disc, while admittedly not as good as the album itself, is still worthy. Take, for example, Rivers' catchy ode to the presidents of the Weezer fanclub, "Mykel and Carli" (who passed away in a tragic car accident), with it's chorus that, in typical Weezer fashion, sticks in your head for the rest of your life. "Suzanne" and "Jamie" are probably the most well-known b-sides among Weezer fans, while a trio of demos -- referred to as "The Kitchen Tapes" -- digs a bit deeper into Weezer history. There are also live songs ("My Name Is Jonas" & "Surf Wax America") and acoustic versions ("Jamie" and "No One Else"), and to top it all off, for the diehard fans, the original mix of "Say It Ain't So" (which was released only in the early pressings of the Blue Album). Also included is a rather elaborate booklet which includes lyrics (finally) and liner notes that chronicle the early history of Weezer. The package is very well done, and surely outshines the bare-bones nature of the original release.

I tried to introduce a foreign-born coworker in an office where I worked to Jonathan and Darlene.  He would have none of it.  He said, "she's doing that deliberately; that's not funny."  You see I had previously turned him on to the giddy delights of Mrs. Miller.  In prying my friend for answers as to why he found Jonathan and Darlene NOT funny, and Mrs. Miller roll-on-the-floor hysterical, I got an unexpected response.  No, he said Mrs. Miller is like your grandmother singing your favorite popular songs to you, and maybe even some songs you hate.  Somehow, she's innocent, charming, and yes, very, very funny.  Whatever the true story, and you'll read of several in these Amazon reviews, what the person called Mrs. Miller left us was a small body of crystalline comedic treasures.  She may or may not have been exploited, or she may have exploited herself, but she was an otherwise nobody who became immortal.

The producer, Bob Celli together with Bobby Vee's family have done an absolutely exceptional job in remastering the various tracks - Bobby Vee never sounded so good! The stereo is lush, the definition superb. "Party Doll" with the Crickets, an unreleased track from the 1962 album and "Gone" (which was apparently an atrociously sounding 45 due to a mastering problem) are wonderful. If, as gas prices top $4.00 and the economy flounders you need a trip back to the 60s in technicolor stereo - this is a must have set. One issue, Amazon lists a digital download in addition to the 2CDs - there is no info on this in the package.
5306	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I have always like bands who come out with these longer songs where there are transitions from quite or slower parts and then culminate with a slow, wailing guitar riff that changes the whole song. Most bands have these songs but only a few really become classics in my mind anyway. Songs like Zeppelins Stairway to Heaven, the Beatles Let It Be, Madam Blue by Styx have those great transition points. Queen also has several that fit this bill. To me, this Guns N' Roses song fits that bill.

I realize whenever I see this music video, it makes me feel good, and so does this song.  Therefore, I will say it takes me back to the old days and good memories.  The beats and rhythm in the song sound like a merry-go-round would sound if music went with it.  "Merry-go-round,"  "Around" the way.."  anyway, he is rhyming about making passes at girls while walking down the block, most likely in Jamaica, Queens where he grew up.  Flirting with ladies while they do everyday things like sucking on a "blow pop."  I bought that brand lollipop all the time where I went to elementary and junior high school in Crown Heights.  The rhythm and harmonies in this song are soft, and not too hard.

I would say _Stabbing the Drama_ is a big improvement over _Natural Born Chaos_ and _Figure Number Five_, and it's sort of a medium between the two. Just for reference, _A Predator's Portrait_ is one of my all time favorite metal discs, simply perfect. _Steelbath Suicide_ and _Chainheart Machine_ are also fantastic. all three of those are brutal and furious. That said, I even liked FNF for the most part, because of the vocals and catchy songs, but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half-hearted IMO, a downgrade from _Natural Born Chaos_ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous.

This is one of Williams' finest albums holding its own with "Lucinda Williams", "Sweet Old World" and "Car Wheels on a Gravel Road". Be aware, however, if you are a Williams fan that this is probably one of her more experimental albums and one of her most moody, atmospheric productions yet. Kudos to Hal Willner who convinced Williams to keep many of her raw, demo vocals for the album. What they may lack in polish they make up for in emotion.

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.

Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for "Escape", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of "Escape".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.

He work as a amazing songstress has been delivered through the heartache, and from the soul of following in the footsteps of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole. I am definitely crushed as a hard core fan of Natalie's. Her voice defiinitely ranged from the sassy in soul and R&B, to the sophisticated Jazz intimacy of her beloved father's legacy. While she had her demons from drug abuse, and the heartbreaks of three failed marriages, what Ms. Cole did for a lifetime, was truly beyond breathtaking at soul. Obviously her biggest hit was really with her beloved father, Unforgettable. The song really showed a beauty and closeness to what Natalie had never experienced with Nat King Coke, and his heartbreaking death. Now with Ms. Cole passing on, the song is so surreal at the soul. I am just shedding tears of sadness for her. Natalie Cole was truly unforgettable.

With a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the true sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as "Fight Fire With Fire," "Trapped Under Ice" & "Creeping Death" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "Fade To Black," this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any true Metallica fan.

There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.

  2006 saw the debut of her song "Promiscuous", where she teamed with Justin Timberlake and super-producer, Timbaland, to create this raw, sexually charged song that showed that Nelly was a bona fide sex symbol, instead of just being a cool hipster.  Timbaland's beats have always been among the best in the business.  However, Nelly's clever raps and strong vocals take "Promiscuous" to another level, as in all the way to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. This set the tone for the remainder of her album "Loose", which showed her new image to be genuine instead of posed.
"I Want You Back" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! "ABC" is very catchy. "Got To Be There" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings "Got To Be There" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! "Rockin' Robin" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?

Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a "celebrity" but as more of a "grandfatherly" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and "Rudolph" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of "Little Drummer Boy" that I've heard! "I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be "Christmas Can't Be Far Away." The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!

This is a very unique song because it has an extremely powerful message that everyone will enjoy. It's also a unique song about religion and Jesus' comfort and support which is one of the only songs of its kind to become a crossover top-10 pop hit. I especially enjoy how Ms. Lane picks up her pitch as she sings the chorus. Although the song is almost 30 years old, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys country, pop or inspirational music.

7686	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	After the multiplatinum success of "Acoustic Soul", India. Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup "Voyage To India". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on "Voyage" as this album is severely so-so.
"Remember The Time" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. "Will You Be There" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and "Dangerous" has some beat! "You Are Not Alone" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing "You Rock My World." Awesome!

"Are You Alright?," the lead single and opening track, is beautiful in its stark vulnerability. Asking questions such as, "Do you have someone to hug and kiss you?" and "Is there anything I can do?," Williams could just as easily be singing to a friend as a would-be lover. She enhances the song with an emotionally resonant romanticism that stems from uncensored, unyielding honesty.

8739	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Not really a Weezer fan when considering entire bodies of work, but I do love Buddy Holly because there's something kinda crazy about the song and the video that just screams 1990's before music went into the witness protection program that currently encases it. It's an upbeat tune that blends the 1990's sound with classical icons remembered through lyrics like Mary Tyler Moore and Buddy Holly. Whenever I hear it, I just get the almost irrepressable urge to stop whatever i'm doing and rock out or pop out, if one has trouble figuring out where the line dividing pop and rock was during the nineties.
So I picked this new one up partly because that documentary The Story of Anvil was awesome!  And I have to say I am impressed with Thirteen as well.  I agree with everything Lips was pitching when they were shopping this record around in the movie, it is great stuff.  The CD cover is blah, but the music is what matters.  I am not going to be overly critical of the music like some people have been because bottom line this is rock 'n roll, it has passion, and some great riffing, and it is Anvil and they are BACK.  I love it.  I actually think a few of these songs are some of the best Anvil has ever done.  Let's stay in the game now guys.

"Fade to Black" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.

"All Around the World" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's "Travelin' Man" more or less, but not nearly as memorable.

Jim Gaffigan's CD, "Doin' My Time," scores high on the replay factor.  Perhaps it's his delivery (dry self-deprecation with a twist of smug).  Perhaps it's his avant-garde style of humor (he spends about a quarter of the time pretending to be a critical female member of his own show, weaving "her" comments with his).  Perhaps it's just his voice, which has a malleable whine to it that never gets annoying and which makes his self-mockery seem humorously authentic instead of just patronizing or pathetic.

Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener "Fight Fire With Fire", to the epic "For Whom The Bell Tolls", the beautifully written semi-ballad "Fade To Black", and, of course, the metal classic "Creeping Death", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!

4260	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This essential country music album is a triumph for all who participated in its success:  producer Owen Bradley (whose lush, tasteful written strings pour sorrow on "Sweet Dreams" and "Why Can't He Be  You") pianist Floyd Cramer and a first-class Nashville session band  (whose piano introductions to "Crazy," "She's Got You,"  and "I Fall To Pieces" are among the most treasured in music),  and, of course, Patsy Cline herself.
 Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.

8639	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a compelling alternative rock song that I first heard as a teenager in the 1990s (from both local radio and television).  I take this songs meaning to symbolize the singers way of truthfully admitting that we do live in a world where many people are prejudged (even outside of Hollywood)based on physical appearance/weight.  This song actually creeped into my dreams as an adult after I reluctantly accepted that I must get a handle on my weight not just for health reasons but reasons having to do with getting a job and how my value as a woman may be perceived (whether I like it or not). I took this song being in my dream as an intuitive warning to accept that reality that I just mentioned without feeling self-pity (I prefer to avoid public sharing when I had that dream). Nonetheless, The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson is a rock song with depth that explores a persons journey to greatness without letting the physical appearance judgements consume them.

There's one thing that drags this C.D. down, which is that most of the songs follow the same structure: raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus. This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable, but all in all, I'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot, because it is much more than typical metalcore. Soilwork deserve to have much success with it, because "Stabbing the Drama" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands. So, if you've given up on In Flames, and you're not sure which other metal bands to listen to (since there are so many), I definitely recommend you give "Stabbing the Drama" a shot.

Which is not to say that the potential isn't there, only that balance is not. Is she the younger visage of Tracy Chapman ("The One," "Power of Words")? Channeling Chaka Khan on two gleefully old school steppin' tracks, "Interested" and "Slow Down"? When she takes her own advice to "live for the moment," she gets better results: "Get it Together" is a swirling slam-dunk of a love song, and "Good Man," an overlooked track off the We Were Soldiers soundtrack, makes a nice fit here. When she comes off preachy, it's with treacly results: "God is Real" and "Little Things" are cloying bits of armchair philosophy.

7752	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	My summary says it all - Johnny Cash was never in 'better voice' than when he recorded this song - that includes his 50's and 60's songs.  He has more range and smoothness in this song than any other - perhaps it's the message that he's trying to send to all believers, and his convictions are well made in the lyrics of this song; quite spooky when you listen to what he has to say, as it applies in the current age as much as it did in 1990, 2001, and now.

811	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	my favorite song by Michael Martin Murphy
And last, but definitely not least, is "The Call of Ktula".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled "When Hell Freezes Over", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song "Hanger 18". Discounting the two covers "Tuesday's Gone" and "Mercyful Fate" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental "Orion".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.
6060	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. "Just send for me, oh baby."

Ironically, back then I wrote "It's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given "45 Real Originals" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for "50 (Mostly) Originals" to 4 stars."

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.

After Burin' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects, Tosh being the most successful of the two. His album Legalize It is another classic. The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band. They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that isn't a bad thing it did seem to loose something. Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums, and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin' has an amazing amount of. Burnin' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits.

On "A Letter," she dedicates a verse to her mother and each of her brothers, apologizing for her mistakes. Then on "730," a bouncy track produced by Loafey, Foxy speaks directly to another woman who's trying to rain on her parade. But that doesn't mean that the entire album is about heartache, as reggae-influenced songs like "Tables Will Turn," featuring Baby Cham, and "Oh Yeah," featuring Spragga Benz, introduce a new wrinkle to Brown's rapping style. She also honors her roots by paying homage to her hometown Brooklyn on "BK Anthem."

181	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.

159	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such "[junk]". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since.

182	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	"Mezzanine" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, "Mezzanine" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to "Blue Lines" that "Protection" failed to be. Like "Blue Lines", "Mezzanine" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic ("Blue Lines" suffered from the track "One Love" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on "Blue Lines", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than "Blue Lines" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album "Blue Lines" and Portishead's "Portishead" (though this one isn't as good).

For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost "Best New Artist" and had the nerve to get on stage to "protest". He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's "Get Rich Or Die Tryin" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even "gangsta". Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up.

6428	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	CALIFORNIA SOUL, an Ashford & Simpson composition, sung by Marlena Shaw is a treat to the ears! I heard this song a few years back, it was playing in the background of a car commercial and everyone in the room wanted to know the name and who sang it. I had to find it and add it to my collection. Since then, I've heard it on 3 more commercials and it was on Lincoln Lawyer soundtrack, and featured in the movie The Italian Job. From the time the music starts playing, you know you're in for a treat and you get it. The music is upbeat and the melody is sweet. Marlena's voice is on point; it's uniquely powerful and full of soul. She has great control of her instrument and you get swept up in the soulful way she delivers each and every note. This song is still going strong and this is a testament to how great of a singer she is. It's no wonder - California Soul has been sampled over and over by rappers (Gang Starr, The Game, etc.), beer manufacturers, Dockers, countless television commercials and a driving game - Driver: San Frisco. I like the album, but I LOVE THIS SONG. You can't listen to it once, you have to play it over and over because it's so good. It's a timeless classic. Great tune and highly recommended.
7673	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	One crucial element that sets this apart from her debut&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Acoustic-Soul/dp/B00005A1PR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Acoustic Soul</a>&nbsp;a year earlier is that...somehow the sound is very much more fully formed in many ways. Wheras the sound of the debut generally emphasized the artists "naturalness" this blends India's "acoustic soul" sound with a array of soundscapes,many of which are as equally funky and soulful."Little Things" is an excellent example. It's groove,the heavy-on-easy style and unique chord changes could only come from the guy who produced her debut:Stevie Wonder. Just about all of the music here maintains his signiture writing style as well,even though India is more fully in charge of the production here. The lyrics are typically "power of positive thinking" but the wonderful thing about them is that India's great attitude and the sincerity and brilliance of her poetry really forgive any possibility for a clishe. Needless the say the moments when this album really catches fire are when the tempo goes up a little such as on the excellent "Slow Down","Can I Walk With You" and the bonus cut "Interested"-all rollicking soul tunes then endow her formula with a lot of rhythmic strengh. Of course that doesn't dismiss the respectful tone of "Talk To You","Complicated Melody" and "Headed In The Right Direction". The only song that confuses me a little here,where I love the lush music is "God Is Real". I realize the connection in the black community to Christianity runs deep and is significant but for the life of me I cannot tell if this song is advertising India's obvious Christian faith or if her intention is to point out that nature in itself is godly. Not being religious myself these kinds of ambiguous lyrics are always mildly curious to me. So while this album really serves mostly to establish that her huge success with the debut wasn't some kind of post millenium fluke this was really the last time,musically anyway India. Arie would have anything to prove.

The Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the "healing hand becomes the bleeding hand."
The title track reached #48 on the singles chart, a slower midpaced affair.  "Spanish Dancer" along the same languid lines, may be an example of what many called "lazy music" to describe Winwood's early solo stuff.

127	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like "Fade to Black" and "Creeping Death" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. "The Call of Ktulu" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.

1286	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This must be the most popular karaoke song of all time; when I tried to find the "original" release, I found over 200 listings, many instrumentals by myriads of different groups.  I really got the wrong version of this song; I would have rather had the original that he sang on a 45.  This isn't it; it is a LIVE version; it's not bad, but see if you can find the original if you know the song well.  If you never heard the original, this version is fine, but for most of us, we can distinguish the slight differences.  My problem was I was not paying close enough attention; you only get 30 seconds to make up your mind, and this version sounded pretty good for the first 30 seconds.

So I have no idea how Reba McEntire's version compares to Lawrence's.  Normally I prefer the original version of a song over a remake (unless it's a Weird Al "remake"), and I suppose one of these days I should look up the Lawrence version as a comparison/contrast to McEntire's.

The net result is that you have Burl Ives singing eight recognizable Christmas songs and introducing you to four songs that you have probably not heard before that are perfectly suited to his strengths as a singer.  Ives started out in the 1920s as an itinerate folk singers, moved to Broadway in the 1930s, appeared on the radio in the 1940s, and became a popular folk singer in the 1950s.  But most people today probably remember him as the Snowman who narrates the story of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" that still airs each holiday season forty years later.  Because of that connection it is entirely possible that a Burl Ives Christmas album will be warmly received in your home by those who do not know about the rest of his resume.  He certainly produces the requisite warm seasonal feelings.

6542	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Great beat, Fun sing-a-long song,
The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to "Weapon of Vanity" and "Nerve" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.

On "Intro" there is no rapping or talking, all we hear is a coin drop, following that we go into the next track produced by Rob "Reef" Tewlow, "What Up Gangsta" and the beat is sick especially when it first comes on, The good doctor gave fif a hit with "In da Club", you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song or somebody just rapping the lyrics "Go shorty, it's your birthday/ We gonna party like it's your birthday!" The other singles were "21 Questions" (featuring Nate Dogg), its one of those would you be down for if I didn't have this type of song. "Many Men (Wish Death)" is the best song on here. On "Back Down", he also throws more shots on "Heat" the Dr. Dre's beat is simple, it has a constant guncok sound. Em shows up twice, on "Patiently Waiting" where he easily outshines Curtis and "Don't Push Me", also featuring Lloyd Banks. On the latter Em is rapping about the same stuff as 50 but he doesn't get called out for it? Double standard? But on another note it was a dope track. There are some missteps on here though "Blood Hound" (featuring Young Buck) was just too boring for me, the pimping anthem "P.I.M.P." cant even be saved by his catchy hook. His braggadocios raps brings the down the album as well, at least switch it up sometimes! We know you got 9 times, we know you went from noting to something tell us something we don't know. As for the bonus tracks "Wanksta" took him to another level, it appeared on the G-Unit mixtape then the 8Mile sdtk, "U Not Like Me" and "Life's on the Line" were out before he was even signed. Overall I think 50 dropped a classic album and lets not try to rewrite history, this was biggest album of 2003. If you do buy it I suggest getting a used one for 5 dollars or less. I heard all 50s album and trust me this is the one worth checking out besides Power Of The Dollar.

The music clips might be a bit deceptive. This is a moody, atmospheric album (even more so than her previous efforts). It also sounds even more personal than usual.

The song is played in an eerie, almost menacing key, quite befitting the building dread of the story as a man tries to track down his unfaithful wife's lover and gets far more trouble than he bargained for in the process.  The piano and electric guitar track mesh well, and the drum track is appropriately intense without overpowering the song.  And Reba's vocals carry the song well -- she doesn't scream or holler, but lets the lyrics convey the song's emotions on their own.  This song could easily have played out as melodramatic in the hands of another singer, but Reba doesn't overdo it, and so the song hits the right balance.

review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a "power ballad"...

1273	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	After spending the past few years getting all the nu-metal trash thrown at me, it seems that that fad has finally waned down.  This new "metal-core" fad in metal today will most likely suffer the same fate, but for bands like Soilwork, this passing fad may find them mainstream success.  After the disappointing "Figure Number Five", Soilwork return with "Stabbing the Drama", which is a vast improvement, and while it may not harken back to the "Natural Born Chaos" or even "Steelbath Suicide" days, this album still manages to be a more than solid headbanger.  The title track features an incredibly catchy chorus, while "One With the Flies", "Stalemate", and "If Possible" are great as well.  However, there are times on "Stabbing the Drama" that it sounds too mainstream aimed, especially on "Distance".  Despite that, and many of the negative reviews featured here, "Stabbing the Drama" is an intelligent metal album, which is something the genre so desperately needs with all the Killswitch Engage's and Atreyu's running around today.  All in all, if you've never heard Soilwork before, check out "Steelbath Suicide" or "Natural Born Chaos", and then give "Stabbing the Drama" a stab.

7111	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Dreams by The Cranberries is a powerful 90s rock song that is both stirring and healing to the soul.  Fighting the Urge to Look Up The Meaning to the Song, Dreams is about coming to terms with multiple changes happening in someones life while appreciating a person who occupies a large place in your heart (metaphorically).  I recently enjoyed hearing Dreams by The Cranberries on iheartradio because it is not played as often on the radio where I currently live  I completely understand that this song could mean something completely different from what Im guessing it is but for me the song reminds me of my husband in a benevolent way.  This is because he has helped me add even more brighter colors (metaphorically speaking) to my life and has helped me appreciate life even more just by his example of how he sees the positive benefits in certain things that would test even the strongest of souls.  Hence, when the lead singer of Cranberries sings you're a dream to me it reminds me of how I have told this to my husband before (just in slightly different words). Overall, Dreams by Cranberry is both an elevating and novelty type of rock song.

This was a song that I used to listen to quite a bit as a young man and it was a  song that was forgotten about when I switched to listening to CD's. I had the Album but never bought the CD. This is a great love song that relies heavily on Electronic Synthesizers. Being a hopeless romantic I related to the lyrics, I always felt I was in love but didn't want to show it. ( It was really lust and most women knew it). I'm glad I have  this  song back in my library.
Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours.

334	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	In this classic rocker we are treated to a driving beat intertwined with soaring lyrics. Musically it is a fusion of early 70s rock with strong Motown flourishes such as ample use of fuzz and wa-wa on the guitars with lively choral back-up on the vocals. The lyrics are upbeat as was typical of the era. It makes you smile and wish more music of today could impart such a good feeling. There is some really great drumming throughout.
317	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This was a story telling song about a man wanting to be next to a beautiful woman. From the movie Car Wash. Great film and song.
It's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this.

This song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say "to hell with being up-tight" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment. Unfortunately, I know these things.

"Stray Cat Strut" was released in the early 1980's by a group called The Stray Cats, a trio that featured musician Brian Setzer.  At the time, I thought it was a silly, absurd yet enjoyable tune.  Roughly twenty-eight years later, it's still fairly humorous but also I hear nuances and jazz influences and terminology that enriches the song to the status of a minor classic.

Patsy not only was the first woman to ever "close" various artist concerts and Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, she was also one of the earliest country stars to cross over into mainstream pop. With classy touches of strings, echo and backing vocals by the Jordanaires (and others), these dozen Owen Bradley produced sides stand the test of time.

The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in "I've Grown Accustomed To His Face" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in "It Might As Well Be Spring" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning "But Beautiful," "Moonlight Becomes You" and "Like Someone In Love." One of my all-time favorites "The Music That Makes Me Dance" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of "It Never Entered My Mind" and "In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on "The Best Is Yet To Come" is so pleasing to the ears.

124	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.

If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.
6440	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	TAKES ME BACK TO THE GREATEST ERA IN MUSIC.
 Obviously, there is more to this gem of a song. Billy Idol really puts alot of his spirit into the song in such an excellent fashion that it is almost like he is telling a very entertaining story that he is simultaneously singing. I admit that I first heard this song when I was a teenager, and I currently still love listening to this song. The guitar riffs and his fantastic singing blend well together with this song to make it a musical track that is fun to listen to multiple times in a row. "Rebel Yell" is also another song to put in a love/lust playlist and/or 80's classic song playlist

4888	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I liked 50 Cent's debut.  Warning, listen to it at your own caution despite the explicit lyrics.  This album is raw, his raps blend well with the different musics and beats and producers and he is just dynamite on the Dr. Dre-produced songs (even "In Da Club"). The ones that Eminem produced are just as solid too.  And his song "21 Questions" shows his softer side and pleasant compliments to the girl he's talking about on the song.  Better than hearing the heavy gun themes that dominate the album.  But his being from the streets justifies his stand in his songs' lyrics.  One of the best albums I heard during 2003.

25	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.  So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no "Dancing Machine", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included "Dangerous" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be "Working Day And Night". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need.
6299	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There are melodies and movements on this album reminiscent of Miles Davis' masterpiece 'Kind of Blue', but with vibes and without, of course, the trumpets/saxes; so thoroughly unique, but in a similar Jazz vein.

The aforementioned stripped back sound finds the band concentrating mostly on fundamental and simplistic rock tracks, that eschew whatever elements of psychedelic sounds were found in the bands style from their first few releases as well as no longer exploring many different directions at once, like on the two eclectic albums which preceded this one.

Listening to this CD really took me back to that first moment when I heard this album.  Putting needle to wax and hearing "Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up for your rights!" come shouting through my speakers absolutely sent chills down my spine.  Understand the time frame, this was 1973 and the Civil Rights/Black Power movements were still raging in the U.S., to hear a band sing a song like that was so mind boggling to my young ears.  Radio stations weren't prone to play such revolutionary themes at the time and especially from a genre that was just making a name for itself on a worldwide scale.  Then you had the sweet and angelic sounds of Bunny Wailer's "Hallelujah Time" with it's wonderful bass guitar and clavinet intro.  This song is so powerful in that it reminds you of the beauty of the simple things in life in the midst of such gross oppression.
Great.

Though Beverly was born in Philadelphia, the band became transplanted San Francisco Bay Area residents and adopted that area's sounds of raw soul, elegant soul and message supplanted soul. Marvin Gaye also helped define their "What's Going On" to  "I Want You" soul which would also give them a Motown 70s pedigree, when the label successfully graduated from the #1 singles label, from an indie no less, to a great album label.

7258	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	I think CeCe Peniston's material represents the 90's decade well.  I like that black turtle neck outfit she wears in "Finally."  I guess "Keep on Walking" is funky as far as rhythm, instruments, and beats go, culminating into a well put together song from the 90's.  "I thought that what we had would never end.."  is obviously a song about a romantic relationship.  Beyonce's "De Ja Vu" and Teena Marie's "Square Biz" are similar to this song's style.

 More pop sounding than her 1974 version "I Will Always Love You" was produced by her band leader Gregg Perry. Many have said this version is a bit inferior than 1974's, but Dolly's voice here is pure, heartfelt and filled with emotion. Dolly herself was going through a breakdown in her own personal life at the time of this recording in early 1982 as she battled weight problems, family issues, an attempt by people to blackmail her and a personal heartache that she refuses to talk about. This all led to the amazing vocal range on this track.

I found that listening to music I like at calming times of the day prevents my depression.  This is a very upbeat song about a man's reaction to a very fine lady.  This woman must be awesome because if you listen to his story this woman has his nose wide open to use slang popular in my day.  Simply Irresistible has awesome lyrics that tell an interestingly funny story to an upbeat solid beat.

Next comes "Undone", which isn't the kind of song that's meant to be played on the radio. It starts of as a pretty decent Weezer song, but it's a bit long. Rivers starts singing at 0:52 [after a conversation sound-clip with two people] and stops singing at around 3:20, then the music gets annoyingly intense at 3:52. Once it dies down, we just start hearing some microphone feedback and some ominous piano chords. I think it'd be much better off without them.

It has been done by practically everybody from rock bands to opera singers and there is something to say for all.  The lyrics are stunning - it is a very sad love song.  The singer or chorus who does it needs quite a range.  It needs to be belted out, not whispered with the help of electronic equipment.  I liked Allison Crowe's renditon.  Bon Jovi does a good job, as does Jason Castro,the Canadian Tenors, and Brandi Carlile.

4481	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is the studio version of the song Stay by Sugarland as heard on the radio. It is not a live or concert version.
We take in her message to unfaithful boyfriends, how they line up in her perception of romance, and how she deals with their galavanting all over town - thinking she would stay home and stitch their socks. More couples danced way into the night in wild excitement with this one song - than anyone could imagine - from Moscow to Manhattan - from Paris to Omaha. There is so much life, vigor, and honesty in this song with the trumpets blaring their triumphant salute to her 'stand your ground if he messes around' anthem for women throughout the world. A truly remarkable accomplishment for the artists involved. Written by Bridges and Susan Hutcheson; produced by Steve Buckingham.

This follow-up, seemingly rushed into stores, doesn't clear up the confusion; as with Alicia Keys, it's almost impossible to criticize a contemporary urban artist who writes life-affirming, organic songs, yet this journey ends as unconvincingly as Soul or Songs in A Minor. What's more, it lacks any sort of knockout number -- Soul had two, "Video" and "Brown Skin" -- leaving us to wonder just where Arie intended on taking us.

4617	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	In my mind, Bob Marley has great songs, but generally inconsistant albums. This is the exception to the rule. Bob's angry at the state of the human race here, and he wants you to know. And people tend to make good music while angry. This is no exception. Pretty much every song is classic: Get Up, Stand Up (which got even better virtually ever time he played it live); I Shot the Sheriff; and Burnin' are the best-known, and best. Also check out the politically-charged, pro-revolutionary Small Axe; Duppy Conqueror, with great harominies; Pass It On; and the call for unity One Foundation. I'd call Hallelujah Time the weakest of the bunch. But as for the rest? It's all good. BUY IT!

9919	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This song pretty much rules rock radio right now. Which is kind of sad, because if this is the best they have, they're in trouble. The song itself doesn't break any ground, and while its melody and overall musical structure may be fine, albeit a little radio-friendly, I think what really draws people into the song is the vocals. They're kind of different, and they grab your attention. They're not stunning in the least bit, but it's different. And some might consider the song a nice change. However, wiser heads would look at the song and say, yeah, it's alright.

"Creeping Death", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

5894	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I am a huge music fan and listen to all types - mainly pop, R&B, dance, country & hip-hop.  But this song is fantastic!  Such a great, funky feel to it.  Was totally worth buying.
Part 1 has "Thank You" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. "Vibin'" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). "I Sit Away" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and "Nobody Knows"..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)
Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of "Fight Fire With Fire" and "Trapped Under Ice" or the longer epics "The Call Of Ktulu", the title track, and the awesome "Creeping Death." The menacing "For Whom The Bell Tolls" and "Escape" are also very strong tracks. Then there's "Fade To Black", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what "Stairway To Heaven" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended.
9372	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Billy Currington has  a great song here that fits right in to today's country music spectrum. It's original punch line is delivered outside of the usual country cliches, yet remains very country in it's content and performance.

"Call of Ktulu", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). "Creeping Death" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. "Fire Fire with Fire" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. "Trapped under Ice" is tight speed metal.

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.

I full recommend "Ring of Fire" by Johnny Cash.
Fortunately, "Voyage" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. "The Truth" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. "Headed In The Right Direction" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired "love yourself" retreads.

An equally picky point is the over representation of "Heart in Motion."  I know it was her biggest release by far.  But it gets five tracks, which is about a quarter of the disc space.  And, to be honest, it's not my favorite of her releases.  Seems like one or two could have been cut to include a song from somewhere else.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that "Sing Your Praise to the Lord" didn't make the cut.  That would have been a good switch.

In style, this song resembles 'Arms Race' a little to closely, but differs in minor, but better, changes in the verses and chorus.

When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.

4901	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	When I originally heard "How To Rob" from the "In Too Deep" soundtrack, I liked the song and the clever wordplay involved, but I wondered if 50 Cent had enough to carry a whole album.  Rappers like Jay Z, Ghostface Killah, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx and others weren't too pleased with what 50 had to say and they came out with their own things to say about the song.  Just as 50 was about to record his 1st single from "Power Of The Dollar", "Thug Love" w/Destiny's Child, 50 was shot multiple times.  After he recovered, 50 called his label and they acted as if 50 had never even existed.  To reestablish himelf, 50 hit the mixtape circuit and would appear on various mixtapes freestyling or with songs that were supposed to appear on "Power Of The Dollar".  In early 2002, Full Clip Records released "Guess Who's Back" which included underground songs and freestyles that included 50, G Unit, Nas, Nature, The Bravehearts and Bun B of UGK on different tracks.  Shortly after that, 50 Cent & G Unit released several mixed Cds and the buzz definitely had been recreated.  Eminem heard "Guess Who's Back" after he completed "The Eminem Show" and that was the beginning of 50 Cent being signed to Eminem's Shady Records.  50 Cent's popular mix tape track, "Wanksta" appeared on Eminem's "8 Mile" soundtrack, as well as,  "Places To Go" and "Love Me" which was  a collaboration with Eminem, 50 Cent and Obie Trice.  These songs and the mixed CDs were enough to keep 50 out in the streets until his highly anticipated CD, "Get Rich Or Die Trying", was released.  When "In Da Club" was released to radio and started appearing on MTV and BET, 50's CD was definitely going to be in demand.  Dr. Dre's club banger had everyone sayig "Go, go, go, go, go..".  The song would propel "Get Rich Or Die Trying" with over 800,000 units sold in the first four days of its release.  The CD gets off a nice start with "What's Up Gangsta".  Fans of 50's street releases will definitely like this track.  Next up is "Patiently Waiting" as Eminem and 50 collaborate on the Eminem produced track.  50 and Eminem rip the track to shreds.  On "Many Men (Wish Death)", 50 speaks about how after being shot multiple times, how he reflects on things and how your enemies and people that are jealous of you are always plotting behind your back.  This is one of "Get Rich Or Die Trying's" best tracks.  Dr. Dre shows up again to produce the passion filled "Heat".  50 is back in street mode once again and has an anthem for anyone that wants to come at him and his G Unit crew.  "If I Can't" is more of a radio friendly Dre song but you will forget the commercial appeal of the song once you hear 50 rhyming to the track.  "Back Down" has 50 speaking on his long term beef with Ja Rule.  This is the CD's best track, in my opinion, as 50 says, "You're a pop tart, sweetheart, you're soft in the middle...".  Since then there have been several back and forth disses with the latest being "Hail Mary 2003" with Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes.  The 2nd single, "21 Questions" with Nate Dogg is an ode for the ladies that will definitely continue to keep "Get Rich Or Die Trying" on the charts for awhile.  "Don't Push Me" w/Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem, has 50 Cent rapping a little too much like 2 Pac for some people.  I like the song as the rappers flow lovely to the Eminem's beat.  "Poor Lil Rich" is a Sha Money XL track that plans keep 50 in heavy club rotation along with the aforementioned "In Da Club" and "P.I.M.P".  The only song that you will have to fast forward, in my opinion, is "Blood Hound" with Young Buck as it sounds like DMX is barking throughout the whole song. "Get Rich Or Die Trying" also includes "Wanksta", "U Not Like Me", and "Life's On The Line" as bonus tracks, but loyal 50 fans have heard these tracks already.  50 recently released a DVD, "The New Breed" that included a bonus CD with 3 tracks:  "True Loyalty" with G Unit, "8 Mile Road" (G Unit Remix)with G Unit, and the Dr. Dre produced "In Da Hood" with Brooklyn.  To anyone who doesn't know G Unit is 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Bang 'Em Smurf and a cast of other characters.  G Unit recently signed with Interscope Records, so a G Unit CD and a Lloyd Banks solo CD should be out by the end of the year and expect a new 50 Cent CD by February 2004.  For 50 Cent the sky is the limit.  If you judge "Get Rich Or Die Trying" by just "In Da Club" and "21 Questions" then you will be saddenly mistakened.  This CD has more than club friendly songs on it.  Fans of 50's street anthems will enjoy this CD as well.  I wonder how Columbia feels now that 50 Cent has sold more than 4 million records in 10 weeks?  I would advise you to get "Get Rich Or Die Trying" and "Guess Who's Back" to start your 50 library.  FREE YAYO!!!!

"Ride The Lightning", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment.

5022	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Amazon offers such great big box deals, I so rarely buy singles anymore, but with Miss Westenra's 'Dark Waltz,' I had to make an exception--the introduction and interlude are wonderfully and quintessentially Celtic, almost Lord of the Rings in tone. Truth be told, I thought Miss W was performing and INSTRUMENTAL, and then she sang! And, oh, I was in love again with the song AND the siren. I was hopelessly and helplessly bewitched by the beauty of this piece.  For your own sanity, don't walk away from the sample. HIGHLY recommended...
184	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening "Angel" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!

As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.
  "Walking After Midnight" is a classic.  You feel like you are there with her as she croons desperately about her guy.  "I Fall To Pieces", "She's Got You", "Back In Baby's Arms"... Heck this entire collection is a must have.

It is said that Winwood was seriously considering giving up on his musical career and this album was his last throw of the dice; what a throw!  The sparse instrumentation as compared with his group work plus the signature synthesizer which I personally like and think gives the album a unique sound allows for Steve to showcase his best talent i.e. his remarkable tone in his vocals without the rest of a band to distract from it and he bares his soul here with meaningful lyrics told by a master storyteller.  I enjoyed every track which are all consistently strong making this come in a close second to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Back-in-High-Life/dp/B00599UE1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Back in High Life</a>as his best ever album.  This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release is pretty good and although the design and assembly is not among the best that I've seen it is good enough coming with a very good inner sleeve and a foldout containing all the lyrics in Japanese only.  Overall this will please both the mlps collector as well as other fans as the sound quality has been remastered very well too.

7816	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I've heard it said that when Trent Reznor, who wrote this song and performed it in solo and/or with Nine Inch Nails, he was very much opposed to Johnny Cash covering this song.  Yet, when Trent heard JC's version, he was truly impressed.  So am I.  This was recorded by Cash just after the death of his wife June Carter Cash, and shortly before he himself died.  I can hear the heartbreak in his voice.  He sounds old and weary, yet that works so well for him in this song.  This was truly his last iconic hit, in my opinion.  I love performing this song at karaoke, since I have a deep voice.  But it is incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve his style.  I've done it before, but it seems only by accident.  Cash is truly a master songwriter and performer, and this track is truly an exclamation mark on his entire repertoire.

Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.

 "Good Man" is definitely an album highlight.  The lyrics are meaningful and real.  The song is about a man who has children and if anything ever happens to him, he wants his children to know he loved them and that he was a good man.  Many parents can relate to this song because it's the same way they feel about their children.  "Talk to Her" has one of those beats you can snap your fingers and bob your head to.  Aside from the laid back beat, the song offers a very relevant message in today's world; talk to women with respect (men).  This song has simple lyrics, but they say so much.  I love it!  "God is Real" is another one of the many beautiful songs on "Voyage to India".  This song has a very noticeable guitar in the background.  India's vocals are really good on this track, they help the song to be more believable.  The song is about questioning the existence of God.  India does an excellent job of stating her claim of why she thinks or as she says "knows" that God is real.  "Can I Walk With You" and "The One" are just nice love songs.  India's vocals are, again, on point for these tracks.  If anyone were to ask me to pick to tracks to listen to on this album, I'd go with these.  The album contains no fillers, just brilliant work by a great artist of today.  If debating on whether or not to cop this one, GET IT NOW!  India will take you by surprise, like she did men.  I am very impressed with the talent of this woman.  She's a shining star! 5 star album!

Keeping with tradition, Lewis starts out his show by busting on the city he's performing in. This time around he busts on Minnesota and his bit on their cold weather is hysterical. As usual, he's spot on when it comes to tackling issues like greed in big business and society's obsession with health. In particular, his commentary on milk and water are very funny. However, the end of the album is dominated by his views on Iraq. While his commentary is accurate, it does tend to drag at times. All told, Rules of Enragement is a very good album even if it tends to be too political near the end.

This is a upgrade after "Club Ninja", but that wasn't very hard to do.  The thing about "Imaginos", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88).  I still like these songs after 22 years, "I Am The One You Warned Me Of", "Les Invisibles", "Magna Of Illusion", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own "Astronomy" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic "Blue Oyster Cult", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best.

3441	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	When "Mothermania" was released there were already several compilation albums of The Mothers Of Invention floating around. Except for "Mothermania", none were compiled or approved by Frank Zappa. On FZ's only approved "best of The Mothers" collection, we get four unique mixes of four songs, which makes this release essential for the Zappa fan who needs EVERYTHING! "Mother People" has the verse that was censored out of "We're Only In It For The Money" (which includes the wonderful lyric: "Shut your f-----g mouth about the length of my hair". "The Idiot Bastard Son" features a short intro that was trimmed for "We're Only In It For The Money", and it also omits the mid-song dialog that ruined the flow of the song. "Call Any Vegetable", which consists of three parts and runs about 8 minutes on "Absolutely Free" is trimmed to a more digestible 4:23, by omitting most of part 2 ("Invocation & Ritual Dance Of The Young Pumpkin"). Finally, we get the alternate edit of "It Can't Happen Here", which has the piano ballet interlude removed, and adds an extra line of FZ's dialog with Suzy Creamcheese. For me, as a Zappa fanatic, "Mothermania" on CD is a long awaited, essential collection.

Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.

 By 1973 after being the biggest duet team in country music history for 6 years Dolly wanted to go off on her own, conquer the pop music market and star in films. Porter was totally against this as he thought Dolly could never make it in popular music or in motion pictures and he felt Dolly owed him a great deal of gratitude for helping her be so big in the country field. The fighting got worse and the arguing ever worser as Porter refused to reason with Dolly, so Dolly thought to herself, "You can't talk to this man, so do what you so best: go home and write a song and perhaps he will somehow understand what I need to do". So, one night in the late spring of 1973 with only her guitar in her music room at her Nashville mansion Dolly wrote "I Will Always Love You" in less than an hour. The following day she went to Porter's office, and knowing she was going to go one way or another, told Porter, "I wrote a song for you". He sat at his desk and cried all the way through it and told her that was the greatest song she ever wrote.

In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr. J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing.

8401	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	"Dry" is P.J. Harvey's debut album, released in 1992 it was a critical success while it did modest on the commercial side of things. Harvey was a breath of fresh air to the industry and was that generation's Patti Smith. Her mixture of pounding riffs and raw vocals created one superb album, the multi-talented Harvey wasn't content with just singing she had to co-produce the album, play guitars and violin, and write all but two of the tracks (those two she co-wrote). There are standouts but the album is overall a solid effort and flows well.

540	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	From my exposure of VH1, I was in 7th grade when I first heard I Ran by A Flock of Seagulls. This catchy song has a hybrid of synth-pop and electro rock in the beat and appears to be a song about falling in love with someone who is different in some way from many people. Im glad that this song is available to hear online (Amazon prime, youtube, Pandora, iheartradio etc.) because it is rarely played on local radio where my husband and I current reside.
1792	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	My 6 year old loves this song and sings to it when it comes on the radio. I decided to order it for her so she can listen to it whenever she likes! We actually sang it in mass a few weeks ago and she was so excited!
I can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. "They Don't Care About Us" and "Earth Song" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think "Whatever Happens" should have been here and perhaps "Butterflies". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop "hits" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!
Now, about the music itself?  At the risk of sounding trite, the  guitars really do shimmer, the banjos sparkle in a setting of solid drumming and inventive bass.  The lyrics are excellent, and reveal more on repeated listening, which is a benchmark which I use to decide who gets my 5th star or not.  The entire album is excellent, no weak tracks, and the more I hear it, the more glad I am to listen to it.  Some might consider it a flaw that there is no one "stand out" track--no one track that is so instantly memorable or catchy as to be the obvious single.  But this is not music for singles, a treat to be digested quickly and best given with insulin--it is music for sustenance.

The album starts off with "Fight Fire With Fire" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track "For Whom the Bell Tolls" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with "Fade to Black" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale.

A little on the louder side than some songs, but that's ok, it is still a good buy.
Highlights include:
  "While You See A Chance" proved to be the huge pop hit Winwood was looking for. With its strongly layered synthesizers and strong pop craft and construction? This is essentially an electronic/new wave re-imagining of the uptempo gospel/soul he started doing from the outset. The title song is similarly layered in Stevie Wonder-like washes of synthesizers on a funky Caribbean style mid tempo number. "Second Hand Human" is a hugely melodic,chiming synthesizer heavy pop/pop number in the same league as the hit that led off the album. Starting off as a melodic,folksy ballad "Slowdown Sundown" gets into dance floor friendly and funky groove on the refrains. "Spanish Dancer" has a beautifully liquidy sound with bubbling synthesizers and a harmonically subterranean melody. "Night Train" is a sleekly electronic jazz/funk jam while the dynamic ballad "Dust concludes the album.

It's such a sad song. A song that seems to have such little hope for the protagonist (I'm not sure what they're called in songs). She will Be Loved is about a guy who loves a girl who has some sort of issue. Either she is mentally unstable? Used by other people in wicked ways? Etc. This scenario dooms the protagonist to this longing for a person who he will never get... because she can't respond. Not that she won't. She CAN'T.
333	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	"This is the song for people who are the workers and not the employees." Everytime I listened to this music, I am proud to be a worker. This song is now part of my music library.
Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is true, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in "Take Time" and "Coffee". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in "Groove On", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to "Free Again" and the very revealing "Poppa Loved to Love Me", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR
Overall, "Dry" is special, it retains it's rock-alternative sound while still displaying emotion and beauty. The two best tracks would have to be "Plants And Rags" & "Sheela-Na-Gig", simply because they well, standout. This album though is incredibly solid throughout and flows nicely making this an irresistable album by a true musical genius.

If you ever need a helping hand,
COMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with "Ride The Lightning". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. "Lightning" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - "For Whom The Bells Toll" and "Fade To Black" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). "Call Of Ktulu" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on "S&M" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below "Master Of Puppets". Still a great disc.
7791	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	We love Johnny Cash.  His last song is haunting, he tells us how he felt about life & dying.  We wil miss him.
When Javier first released "Crazy" last year, I wasn't too, uh, crazy about it because lyrically, he wasn't saying anything new. If you're looking for more original songwriting on this album, you won't find it but you will find some wonderfully sung tracks like "Song for Your Tears" and "Hey Little Sister". Javier also does a good rendition of the jazz standard, "October Sky". Vocally, he is a cross between Eric Benet and Slim from 112. He has a good chance of staying long in the business if he is promoted right. Actually, this album came out last August, I only saw one video from him ("Crazy"), and I'm sure this album isn't platinum yet, so the future doesn't look too good. Pick this album up to support Javier, and for more underrated artists on Capitol Records, also get the new Van Hunt. -EJR

For Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who has succeeded in turning angry working Americans against one another instead of his biollionaire employer and the wealthy advertisers who bankroll them..
It's a song that runs on a million trains of thoughts, ranging from karma, to self-appreciation, to celebrity-bashing. It's certainly ground-breakingly awesome, bringing awesomeness to another level not only in the world of pop rock, but music period. Hearkening back to those piano-driven pop ballads of the 70s, this outwardly simple song holds a lot of complexity to it. Just ask U2 guitarist/song-writer "The Edge." When asked in Time Magazine back in '06 what songs he would most like to have written, there was "Wonderwall," and "You Get What You Give." And even though some would say it's a throwback to years gone by, it keeps itself a modern eye, staying relevant not only in the 90s, but also in the 00s.

5779	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	It's the song that showed of his immense talent to the world, and it really never gets old either.  Mr. McKnight is such an understated, yet powerful crooner.  In a different life, he would have been the antithesis of Frank Sinatra, yet he's never abrasive to any listener.  His pianist stylists are somewhere between Bill Evans and a quiet dive bar's lonely player.  That type of authenticity is long gone from most musicians, but on Anytime he manages to embrace the multi-layered hopelessness without having to sell it.  You're simply there, in the moment, and stuck without a prayer.

4854	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Whoa. I was used to hearing Brecker in your average funk-fusion (a bit smoother than I like sometimes), and straight-ahead blowing sessions, so this one really took me by surprise. Here he assembled a unique combination of instruments - among them strings, guitar and a somewhat unique (including French horn and Baritone) brass section - which gives the music a kind of heft and richness that is just a joy to hear. The arrangements are great - interesting horn/string lines underneath Brecker's usual masterful and fiery soloing. My faves are "Night Jessamine", and "Modus Operandi" which are two of the grooviest and funkinest jazz songs I've heard in quite a while. The only tiny complaint I have is that Brecker is virtually the only soloist. He gives bassist Pattituci a few spots, as well as a couple for the guitarist and trumpeter, but most of the time it is him wailing on and on. Mind you, he is an awesome soloist, I love his playing, but sometimes you need to break it up a bit and let the other guys shine for a while, too - that is what Jazz is about, individual expression, while still serving the collective. Not even the great Coltrane had a problem letting Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, or his own McCoy Tyner shine for a while. But, aside from that, this is a superb effort from one of the most important saxophonists since Coltrane. Keep it up, Mike.
This is one of those songs to introduce them to!

Live albums always work better, when there recorded from one venue, instead of a whole tour, constantly fading in & out after each song, losing momentum.  But "River Plate" feels like a one off special event, which always makes a live more appearing to listen to. It is interesting that back in the 70's & 80's, rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3-4-studio albums, but "AC/DC Live" was one of the last big selling live albums (Thanks Kirk Cobain).

Brian McKnight is just a wonderful singer.
Javier appears to be caught in the group of overlooked singers, as his self-titled debut is a great album full of light soul songs, with a little bit of blues thrown in here and there. If you want to enjoy some other snap-your-fingers style jams like "Crazy", try throwing on "She Spoke To Me" or "Slow Motion" (the latter kind of reminds me of "Don't You Forget It" by Glenn Lewis [another overlooked singer]). Slow songs are also good, as evidenced by my favorite track, "Biggest Mistake", which is what you'll do if you don't play this song.

Some of the songs are really swinging, some are beautifully sad, some are pretty darn modern, but the general feeling of the album would be - in my interpretation - warm. The cozy tone of the leader's guitar really enriches his fanciful solo flights as well as the numbers where the rest of the trio has a larger role.

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

"Strange" is very well done--there's some backup vocals for Patsy and while they do sound pretty good Patsy never really needed backup; her talent carried her through every time! Patsy's interpretation of Hank Cochran's "She's Got You" is very impressive; and Patsy's "Heartaches" is easily the very best I've ever heard! "Half As Much" is easy on the ear even if the lyrics aren't all that happy while "When I Get through with You (You'll Love Me Too)" is certainly more upbeat. "Imagine That" gets a fine treatment from Patsy and "So Wrong" yet again features Patsy's beautiful contralto voice. "Why Can't He Be You" is another moving number.

The only song that I have a problem with is "Down In Mississippi."  It's an attempt at a barn-burner that wants to sound like Southern rock but fails to satisfy.  Nettles' voice comes across as forced, and the song just feels out of place from the rest of the album.  If this trio has any shortcomings, it's that their sound is too tight to sound tough.

The first song on the album: "What This World Needs" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along.

This is an album that gave them many awards and multiplatinum success for the music and the harmonies alone.

What I love about "Mezzanine" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as "Mezzanine" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs "Angel" and "Risingon" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to "Teardrop" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. "Mezzanine" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.

162	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.)

Since "Love Calls" is the first single, it's probably also the most recognizable song on the album - but I don't know if I would necessarily say it's the best song. Not to say it isn't a great song, but there are other great tracks too, like "Inside" (no, it's not about sex) and the gospel-flavored "This Place". And "Brotha Man" is a great storytelling track.
The release comes from the repetitive refrain, "The boys are back in town", as it is more fluid
2008	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This is a classic song from Lenny Kravitz. I suspect many, many, many men know it only as one of the best songs from Gran Turismo 3. That's where I heard it and it brings back such happy memories of the last good Gran Turismo game. That aside this is a fast, guitar and drum heavy song with a cracking music video to go with it and one of the cooles tdrummers ever. Definitely a song to keep. So, why the four stars? Well the version I downloaded from AMazon was so quiet it could barely be heard played over my computer speakers and when played on my X7/Sennheiser portable music set up I thought I'd missed it. This is really poor audio quality. There are ways around this if you're creative so whilst I like the song the download is terrible. Avoid.

This disc is an attempt to collect the hits from Amy's entire career, and it does a remarkable good job.  With just nineteen songs, it hits all the highlights.  It includes "Simple Things," the title track from her last major studio release and "Old Man's Rubble" from her self title debut.  In fact, it includes at least one song from each of her major studio releases (not counting the hymns projects or the Christmas releases) except for her third, "Never Alone."  Heck, it even includes "Stay for Awhile."  That song originated on Collection and went on to become a hit in its own right.

I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it.

186	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. "Mezzanine" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums ["Blue Lines", "Protection", and "100th Window"]. I think of all the MA albums I own, "Mezzanine" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of "Angel". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off "Mezzanine" has to be "Man Next Door" and "Teardrop". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in "Mezzanine" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that "Mezzanine" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.

Were it not, that is, for a new crop of young bands, all of whom were just pre-teens in 1994 when Green Day released "Dookie," that emerged around this time to save the day and inject some much-needed youthful vitriol to the sound.

2648	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Richard Marx is one of my favorite singer/songwriters ever. In an era where most things felt over-produced, dramatic, or downright cheesy, the music of Richard Marx felt like a breath of fresh air. One of his most famous songs is a post relationship classic "Should've Known Better." Richard Marx voice allows the listener to believe that he has truly expierianced the heartbreak of which he sings. Something that is def. lacking in today's mostly soulless popular music scene. There's something universal in the loss of love that Richard Marx manages to capture though without delivering a four minute funeral procession in the process.

Sure its raw and whatever else.  Whoopee.  On a decent sound system it sounds quite good as it has a pretty clean sound.  And it also shows that Ringo was the better choice for drummer.  He just had the edge on Pete.  Having said that, Pete Best did a pretty darn good job.

17. Spit It Out Live
  To my way of thinking? Debating over which song I like better on this album serves no purpose. Winwood didn't merely make an album here with a hit or two and just filled it out. He constructed a creatively potent album that mixed his classic blue eyed soul approach with modern post disco/new wave synthesizer touches. And the way in which he used synthesizers were creative and highly distinctive. He was one of a scant few pop musicians who was able to create an enormous sense of warmth and feeling out of them. I include Prince and Stevie Wonder in with that too. Although this album does have its detractors for that very reason among some of the less tolerant followers of the "keeping it real" music critic brigade? It would be very difficult to debate how much this album successfully extended on what was started on Winwood's commercially failed debut album and actually began an entirely new and fruitful career for him as a solo artist with a lot to say.

7718	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Buffett goes back to writing all of the songs on this album except one, and for the most part it works well.  After dabbling with country on the "Riddles In The Sand" album, Buffett moves back away from it with the exception of two tracks on "Mango".  "Please Bypass This Heart" is nothing spectacular, but the other country oriented tune on the album turns out to be one of it's best with "If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me".  I believe it has been covered by several country artists over the years and is a really great song (this is coming from a guy who does not like country music).  Other highlights on the album include "Frank And Lola" a hilarious character study of a middle age couple trying to re-kindle a spark in their relationship on vacation in Florida.  "Desperation Samba" is another great Buffett "south of the border" tune.  The title track "Last Mango In Paris" is classic Buffett.  The album closer "Beyond The End" is a song a lot of Buffett fans don't seem to care for, but I think it makes a nice grandiose close to the disc.  The album also includes several of Buffett's popular concert favorites "Jolly Mon" and "Gypsies In The Palace".  Some of the production on this album is very 80's oriented which dates it a bit, but overall this is another good album from Jimmy.

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.

It's a great song.
To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.


"Ben" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes "Ben" even more beautiful. "Enjoy Yourself" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. "Blame It on the Boogie" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in "Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)." Listen also for Michael to deliver "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings "Rock with You;" "Off The Wall" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled "The Girl Is Mine." "Billie Jean" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! "Beat It" is yet another jewel on the first CD. "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like "Thriller;" "Thriller" is timeless and just one listen proves it!

This is perhaps one of the finest recordings from the mid 70's you will ever hear, right next to the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of the Emerald Beyond.  I seriously mean that.  Yes, I've heard quite a bit of albums around the same time Where Have I Known You Before was released, and despite the fact this album wasn't exactly popular doesn't really MEAN anything when it comes down to it.  What matters is that I've heard the album, and I'm trying my best to convince YOU why you need to hear it.
8972	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Have loved this song for a long time.
  If you think I am getting too nit-picky about this set, you may be right.  The crisp, heartfelt delivery on "You Can't Make A Heart Love Somebody" is  just one example of why many consider Strait to be the Sinatra of country  music.  And as "Blue Clear Sky" and "Round About Way" illustrate, no one  handles a play-on-words more effectively than Strait.  You'd also be  hard-pressed to find country music more riproaringly enjoyable than "We  Really Shouldn't Be Doing This."

6609	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Often, there are times a song can touch you simply from the heart. When it comes to Snow Patrol, they had struggled for years trying to make it happen in the underground scene. But, their breakthrough song, Chasing Cars from their album Eyes Open, was one of the most soulful songs released in 2006. I like this song because it simply comes straight from the heart, and is just a very simple song. I also hope they don't get classified as a one hit wonder either, the guys feel like they actually have something else up their sleeves soon.

4494	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Yes, oh yes, this was a great album of songs; funky and soulful, gritty and bluesy, and also quite poppy and tuneful in parts. Some definite candidates for Top 40 hits, and some groove-laden tracks where Robert and his musician buddies (if you don't know the names by now, look 'em up; it's an all-star cast) stretch out and get down with it. How much fun? A lot! Hard to believe that this was the same guy who later got slick for MTV and his chorus line of models. But this album, and a few more that came after it, show what a fine singer and interpreter of songs that he was.

I Play it all the time, I love it.
On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

Overall, one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80's that was lost for so many years, but is finally making a comeback. Why iTunes doesn't have it is beyond me, and is really a musical travesty. So many fans are getting jibbed of great music.

Patsy Cline shared so much of her gift with us that we are all better off for it. I highly recommend her exceptional music.
Of course part of the reason for Petersons restraint on the first track maybe because a couple of the other tracks are absolute barnstormers. In particular Work Song and Reunion Blues swing like hell. Milt Jackson plays with a fire that, to me, was sometimes missing from his work with the MJQ. Listen on these tracks for Ed Thigpens great drumming. He really hits some great accents when you really don't expect them - and they work! Combine his work with the relentless Ray Browns bass and you have a swinging backdrop that could make much lesser musicians sound good.

196	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  "Imaginos" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on "Secret Treaties" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to "Imaginos".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a true concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of "Astronomy" and "Blue Oyster Cult" (formerly "The Subhuman") are better than the originals.  "I Am The One You Warned Me Of", "Les Invisibles", "In The Presence Of Another World", "Del Rios Song", "The Siege.....", "Magna Of Illusion" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find.
4205	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	i didn't purchase this
This compilation is stunning in its breadth. The treatment she gives to these songs cannot even be imagined until heard for oneself. She covers a variety of styles, with a heavy concentration of 1960s sugar-pop like "Monday, Monday", "Let's Hang On", and "Yellow Submarine". (Yes, it's true that Ringo sings substantially better than Mrs. Miller.) Particularly entertaining is the truly dreadful altered lyric masterpiece "Queen of the House." I can't imagine having been a supporting musician or recording technician that had to sit through multiple takes of these masterworks.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.

4024	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	What else can I add about such a wonderful album? I have never before heard such relaxing, gorgeous music. Nothing is forced, everything just flows along so naturally. This was my first introduction to Bossa Nova and Brazilian music in general. And I adore it. Joao's voice is to die for, and the wonderfully controlled, relaxed playing of Stan Getz is terrific. Add to that the rythmn section of Jobim on piano, Milton Banana on drums and Tommy Williams on bass, and you have an album that will go down in history, and will never wear thin. And of course I mustn't forget to mention the pretty voice of Astrud. I wish and hope that everyone will have the chance to listen to this album at least once in their life, but of course, once you have you will want to hear it always. A must have!!

I'd say if you really _disliked_ everything since APP, STD won't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW, then you should pick this up if you haven't because it rules, although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one.

4904	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Well we know dude is rich. I mean dude was one of the biggest drug dealers in the NY. He got 1 mil to sign with Eminem. He has already made about 1 1/2 mil from his independent CD "Guess Who's Back"(he got 5 dollars for every CD sold and he's sold abt 250,000 copies already) and This CD has sold about 1.8 million copies in a week and a half. So yeah dude is rich. Is the bang to hype ratio right should be the proper question. I'd have to say yes. Listening to this CD to me is like the first time is saw "New Jack City" or heard the infamous GETO BOYS. It's just unadulterated thugism! Being shot 9 times and havin such a horrible childhood really proves to be a backdrop for this CD. The CD starts with "What up Gangsta". A cool lil song settin the tone for the rest of the CD. Track 3 "Patiently Waiting" features Eminem.. They go real hard on this one. Great sound effects on this one. One of the better cuts on the CD. Track 4 "Many Men" is cool but I was really feelin the lyrics, especially when he talks about dude that shot him. Of course track 5 "In Da Club" probably will be the club song of the year. I've never heard a song looped so much in the club. They play this song for 10 minutes straight and the club stays hype! Track 6 "High All the Time" is his tribute to the sticky icky! Good cut. Track 7 "Heat" is classic Dre production. This song is just raw! A gun cocks in the background on the wholeeeee song. Track 8 is another Dre staple song. Track 9 "Blood Hound" is a cool song with a nice little chorus. He sounds alot like Bushwick Bill on this one. Track 10 "Back down" is one of the CD highlights. Dude rips Ja Rule apart!!!! Track 11 "P I M P" is another banger. Track 12 "Like My Style" features his crew G UNIT. My  2nd favorite cut on the CD is track 14 "21 Questions". It's a Dre production with Nate Dogg. This song is essentially a song talkin to a girl and askin her questions to see where her mind is at. Great song and Nate Dogg hasn't sounded this good in a longgggg time. The beat is off da hook. Track 15 "Don't Push Me" features Eminem again and once again is STRONG. Track 16 "Gotta make it to Heaven, I'm going thru Hell" pretty much sums up this CD. Just raw East Coast Gansta Rap! "Wanksta" makes an appearance here but really it's just a playful radio cut to me. Overall this CD is great. He puts his foot down and even steps to Nas and Jigga. My favorite tracks are 2-11, 14-16. I personally haven't heard anything this raw in a long long time. The hype for this dude is incredible and fortunately the CD comes about as close as it possibly could to that. After a few earchecks this is a must have for the true hip hop fan..

4495	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	During the mid to late 70's Robert Palmer was far from the household name he became during the mid 80's. At the same time at this point in the 70's one of the more fasionable things for a lot of white rock musicians was to record in the Crescent City with many of the local musicians from Dr. John,Allen Toussaint,Little Feat and The Meters. None of these projects were bad at all but strangly enough many of them were one or two off genre excersises that the said artist(s) never again returned to. This was not one of those efforts. Throughout even the 80's the core of Robert Palmers music was always soul and funk so it was only fitting he would make his first solo album in New Orleans with of course all the best people in town on board. Two of the most remarkable things about this are related to Palmer himself. He wrote or co-wrote almost all the music on this album and had a very keen understanding of how to create great funk music,from the honeyed nuances (as opposed to loud bellowing) of his vocal style. Now he does a great job for sure in interpreting Big Easy styled funk here from the rolling clavinets on Allen Toussaint's title track and "From A Whisper To A Scream" which Palmer also delivers with his great soulful understatement. There's more of an obvious Mardi Gras-style hump to the grooves of Lowell George's "Sailin' Shoes" and "Blackmail" but some of the most impressive songs on the album are the ones Palmer wrote himself. "Hey Julia" is an excellent song-a great rhythm box percussion led have jive/funk sort of groove with a really deep Carribean rhythm under the service;not so obvious it's emmediately detectable but it's there if you recognize it. "Get Close" and "How Much Fun" both illustrate an understanding of the elegance of funk and elegance is a quality that Palmer himself always possessed very strong. Of course for a SERIOUS represenation of that there's the twelve minute closer "Through It All There's You" where Palmer really works a hardcore jam to death with his wonderfully jazzily phrased licks and how the song builds up and down from a full band sound back to it's lower key tones from the beginning. It was only fitting that his 70's sound was built very strongly on the type of music presented on this album and it's a credit to his integrity that maintained a strong connection to this particular element of his sound throughout his career as opposed to totally disgarding them when they were no longer trendy in mass culture.

8400	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	PJ Harvey's debut album is raw, quiet, and gutsy. I guess you would call this an indie album, very subtle and low-key in production quality. Some great songs here, some of my all-time favorites are Happy and Bleeding, "Hour of season, happy and bleeding, long over-due too early and it's late too." Sheena-la-gig (hope I spelled it right!) is one catchy and fun song, "Look at these my childbearing hips, look at these my ruby red ruby lips..." Oh My Lover is a classic, "You can love her and you can love me at the same time." Plants and Rags, a gorgeous ballad, "Dreamt of man, he fed me fine food he gave me shiny things." Fountain is another standout, "On my hill I wait for wind..." The rest of the tracks are fabulous as well. Dry is the perfect album if you want a strong female singer and talented songwriter all in one, buy this hidden masterpiece!

The girlfriend is really skilled in the bedroom, but she's otherwise crazy, he kept her around or keeps her around because she's wicked good and brings out his animal nature.  It's rude, it's demeaning, it's crazy in and of itself, but that's what I like about it.  Is it art - who cares - its lusty rock and I'm sure there are real guys out there who similiarily stay with a woman only because she fulfills a need and there are women who do the same thing.

Voyage is at its most interesting, and often its best, when Arie tries to come from out of the shadows of her influences and chart her own path. Though she stumbles on "The Truth" trying to incorporate slicker R&B-style beats into the mix, the titular Spanish folk tinges of "Headed in the Right Direction" says it all, as does "India's Song," which could have been the album's most overwrought track but instead perfectly mixes Chapman's subdued introspection with Woody Guthrie's wide-eyed folk. These are the tracks suggest the voyage isn't over; it may have only just begun.

"Bad" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and "The Way You Make Me Feel" is pop music at its very best. "Man in the Mirror" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on "Another Part of Me." I love it! "Black or White" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. "Heal The World" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.

Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.

My one, small criticism of this nearly complete compilation is the omission of "Up, Up And Away."  Talk about Definitive! (If you're a Mrs. Miller fan already, and haven't heard "Up, Up and Away," you owe it to yourself to hunt down this delightful rarity). But perhaps the best moment on this particular collection is when Mrs. Miller hits that high note in "Lover's Concerto."  She NAILS it!  And people said she couldn't sing!

"Ride the Lightning" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than "Kill `Em All."

So what is it about "Reflections" that is so magnificent?  It's that it goes through many emotional shifts in such a way that for 3 glorious minutes leaves you completely stunned.  Sadness, optimism, worry, fear, deserted... these are just some of the feelings I experience.  If you love the song as much as I do and hopefully you do, you should be able to detect all these emotions and more!  Most artists could spend their entire careers creating something with as much emotion that Diana Ross & the Supremes summed up honestly in one 3-minute song, and that my friends is downright amazing.

Typical of British LPs, the outer jacket is of thinner stock than with U.S. albums. (NOTE: back cover notes misidentify "You Know My Name" as a stereo track.)

This upfront quality permeates the collection. "Everything Has Changed," for instance, underscores the monotony of life, whereas the richly melodic "What If" has Williams questioning many so-called facts of life.

John, Paul and George would certainly go on to have hits songs and chart toppers but it always seemed to me that Ringo was over looked a bit in what he accomplished in the years after going out on his own. Yeah he maybe didn't have as big an impact as his former bandmates on the charts but that doesn't mean he wasn't putting out some great music. He most definitely was. The album "Photograph: The Very Best Of Ringo" (a greatest hit compilation) is good proof of that. His music maybe didn't have the depth and social message to it as the other former lads were but Ringo's music I always thought was great good times, party kind of music sure to please and entertain anyone looking for some uplifting music.

2347	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Honestly, it has been a very long while since Lenny Kravitz came out with a really good song. The 90's showed he had a really good tune with knowing how to craft good songs like Fly Away and Thinking Of You for his mother Roxie whom died of cancer in 1995. But he also showed that he was able to do well with cover songs as well. That was the case with his cover of The Guess Who's American Woman, which was featured on a expanded version of his 5 album. The song feels just as driven today as when Lenny recorded it over a decade ago. While he hasn't reclaimed his 90's glory, Lenny still is making music out there. Hopefully, when his next work comes out, he can do another cover song like this one.

Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.

148	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	If Metallica's 1983 "Kill 'Em All" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release "Ride The Lightning" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since "Kill 'Em All", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from "Kill 'Em All" out of the water. Tracks such as "Fade To Black" and "The Call of Ktulu" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on "Ride The Lightning", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include "Fight Fire with Fire," and "For Whom the Bell Tolls". This album rocks in epic proportions.

Of course, some Monster Magnet fans don't necessarily dig direct rock songs and therefor could ask for a little more variety from the album, perhaps more crazy effects, longer songs and inclusion of a wider array of instruments.

5398	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	An old time favorite that will always be a hit no matter how old.
Two non-singles in particular strike me and both are slow songs.  They are "Slowdown Sundown."  A wistful ballad, calling wine that "glassful of memories"  and something to soothe the balm of yesterday's pain.  The tempo goes up during the bridge, which is a toast to whoever can understand this madness of life.  The closing track "Dust" is the other song which also deals with memories one wants so bad to go away, in this case meaning time with a woman, yet how to deal with a love that's gone, but a friendship that still remains?  Indeed, "a feather duster is no substitute for the real thing," meaning time, "the universal healer."  That brings to mind the Dr. Who quote "the sands of time wash us all clean."

I've always liked this song, so why not get it. one tip though you might want to sample the sound quality before you download a song because not all downloads of this song sound alike, in fact some other downloads of this song with the same artist sound less rich in quality, so just try a few versions first to make sure you get a good music file in your cloud player.
I was in high school when these guys rocked the world with 'Buddy Holly'. It meant nothing to me at the time though. Somehow Weezer remained virtually unknown to me for another decade as alternative rock was never my thing in the 90's (You know, the exact time when alternative rock was EVERYONE's thing. I didn't dislike it because I was an ironic hipster in my youth. I was just super lame.)

At one minute a wispy female vocal enters. The rim shot carries on throughout the tune with the occasional crackling, vinyl record sound entering from time to time. The rhythms are expertly intertwined to make a haunting and beautiful musical experience. I love this tune and consider it the best of Massive Attack (so far). What you hear on the sample is basically what you will hear on the download with the exception of the vocal. This is also used as the soundtrack for the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/House-M-D/dp/B002JVWR7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">House, M.D</a>.

8940	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	What can I say, I couldn't resist throwing in a few words about hapless Elva Miller and her cool, wild an' swingin' "hits."  The music is really irrelvent, as Mrs. Miller's fame and musical career was all about her persona, and her lack of being able to keep time or pitch.  This is what I gather, anyway, as her 15 minutes of fame was already up several years before I was born.  I was introduced to this phenomenom as a young child, as my parents had a copy of this floating around that they'd received as a Christmas gag gift from some friends circa late 60s.  Always rearing it's bed-haired head around the holidays, when the whole family gathered around the stereo for a good laugh.  Funniest selections are:  the frightening "Monday, Monday", Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walking," as well as dad's "Stranger's in the Night" (dooooo-beee-dooooo-beeeee-dooooooooo!!)  and the all time Mrs. Miller classic "Downtown", complete with out of time vocals and ear-piercing bird whistles.

This actually was a really good album, and I liked it a lot when it first came out. If it sounds like I have a hard time saying it, it's true, because I can't stand what he's done to the hip hop world since its release. Now he's concerned only with women, the pop star lifestyle, and beefing with every rapper he can find, which makes me pretty mad, especially because Nas, Fat Joe, and Jada are all tougher and better than him and have been around longer. He's got nothing left to prove now. 50 did a good job here and would not be able to duplicate it ever again.

Enticed by a Metamorpho review, I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music.

766	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There is no question that today, music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers, Joe Cocker who passed away at 70 years old. He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time, who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own, and doing renditions of other artists songs. He had his ups and downs with his life, but always kept music in tune. When he did another artist in song, he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un-Chain My Heart, which came out in the 1987. The song just remains a classic, and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart. It is truly a blessing at soul, and what he put out with great music. Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song, and in spirit. His heart has been un-chained.

Initially issued on LP in 1960, the album was re-released in 1966 under the title "Man at Work", with really beautiful photo by Don Brownstein reproduced inside the CD's package (the cover photo of Burrell, taken from the original edition, is by Chuck Stewart). Actually, my only problem with this lovely CD is that the original liner notes - printed twice, are too small even for a reasonably young fellow with a normal eye-sight... Keeping the cover art was smart, but the backside of LP is not visually interesting enough to compensate for too small letters.

All in all this is an outstanding debut that is solidly based on old school R&B, but spiced by jazz, rock, funk, and Latin grooves. There are only a couple of songs (Beautiful U R, Slow Motion) that are not as strong as the rest and sound a little too much like other crooners who specialize in mid-tempo songs. Even those songs are head and shoulders above the rest of what passes for R & B these days. While at first listen I can see why some may see Javiers debut as a poor mans Brian McKight, if you really listen to the music, there is no doubt that Javier is his own man and easily earns the 4 stars that I am giving it. It would have been 5 stars if the aforementioned mid tempo songs had been replaced by songs in the vein of "October Sky"

I do miss "Earth Song" and the duet "Scream" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from "Thriller" and "Bad", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original "Thriller" album, and even more from "Bad". Plus we get the best of "Off The Wall", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just "Human Nature".

It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

That was not in fact the case-she had two false starts beforehand and this was her first. At the time of this release Janet was the one member of her family not really considering a career in music. Acting seemed to be her call to "fame" (no pun intended) and she was doing very well in that field lending her charming,coy personality to TV shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Good-Times/dp/B001DSNELU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Good Times</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Diff-rent-Strokes/dp/B0002JZT5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Diff'rent Strokes</a>&nbsp;and later&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fame/dp/B002BYYAKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fame</a>. In the latter two series her appearances often including her singing in some capacity. So at this point being only 16 years old and very much "doing what her father said" she recorded this debut album. Even at this point her voice possesses the same coy charm as her attitude. It's definately not soul shouting of course but she has a pretty good range and,in a lot of ways has the sound of a female version of her brother Michael. The music was another matter however. With Leon Sylvers handling the production on this album (with his sister Pat contributing some keyboard parts) there is something of the flavor of both early 80's Solar R&B and some of the period Jackson family sound which,as most will remember share certain similarities anyhow. "Say You Do" is a great open,an extended dance-funk jam that builds from a beat to a BAAAD bassline with some great echo on it and,of course it isn't all that unlike something Michael and/or his brothers might've come up with at that time. ("You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine" has the same effect through the guys of a bubbling disco-pop tune and both tunes showcase her maturing voice very well. On these songs it would seem there was an effort to turn Janet into something of a lower key version of Stacy Lattisaw but when the funk gets percolating on "Don't Mess Up This Good Thing" the electronic textures of the song demand Janet belt out the song more and she does to great affect. The ballads "Love And My Best Friend" and her version of "Forever Yours" are not only just a tad over arranged but somehow don't quite seem like suitable material of the teenage singer. However the than very forceful disco freeze out the out and out four-on-the-floor disco-soul production of "Young Love" best explemlifies where Janet was coming from at this point and fits well with her persona at this point in time. It was on 'Diff'rent Strokes' that Janet first premired her song "The Magic Is Working" and this is a great and very Shalamar-like "The Magic Is Working" and again it fits well with who she was at the time. The album closer "Come Give Your Love To Me" puts her into a new-wave rock style and although the track slams again with a mean bassline leading the way Janet's voice is just not quite into rockier material at this point. Nevertheless the song itself will grow on one with the passage of time. This is not by any means her definative early album. I'd say that would be her very,very underrated second outing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dream-Street/dp/B00000DNA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dream Street</a>. However this did serve the common function of what a debut album does for most artists: give them a loose musical concept and allows them to develop appropriatly in a variety of settings.

Four tunes off the acclaimed 'Black Ice' CD - the frantic opener "Rock 'N Roll Train", "Big Jack", title track "Black Ice" and "War Machine". Can't get enough of those Bon Scott gems - that you might not hear every day - like "Shot Down In Flames" and the ass-kicking "Dog Eat Dog". Plus all the AC/DC live staples we have come to know [and love] "Back In Black", "Shoot To Thrill", "Whole Lotta Rose" (complete with giant inflatable blow-up woman), one of my all-time favorites "Let There Be Rock" and the grand finale "For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)". Comes with a handy CD booklet with full color photos. Essential.

6358	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is the real "Let It go". On The Album, "Just Like You", you get the video edition of the song which removes about 50 percent Of Lil Kim's rap verse, Keyshia's add libbing at the end of Lil Kim's rap and the second chorus. If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as "Let it go Extended". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it.
89	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.
4582	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Excellent quality. Easy to purchase.
"Escape" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is true that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.

4257	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I remember being a little kid *granted this wasn't too long ago* and my parents having a Patsy Cline tape they used to listen to in the car. I fell in love with Patsy's voice and her gorgeous songs. Now, I've never been a country fan, but Patsy is the one big exception. There is no genre to her voice. It's practically perfection. I rank her right up there with powerhouses such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. This CD offers some of her best material. Of course, most notably "Crazy." Everyone knows it. Also, "I Fall To Pieces" *my personal favorite*, "Sweet Dreams of You", and "Strange." Another stand-out has to be "She's Got You." It's a gorgeous ballad and perhaps one of Patsy's most memorable songs. This is a must buy for any music fan. Patsy Cline is truly timeless.

195	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.

Kem's sparkling debut should truly set the standard in terms of what to look for in good soul music: REAL INSTRUMENTS (played by REAL MUSICIANS, of course), REAL SONGS (inspired, meaningful lyrics and solid composition skills), and REAL SINGING ABILITY (knowing HOW to sing in addition to having vocal talent). If more and more artists today would just adhere to these relatively simple guidelines, then there wouldn't be so much bad music out there to begin with. An album containing a few hit singles and a load of filler doesn't do it for me. That's why I'm recommending 'Kemistry' to ANYONE who honestly craves good music without the hype to go with it.

3999	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This mini-lp sleeve version of this Jazz classic is the best version that's out there at the moment.  The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent.  We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert.  The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art.  While the strength of "Girl From Ipanema" alone would carry this album, we also get "So Danco Samba" and a version of "Desafinado" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the "Jazz Samba" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album.  Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general.  Recommended.

I would honestly think of this has heavy pop music, which to me isn't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn-off to most people.  like pop music, the main focus is the vocals and the hooks. The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward, and by now Speed's approach to vocals is pretty predictable. Speed's voice is amazing though, whether the harsh voice or clean voice, and he's gotten much better with each album. That said, the music is much more... i dunno, fleshed out than the last few. Fat, chunky-choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming (forget Ranta, the new drummer is a fiend, did i mention that?), and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight. pop music, even really good pop music, doesn't really show this kind of deadly chops.

"Ride the Lightning" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. "Ride the Lightning" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.

Overall, the song is still pretty great, and it deserved to be #1. But support OneRepublic and go buy their album, "Dreaming Out Loud." It's a great CD that has this song, and the original, and enough other stuff to please most everybody.
This is a great collection. Every song is a killer. It is a five star collection. BUT, there are many excellent Martha songs not included. Where's Livewire, In My Lonely Room, Wild One? There are others equally deserving that have been omitted. So, as good as this compilation is, it is far from perfect. You don't need to be a completist in order to regret the omissions. If you are looking for a Martha collection go further - there are numerous other collections that contain more. Notwithstanding my reservations I cannot give any Martha CD anything but five stars.

As for the rest of the songs, Getz's rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on "So Danso Samba" with its "vai vai vai vai vai" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means "I Only Dance Samba", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country's dance floors in the 1960's.  And Joao Gilberto's soft vocals complement the soft qualities of the other instrumentalists.  Only complaint:  Astrud should've been featured on more songs.
Highly recommended for the new or casual Strait fan. You'll get your money's worth with this set. Very entertaining. ENJOY!!!

At first listen, I could hear the purity and the many dimensions of that VOICE, which is soothing, smooth like 18 year old Appleton, seductive, and playful. Kem is not your ordinary run of the mill singer but an extraordinary song stylist. His voice dips and dives, rounds syllables (much like Al, Anita, & Phyllis), scats, and just downright croons.
2429	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I was troubled by the subtle or overt sexual theme music my school age grandchildren listen to which is performed by today's Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, and R&B artists blasted on their parents favorite car radio stations.  Therefore, I decided to compile a CD to introduce my school age grandchildren to a variety of wholesome music from various genres.  This classic song is performed by Bobby McFerrin, and  is a 'must have' to include on a playlist which is suitable for older school-age children.  The message is timeless, and best of all, this is a fun song, which is  family friendly, and a  favorite which I'm sure my grandchildren will enjoy.

What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.
7755	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	On his last album before he dies, Johnny Cash proves that he is still great by taking this song from Nine Inch Nails and turning it into his life's anthem. Johnny Cash doesn't just cover this song but he OWNS it. He reinvents it and makes it more powerful that the original. Hurt has become one of my favorite Johnny Cash songs. The music video is amazing. Yes, this song is a "must have."
This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.

77	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Michael Jackson is a timeless Musical Genius. He Owned the Last Century. Dick clark got it right  when he gave MJ the Award as Artist of the Last century. nobody before or since captured the whole World's Musical  Complete Attention as the soul Brother from  the Dirty of Gary Indiana. these songs showcases His Greatness for  Decades upon Decades. His Vocal Range&ability to adapt to Musical changes highlights a Genius without Limits.  Michael Jackson is the "DON OF MUSIC" period. Michael back in the day was a Event all unto Himself.  there aren't too many artists who cover as much Ground as MJ past or Present.  He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form.
So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.

Anyway, I would vote for Ringo Starr's "Photograph," arguably the best song of his post Fab Four career.  Contractually, Ringo was given rights to sing one song per Beatles' album, so this one fits the bill.  Can you "imagine" (sorry) an album with "My Sweet Lord," "Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five," "Imagine," "Love," "My Love," "Listen to What the Man Said," "Give Me Love," "What Is Life?" "Whatever Gets You Through the Night," and, of course, this one?  If George and Ringo didn't feel like they got the support they desired back in the day, they sure make up for it by (characteristically) supporting each other (George allegedly wrote most of the song) and with a "little help" from Ringo's many friends.  Gloriously, "Photograph" is as grand and corny as they get.  The rewards are twice that.
4212	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	A great beat, great lyrics, and a great singer.  All these combine to make a great song!  Plus, you gotta love the 80's.

Someone plays a great keyboard on this single, while lead singer Brandon Flowers sings his heart out and the other musicians collaborate to make it even stronger.  Like Foo Fighters' "The Pretender," this song makes a brief detour into a softer segment around the middle, then speeds up again as it reaches the end.  Compelling and easy to remember.

I find The Fox to be an album that tries to stretch out a bit, prehaps begging to cover a little too much territory.  As a few reviewers have noted previously, this was his first with Geffen Records and first with producer Chris Thomas (who would also produce his next 3 albums). Therefore undoubtedly the game plan was for this one to make a grand statement.  This ambition shows up in songs like "Fascist Faces", the beautiful instrumental trio "Carla/Etude/Fanfare" and the more traditional love ballad "Chloe."  The usage of the Rev James Cleveland choir, a full string orchestra, and new agey synthesizers drive home the point that this isn't meant to be a cohesive statement, but meant to try to satisfy trends and make "the cutting edge" for 1981.  Most of the time, it acheives this due to Elton's tunefulness and ultra-competent instrumentation.

  This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?

Containing two of the groups biggest hits, the great opener 'Get Up, Stand Up' and the immortal 'I Shot The Sheriff' which is far better then the Clapton cover, and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics.

24	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.

After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.

Can I Walk With You :: 4.25/5
It's a very sad song that has little hope.... but that's life. It doesn't always turn out great for us, and this song reflects that. It has a great tune to it that sounds like the protagonist's fate.

Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's "Snowblind".

Sandwiched in-between the highly electric rave-ups are three of Chick's acoustic piano improvisations including Where Have I Loved You Before; Where Have I Danced With You Before; and Where Have I Known You Before.  This is the closest this album comes to sounding like traditional jazz and showcases Chick's considerable talents on the acoustic piano.  The softer acoustic tracks provide a nice contrast with the highly charged electric tracks.  Earth Juice is the "funkiest" piece on the album, although this funk is pretty far removed from Sly and the Family Stone.  Of course, Chick's work on the clavinet here and there on the album really lends to the funkiness.  The suite that closes the album out is a high point for me and opens with a great synthesizer arrangement, which then launches into some extremely complicated ensemble work that sounds very similar to some of the music that was coming out of the English progressive rock scene at the time.  Although there are solos on this lengthy track, they are really very interesting and are seamlessly integrated with the arrangement - in fact, they sound pre-composed.
8480	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	ARC OF A DIVER is Steve Winwood's masterpiece. Many of the songs cut a lot deeper than their pop veneer would indicate on first listen, including, especially, the opening cut, "While You See A Chance", which tells people not to let opportunities pass them by, and the title track, which is about how hard connecting with others can be. Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes even disco pap like "Second Hand Woman" and "Spanish Dancer" bearable, and results in ARC OF A DIVER being an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
11	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with "If We Are The Body" and "Does Anybody Hear Her," but with "What This World Needs," it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!

An all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's "Time After Time" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called "Chet Baker Sings." According to her, "she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture." She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely "love the way this guy sang." And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; "Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  "Chet Baker Sings" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.

6792	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	It is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented dies early & before their time. With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.

The title track opens the album; this catchy, infectiously happy and upbeat tune could never go out of style; and Burl practically owns this song the way he delivers it. He puts a lot of positive energy into his version of this song; and it shows quite clearly when I hear him perform it. Great! "Christmas Is a Birthday" is very easy on the ear; what a charming ballad--and it's religious, too. "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" switches gears back to a more secular song; Burl puts his own stamp on this tune by playing a bit with the tempo and a few key changes--and it all holds its own very well.

So why should you pony up the extra dough for the "expanded" edition? Is the second disc really worth it? For a change, the answer is yes. You get four great live tracks, complete with some funny self depreciating comments, one song from a various artists rarities album that the band wrote about their lawyer ("Jamie"), and a handful of demos. The best of the bunch is an a cappella quickie titled "My Evaline" that highlights Weezer's uncanny harmony abilities, something occasionally lost in the din.

863	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There is honestly so much that could be said about Joe Cocker and his gifts in song. The guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the Woodstock. He honestly was amazing with each and every song he had recorded and performed live. The guy was absolutely a remarkable singer But this past year had showed a sad and tragic end to his brilliant end, losing his life to lung cancer, as a result from his twenty years plus of drug and alcohol addiction. But he left behind a cavalcade of great songs from With A Little Help From My Friends, and especially Up Where We Belong. His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983. It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart. Joe & Jennifer had a connection that many of today's artists couldn't even come close to at heart. If you had never even heard of a Joe Cocker song before, than this is one I would recommend going to.

Disc 1
3183	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	"Simply Irresistible" is a great feel good type of musical track that is my overall favorite by Robert Palmer. In "Simply Irresistible" Robert sings a great tune on how a woman that use to just look good to him has gotten even more beautiful and appealing to him over the years. I love it when he sings the lyrics "she is anything but typical", and the lyrics "she's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force". I personally have learned ways to increase my self-love, and listening to this song is one of the ways I love to do this. I say this because listening to this song helps serve as a fun reminder on why it is important to see the beauty inside of yourself regardless of what is reflected in the outside world. Hearing this song serves as a playful reminder to always work on feeling good from within. "Simply Irresistible" is a great song that is like fine wine that gets better with time (just like his other track "Addicted to Love"). You are going to love listening to this song if you enjoy Robert Palmer's "Addicted to Love" musical track and/or classic rock and 80's music.

The tune is quite mesmerizing and, I think, soothing,  Strange, I know, considering it's sung in high pitched voice.

end note: Other album highlights are Rinse, Twilight and Paint It Black (a Rolling Stones remake).
6145	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the more memorable songs by the Spinners that I remember from when I was a kid :) I believe that's a sitar at the beginning of this song and it only adds to the appeal of this performance. Great song by one of the all-time great groups from the '60s-'70s. *I've heard this song on a overseas Internet radio station and their version seems to have the same problem that I encountered with my download: there seems to be a weak spot at the beginning of the song, so I'd check it out if I were in charge of the downloading division of the record label. It's the same sound you hear when a cassette tape gets caught up in the rollers. After you untangle the tape and fix it right on the reel, it's still playable but there's one section that got mangled and doesn't quite sound right. I'm guessing that a master tape from the reel to reel recording days probably suffered this same problem :)Other than that slight flaw, it's still a great song :)

2730	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	My memories were fonder than reality.  After listnening to it for 2 times I was already sick of it again and annoyed with the repetitiveness.
Musically, the song has a lite poppy feel, that is distinctively 80's. Is it 70's? No. Is it 90's? Nope, it is unmistakably 80's. It's a nice feel to the song, and it really adds an extra flavor to it. Vocally, while the verses lag, and fail to deliver a great punch, making for the only complaint of the song, the main chorus is perfect. Well, almost, that "I promise you," does drag it down.
5846	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderfully, beautiful duet!  Has become one of my new favorite love songs.

Other than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of "Love comes easy", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic "You make me feel brand new" and the exuberant "I won't give you up".

73	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like "Ben", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out "Never can Say Goodbye" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is "Jam".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of "Dangerous" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of "Bad" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note...."Farewell My Summer Love" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45.

7569	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This song starts with some very melancholy piano soon joined by a plaintive, but completely complimentary vocal. The lyrics are mysterious but appropriate for the mood of the piece. It is a very minimal tune with some flute and strings joining in at around 2 minutes. Very non-intrusive bells join in at 2 minutes 15 seconds. This is a simple but powerfully moody and evocative song that I loved the first time I heard it.
239	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic " MY EVERYTHING " with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of " AH SHOOT ", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly true! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, " AH SHOOT " is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear " AH SHOOT " the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD.
Its so overplayed & way overrated.

Lily's humor doesn't hit you over the head, in fact it's so subtle that you'll frequently ask yourself, "what was funny about that?" I had completely forgotten about Lily until I saw her on this year's Oscars award show with Meryl Streep. Now that was a funny bit!

"Surf Wax America" is a nice song that makes you want to go surfing [or take your board to work, as Rivers says]. But like the previous song, it has something that I wish it didn't have--the middle section. I know they're trying to sound cool and slowed down, but why is it so quiet?! I heard Holiday before this one, so I thought Holiday was the only song to have a middle section like that, which would make it seem more original. [Before I bought this album I had the songs Buddy Holly, Undone, Say It Ain't So, and Holiday] Other than that, I guess it's cool song.

Everything has to fall into place. It's not just, "is every song good?" It's more than that. It's the right artist at the right time with the right circumstances and attitude. 10 years down the line will people hear the songs And sing all the words?. People have been throwing around the term "classic" nowadays practically right when the album comes out. Nah man. Kendrick hasn't dropped a classic. Wayne never dropped one either. Nobody has put out anything like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying. His story was crazy, his time dropping mix tapes as if they were albums was crazy. He was jacking beats like it was nothing and making dope songs. His confidence and sense of humor got people. Then, Eminem and Dre signed him and got right to work making this.

The video on YouTube is rather powerful.  I guess that clinched the purchase of this item for me.  Nelly's ethereal voice inspires me to "try" -- to try to live my goals, to make the effort to work out the details of my expectations.  Nearly every time I listen to this song, I cry.  Sometimes when I sing along, I say "cry" instead of "try" but ... methinks... those words are linked beyond rhyme.

7535	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Foxy has made a incredible come back. Broken Silence is hot. It makes her last album Chyna Doll sound like non sense. She mentioned at the end of the booklet that she sometimes found the album too difficult to complete, I can see why. The album kicks especially the sound "Hood Scriptures" which is actually the most incredible song ever written. Believe it, rap and latino music blend together nicely. Other hot songs are "Fallin", "730" amongst hot joints with Baby Cham and Ron Isley. The album is hot. "I don't care" is another classic is which she says " to all the haters that be looking to fade us, we not concerned with what you put in the papers". Lil Kim said in her album, that people had the gall to be re-writting her rhymes and Foxy says that people can do the thing she does. The lines are probably sent for one rapper to the other. Foxy also said in her song Fallin "I shed tears when Biggie and Pac got killed, there's only one other broad who really got skill, she's alright, but she's not real". Is this for Lil Kim, maybe. The women of rap better watch out. Foxy is back and hotter than acid. It will take a whole lot a... for Trina and Lil Kim to catch up to Foxy's new speed.

67	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the "King of Pop". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.
Honestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying true to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled "Black Album"), but at least we still have this album, along with "Kill 'Em All," "Master Of Puppets," and "...And Justice For All" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.

Sure, the '90s have all but stomped it out due to the ubiquitous presence of hip-hop's "dark" side (heavily-programmed instruments, blatant sampling, offensive lyrics, bad singing).

But to me the overall relaxing vibe, the sum of all the individual parts make the whole thing worth the listen.

7824	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary Johnny Cash passed away. Yet, his music was definitely a cavalcade of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well. But when he did a cover song that was out of the ordinary, he not only made it his own nicely, but it sometimes still stands taller than the original artist in that tone. The prime example of Johnny's musical intimacy came nearly at the end of his life when he did a cover of Nice Inch Nails song Hurt. The song is definitely something still worth listening too. Not just from Johnny's voice, but also because of his simplicity of the guitar and piano. It is a great song to listen too, not just if you are a die hard Johnny Cash fan, but also for anyone who is new to his music. Get this, and you won't be hurt.

How this album is different from the previous Burl Ives Christmas albums is that he has shifted to this point to more of a pop-oriented approach to singing Christmas songs that the traditional folk style that defined his earlier albums.  There are still some folk songs on this album, with "Christmas is a Birthday," "Christmas Child (Loo, Loo, Loo)," "Christmas Can't Be Far Away," and "Snow for Johnny."  But most of the songs are definitely more popular than secular, with "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," "White Christmas," "Winter Wonderland," and "Silver Bells."  I tend to think of "The Little Drummer Boy" as being more religious than it really us, but that is more because the music is more hymn-like.

#6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. "The Altar and the Door" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.
It opens with the strong folky chords of "Colleen," a slice of Celtic-flavoured balladry that trickles through an oddball melody. "I tell it as I best know how," croons Newsom in her crazy-fairy voice. "Pick me up and toss me round/I lost my shoes and tore my best gown..."

2679	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion, this is Bing Crosby's best Christmas Classic: "Do You Hear What I Hear?"  It has survived the test of time, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its release this year.  It is also one of a dozen of Bing's first STEREO Christmas songs, and it sounds great.  I enjoy Bing's version of this song better than any other artist, and this song even more than his signature song, "White Christmas".  Bing was one of the first two artists to present this song to the public, and he left a great lasting impression of "Do You Hear What I Hear".  A couple of other not as popular Bing Crosby Christmas songs to look-up are: "I Sing Noel", "The Littlest Angel", "And the Bells Rang", "Round and Round the Christmas Tree" and a duet with Frank Sinatra called "We Wish You the Merriest". Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  May this season bring us peace, goodness, light and life.

While some people dismiss it as light and pithy pop that appeals to the teenaged crowd, there can be an alternative meaning attached because so many girls have viewed it as something of a girl power/independence anthem because it stood out as something different in a rough sea of boy band pop that perhaps treats girls as though girls are puppy dogs looking to be lead into one night stands or something.

But Burl Ives performance of Rudolph is fantastic. This version is slower and longer than the version from the TV show featured on the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer soundtrack. But this version is still up tempo and very well sung. Unfortunately too many artists ruin this song by trying to make their renditions too much their own. Dean Martin refers to Rudolph as "Rudy" in a few lines of the song and Jewel performs this song in a horribly slow and dragged out manner. Burl Ives sings this song the way it's supposed to be sung and keeps it at that and that's why Burl Ives performances of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer are the best versions of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer that exist.

The opening song "Fight Fire With Fire" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. "For Whom The Bell Tolls" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James ("take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will", sounds nice doesn't it?). "Fade to Black" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day."Trapped Under Ice", "Escape" and "Creeping Death" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live."The Call of Ktulu" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.

Oh come on, the first 3, of course not, they are completely different, and terrific in their own genres...but Kenny G, DOH! I think the Boyz would give up singing if they ever heard that one. Comparing Boyz 2 Men to Kenny G is like comparing silk to polyester, prime rib to hamburger, Belgian chocolates to dog chocolates and champagne to grape juice. Come on Mew!

"The Call of KTULU" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as "Orion" (from Metallica's next album, "Master of Puppets,") and it's a very good way to end the album.

8476	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	The first time you heard "While You See a Chance" in the early 80's you hear these luscious arranged keyboard sounds, and it welcomes the 80's decade with a up tempo keyboard solo, then you hear the voice and you say to yourself "Isn't that Steve Winwood? The same guy who played organ in the Spencer Davis Group?"  You automatically get a road map of Winwood's new 80's direction.  It's a direction of synthesizers dominating his sounds, and soloing with unique keyboard phrases that defines this era of his career.  Arc Of A Diver is the beginning of  Winwood where he redefines himself.  The album's mix is below par.  The instrumentations that are put together also fail to adhered some kinda of unity, but this is excused because Steve Winwood played all the instruments.  Winwood also engineered and mixed the whole album.  In my opinion when it comes to artists that play all their instruments on their albums I put Arc Of A Diver in the top 5.  Their are some good uptempo danceable songs like "Second Hand Women", and "Night Train."  "Slowdown Sundown" is more classic Winwood ballad.  You can hear the organ, but their is also a beautiful multimoog solo.  Their are only seven tracks on this album, and a important album in Steve Winwoods career.  The album is only 40 minutes long, but enjoyable!

The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called "Trapped Under Ice" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number "Escape". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks "Creeping Death" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called "The Call of Ktulu" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively.

CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the "Thriller" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as "ABC" and "I Want You Back", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include "State of Shock" or "Lovely One" instead of "Enjoy Yourself". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 "Thriller" album tracks (the other 2 being "Baby Be Mine" and "The Lady in My Life"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when "radio tracks" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.

This Winchester, Virginia, native thrilled the music world like no other and continues to do so, long after her untimely death in a plane crash with country singers Hawkshaw Hawkins and Cowboy Copas.  Patsy could make her voice break and thus break our hearts with her soulful rendering of songs written (and often recorded) by some of country music's greatest.  Consider "Sweet Dreams" (Don Gibson), "Crazy" (Willie Nelson), "I Fall to Pieces", "She's Got You", "Why Can't He Be You?" (Hank Cochran), "Back in Baby's Arms" (Bob Montgomery whose life has been rich in "country", including a pre-Crickets duo with Buddy Holly), "Faded Love" (co-written by Bob Wills of Texas Playboys fame), "Leavin' On Your Mind" (co-written by country/honky tonk great Webb Pierce) and "Always" by one of the all-time great composers of American standards, Irving Berlin.  If you want just one Patsy Cline CD, this is probably the one for you.

Pretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to. He really sounds tough here, not all worried about women and his star status like he would be later. "What Up Gangsta" is good, good chants at the end and all. "Patiently Waiting" with Eminem is memorable, crazy production, good lyrics by both parties. "Many Men" was a hit, 50 telling all about his gunshots, why he's here, the whole bit. Everybody's heard "In Da Club", not much I can say there. "Blood Hound" is the infamous Ja Rule diss, pretty funny, but he went crazy dissing everybody later. "21 Questions" was the love song with Nate Dogg, pretty good, but there would be way too much of this on the Massacre. The bonus tracks are all good too, "Wanksta" being the original single, spawning a new term to the masses, "Gotta Make it to Heaven", "Don't Push Me" and "Nobody Likes Me", a funny song.

Would recommend to anyone you grew up with Bobby and New Edition.
This song is incredibly catchy, and impossible not to love once you get into it. And the dance factor is cranked up to max here. Whether it be in a closet, or an empty room, or a bar, or a club, rest assured, you'll dance at some point. The vocals, the beats, and the music completely fit the song.

8482	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Steve Winwood's second solo album, 1980's "Arc Of A Diver," remains one of his most popular releases, and it is indeed an excellent album. Winwood produced it, co-wrote all the songs, and plays all of the instruments himself. And, of course, he sings with that marvelous Ray Charles-ish voice. The album is a keyboard-heavy platter of pop, and it's all good. The catchy "While You See A Chance" was a big #2 hit for Steve on the U.S. singles chart, but there are also other goodies including the atmospheric title song, the breezy "Second Hand Woman," the great grooves of "Spanish Dancer," and the up-tempo funk-pop of "Night Train" (featuring some fine electric guitar from Winwood). Steve also slows things down a bit for the cool mellowness of "Slowdown Sundown" and "Dust." "Arc Of A Diver" is a great Steve Winwood album.

He stated about the two artists in question: "One wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, ended a war single handedly, and is looked at to some in Africa as the second coming."  "The other wrote and performed a lot of hit songs, Enough Said!"  I couldn't have said it any better myself and that is the difference between The Wailers and every other band of any influence, their songs touched people on a level that made them want to get up, stand up and fight for their rights, not just sing, dance, go to parties, etc.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with the latter, however, it's the former that truly makes a difference in the direction of a people and nation.

8020	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	On August 10, 2005 Lucinda Williams played at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.  It was the last live concert that my wife and I saw together.  Lucinda was touring in support of "Live @ the Fillmore" & said she was writing songs for a new record.  As I recall, she played a new song she said she'd recently written, "Everything Has Changed."  I preordered Lucinda's "West" set while my wife was still here.  Today marks the fourth week since breast cancer ripped a giant unfillable hole in my universe.  Lucinda lost her mother; and so themes of adjustment to loss not only resonate with me, they punctuate every breath I take.  I spin the CD & Lucinda's gentle aching voice comes on, "Are you alight?"  When people ask me that, I want to say, "He*l no!"  But when she sings, "All of a sudden you went away; I hope you come back around someday; I haven't seen you in a real long time; Could you give me some kind of sign?  Are you alright?  ...Cause I've been feeling a little scared," it sounds like she's tapped into my inner dialogue as I look toward heaven and speak to the one I love.  What an amazing song, "Just tell me that you're okay."  If this were the only song on the CD, it'd be worth it.

There's not a single dud in the lot here; every song is just that good! "Walkin' After Midnight," written by  Alan Block and Donn Hecht, is a fine way to start the track set--Patsy is squarely front and center which is right where she belongs! The music, as is the case with all the tracks here, fits in perfectly with Patsy's vocals. "A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)" is very well done and Patsy does a great job on "Lovesick Blues" which is a number I really like. "I Fall to Pieces" (Pasty's first #1 hit on the country charts and her second hit on the pop charts) and "True Love" from Patsy's 1961 album entitled "Patsy Cline Showcase" are most poignant and Patsy sings "San Antonio Rose" with panache--I love it! "Crazy," a number by Willie Nelson, shines bright in Patsy's more than capable hands; it's her signature song despite the fact that she didn't like it at all initially!

  Verse 2: I forgot a little part of it, but it's still pretty fun to listen to.
Ain't no river wide enough
After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, "Soundtrack to Your Escape" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.

Recorded in 1961 the album starts with On Green Dolphin Street. This is mellow and laid back for a while and then changes gear to swing. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about this track is Peterson's very restrained and delicate Piano solo. Even when the solo reaches the swing section there aren't the torrents of notes that you might expect. This is Oscar Peterson showing a different facet to his great talent.

Bland "folk"-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead "Voyage" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience.

They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do.

Although it has been so long since they've made a great song, they still know what it really takes. Wake Up Call, the secong single from their sophmore album It Won't Be Soon Before Long is a very upbeat driven song that remains as deep of a staple to what Adam and the band had captured to fans alike for the past several years. It really is a great track from the album, while the lyrics showcase a man who is scorned from a cheating so-called significant other. I hope Maroon 5 can make another great single like this.

Let hate be your enemy, and only love will set the spirit free. WOW! You said it brother. I won't ever get tired of this song, NEVER! First recorded by The O JAYS, and later done by my late friend Heavy D - My heart and soul is filled with love and my feet want to dance when I hear NOW THAT WE FOUND LOVE.

4294	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific.

4702	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very true to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something...
The eight tracks on the album range in length from 1'02" to the 14'21" Song to the Pharoah Kings suite.  In terms of the music, it is an incredible amalgamation of jazz; jazz rock; progressive rock; space rock; funk and even a tiny bit of classical - more like a proggy jazz rock actually.  In fact, as a progger, I really appreciate the dense arrangements and virtuosity.  Speaking of which, just about every odd time signature under the sun is used on Where Have I Known You Before and there is some incredibly complex ensemble work.

"Fight Fire With Fire" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, "Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!". Great way to start off the album.

But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.

The international version of "The Essential Michael Jackson" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:
It's stripped down, too, right to the essentials. It doesn't have the multiple rhythms of a typical Wonder song of the time, it doesn't have the elaborate vocals of Earth, wind & Fire or Kool & the Gang, or the smooth horn section of the Ohio Players. But it doesn't need all that because it has Chaka Khan singing her heart out. This song tore up the airwaves in 1974 and is just as good today.

5852	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas might just be the very best Christmas song there is. Holistically Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is the song that best captures the essence of what Christmas should be right down to the title. Christmas doesn't have to extravagant but it should be happy,nice,peaceful,comfortable,and enjoyable. If it weren't for Frank Sinatra we wouldn't have the lyrics to this song we know and love today. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated in 1944 in a time period where many meaningful Christmas songs such as White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas were emerging. The original version had somewhat different lyrics. The most notable difference is that the original version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had a line that was sung. "In a year we all we will be together if the fates allow. Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow." Sinatra called songwriter Hugh Martin and told him "I like your Christmas song" but that he needed that line "jollied up" to include the piece on his Christmas album. Sinatra said "The name of my Album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly that line up for me?" And,of course,as Martin put it "You don't say no to Frank Sinatra." The new lyrics in this line became "Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow. Hang a shining star upon the highest bough." Frank Sinatra then became the artist to perform Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with the improved lyrics. Frank Sinatra's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is THE original version of Have Yourself a Merry Christmas and gets 5 out 5 stars hands down. :)

Not only is this music timeless, it is so well performed with each and every subtle nuance that it possesses a universal appeal decades after its' release.

Despite the commanding songwriting and singing, this newfound vocabulary of sexy chord changes does slightly replay itself throughout the short disc making for parallel melodies throughout, along with the sumptuous, at times slightly awkward vocal phrasings. This is not to negate the fact that this album is a complete triumph of aesthetics, overpowering any specific gripes with it's liquid smooth tranquility.

1800	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	It is sincerely sad whenever someone young and talented dies before your heart. Natalie Cole knew that dear feeling, not just with the death of her beloved father, the great Nat King Cole, but also in herself, with her saddened passing New Year's Eve in 2015. She had showcased a brilliant and beautiful bravado of songs that really have with stood the test of time, on her own and healing through the soul of jazz and R&B soul overall. When I have thought of Natalie Cole, I think of her deepest songs that really showed all sides from pop and R&B like Snowfall In The Sahara, Live For Your Love and the dearest ballad of them all, Unforgettable. The song which Nat King Cole recorded on his own was one thing, but when Natalie did it in 1991, it really became timeless beyond what words could ever expect. It is just one of those duets that really drives you at the heartstrings so deep, you'll forget what cheap music of today really is. This is a must download for any die hard fan of Nat's, Natalie's or for anyone that really never heard of what great songs were like.

The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.

8429	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	After Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas were Motown's biggest female stars.  But whereas the Supremes offered listeners sophistication the music of Reeves was more in the gospel tradition.  Reeves got her big break when she was a secretary at Motown and Mary Wells failed to show up for a recording session.  The song, "I'll Have to Let Him Go," which is not included in this collection, was the first song credited to the suddenly created Martha & the Vandellas.  The original Vandellas were Annette Sterling and Rosalind Holmes, although the lineup changed over the years; the name came from combining a couple of Detroit favorites, Van Dyke Street and local singer Della Reese).  The group's second single "Come and Get These Memories" made the Top 5 of the R&B charts and the girls were on their way.  Other Top 5 hits included "Dancing in the Street," ""Nowhere to Run," "Jimmy Mack," "I'm Ready for Love," "(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave," and "Honey Chile."  These danceable R&B hits made Martha & the Vandellas the chief rivals to the Supremes until 1968, when Reeves had a nervous breakdown after a bad acid trip.  The group disbanded after a farewell concert in Detroit in 1973 and after an undistinguished solo career away from Motown, Reeves was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 1995.  This Millennium Collection offers up all of the group's hits, but is limited to only 11 cuts.  Consequently, while this album certainly covers the basics there is more of Martha & the Vandellas out there for you to enjoy.

The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, "The Girl From Ipanema".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  "Tall and tan and young and lonely/The girl from Ipanema goes walking/And when she passes/Each one she passes goes haaa."  Well, the thing that makes me go "haaa" here is Astrud Gilberto's voice.  Getz's sax solo and Jobim's piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River's "The Girl With Emphysema", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.

Supertramp's album "Breakfast in America" was released in 1979, and its tracks appeared climbed the charts over the months that followed.  They also have enough staying power that they still show up somewhat regularly on oldies pop and rock radio stations.
But, the highlight for me is undoubtedly "There's no reason" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.
Some reviewers here said if you have heard AC/DC's previous set lists before, then you have heard it all and they are boring. Well, you will miss out on great new live tracks such as "Rock N Roll Train", "Big Jack", "War Machine" and "Black Ice", even tho most of us fans really wished they had preformed other tracks from the Black Ice album like 'spoilin' for a fight' and "she likes rock n roll"... and then there is the typical songs of coarse... but what those guys saying it's all been the same, it surprises me AC/DC didn't take the chance to finally get an official live album version of "Rock N Roll aint Noise Pollution" down. What really would have been nice would have been a bonus track of "High Voltage" included that AC/DC subbed in during the Australian and New Zealand tour by popular demand. Just like they included "Hell aint a bad place to be" only on the Japan special edition of Live (1991). Oh well, what can you do?

Lucinda composed this album following the death of her mother, which is probably why most of the songs are mellow. They don't drown into each other though, as I can easily pick up highlights like "Are You Alright", "Learning How to Live" and the title track. And the songs about her mother are poignant yet exceptional, as shown in "Mama You Sweet" and especially "Fancy Funeral". But my favorite song would probably have to be "Words".
Where do I begin to describe the mood of this wonderful and innovative R&B album?  There is something for everyone on this CD.  We have the funky, catchy "Thank You" that samples from "La-Di-Da-Di" performed by Doug E. Fresh.  The hook is infectious!  We have "All Around the World" to get you up and dancing, no doubt.  One of my personal favorites is "I Sit Away," written by Tony Rich (of the Tony Rich Project fame).  It has a haunting hook and a beautiful, introspective feel.  Truly an ode to solitude.  There are also a couple of songs on this album that became huge hits for the fellas back in the early 1990s.  They include "I'll Make Love to You" (on those songs to get you in the mood), and "Water Runs Dry."

His first, "Christmas Day in the Morning," came out in 1952, followed by "Christmas Eve" in 1956.  "Have a Holly Jolly Christmas" came out in 1965, with the soundtrack to the classic holiday television special "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" the following year.  The title song of this album was written by for the special by Johnny Marks, who also wrote the song "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," which Ives sings on this album, and the final track, "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day."  That is a pretty good trio of Christmas songs, which would make Marks one of the best writers of Christmas songs ever.

This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums "Off The Wall" and "Thriller". His best songs are all here" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like "Bad" and "Dangerous". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of "Never Can Say Goodbye" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!

8953	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.

But actually, in Brazil, the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in '72, when I was visiting family there, this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering.

This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.

Radio-friendly pop-punk, that would be the best and most accurate description of "all killer no filler", which took the world by storm mid 2001 with its single "fat lip". Chances are, unless you were living under a rock, you've heard that song, and their other radio friendly hit, "in too deep". Although sum 41 has shifted their style since the release of "all killer", this band never fails to amaze, and getting any album from them is worth your while.

7	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I love the song Slow Fade by Casting Crowns, especially how they put the children version at the end... its a song that speaks to everyone of us to be careful on "itching ears" that may take our faith and attention away from the Lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all times in the gospel. The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say "people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away..." this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a "slow fade" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.

8484	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	The 1986 album "Back in the High Life" may have sold more  copies, but "Arc of a Diver" is Steve Winwood's best solo album.  It contains the smash hit "While You See a Chance," and plenty of  other smooth jazzy pop songs in the same mode.  There is not a bad song in  the mix, though the standouts are "Slowdown Sundown,"  "Spanish Dancer," and "Dust."  Though fans of Winwood's  days with Traffic may lament the lack of adventurism on this album, those  who love great songcraft will feel right at home.

Smile, a very special piece composed by the great Charlie Chaplin for his 1936 film entitled "Modern Times," had its lyrics and title added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954. This song, a classic little masterpiece, gets the royal treatment from Nat "King" Cole, who delivers this ballad with panache. Nat's excellent diction, sophisticated phrasing and sense of timing make this version of "Smile" one of my very favorites. It never fails to move me; this is an incredibly poignant musical number. I highly recommend this music.
7473	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	The ethereal sound was created by laboriously building up multiple overdubs of the voices of Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing a single note in unison. This multi-track was then mixed and dubbed down onto 16-track tape. This process was repeated across all 16 tracks to create a lush 256-voice "virtual" choir that could "sing" chromatic chords.[2] A number of these prepared multi-tracks were then cut into several endless loops, each of which contained the basic notes of the main chords used in the song. The chorus loops could then be played by using the mixing desk rather like a keyboardeach chord could be sounded by bringing up the fader for that loop. The instrumental break featured the repeated spoken phrase, "Big boys don't cry...", spoken by Kathy Warren, the receptionist of their own Strawberry Studios where the band recorded the track. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for Brit  group, The Cure, who had an album and song called Boys Don't Cry. Axl Rose has also stated that this is one of his favorites which inspired him to get into music.

Musically, I think it is one of Cher's best sung songs, and I enjoy listening to it again and again, because it is able to make me feel things in a way that no other song does.
It was nice to see SY expanded their limitedly frenzied vocabulary a little further with some experimenting, but the sum still equals a mighty uneven album with very few songs that will end up standing the test of time.
Dust In The Wind - Kansas
Mellow, but not "lazy music" as was described by some, Arc Of A Diver shows that Winwood still had some life in him following Traffic.  Considering the turn-of-the-decade changes going on in the music scene, i.e. punk and new wave, it's fortunate that Arc found an audience.  And Winwood played all the instruments on the album, much like Prince had done his own debut For You.  Despite having only seven songs, Arc benefits from a consistent synth-keyboard style, upbeat dance tunes to reflective ballads.

 Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.

I was just a little disappointed that they did not include her 1986 minor hit "Wise Up". I really like that song but it is not included on here. Also "I Will Be Your Friend" and "Big Yellow Taxi", are not included here as well. They also could of included her Christmas single "Tennessee Christmas". The record company needs to get this straight and release a complete greatest hits album. Other from those songs missing, this is a must have Amy Grant collection.

Overall, with its loaded gun of energy, and familiar, but still rockin' elements driving it, if you listen to rock radio, you're going to love it. This song really took me back to that 90's alt rock movement with bands like Collective Soul and Nirvana, and "Psycho" certainly does the greats justice.

9717	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Have you ever just been driving in your car and you hear those first few notes and all of a sudden you are overcome with emotion.  You begin driving with one hand, the other is now a microphone or a very vivid gesturer of your feelings.  Your voice begins without you realizing, singing along with all of the memories of past best friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, and imaginary friends swimming in front of your eyes.  Then you realize that you are crying as you sing at the loudest your emotion allows. Two hands on the wheel now, clinging while you say whoa-oa-oa. Then your hand returns, holding up a hush finger to your memory, "Don't speak!" you wail.  The words all come to you and for about five minutes you are overcome.  Wherever you are, red light, freeway, parking lot, side streets, or waiting for the song to end before you leave your car because you are at your destination, you sing.
I love the idea though. Brecker basically does big band and playing with his fourteen cohorts here gives him the opportunity to paint a canvas of very complex textures upon which to play his beautiful tenor sax solos. The whole ensemble works well but, apart from the bandleader of course, I have a personal fondness on here for Alex Sasha Sipiagin on trumpet, Adam Rogers on guitar and the drummer, Antonio Sanchez (now of The Pat Metheny Group). My favourite songs include "Broadband" (which is the opener on my CD and not "Loxodrome" as mentioned in the product overview soundclips), "Night Jasmine", "Scylla" and "Never Alone". Gil Goldstein does a great job co-arranging with Brecker and doing the overall orchestration.

Jonathan & Darlene Edwards came along years before Mrs. Miller, but I only discovered them many years after I fell in love with Mrs. Miller.  The former act was, in case some readers don't know it already, a gifted piano player/bandleader Paul Weston, and a supreme vocal stylist known in popular vocalist circles as a singer's singer, Jo Stafford.  She eventually became Weston's wife.  They were best known as themselves, but forged a separate career in musical parody.  What made me convulse with laughter when I was in the mood to listen to these two cutting up vinyl was the knowledge that bad singing isn't easy, and Jo did it by singing sharp.  Try it.  It's harder than singing flat; believe me (and sounds even more horrible).  Now, you may be asking, what do Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have to do with Mrs. Miller?  For me, it's personal, but it may help me to explain the appeal of Mrs. Miller to so many people.

122	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.

Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this "Ride" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.

However, why did Timbaland give OneRepublic (the band that made the song), a "featured" spot. The guy just remixed the song, and added his voice to the background. Is that deserving of taking credit for you making the song? No. I mean, I'm not the biggest Timbaland fan mind you, I like "The Way I Are," but really, this is an undue cheapshot. But, if he hadn't done this, then OneRepublic probably would have taken forever to put out their stunning debut, so in a way, it's actually a good thing. Still bad, but good came out of it.

After discovering that album and Chronicles, I had the good fortune of someone loaning me her tape of Arc Of A Diver, which I copied.  My interest in his second solo album was due to the upbeat "While You See A Chance."  Winwood's sweeping organ-like synths open his first Top Ten solo hit-it reached #7 in 1981-along with the accompanying lively piano that gives it a radio-friendly beat, with some downright introspective lyrics on if one is truly free from the past and ready to take another road one blue morning with a gray wind blowing.

"Good Directions" is the type of down home, good ol' boy number that Kenny Chesney succeeds with (again and again and again).  Billy's remake of "Lucille" is a nice update, hitting a little harder than Kenny Rogers' original, while a collaboration with Michael McDonald on "She's Got A Way With Me" offers a power ballad change of pace.
3154	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Not to call him a male version of Jill Scott or anything like that; there are plenty of albums that sound like this, but Javier's pleasing charm, romantic sentiment, and minimal attempts to be hip-hoppish certainly make him and this album worth checking out.

It contains slow jams, simple, yet deep folk numbers and sultry vocals. Although it is a well-rounded album, it sounds more like "Acoustic Soul 2" rather than a record with its own unique taste.

1. Something More- 4/5 Great song, true lyrics. What more can I say?

While this and her sophomore record aren't as memorable as Control, there are still some pretty good songs on it.  My favorites are Say You Do, You'll Never Find a Love Like Mine, and Come Give Your Love to Me.  The ballads aren't so great.  The upbeat tracks are better.  Very early 80s R&B, disco, Jacksons, Off the Wall sounds.  Come Give Your Love to Me is more rock/new wave, kind of a hint at the sound of her next album, which I think is better than this one.  Both are worth buying if you like 80s music.

There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects.

I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity ("Character" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.

I agree with that assessment.  I was deaf in my right Ear for six months due to a welding accident and went to Saginaw, Michigan to see Rush at the end of their Hemispheres Tour that winter.  The Rockets were the Backup Band that night.  Near the end of the show I moved from the floor up to the back center position to get the best sound.  My Ear broke open and drained out and I could here with both ears again.  I was ecstatic.  This composition was one that I could hear properly.  I love it.  They introduced Free Will, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spirit Of Radio after a final Curtain Call.  Sorry to go on so long but I also seem to remember Mr. Lee saying as the Show began, "We're going to do everything tonight", which may be what happened?  These Guys are Top Notch Entertainers.

It's basically just I-make-more-money-and-do-more-ladies-than-you-so-I'm-cool gangsta club rap. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is that ALL 19 songs are great club tracks (that is indeed a bargain and contributes greatly to its mass appeal)! A must-have album for clubs and parties, but it doesn't really hold any other significant longterm value. Highly recommended for clubheads.

Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.

Much has been made of the resemblance between Luke's voice and that of the lead singer of Coldplay.  Indeed, his voice is eerily similar; fortunately, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Chris's voice is emotive and anguished, and Luke's is much the same, which suits this lovely music perfectly. Some might persuasively argue that it would better serve Blue Merle to have a vocalist with a voice more uniquely his own.  While a voice less reminiscent of that of Coldplay might be desirable for some, ultimately, no one can deny the power and maturity with which Luke uses his voice.  Did Chris influence him?  Probably.  There is no crime in that.  Could Luke have chosen to sing in a different style?  Perhaps.  But would that have suited the music as well? Probably not.  I think that he was blessed with a voice that performs well in the style in which he has chosen to use it, and we should be grateful.  Maturity and further listening will probably help to separate the two in our minds as the bands grow in different directions.  Musically, the two bands are not that similar, although there is much to admire in Blue Merle for fanatics of Coldplay.

The most magical song on the CD is saved for last. October Sky takes an entirely new direction with a jazzy late night feel that  has Javier sounding like a troubadour from the 1930s (with a detour at Stevie Wonders house) who somehow wound up in a modern day bar. I hope that this song is a window of things to come. Dont turn off your CD after the song ends as it picks up again in an organic feel that could also be the basis for what lies ahead for Javier.

I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)

Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, "What the hell are you listening to?" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, "You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. "Love Calls" was the first single from "Kemistry" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. "Inside" and "Cherish this Moment" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on "Inside" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording.

1693	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Though "Quiet Is The New Loud" lacks a hit like "I'd Rather Dance With You" from their newest album "Riot On An Empty Street", every song here is wonderfully mellow and good enough to make it a better album overall (that one had some bad tracks). Erlend Oye was clearly blessed with one of the most soothing voices in the music business. Not only are the vocals great, but the lyrics are also very interesting, even if they lack catchiness. That's not really what this album's about anyway; it's about relaxing. The instrumentation is also pretty simple - it's basically just acoustic guitars and drums, but they're wonderful here - they perfectly encapsulate the mood. "Failure" and "I Don't Know What I Can Save You From" may be the standout tracks, but, really, they're all wonderful. They may not be breaking any new ground here, but they don't really have to - you're going to love it anyway. Practically any music fan will love this, and for that it definitely earns "5" stars. You'll never get tired of listening to this! This is highly recommended!

Authentic Latin flourish spices tracks like "Can't Have My Heart" and "She Spoke To Me," are peppered with Latin influences, which is not surprising as Javier's father owned a Spanish-language radio station  and Latin music was a constant presence in Javier's family household growing up. The former sounds a little too much like Brian McKnights Back At One, but its still great. The latter is pure Javier which to me sounds a little like a contemporary Stevie. Not a parody or an imitation, just the voice and song selection is definitively more Stevie than Nas or 50 Cent. I love the guitar work and the sexy images that the song evokes. Think of a midnight dance under a full moon in a tropical island and youll get an idea of how great She Spoke To Me is and why its another of my favorites. In Your Hands showcases Javiers voice and songwriting strength. Shell Never Know also hits the spot with his pleading beat and sense of romantic loss.

Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Master-of-Puppets/dp/B000002H33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Master of Puppets</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/And-Justice-For-All/dp/B000002H6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">...And Justice For All</a>&nbsp;sounds like.

9442	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play "Amarillo By Morning," and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to "Amarillo by Morning."

8535	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	If there is honestly one thing that I do adore about Sting, is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own. He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold. This is one song that I definitely recommend downloading if you are a Sting fan.

My opinion all soldiers should return back home to their families. Enough is enough!~ These soldiers are in my love cup (heart) for they still are keeping all of us safe from harm. They are and always been in my thoughts and prayer's. I still sing to them online. That's the least I can do for them and I feel it's my call of duty.

8017	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This debut from New York's southside Jamica, Queens crew led by Mr. Cheeks has made boyz with their hustlin', partying, street grooves on Legal Drug Money.  With memerable, catchy hooks and freestyle rhymes the Lost Boyz had themselves an almost classic.  Their party, upbeat joints like "Music Makes Me High" and "Get Up"  are what makes this such a hot commodity.  On the other end of the spectrum we have "Renee".  This is a song mourning over a death.  Besides, Mr. Cheeks uses the word love and keeps it raw and hardcore.  Member Freaky Tah also represented on here with Mr. Cheeks and with a solo song, "1,2,3".  Going back to their most obvious freestyle flow, listen to the two of them on "All Right".  A couple more upbeat tracks would have absolutely made this a classic.

6312	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	When vibraphonist Jackson accepted a recording date with pianist Peterson in 1961, along came the other two members of Oscar's trio, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, "Green Dolphin Street" is relaxed, but "Heartstrings" and "Work Song" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on "John Brown's Body" that soars. The final two cuts, "A Wonderful Guy" and "Reunion Blues" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago. If you have a friend who is afraid of jazz, play this for him or her. It's a perfect blend of the four instruments and a great introduction to the category.

There are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.
6884	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	There is no question about really great songs from the 80's that still stand the test of time, not just because they are infectious, but they still remain more everlasting than many of today's songs in merit and absolute heart. Soft Cell, which has been labeled a one-hit wonder from the 80's, still has not been able to master having another smash song. But still which is a big surprise, their biggest song is actually a cover song from another artist. Tainted Love still sounds great today from the rhythm of the heart, to the mood that many songs don't ignite today. The song which is a cover of a old Gloria Jones song, still is a one of a kind joy to listen to. While it was cheaply sampled by Rihanna for her song S.O.S. in 2006, the song that Soft Cell made years ago, is still more than anything tainted, it is real love.

6120	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	When it has came down to Elton John, musically the 90's definitely brought out the best in Elton's voice, after getting his life back together from vices, and fallout from the media in England, he reemerged brilliantly with his music, and the music from his 1992 album The One definitely showed that in a melodic way. The Last Song definitely still shows that. It is still as beautiful and simple from Elton's talent, singing about A.I.D.S. after losing his friends and loved ones from Freddie Mercury of Queen to Ryan White, he definitely still knows that even after 20 years after this song came out, it still clicks very well and intimately with Elton's voice and sonnet. If you've haven't heard any of Elton John's songs from the 90's, this is absolutely one worth checking out.

When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects.
Not only is this album a great party CD for "retro" parties, relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing, but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music. Oh, there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this, but this album is surely the place to start.  (By the way, if you have insomnia, this can be quite soothing. Lie back on that imaginary beach in Rio and float away on Gilberto's soft voice. Mmmmmmm....)

With 1983's "Kill `Em All," Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel "Ride the Lightning" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was "Master of Puppets."

Crazy was a top ten pop hit in America and (in 1990) a top twenty hit in Britain. Heartaches was Patsy's first American top forty pop hit. Don Gibson wrote Sweet dreams and had a big country hit with it, but once Patsy recorded it, it became much more popular and will be forever thought of as a Patsy Cline song. She's got you was an American top twenty pop hit and was also Patsy's first British hit, albeit only a minor one I fall to pieces was yet another top twenty pop hit in America. Walking after midnight is the song that began it all for Patsy in the fifties. Poor man's roses, Back in baby's arms and Leaving on your mind are other Patsy classics included here.

If you ever need a helping hand,
On the other hand, it's a darned shame that at least a one unmarked re-recording snuck into this set. Runaway is obviously not the original version. (That's the only one I'm sure about; perhaps other reviewers can find more.) At least half of these songs really are the originals, and the collection would be easily worth the money just for them. I would have given "45 Real Originals" a 5-star review, but the sour taste of a re-recording lowers my rating for "50 (Mostly) Originals" to 4 stars.

4880	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	When 50 First came on the scene, I was a little skeptic of what he was all about. I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened? NO, but I am more then 99.9% sure that this is how it went down. Everyone do 50 and favor and boycott his next CD, then maybe his can Get Poor and Die Penniless.

As wrong as that may sound, some moms are just hot, like it or not. You might even dream about having that mom, to show her off to your buddies. But this song is about that feeling. And kudos to FoW for having the balls to write a song like this, put it out on the radio, and making the music video the way that they did.

"Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of "Ipanema."  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings "Quiet nights and quiet dreams/Quiet walks by quiet streams/And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely."  And Getz's sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim's piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.

3459	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Its Christmas time once again and all the Christmas music is playing on the radio, in the stores and at home. The tradional Christmas music is fun, heart warming. A couple of weeks ago I heard the song A Baby Changes Everything by Faith Hill, introduced by a friend. That song put a whole sense of feeling about life. Though it is about baby Jesus, but it touched my life about a baby that was born 23 years ago to me. The baby changed everything in my life. When I first heard it I was crying. Tonight Jamie who sings at the Hard Rock Lobby Bar in Tampa sang a song called  Grown -up Christmas List- I honestly have never heard this song before and I simply started crying, tears were flowing. Though it has been recorded by such very talented artist as Amy Grant, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Cole- David Foster, Clay Aiken and Michael Buble. I have always had people in my life, a friend, my family, people who I meet. As I was crying the shock of reality came over me when I realized their are people in this world who do not have family, a friend, neighbor to talk to.

Since the Latin beginning "Broadband" , passing through the marvelous and suggestive ballad "Angle of repose", the original song of African roots "Timbuktu" , the magnificent theme "Night Jessamine" with funk accents, to the most experimental and dynamically moving "Scylla" in which harmonizes expression and introspection, until the last track "Never alone" Brecker always exposed with his inimitable style and touch of class tracks like "Brexterity", the captivating "Evening faces" and the fabulous "Modus operandi" makes me think about an innermost musical journey .

Several more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.

One reason that makes this album great is their creative hooks, some of them will have you remembering for a while. "Music Makes Me High", and "The Yearn" are both entertaining (although I believe "Da Game" is very similar to the latter song). "1,2,3" is another great song too with the late Freaky Tah on the solo. "Get Up" is another song to easily remember, and slightly changes the atmosphere on the album. Other dope tracks to check out are the title song, and "Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless".

Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

1518	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I could see this played out in a music video because of the way it's presented here.  The girl hypnotized by the "Magic Man's"  charm and personality (among other things), the mother's worry that her daughter will be lost to a stranger, and her pleas to her daughter to come home.  It's up to you to decide whether she returns or not.  I like that.  Rarely do songs involve the listener to actually think about the outcome for themselves.

236	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.

"White Christmas" glows brighter than silver and gold combined when Mr. Ives sings it; that background chorus rounds out the number nicely although wisely the arrangement makes it so that they can't attempt to share the spotlight with Burl. "The Little Drummer Boy" has another terrific arrangement; the percussion and guitar are used very well and the music fits perfectly with Burl Ives' singing. In addition, "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer" leaves nothing to be desired--this music is all THAT good!

So as you can see, "Ride The Lightning" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even "The Black Album" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.

"I'll make love to you" is one of the most romantic songs ever, but we've come to expect great songs like that from Babyface. The Boyz also wrote quite a few of their own songs that are featured on this album,  which further showcases their talents. This album is a must for all R&B fans.

158	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Contrary to just about everyone else saying "Master of Puppets" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt "Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with "Fight Fire With Fire", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is "Fade to Black", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  "Trapped Under Ice" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  "Escape" is hte only song that could be classified as "filler material", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is "Creeping Death", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental "Call of Ktulu" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, "Ride the Lightning" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.
It ends:
Alternately, "Rescue" finds her articulating the disadvantages of being a damsel in distress.
The songwriting is a highlight as well. Never before have I heard such well-crafted stories like the bluesy "October Sky" and, although slighty sappy, "If I Never Get To Heaven". The former talks about how his girl suddenly changed her ways, while the latter explains what his woman's love means to him. The fact that Javier had written or co-written all the songs himself especially makes these tracks stand out.

All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving.
6414	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This was the first song I heard by KISS back many years ago in the 1970's. It's hard to believe they're still going strong although they have changed drummers and guitarists a few times. I think Paul Stanley does a wonderful job singing and its a good song to dance to!

97	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.

2870	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I came across some lyrics about a month ago and wondered where have I heard this song before. I forgot all about it, but I will never forget the music video with Erik Estrada. The reason why I like this song is because of the great beat. It's not like a lot of the 90's music with the screaming, shouting and just poor music. This song has definitely got it in all the right places :).
4597	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	...I do not mean any disrespect AT ALL. This is NOT sarcasm: People that are in one of the greatest bands ever, should NOT get near a plane! Seeing them in the sky is as close as you should get...ever. This song sums up Lynyrd Skynyrd. The older VanZandt brother and a couple of other band members and crew died in a crash. It seems very odd to me that so many great musicians lost their lives jetting around. These guys lived they're lives just like the moral of this song. They did not play for fame and fortune. They never let themselves be changed one bit when all the other bands were going "hair band." They were good ol' boys from Alabama that played songs that had a certain timeless and profound pride in being just that: good folks. Skynyrd touched so many of us (now middle aged) people when WE were the future. It was our turn to run the world, and being humble, respectful, and doing the right thing was important. Now that we've retired, the world is way too small, and common courtesy seems but a distant memory. Everything they put out went platinum. Their first song, to the last, was straight up American. The whole Rock Music world mourned when that plane went down. That was it. The other members went back home and would have never played again. BUT! Those guys knew that the older brother, Johnny, I believe (God forgive me if I've got the two mixed up) would want them to try to show the world what was being lost and try to get people to just slow down, realise what is truly important in life; forget greed, be kind and respectful, and just live, simple. Because, "if you do, you will be satisfied." Fans of all different kind of music came to see a band that was not really a band any more. All these people came to listen and give their respects. Skynyrd toured one more time. The younger VanZandt brother finally put his grief away for long enough to tour one more time. The whole venue was packed. We went and seen them at Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville. The younger brother wore a flat brimmed hat just like his older brother used to. He stepped up to the mic and did something he swore not to do...it just hurt too bad: He sang his brothers songs. They played, I swear it was like Jonny was there. Freebird was last song of course....

393	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I loved the 1960's the songs were so strong and almost militant by standards of the day.  In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car.

844	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	George Thorogood plays no frills rock & roll heavily steeped in Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.  "Bad To The Bone" is probably his most recognizable song and is a chunky piece of braggadocio that echoes the great Mr. Diddley.  Mr. Thorogood gravelly voice rumbles through the song alongside his buzz saw guitar with a horn piercing in and out to add an exclamation point.
188	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  "Mezzanine" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include "Angel" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about "Teardrop" (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!

 So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.

Being a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.

The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.
Her twangly, delicate harp is matched up with some decent banjo tunes, and what sounds like some soft drums, all mingled together. In "Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie," we mostly just get gentle strums from the harp. And over it all is Newsom's creaky, meandering vocals, wandering through the melody like a sleepy fairy.

1271	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I hear people complaining how bad this album is, that "Soilwork have turned to crappy nu-metal or they're not melo-death!" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy Metallica's horrible excuse for a new album "St. Anger", or that that new album from Limp Bizkit. True "Stabbing The Drama" isn't Soilwork's best album, but is sure blows the previous release "Figure Number Five" right out of the water, and at least the drummer doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that guitarists Ola Frenning and Peter Wichers still know how to solo. Now that I got that out of my chest, I will now review the album. 2005's "Stabbing The Drama", Soilwork's sixth album is one of the best metal albums I bought this year. Like I said before, this blows FNF out of the water. Even thought the bass and keyboards are somewhat drowned out (due to the bit faulty production), this album still has great vocals from Speed Strid, catchy guitar riffs and some nice solos from Peter Wichers and Ola Frenning, and some very good drumming as well. My favorite songs on here are "Stabbing The Drama", "One With The Flies" (which is very catchy), "Weapon Of Vanity", "Stalemate", "Nerve", "Distance", and "Blind Eye Halo" (which is an excellent dose of traditional Soilwork brutality and aggression).

And yet, on this same opener, it is made clear that the group also have the tunes to back it up, and then some!  From vocalist/co-guitarist Deryck Whibley's ultra-memorable vocal lines and defiant sneer to bassist Cone's well-placed and twanging mid-song interlude, these guys prove they're the real deal, and it doesn't let up from there.  This cut segues into the 50-second "Never Wake Up," which is a fast and furious monster and as good of a take on hardcore punk as any I've heard.  The two best songs, though, lie in the disc's second half.  One is "Summer," a rerecording from the group's debut "Half Hour of Power," and boy, is it a masterpiece!  The main driving force in it is a simple, three-chord progression, but it proves that sometimes the simplest riffing can also be the most effective.  And that chorus -- you will not get it out of your head for days!  No doubt, one of Sum's signature tunes.  Perhaps my all-time favorite, though, is track number ten, "Crazy Amanda Bunkface."  This one is two minutes and 16 seconds of pure punk rock bliss, and Deryck's raging guitar solo, which is somewhat reminiscent of Green Day's earlier "Haushinka," will surely have you cranking the sound to maximum levels and basking in the euphoria.  Again, a cut virtually unrivalled in the confines of punk.

Track by Track:
9818	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is a very nice song. The melody and how every thing comes together was done very well. Nelly's voice is crystal clear. This song should have been longer with some sort of instrumental solo in the middle and at the end fading away slowly in conjunction with the other instruments. None the less I like this type of song from Nelly. I've been a fan off Nelly since she started in the late 90's. I was in high school and normally listened to rock music like Guns N' Roses, Metalica, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd etc. I hated when she changed to more "dirty" type music. But she had to grow up and wish she would make more of this types of songs. This is more classy Nelly and I like a well orchestrate song with melodies. U need to listen very carefully to the song with your headphones to appreciate not just the lyrics, but the instruments and how they were tied together. GOOD MUSIC!

5536	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Great tune  cannot go wrong with a winwood clapton collaboration
1173	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This was one of Grand Funk's real anthems and one of their most played songs before their big hit period began with We're An American Band in the fall of '73. Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics, largely, I think, because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd-pleasers, and showed no greater ambitions than that. But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million-selling albums at a time when AM radio wouldn't play their songs. This song would be heard at rock concerts all over, especially the outdoor concerts. If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot. But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too. It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970-71.
7080	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news--she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song--it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.  If you've never heard a Cranberries record--this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound.

'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10

While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.

8595	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Marilyn Manson is an alternative rock music take on the Sweet Dreams Are Made of This song by the Eurythmics (which is also a brilliant song  by the way). The only difference is that Marilyn Mansons version is a grittier/darker remake.  Im guessing-from reading online meanings of the song-that the basic summary behind Marilyn Mansons version is the controversial notion of a person witnessing both people being abused and those that are the abusers themselves (which Im guessing can apply to either personal or professional/career settings).  I myself am lucky to have a loving husband so fortunately this song is not life imitates art for me.  However, Im intuitively collecting this song as a way of understanding the shadowy/dark sides of human nature for my professional storytelling career aspirations.

The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on "More And More" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in "My Everything".  Another Motown remake (besides "Heaven Must Have Sent You", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  "When I'm Gone" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.

However, I was surprised at how good Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are.  She, being the lead singer, has a pleasant voice, very melodic with an bit of poetic spin in it.  The song to me was sort of something between jazz and R&B, but resulting in the best of both worlds, since R&B originated from jazz in the first place.

8534	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.

  Second is the orchestration of the piece, and the organization of my perfect song is wonderful. It begins with string entry on electric guitar, (although I've seen the tall guy banging away on an acoustical guitar in concert) . First thing is a tentative mid range chord swipe followed by a second bold strum using the same chord then blazing away into the chords banged as a rhythm, with varying chords that raise up to the high range and then cut off by a single plucked string that's allowed to fade off for a while a second or two and that leads into the voice singing in a soft tone, suggesting a secret whispered into your ear then raising to a pitch that wails across the table at a bistro you're sitting at with him. As the singer carries on with his performance the harmonizing players join on key notes while the electric guitars jam on at a feverous rate, keeping the same rhythm and beat underneath them swelling when there's a pause in the song, eddying away after he rejoins until without warning  (well, I know where and when by now) it all freezes, stops suddenly and there is only the bass thrum of a string , low and reverberating, steady and carrying the whole band, the world and the secret on it's powerful,confident back. That all too brief sound  is the one I wait for as I fall under its spell and it tells me the secret and the meaning that no one knows. I didn't know what to do about the ending going into a Mexican radio station and the announcer crying "avey,..avay,..avey,..aiyee..." but now I do know that the Queens had cradled the entire album around and within leaps into various broadcast stations in order to carry the secret out into the world  and seek a change, I have come to enjoy the brash announcer as another performer doing a job, yet a part of mysteries beyond us. The second song on this album is the Mosquito song, perhaps a dig at music producers and bean counters who would suck the life out of composers and performers? however one that I have come to interpret as music of another creation that is living and composing music in its own way and I avoid judgement on its efforts. For sure the whine of a mosquito gives me chills and snags my interest as I prepare to fend it (her?) away from my flesh, but there's something broadcast-y and remenisent about the sound she makes resembling the whine on a radio being tuned in. As of yet I haven't found a single song I would say I can stand after those two, but the ease,flexibility, quality is above average and excellent.

Released in 1973, the same year as the bands debut Catch A Fire was released, and while many consider one significantly greater then the other, which varies who you ask, I must say they both go hand in hand. Catch A Fire and this, Burnin' are sort of like a ying, and yang thing, not to sound too cliche. Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin' is the opposite spectrum, more empowering, and more about overcoming and getting yours.

7983	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Having the majority of Lucinda's albums, I must say this is the one that stays in my CD player the most.  All the songs on this album are great and some in particular will keep you thinking long after you hear them (Fancy Funeral, What If).  You may want to hear "Come On" in private, especially away from children or the prude due to subject matter and how she lyrically gives the kiss off to a guy that "didn't know where to put his hands", and he couldn't even make her Come (On) (you'll get the idea at first listen).  One of Lucinda's best albums, followed by Essence and A World Without Tears.

It's also nice on a nippy evening when it's just a bit to chilly, but you sit on the porch anyhow...because Skynard is plying you with alternating rhythms and sweeping chords, managing to make a twang sound sweet.

So you hit repeat and do it all again.  Got to love it.

In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a "tune" or two). I love true heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.

Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, "Fade to Black." It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is!

Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6/22/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience.

With members of The Meters and Little Feat backing him, this album is really tight. It would have been quite something to see these guys live. The material is a mixture of originals and two classics by the great New Orleans musician and producer Allen Toussaint. These are the title track and "From a Whisper to a Scream". Palmers vocals are as smooth as you would expect and unlike much material from the early 70's this doesn't date.

Back in the 70's she was trying to expell her character gypsy songs-and forage a serious career. She was in somewhat of a dilemma considering her loss of a private life-a public life paired with a clothes horse reputation. It was a long shot to imagine musical crtics to come to her side.
BestBuy is currently offering an edition with a second disc featuring two demos for tracks on the main album. "Where Is My Love" and "Rescue" (both terrific songs).

243	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.

9787	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Great song, beautiful tune, and the lyrics caused me 2 do some research. There was a radio station in the South that was allegedly either bombed or burned down for playing this song!  Janis had the insight to write this song at age 13!  I would give this song 5 stars except that the girl cops out at the end. However, the song played in 1965 or 1967, so the taboo of the times still has to be considered.  For the most part,  society's children are still "sticking to their own kind", and though  unspoken and a bit weaker, the social dating rules still exist.
1764	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	One of the best of the 80's.  This is a handy, more portable version of the song.  Beats hauling 8-tracks around.

3. The title track from "Dangerous" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's "HIStory" second CD of new material are added ("Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although "Earth Song" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How "They Don't Care About Us" ended up on the "essential" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).

While a great deal of my music library is comprised of Amazon's free songs, I splurged and spent a whopping 69 cents on this one.  Thats right...Amazon has a FREEBIE / CHEAP section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.

21. Eddie Fisher - Oh! My Papa (3:09)
The album is absolutely spot-on in terms of quality, the songs are memorable, the production is good and there is an audible enthusiasm to the performance. Monster Magnet, like so many bands, may have a reputation stating that their early stuff is what you want to be listening to and the rest is take-it-or-leave-it, but I assure you that in the case of Monolithic Baby! that is only a stylistic argument, not a qualitative one.

8022	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is an album about loss and survival. It's darker than some of Lucinda's other releases. It may not be for all Williams fans; it certainly is very different and more experimental than her last three albums. If you're uncertain about it the first time, give it a couple of other spins--it'll grow on you. The depth of emotion and Lucinda's raw vocals (meaning they weren't re-recorded--producer Hal Wilner used the demo vocal tracks as he loved the emotion in the performances) give this album an extra kick. I've seen some mixed reviews from fans here--I suspect this is an album that fans will probably come back to later and realize how good it is.

And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.

4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.

As with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with "I Know You're There" and "All Because of Jesus," but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.

9143	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on "Thank You" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both "All Around The World" and "U Know" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, "Vibin'" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  "I Sit Away" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel "Jezzebel" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on "Khilil (Interlude)" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with "Trying Times" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights "I'll Make Love To You" and "Water Runs Dry".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on "On Bended Knee".  "50 Candles" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content "...feels like one of those nights..."  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on "Yesterday" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time.

One of the major ones was is that he would need to put some distance between some of the more progressive melodic/harmonic instincts he might've developed during his Traffic period. Also he might've also had the sense that,although strongly synergistic with musicians such as Jim Capaldi,that as a multi instrumental Winwood was more in the position to instrumentally carry his follow up album on his own He also added another element to the mix along with Viv Stanshall. And that was the presence of the apparently more pop radio friendly lyricist Will Jennings. The result was this album-one which held the hopes within it for the future of Steve Winwoods musical future as a solo artist.

Big Girls Don't Cry, the third single from that album is a very heartfelt, and down to Earth ballad. It is a real departure from her other hit songs which are more upbeat. It has a simplistic feel that matches that is very mellow and elequent. I like the song a whole lot, because it shows a more natural tone to Fergie's soulful voice, and what she does to make it worth while. I really hope Fergie can keep making more songs like this one on her next record, or with The Black Eyed Peas.

This particular song just has a power in the lyrics about a guy in a bad romantic situation that really resonates with anyone who has ever been in love with someone else and not had those feelings returned by that person.

And because of the movie, covers ensued. Anberlin's cover of the song wasn't that great. It was a straight up cover, with some acoustic elements added to it, that really didn't add to the song. Plus, they are so alike on vocals, you still had the same problem. New Found Glory also covered the song, but they made it more upbeat than the original, giving it more of a pop/rock influence, but it still kept the emotion of the original song, and added another layer to it.

"Can I Walk With You" has that ready-for-VH1 feel to it, as does "Interested", but that doesn't make these songs any less engaging. Also, I noticed that "Slow Down" has the same melody as last year's "Back to the Middle". But this album is still solid. Don't buy it expecting some kind of growth in songwriting or spiritual evolution (it's only been a year since her Acoustic Soul album). Because while there are no recognizable standout singles by the likes of, say, "Brown Skin", you'll be missing out if you don't take this voyage to India.

The music is also very creative and original, much different from all the grunge that was released back in 1994. Best of all, it's timeless! Each song has at least something to say about it.

4829	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	So here we have the elusive album by Janet Jackson that i have been trying to convince retailers actually exists ! Those of you in the know,know what i'm talking about.....trying to explain that Janet did have two albums prior to Control. For some reason people [among them Janet] have been trying to avoid this album's existence and i for the life of me don't know why,sure it doesn't have all the "attitude" of a Control or a Rhythm Nation but this was 1982 four years before Control and music was different then. To compare this to Control or "rhythm" is unfair,first off as i stated before music WAS different then,secondly,even tho the "Minneapolis Sound" was in full swing,it was done by grown folks like Prince,The Time,Vanity 6 among others,Janet was a 16 year old girl still living under the jackson's Compound and it was not until 1984's Dream Street that she started showing signs of rebel. I'm giving this album five stars because the music is good on here and Janet was in her purest form, just an r&b/pop teen singer doing her thing. For those of you who care...there's a longer version of "say you do" on this album and it's better than the one that appeared on the original release, in my opinion also i have a new found fondness for the song "forever yours" and i always loved "young love' that was my jam ! Anyway,buy this album before it "disappear" again.

They're classified as "Baroque Rock".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song!

Then you have the ultimate song of rebellion and revolution, a song that would become an anthem of both Reggae & Revolutions around the globe, Bob Marley's masterpiece "I Shot The Sheriff."  What can be said about this song that has not already been stated millions of times over.  It has so many layers and displays Marley's incredible mastery of writing and storytelling using allegories and metaphors.

 As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.

"Only in Dreams" is the finishing song, and it sounds EXACTLY like Undone at first, but it later starts to sound like a big mix of every other song on the album, so it makes a great last song [8 minutes]. But it had a lot of mic feedback at the end and Rivers stopped singing early again, so I'm not so sure about it. It got quiet like Surf Wax America and Holiday, but that's not exactly a middle section, since no one was singing, and because it happened towards the end. Long story short, it's a good last song, though it kind of sounds like Undone. [5/10]
146	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton

All songs aside, Arie shines most on "Can I Walk With You" - a song about the need to belong. Arie's vocals on this song depict a yearning like no other. This is definitely a gem, if Motown Records had any sense this would be the next single.

168	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Though not a true concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the "story" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best.

355	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.
3759	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Amen
After to the legendary grandeur of "Ys," this little EP seems relaxed and laid-back, as if Newsom and her band had sauntered into a coffee shop and done an impromptu set. They're done with an ear for fun, but that doesn't take the delicate, appealing edge from the music.

Overall, a good album just got even better. Despite it's price tag, the average Weezer fan just should not be without this. It might make you love the band even more. You definitely get your money's worth. And as I said before, the original album itself is just classic. Say what you will about Weezer's newer material, but this stuff just can't be beat. They definitely deserve their popularity and their place in modern rock royalty. I really think anyone and everyone can appreciate the Blue Album, an accomplishment a lot of musicians cannot acheive.

57	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).

9142	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	While most artists suffer a sohphmoe slump Boyz II Men did just the opposite and scored home run with the classic II. II is a carefully constructed crowd pleaser, accentuating all of the finest moments from their hit debut. While there are some high-energy dance tracks, the album's main strength is its slower numbers, where the group's vocals soar. The slow jams Trying Times & 50 Candles are excllent and can easily hang with any of the songs they've ever recorded. As far as the singles I'll Make Love To You, Yesterday, On Bended Knee and Water Runs Dry they need only word to describe them which is classic.

5789	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I always think of Be Like That as the cautionary tale of excessive dreaming and a commentary on what happens when we constantly compare ourselves to others. I've spent entirely too many years doing this instead of just chasing what I wanted in life. In doing this, I've missed out on so many opportunities to do great things because they weren't the greater things I thought other people were doing. As a person with cerebral palsy since birth, I've fallen into the trap of wanting to be someone else, a lot. Therefore, Be Like That has special meaning for me. Don't live in your dreams or anyone elses, make your own beautiful reality.

The stars? Harrison and McCartney. I think George's stuff here could have been freeze-dried for a hearty repast on any number of 1963-64 Beatles l.p.s. "Crying, Wating, and Hoping" is beautiful - as usual the guys do an exceptional take on Buddy Holly.

They weren't the first to write, produce & perform reggae (Music of the Islands) but they did bring a cohesiveness to their genre and showed that, by this time, it had matured into a force just like the other top genre's of the day.  The Wailers also were able to seemlessly blend aspects from R&B, Jazz, Gospel and Blues bringing a different and unique flavor.  The Wailers, along with Jimmy Cliff, were truly the 1st to make us stand up and pay attention to Reggae and what it would soon mean on a world wide scale!  I recenly ran across an online poll that asked a simply yet profound question. "Who was more influential: Bob Marley or John Lennon?"  There were a variety of opinons one way or the other, as you would expect, and the debate got somewhat heated.  However, the final response given by a participant on the forum was one of the most profound I've heard on the subject and I think sums everything up in a nutshell.

8023	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Lucinda Williams has made a career out of doing things her way.  Her past is full of legendary confrontations with record label execs and producers who did not support her vision of what her music should be.  With the success of CAR WHEELS ON A GRAVEL ROAD, that relentless fight finally paid dividends as the commerce finally caught up with her art.  Rather than repeating CAR WHEELS formula over and over, Lucinda left behind the Southern travel logs and delved into more emotional material.  The songs on ESSENCE and WORLD WITHOUT TEARS not only dug into the deeper depths of her psyche, but also loosened up musically, mixing more rock and hard blues into her Americana palette.  WEST seems like a logical extension of the two previous albums emotionally, while moving into new territory musically.

"Unsuffer Me" is a grueling unflinching look at the pain of loss.  Sometimes you have to stare it in the face to get through it.  "Anoint my head with your sweet kiss, my joy is dead; I long for bliss," she sings as what I assume is Dan Pettibone's electric guitar churns mercilessly.  Yet somehow the song achieves a magical dignity.  During my wife's last weeks, my daughter said to me, "It's like watching a train wreck; you can't look away."

I don't care if something is popular or not, if I like it I'll listen to it.  I think the fact that it was associated with Barbie, which I wasn't into anymore, and that I didn't like a lot of 90s pop, just made me feel alienated from the song.  But many years later, I like it.  It's catchy and gets stuck in my head.  Maybe it's because I've been into collecting Barbie again.  Or because I don't hear 90s pop a whole lot anymore, and I can just listen to it now and then when I feel like it.

A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled "Wanksta" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit "IN Tha Club", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is another one of those cases where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. But if this is your first Lucinda Williams album, I suggest you get educated on some of her earlier material first. She doesn't sound different or anything, but, well, Lucinda is another one of those singers that makes great songs yet she doesn't have a great voice, so if you're not a fan of hers, this album might put you to sleep.

7843	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Jeffrey Osborne the ultimate lead singer of LTD sang this Ballad and it was the Song of our High School Prom 1967.  I did not have a boyfriend back in the days because I valued music more than most of the boys I knew and they were too shy to want to dance.  This song came on and one of my high school crushes came and asked me to dance.  It did not matter that he could not dance very well, I was just on top of the world that I was dancing to one of my favorite groups singing my favorite song at the time.  LTD was not the same for me once Jeffrey Osborne left the group but I still listen to his music.  It was and is still soothing, I play it when I am studying or when I am having trouble falling asleep or when I want to go back to sweet memories.

95	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I already had one of the finest versions of Ride the Lightning on CD as a basis for comparison. I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.
I used this song in one of several 80s compilations.
