5565	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Wheat thins and triscuits are my all time favorite crackers! What I love about wheat thins though is they can either be eaten standalone, which is how I normally eat them, or with toppers such as cheese, which I have on occasion. Triscuits however, are on the dry side, and while you can eat them on their own, I most always eat them with cheese. I find wheat thins to have a nice, sort of nutty, flavor, and has just the right amount of salt, which like a lot of crackers, is just on one side. I love all things salty, so when I eat them, Im always trying to make sure I get the salt side down so it hits my tongue. Doing it this way hits my taste buds in all the right places as I eat each cracker. And the cracker is just the right size to pop the whole thing in your mouth, so if the salt side is up, I can easily flip it down with my tongue before I begin chewing it. Maybe its part OCD, but hey, what can I say, its how I like to eat them! :)
2936	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good taste but some were damaged in packing or transport and had to throw away two cups and do a lot of cleaning because of the sticky mess.

654	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	These are very good but their Mesquite flavor is their best.
The cookie flavor itself was pretty good. I like the soft texture, although there is some grittiness due to the oatmeal and fiber. Not objectionable, however. What I didn't care for was how crumbly they are - they can easily fall apart.

7682	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good value
"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a type of sugar that has been processed and combined with corn syrup to produce a cheap, easily dissolvable sweetener. But this sugar is quickly absorbed by the liver where it is converted into fat. Since your brain doesn't recognize HFCS as regular food, it never shuts off the appetite center -- so you keep eating. Blood sugar levels rise, massive amounts of insulin is recruited to metabolize it and then you crash and feel hungry again. It is found in soft drinks, fruit juices, salad dressings and baked goods. Read the food labels of products in your pantry and refrigerator and throw out all products that contain HFCS."
5360	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I just recently discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a variety of green teas. Wonderful! I was introduced to cold green tea about a year ago and I loved it. Now I can buy Teas' Tea Jasmine Green Tea quickly and easily. It's rather expensive, but soooo good! It's only ingredients are purified water, jasmine green tea and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The taste is light and utterly refreshing. I'd take this unsweetened tea over any kind of sweetened tea any time. After you get used to it, regular iced tea just will never suffice. I wonder how long it will be before this stuff starts appearing in restaurants. I haven't noticed any as yet. Believe me, it's only a matter of time.

I suppose it could be either a random burp, or a cost reduction decision.  Either way, I'm unhappy with it.  I wouldn't mind if they had perhaps reduced its thickness or used a different/cheaper design, but not having one at all is annoying.  Using the cracker to scoop has invariably gotten me messy in some way, and forces you to leave more cheese along the walls/bottom than if it had the old spatula.

Some people have complained the hole in the top is too large, but I have found it to be just the right size for dispensing this thicker mustard.

I take one star off of this soup only because the calories are higher than I like to see in a bowl of soup. This is 150 calories per serving, and I prefer the calories to be closer to 100. Of course this isn't advertised as a light soup either. My wife recently tried combining a can of this with a can of the Light Chicken and Dumpling. The result was a pleasing lunch at an average of only 115 calories per bowl.
4472	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I was a soy drinker for a few years and really enjoyed it.  Then I started reading more about the problems with soy and decided to give Almond milk a try.  I admit I was skeptical and at first was not thrilled with the thinner consistency and lack of sweetness.  However, I've adjusted and I really like this milk now.  I use it in everything and even bake with it.  For some things like custard I add a tad of cornstarch to give it a thicker consistent but flavor wise it's great.  It also makes wonderful ice cream and sweetened with agave it's all good.  Plus an added bonus is the 40 calories vs. 90-120 for soy AND.. less chance of hormone upset, genetic altering etc.

I have to do all of the purchasing for employee appreciation every other Thursday for our company. with between 50 & 100 employees at a time depending on the season it can be a huge PITA going to the grocery store and purchasing a boat load of different snacks for each of them. I was able to add the quantity I needed to my box and fill them up then have them delivered right to my office. No carrying bag and bag from the parking lot to the break room. SO AWESOME!!

3474	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I have to say this mix comes out better than my homemade cornbread.  It has a nice moist texture as opposed to a gritty consistency.  Very flavorful.  Be careful how long you bake it or it will get crumbly.  I baked mine almost 5 minutes less than the instructions read and cooled the pan on a rack rather than a flat surface.  Another difference is to use a metal pan.  As long as the price stays the same I'll continue to purchase this item as desired.
146	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Barely edible. I like tuna but I've smelled better tuna cat food!  Not solid white.  Grainy texture and too much water.  Chicken of the Sea used to be the best but not anymore. Very disappointed.

BTW:  IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED PRIME PANTRY, GIVE THEM A TRY!! Efficient, quick, and I love getting my non-PERISHABLE  foods ahead of my PERISHABLE ones!  BY THE WAY....did I MENTION PRIME PANTRY HAVING OUTSTANDING PRICES?  These are the best Taco Shells and we won't go back to the other shape.

Progresso decided to make its Safe & Hearty soup easy to use, starting with it's easy open cap, almost a pop-top. Obviously, they supply all the directions you need for both cooktop and microwave, in English and Spanish. IMPORTANT: Be sure to let the soup cool after microwaving your bowl of soup. I prefer the microwave directions. In my opinion, the taste is equal, but clean-up is easier.

3118	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I do not understand how GM/Progresso manages to create this product. Most soups are double the calories (or more) and 1.5x sodium. I have long suspected they must simply be lying about the calories on their soups because, somehow they are incredibly low calorie, yet somehow this can is positively packed with deliciousness. Huge, curly noodles are great, and the flavor is just right. I crumble up a few saltines into this soup and it is delicious!

The Bad: These potatoes are not as cheesy as I was hoping for. As instant potatoes, they are great, but this flavor is not a favorite.
Okay, I need to use Bible's 1John1:9 (naming my sins to God, here of anger) every time I use these.  Thankfully out of the original group I purchased five years prior, most became damaged; so, I've only a few left.  THEY WILL NOT STACK because some dufus thought that center poptop was a good idea.  All these years have now passed and still the design is used?  So now it's the customer's fault for buying, no longer MADware's.  The tops wreck an otherwise quality product.  Hard to store, NO they don't clamp together, and NO they don't stack, so that everything wobbles in your freezer.

8430	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	There was something not quite right about this item.  I know it is supposed to be an authentic taste as it would be with a "real" lemon, however I felt like there was almost a chemical taste to this, perhaps it was derived from the little bottle it was in. I would personally not purchase this item again, I prefer the taste of real lemons (fresh lemons) and will opt for that over this brand again.

As a family we tend to prefer the more boutique brand, Peanut Butter & Co. Among the basic go-to brands, we agree that Jif Natural has a more robust roasted peanut taste. This Skippy seems a little bland by comparison, although it has that same classic Skippy taste, meaning we detected no real difference taste-wise between this natural version and the regular (hydrogenated oils) version. Per a two tablespoon serving, Skippy Natural has 3.5 grams of saturated fat (other brands have 2.5 or 3 roughly), and 3 grams of sugar. We found that the Skippy Natural with Honey (5 grams of sugar) tastes better all around.

7569	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is small but it tastes good. Haribo bears are a bit firm relative to other gummies but they have a good taste to it. It is a little bit acidic and a little bit sweet. There is a variety of flavors. I like the 5 oz bag because they are not too large. It's hard to stop eating gummies once you have sampled some. I would buy this brand again when I am in a gummy eating mood.

Very easy to cook sure but I thought it was going to be rich in flavor but it was very bland and made me feel nauseous and grossed out. I added some garlic and seasoning and it made the cardboard taste seem a little bit more bearable. Other then that look into other brands.

7247	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Alright, it's just dish soap but there is something different about it.  First, it is great on grease.  Secondly, it is not overly perfumed.  The scent is subtle and pleasant.  I hand wash my dishes now that my kids have moved onward and upward, so dish soap isn't just for getting things ready for the dishwasher anymore.  This is a bit thicker than the name brand option I have gotten used to, so, while I ordered this because there was too much snow for me to drive 20 miles to that big box store that us rural folks have become dependent on, I am glad I gave this a try.  I am so impressed with Amazon Pantry.  It is quite a service.  I was skeptical but they wowed me!

He probably didn't understand my disappointment in the animals. Most of the crackers were broken - they still tasted good and fresh but that did disappoint me. The crackers that were whole were hard for me to determine what animal they really represented. I believe animal crackers have changed a lot since I was a child. They are still nicely flavored and we enjoyed our snack but I wish I could have recognized the animals!

One can I had to use a hammer and screwdriver to open, one opened fine, the 3rd one was the one that nearly cut the tip of my finger off, I am afraid to ever buy or try opening any of these anymore.

I had to seriously "doctor up" the four cheese potatoes with seasonings of my own just to make it edible.
451	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product and a good price.  If you have not tried "prime pantry" yet, you are missing out.  Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?

A lot of the "butter" flavor stuck to the bottom of the package.  I suppose that cuts down on the number of calories and amount of salt that I consumed, though I *may* have run my finger over that part of the package a few times to get a taste of that stuff.  I would like it if more of that ended up on the popcorn, although the flavor was OK as is.

Would it be economical to ship them in cardboard tubes?

I tried this both with and without milk. With milk, it was just OK: not great, disintegrates rapidly, chocolate taste is good, but overall nothing that special.
These Jiffy Corn Muffins are sweet, so they might not work with recipes that need non-sweet cornbread. You make them with one egg and enough milk to mix. The recipe on the box calls for 1/3 cup but I can tell you that the amount needed changes with the weather, just like more flour recipes.

I don't know if French's improved their recipe, but from what I remember as a kid, the onions were good for chef's treat while cooking in the kitchen.  Though crunchy, they weren't crispy and they still had a moist coating to them right out of the can, a coating that actually coated the tongue after a few bites.  Once that happened, I was done until they were baked in the oven atop the casserole.

Be forewarned - this soup has a spicy kick to it, both in the seasonings and in the sausage. As described, this is a hearty soup - thick with pasta, tomato chunks, spinach and sausage - it borderlines being a pasta dish. If you like spicy, you'll love it. Otherwise you'll want to try something else (another favorite is the Progresso creamy Tomato Basil). Also, maybe it's just me but even though these cans say they serve two, this is a hearty meal for one.

The only soup my husband eats is chicken noodle so when I have a craving for different soups since I love soups this brand comes in handy.

It's easy to just heat up a can and serve it.  I usually heat mine in a nonstick skillet- it can stick to other pans a bit.  If that happens, just soak the pan a bit and then it is easy to clean.  I've never tried to put it in the microwave.  Heating it in a skillet will cook a bit of the fat out of it.

I found the price on Amazon to be lower than what I pay in the grocery store, plus it's available in Prime Pantry, so it's super convenient to buy.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

As an adult, I branched out to Wheat Chex, since they seem to have a deeper flavor and are a bit more substantial than their paler counterparts. Plus, they are a healthful food. But what I like best about Wheat Chex is what they add to Chex Mix. I make several batches of this every year around the holidays, and I would never make Chex Mix without the Wheat Chex. No Chex Mix should be without them (unless you're aiming at a gluten-free variety).

It is good news for folks who happen to be on a low salt diet due to high blood pressure or water retention problems, that a 5 oz. can of Premium Tuna Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna In Water, now contains 140mg of salt, instead of the 180mg that it used to contain. My question, is why don't they go even further, similar to the 35mg of salt contained in their "BUMBLE BEE Prime Fillet Solid White Albacore Very Low Sodium in Water".  Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Beyond all that, this Premium Solid White Albacore Tuna is great.  I never have finally decided on whether I prefer it to be packed in water or soybean oil. I dump out the liquid anyway, add Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise, pickle slices, and maybe some salt and pepper, before eating it as a snack right out of the can. I would never eat the recalled stuff, the chunk light tuna. I have always considered the chunk light tuna to be leftover scraps, better used as cat food. I never understood the reason why they cut the amount of tuna from 6 ounces to 5 ounces, as any competitive cost savings on ingredients would eventually spiral down to the level of 1 ounce cans. Anyway, I gave this 5 ounce can of tuna five Amazon stars.  Note: Comparing their Premium Tuna with their more expensive Prime Fillet Tuna, is a story for another day.
1215	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I bought one to try and was really surprised that I liked it.  I think there was 6 crackers and a small tin of tuna salad that was actually good tasting.

Recently my son saw the commercials on TV and asked me to buy it. HE BEGGED for it daily asking each time I came home from the store if they had it in stock. It was awesome timing that Amazon had it FIRST before my local stores. When we received the box my son even ate it for dinner as he loves the crunchiness of the cereal but the best part everyone agrees is the chocolate flavor inside!  It makes the cereal unique and truly makes you want MORE.  We also love the chocolate version of this cereal.

The flavor is thick, beyond my own liking. The snack pack satisfies hunger for a little bit. I almost wanted to rate it three stars, as being "alright," but considering I have no desire to have another, I suppose a two-star "I don't like it" is in order for my particualr review.

2505	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Clam chowder is one of my favorite foods and I have no qualms about calling Progresso a bad clam chowder. It doesn't taste good because it's made from cheap stuff. The taste is pasty rather than rich and savory. When I make my own clam chowder, I use flour and a considerable amount of butter and milk or cream, not soybean oil. Notice in the ingredients list below that cream and butter is less than 1% of this product, which is why this product tastes chalky and bland. It's got the right color, but the wrong taste. The texture is monotonous because it's just the diced potatoes in here that I can taste. Some celery pieces would've given the soup some textural variety. The clam pieces are very few and I don't taste them at all. I don't taste any of the other seafood powder flavorings, so I wonder why Progresso even bothered with them. There's also artificial color in here (white?) and DATEM, which is an emulsifier (keeps the oil from separating out).

These are a great way to extend dishes (like meat-bean-vegetable) taco filling.  Beans are a good source of protein - 7g in 1/2 cup.  This brand tastes good.  One issue to consider, however, is 1/2 cup contains 19% of your daily salt allowance.  That is a lot of sodium.  If it's the only salt you eat all day, it's probably fine.  The company makes a low-sodium variety, so may want to sample that.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

HAIR: For no shampoo and conditioner to cleanse my hair I use no shampoo mix at all, since I make my own shampoo and conditioner. For shampoo I mix water+baking soda, half and half, cold boiled water AND water+organic apple cider, half and half, cold boiled water for conditioner. I do not mix in advance but mix just before jumping in shower. Need to keep it out of eyes completely. It takes few uses for hair to get used to it but the results are amazing. Now that process takes time and effort. For less effort, I mix 2 part organic castor oil, 2 part organic apple cider vinegar and 6 part shampoo. No conditioner, no more of anything other than the mix and sometimes I even add some EVOO or Wheat Germ Oil which is the highest in vitamin E. The effects are so immediate that after applying the mix I feel the effects on my hair immediately in the shower. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with coldest water possible since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. Tweak the mix according to the type, color and length of the hair but always insure to keep the mix away from eyes and scrub the mix on the scalp for the benefits of castor, apple cider on scalp and removal of any residue on hair. I do not shampoo my hair every single day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help. Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.

I find this basically pretty good.  It is not the most delicious microwave popcorn I've ever had, but it is certainly acceptable for a reduced fat product.  It's salty without being overly salty, though there is a fair amount of sodium if you look at the nutrition facts label -- about 10% of your daily recommended maximum.  (You can see the full nutrition facts panel if you zoom in on the product images.)

It arrived nicely packaged in a plastic bag, just in case it leaked, so it wouldn't make a mess on the other products in the box. I'm disappointed and obviously sensitive to one of the ingredients, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad product. It's not good for me. However, if you're looking for a nice lavender smelling soap, you won't find it with this. The smell isn't remotely pleasant. In fact, it smells rancid.

We found Krusteaz products purely by luck; one day we were short on time but had friends coming over, and we wanted to make a nice dessert item that would be good with after-dinner coffee and would make the house smell really nice for their arrival.

She felt it was better than anything more expensive and she's been absolutely correct. My infections are way down and continuing to recede. My skin has actually been less dry and less prone to fluctuations. And my husband's combination of eczema and acne has completely disappeared. Bonus: It's pretty highly recommended by the environmental working group and it's pretty cheap, too. Total all-around win. As long as they never change the formula, I'll never use anything else.

Maybe someday I'll learn to appreciate the nuances, but for now tasty, hearty, convenient, fast and easy meets my criteria and this chili makes the grade.

I have sensitive teeth and generally use toothpastes made for that issue but I bought this for the family and used it several times. It seemed fine to me. My son hated it. He said it tasted awful and didn't whiten his teeth like Crest or other super whitening toothpastes. I use activated charcoal to remove stains and whiten my teeth so I wasn't that worried about whether this paste would get my teeth sparking white. I just wanted a fresh mouth and well maintained teeth and this paste seems to do the job well enough. I prefer other brands for taste and formula but this one seems to do a good job and is often cheaper than other pastes of the same size.

Red Hot Blues chips are zippy, crunchy, fabtacular!  I've had them out at parties and took them to picnics to go with burgers.  They had a whole lotta zest to your meal, but you still get the goodness of the blue corn.  They also make wonderful zesty nachos.  The next thing I want to try them on is a homemade taco pizza.
Too much seasoning
Good price and size.
7789	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	ok
I really like that these oats come in a canister. They stay fresh and I don't need to put them into a container for storage.
When I tried Red Hot Blues for the first time, I knew that I didn't want to do without them. So I put them on subscribe & save right away. Can they be that good? My answer is yes! They are really spicy, but not in a run and get the milk sort of heat that some "red hot" labeled foods get. I like foods with a kick but I am not fond of foods that leave me feeling like I have just scalded myself.
Tried an order from Amazon Pantry to see how it would work out.  I was impressed.  I filled a pantry box to near 100%.  Made sure that the items were a nice mixture of items that would not necessary be packaged together and could be a problem.  All arrived in great condition with no damage.  Chips, cookies, bottled drinks, cooking oil. Snacks, etc. were the type of things that I mixed together.

5176	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	To me it doesn't taste like real/fresh lime juice but most likely because they have to add preservatives or whatever to extend the shelf life but I still like it. I think it tastes like the lucas lime powder candy I used to eat as a kid which is basically the same as "lime beer salt" you buy at stores to add to your beer but this is in liquid form or course.

7856	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Bleh.  I don't like this at all.  I have no idea why this is so popular.  It's only faintly peanut-y, it's far too sweet, and it has an unnatural smooth texture that's more reminiscent of hair conditioner than food.
1529	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great!
2178	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.
4006	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My husband and I started eating brown rice because we are both diabetic and makes our blood sugar spike less.  We love the Lundberg Basmati Brown Rice, but we sometimes have a difficult time getting it locally.  I was very pleased to be able to get it on Amazon Pantry.  It has a subtle nutty flavor and it isn't as mushy as white rice.  We use the brown rice setting of our rice cooker to cook it and it cooks perfectly each time.  I was rather worried that some of our young grandchildren would not like it because they love white rice, but recently we all got together and even the pickiest eaters were going back for seconds on the rice!  We are very pleased with our purchase!

I just made a box this afternoon. I followed the directions. I made 24 (3-inch) cookies and baked them for 10 minutes because I like my cookies brown and toasty with crispy edges.

2945	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Progresso soup used to taste better.  This soup has very few veggies and meat.  It's not even close to what's shown on the can.  Also, I ordered this and other soups thru PrimePantry and the majority of the order was delivered with one or two cans per small box.  One shipment was 16 individual boxes!  Crazy.  Hopefully they had just ran out of larger boxes, and it won't be the norm.  I like PrimePantry, but I'll discontinue using it if they repeat for my recent order.

The ingredients comparison between this Skippy and Peter Pan are pretty simple as well. Personally, I could care less about the type of oil because the absence of soy is a life threatening issue.

I mean, they were an OK substitute when I didn't want to go to the trouble to make homemade mashed potatoes, but they weren't very satisfying, either.  I'd come to the conclusion that no one could make really good instant mashed potatoes -- something about the processing required, etc.

It is a great items to prepare quickly especially when kids drop in and want more than just a potato chip snack. Easy to prepare and the kids all seem to like it. It is also very inexpensive compared to heading out to a hamburger place to get burger for four of five kids. Guess we will continue top keep a  could of cans on hand at all times. Great item.

And they don't go changing it every year, I hate that. This simple, classic recipe is the same as it's ever been, which is perfect because it needs no adjusting.

8117	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	I don't consume a TON of almond milk, so I'm not that worried about a small amount of food grade carrageenan. Still, I wasn't wild about this almond milk. It had an odd color and it was a bit more watery than most I've purchased. It also  had kind of a funny taste. The package said "roasted", but it seemed a bit sour and bitter compared to other brands I've purchased. I used some in blueberry muffins and the taste was kind of off. I probably wouldn't buy this again unless there was no other option.

2962	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Not as crazy about the Beef because it seems more chewey than their kitchen soups. But Progresso really does have that homemade soups. And they are great to eat instead of a real meal for weight.

4368	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I wasn't sure what to expect but what I got was a product that tasted like crunchy paper, no flavor, no salt nothing.  The highlight of the ad stated Almond---no taste of anything almond. They were not pricey but I still felt like I got ripped off of the amount that I did spend. At least I didn't buy more than one box. Wish it had been good, was looking for a snack that had something good for me and tasty.

Future.
I really was not a daily tea drinker until I discovered this at Whole Foods but this is so much more convenient. No additives, no sugar, no sucrose, no harsh acidic taste. I am thinking of Snapple here which is soo addictive but not in a good way since it has some additives which aren't too great for my body. It has Sorbitol in particular which absolutely sends my intestines into convulsions.

9303	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I tried this after using Shout or Oxyclean for a long time.  I wasn't impressed.  My son plays baseball and his pants and shirt are really dirty or grass stained (he plays centerfield).  Shout and Oxyclean do OK but I was looking for something better.  Spray and Wash did a worse job and didn't get out any of the grass stains.  It removed the dirt but the grass stains are the hardest.  I also tried Resolve with no avail either.  Spray and Wash doesn't perform to the standard that Shout or Oxyclean do.  I haven't found that perfect stain remover yet but Spray and Wash is at the bottom of my list.
Good find...

7477	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Now and then I worry about how many dirty hands have used the bar of soap.

5425	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I love this mustard. Although I like the convenience of the squeeze bottle, I don't love the fact that is is plastic and it seems more watery than the Grey Poupon in the jar. I would rather stick with the glass jar, and use a knife!

It's a substantial breakfast that helps keep you going all day.  You just add the oats to water, so preparation is very easy.  They are good in recipes too, like cookies, granola, desert bars, etc.  The instant oatmeal is also sodium free and we use them the same way as the longer cooking version, and it works just fine.

Did you know 1 cookie has over 20% of your daily whole grain target? SWEET.
2603	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Okay, this totally personal preference, so the star rating kind of sucks, I'm sure in equal measure to how much I disliked it there is someone out there who loves it...and they should.  I normally eat very little processed food but as I become more disabled I'm less able to cook, so in an effort to add variety, I picked a bunch of Progresso soups.  This Traditional Chicken and Sausage Gumbo really missed for me.  I kept taking a bite to see if I could figure out what I disliked specifically...I just couldn't make it swallow. I think I narrowed it down to the sausage, and even though there wasn't that much in the can, it had taken over all the other ingredients. I'm not so pampered, and loathe wasting food, I usually just choke it down and make it a point not to buy it again.  But in this case I did the best I could and put the other can in the giveaway bag.  I'm sure somebody else will love it.

Decided the bigger bag was a better value and just poured it in a storage bag inside an empty big coffee container to help protect it and keep it fresh as I don't eat pancakes all that much. As always save the original packaging if you do this. (The reason I mention storage is because it's not good to have pancake mix sitting around in an improperly sealed box or bag for long periods of time. I've had enough bad experiences with mold to feel moved enough to share this here because this is the "family size" package that might end up sitting in your cabinet for a few months at least. I've heard horror stories of people getting sick from mold toxin because just enough moisture slowly built up and mold grew, and it wasn't easily noticeable, probably in part because of the consistency of the powdery medium not being a solid surface like you might notice mold on cheese for example. Knowing what I know about mold, it's probably not all that common, but if the box or bag sits around long enough in a moist climate without being COMPLETELY sealed it might just be enough to allow slow growth of just the wrong kind of mold. What makes the nasty mold dangerous is the toxins it releases over time. So just do yourself a favor and invest in a storage container (or use a big Folger's plastic "can" with a storage bag, like I did) and keep your floury substances away from moisture and storage in a well-sealed container.)

Packaging wise it could use some work. The open-tab opens vertically which doesn't make much sense as you get disoriented from turning it to the side and having the text in the wrong position and may spill on occasion if you are not self aware. The only reason I think it is designed this way is that it discourage you from digging deep into the bag and getting your hands greasy as there is more open space for your hands to reach in. Also upon opening it's hard to re-seal prompting you eat it all in on go.

1560	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I like the convenience of fruit in this size. The only problem is that they are so full of juice it's easy to spill them when you open them. Not a major problem, but I've done it so often even though I know it. I wish they were just  a little less full. The fruit is not quite as good as what comes in the large jars of the same brand.

Ali Julia Review
The last frontier that Kettle needs to reach is sustainable packaging. Im tempted to give them only 4/5 green stars because their packaging is non-recyclable and non-compostable. After all, Sun Chips (a subsidiary of PepsiCo, for goodness sake!) introduced a compostable bag back in 2009. The bag turned out to be hilariously loud but they improved the packaging to make it quieter in 2011. Boulder Canyon, who make really tasty chips, introduced a better compostable bag made from wood pulp. Recently, Oceans Halo began selling seaweed chips (which are very tasty and healthy) in nice compostable bags, also made from wood pulp. So why cant you, Kettle? Hmm? Until you do, Im tempted to curb my cravings for fried potato by making them at home  slice, par boil for 10 min, pan fry in olive oil for 5 min, season. Hey presto!

5201	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I make sure I always have a bottle or two of ReaLime Lime Juice on hand. I have a recipe I make frequently. It's a hot Caribbean chili that calls for lime juice, and ReaLime works well. I also use it when I make lime squares. Another thing Ive done is to add an ounce of this to an eight-ounce glass of ice water, add sugar to taste, and I have a really great lime aid (and a nice summertime treat). This is as good a lime juice concentrate as is available on the market. And the price is right. I cant get it any cheaper than this in the grocery stores.

I like making my own tuna salad, but it doesn't keep as long ,and needs to be refrigerated.  This is the first time I tried the tuna salad snack cup, since I was worried it would taste weird because of the mayo and veggies in it.  I was surprised it tasted so good. It tastes even better if you add some spices to it ( I recommend Old Bay&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Old-Bay-Seasoning-Shaker-2-62-Oz/dp/B00I9VB51U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Old Bay Seasoning Shaker, 2.62 Oz</a>&nbsp;;)  As usual for these types of meal kits, there aren't enough crackers included, so be sure to have some extra on hand.

5346	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Recently, I purchased a Teas' Tea bottle (2 liters) of Golden Oolong Tea at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. It's exactly the same tea as offered here, except for the size of the bottle. Nice tea. Really smooth and mellow. Wonderful taste and a total lack of sweetness plus zero  calories, of course. This stuff is a great relief from all the sweetened drinks, including most available bottled teas. I'm glad to find some in these 2 liter bottles, but the smaller 16.9-ounce bottles would be equally fine. The important thing is to find it!

I've used this ever since I was a kid (although at that time I used it much more regularly) and I've never been regretful about it. It is every bit as gentle as they say it is--no burning sensation in my eyes when I use this to wash my hair. This bottle is a bit larger than other sized bottles of the shampoo which, of course, means it will last you a bit longer and that's great. You really don't need to use to use large amounts of it in the shower to get your hair really clean.

9523	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Fiber One Original since 2001. Back then, we didn't have all these fancy smancy Fiber One cereals like Raisin Bran Clusters and Nutty Clusters & Almonds. Fiber One Original is still king of low calorie, high fiber content cereal.
2216	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Nice. Convenient. Great to take to lunch.
The cereal is quite tasty in my opinion because it is not sweet, has a crunchy texture of a shape that I find appealing, and it is fantastic when served with warm milk and either fresh or dried fruit.  It is a wonderful way to use my frothed milk after skimming the frothiest part into my cup of coffee in the morning.  The cereal then becomes softer, so when I used the heated milk, I tend to use dried fruit instead of fresh fruit.  Fiber One is also delicious in yogurt or even on ice cream instead of fattier nuts.  I have used the cereal in baking with excellent results.  My recommendation is to not limit yourself to consuming the cereal simply with cold milk.  I will also remind you that this is very high in fiber, so beware if you grab it out of the box and lose track of how much you're consuming.  You can have too much of a good thing, as you will likely discover the next day.

A few notes: Wash this sponge with soap and water if you used bleach with it. That way you rinse out the bleach from the sponge before you use it on the next job. If you have any concerns about cookware that you may believe to be delicate, test the scrubbing side of the sponge in an inconspicuous place on the cookware just in case it does scratch the surface. You wouldn't want delicate cookware scratched, now would you? The instructions state that you can sterilize this by boiling it; but I can't comment on that because I never tried that. If you have any concerns about making the sponge sterile consult a doctor or someone who is medically trained.

1814	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I have bought these cookies numerous times but will never buy another Kashi product again. Those ..... downsized the cookies significantly but left the box the same size! When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.
9829	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love it.  Great deal and great product.
3527	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I order from Prime if I can find a comparable product to my grocery in terms of price and ratio in the Prime box (ie. does it fill too much of the box to make the order make sense vs. smaller items) and the ease of having dry foods come to the house directly instead of driving out into town (we are rural).  This item fits my criteria, and it came as it would from the store. Sometimes the boxes get dented because it will take a tumble around the UPS truck, but it's a box... the contents are fine.

9566	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Almost better than candy. I opened a box of this to snack on dry, and it was the first time I have tried it since they changed the box to read "Gluten Free". I was absolutely amazed at how crunchy it was and the taste was just wonderful, slightly sweet, with just a hint of a caramel aftertaste. I think I could probably eat half of a box at one sitting. I have been trying to stay away from cookies and candy, which are a couple of my weaknesses, so for my first week of healthy snacking, I bought the Corn Chex and some baby carrots. At 120 calories per 1 cup serving, even a 2 cup splurge of eating the Corn Chex is less calories and more nutrition than any candy bar. I think sticking to the healthy snacking is going to be a little easier than I thought if I can keep myself from eating the rest of the box of cereal  : )
1122	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	perfect for my lunches
 Then you have a smooth, Cheesy Mashed potato. That tastes very good. As with most packaged meals. The sodium content is high. However, if you are an average person not worried about low-sodium restrictions they are a nice tasting splurge.

It is a bit on the thin side. While the term "hearty" is in the title, I don't think it reaches that mark, with a lot of broth present. The meat, while tasty, is in very small pieces.  The veggies are sparse and somewhat mushy. On the plus side, the potatoes are cut large and are of good consistency -- soft, but not mushy.

4524	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Ive been buying almond milk for quite some time for various reasons. One of the top reasons is because of its shelf life. I don't drink a lot of milk, so a carton of it can last quite a while in my house. I like that I can keep almond milk in my fridge much, much longer than a carton of regular milk (or skim milk, which is what I used to buy in my pre-almond-milk days). And now that I buy many of my grocery dry goods online, I find my trips to an actual supermarket are way less than they used to be, lessening the opportunities for me to pick up a carton of milk. And THEN I discover this same milk I have been buying doesnt need to be refrigerated if it hasn't been opened! There is literally no taste difference than the cold version of this, and I find it lasts just as long once opened, as well. Out of all the brands Ive tried, this is one of my favorites.

2575	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	This soup was extremely salty tasting, so I checked the label.  I wish I had checked the label first!  1380mg of sodium in one meal, if you eat a can of soup for a main meal of the day like I do.  The American Heart Association recommends that the average adult have a sodium intake of 1500mg per DAY, and have no more than 2300mg at the most.

Calories are in a good range at 130 per serving, and a bowl of this soup is filling. There is a "regular" variety of this soup without the high fiber content that is fewer calories still, but I like this one as I have trouble getting enough fiber in my diet daily. This soup will go well with a sandwich and still have a lunch that doesn't threaten the waistline.
Much cheaper than buying them locally at the grocery store

My friend even asked me when I made them for her "Are you sure these are gluten free?" they are THAT good! I also want to point out that mine were not crumbly at all like a couple people mentioned in their reviews here. They are soft and moist like a regular flour cookie.

This variety of Rice Chex cereal contains about 50 % Rice Chex and 50 % Rice Chex coated with cinnamon and molasses. This cereal is good, and makes an interesting snack as well, but like a lot of processed foods, it contains more salt and sugar than what is good for us, with 180mg of Sodium (Salt) and 8g of Sugars. The Fructose and the Canola Oil don't get my votes either. I hate the taste of Canola Oil, and it makes me nauseous. Thankfully, the amount used in this product is minimal. I guess my body is trying to tell me something, -that Canola Oil is not good for me. I get the same feeling after eating anything containing synthetic sugars like aspartame and saccharin. Better living through chemistry? I don't think so. Please, keep it natural and digestible.

6244	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Year ago we started buying just about any tuna that was on the shelves as long as the price was right. Then we started noticing that light tuna seemed to be dark and the taste was strong. So we switched to the Solid White Albacore and found that  most BUT not all cans we actually did receive white tuna. I don't understand why some cans in the same package have such different kinds of meat int eh can. Then what ticked us of even moire was noticing the diminishing size of the cans. Now the same cans are getting so small that if you make a tuna salad it will probably only be enough to serve tow people instead of four. Then to make matters worse the prices have increased in the past few years to where tuna is now becoming a gourmet item at the table. While the Bumble Bee Solid White is better than most it seems that the issues raised prevail in the entire industry.

1939	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	A light and easy to prepare side dish that won't set you back financially.  I often turn this side dish into a main dish by adding shrimp, canned tuna, or chicken breast and some diced vegetables (tomato, asparagus, broccoli, peas, corn), whatever is handy at the time.  It works well when you have a small serving of vegetables left over from the night before which wouldn't be enough for two people, but is too much to throw out (we are empty nesters).  It is easily changed from it's basic flavor to a more robust one by the addition of your favorite spice or herbs.

1809	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This is the first time I've tried Kashi cookies, and I plan to get them again. The cookie is not the same as the picture on the box- there isn't as much fruit, for example- but the taste is pleasant and not as cloyingly rich as other cookies I've tried. If you want a healthy cookie, this may not be the one, I noticed the ingredients label indicated no nutrition. But one cookie is enough for a serving. Another caution is that there are only 8 cookies in a box, but they are double the size of typical cookies.
Mix all ingredients into a very large mixing bowl (reserve the chicken broth).  Once the ingredients are mixed, begin pouring chicken broth into mixture, stirring as you pour.  If you like your stuffing a bit dry, you will need to use less chicken broth.  If you like your stuffing more juicy, you will need to use more chicken broth.  I then season my stuffing/dressing with sea salt, garlic powder and a bit of poultry seasoning.

This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house

This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for "gros sel" something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.

Until my wife bought a three-pound box of Morton Coarse Kosher Salt at our local supermarket I thought that all salt was created equal. I quickly discovered that I had been wrong. This coarse salt can be used as a substitute for table salt. But it really shines as a rub for meats. Because its granules are flat and larger than those of regular table salt, it seems to work into the meat better than does other salt. If you use rubs on meat you'll definitely want to have a box of this on hand.

2655	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Why is this so very white and opaque?  Even pure cream isn't this white and opaque.  I've read about food companies adding nanoparticles -- tiny particles of metal -- to make food appear white, without any evidence that they're safe and without a government requirement to list them on the ingredient label.  That aside, the soup's okay.  The potatoes are good but there's very little clam.  I wouldn't buy it again.

These chips come in bags of 1, 1.5, 2, 8.5 and 13 ounces. It appears that the large size bags have the lowest cost per ounce for the chips. The only problem with the large bags is in trying not to eat all of the chips at once.

7801	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Opened the first packet of this salmon and put it on top of cream cheese and cucumber on a wasa crispbread. The first thing I noticed was the salt...a bit too salty for me.  I've never had seafood in these packets before so was surprised how flattened the fish was...guess there's no way to get around that.  Parts seemed 'dry' and it appeared 'clumpy'.  It had a good salmon taste and smell.  My blind kitty headed right for the smell as I opened the packet...she likes it too.  Pretty expensive for kitty food but nothing but the best for her, she ate the little I gave her, then my other kitty came in to clean up the rest.  I would have rated this higher if it wasn't so salty.  It's convenient and easy to use and for just me eating it, I like the packets better than a can, I just roll the top down and put it in the refrigerator for tomorrow's lunch.

This makes suds very well and has been great at cleaning all the dishes I've tried it on so far.  I had a microwave container with cheese crusted onto it.  I soaked it in soapy water (with this being the soap) for a half hour or so and I was then able to get the cheese right out.  I think this was even easier with Mrs. Meyer's than with Dawn.  It's also been great for cleaning out pots and pans I cooked with; my frying pan is starting to lose its nonstick coating and has been harder to clean, but this helped a lot.

I had quite a mess cleaning everything up. I thought about complaining but figured it would be too much of a hassle to send it all back. I just pitched the few things that weren't salvageable(box products) and of course the soup. So never got to try it. That also makes me hesitate to order another pantry box with food.

It's the most drying soap I have ever seen.  He has SEVERE dry skin on his hands and about a quarter of the way up his forearm - the area he washes when washing his hands.  And it's not just dry skin - it literally looks like he is growing a fine layer of soap in the crevices of his skin.  You feel his skin, and it has an odd...well...soapy feel.  This is just on the hands, but because he washes his hands often during the day (well, when need be...) this is what it causes.  He also uses this soap to bathe with, but since that's just once a day you don't notice a terrible effect.  However, I have run out of body wash a few times and been forced to use his soap before I could get to the store, and it LITERALLY leaves you feeling like you have a layer of soap scum on your skin.  Like you haven't rinsed, even when you have.  Like you need to scrape your skin down with a razor.  Really, it's bad.
7831	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I'm seriously allergic to soy and finding peanut butter without soy has been surprisingly difficult. Most common brands add soy and a lot of the supposed organic brands do as well - this is entirely unnecessary, soy is considered one of the top eight most serious food allergies, like milk and shellfish. So far, Peter Pan has been reliably safe for me to eat and tastes great, but I am glad to find this Skippy Natural is soy free and provides another option.
6386	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is not your usual can of fruit cocktail but rather an interesting can of tropical fruits that may of may not be in that normal can of fruit cocktail. The fruit taste great and are delicious. Great for a change from the regular fruit cocktail.
4509	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I got tired of pouring out a bowl of cereal and opening the refrigerator only to find that someone had used the last of the milk, so I started keeping a container of Almond Breeze in the pantry. The vanilla flavor I think is great with cereal, coffee, and oatmeal. I also keep the unflavored variety on hand for cooking and baking, it has been a lifesaver for situations where I suddenly realize I don't have enough milk for a recipe in progress.

8766	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These sponges are my favorite. I prefer to use sponges when I wash the dishes - I have a dishwasher, but there are few things I don't like to put in there. I like that there is a sponge on one side and scrub on the other; works well for pots and pans. I don't use them to clean my counters because it just seems unsanitary to me - that's my own issue though. I use them on my sinks and bathtubs and I like them for those areas of my home as well. They have never scratched anything I have used them on and I like this brand because it is a little cheaper. My small town only has an overpriced grocery story and a Walmart which is very small and often out of things so I do a lot of my shopping on Amazon. Also because it's a small town with the next closest store being over 1/2 hour away, they can usually get away with jacking up prices so that another reason I shop for things like this online. If you can get it cheaper at a store near you, you should.
3491	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Excellent taste
7445	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love the smell of this stuff. I always buy the lavender to use on my sheets and pillow cases because the smell is very calming and good for bedtime. I prefer this brand because it is all natural. Great smell, natural and not too strong.

8553	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is a great alternative to squeezing lemons for iced tea or in recipes. I use it all the time and I feel the taste of authentic. It's concentrated so just a little packs a punch. I prefer this to real lemons because they're a hassle to cut and squeeze and, if I just need a wedge, I have to figure out a way to keep the rest of the lemon fresh. Hassle. This juice is very convenient and tastes great in my iced tea and also in some recipes that call for lemon juice. Lasts a long time in the fridge.

6509	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I gave this 4 stars because I prefer the homestyle flavor. However, they were not offered in Prime nor were they in Subscribe and Save. The flavor is good and I like these as quick comfort food or a filling breakfast. I add a few more bacon bits and the taste is good for this bacon addict. This is a good value for those of us who do not live near a Costco or Sam's, if someone thinks they can get them cheaper at those stores. I do not have that option, so I am glad these are available on Amazon.

3578	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My mother in law purchased this box of Velveeta Shells(12 ounce, 340 grams)(original creamy cheese sauce and pasta flavor) for my husband and I. My spouse and I cooked these shells with some hamburger meat (around half of the 1.23 pound package that I bought for the first night and the remaining half for the second night) as the sirloin ground beef was cheap and complementary for a hamburger mac and cheese dish.
All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

This mixes very well with low fat cream cheese, some liquid smoke, capers, red onion, and a touch of lemon and worcestershire sauce for an easy bagel spread- or substituting it instead of tuna for many things, including the "fish assistance" boxed dinners :)
I *did* cut the product coupon off the box just in case the chocolate outer shell version is better than the "plain" version.  I have a strong feeling that coupon will expire.

5488	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This is OK in a pinch - It's quick and easy though I don't really like it as a pizza sauce all that much.  It just doesn't taste as fresh as I like my sauce to taste, though I rarely really make fresh sauce.  BUT, it's very good with mozzarella sticks for a quick snack, or as a dipping sauce for a stromboli or pizza roll.
3968	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good, fresh yeast, ideal for bread machine use.  I like to use this when I'm in a hurry; saves a bit of measuring time.  Just be sure to keep it FAR away from any salt in your recipe (salt kills yeast & your bread won't properly rise).  If you use a bread machine, you also want to be sure to not let any liquids (or even butter) touch the yeast, or you'll impede the rise.  This also works GREAT for homemade cinnamon rolls.  I ordered mine through Amazon's Prime Pantry service & the yeast was very fresh & performed well.  A winner!

8983	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Contadina Tomato Paste has been around for as long as I can remember. (And I've been around a long, long time.) I even remember a Contadina ad being spoofed in Mad Magazine in the early sixties (where it was called "Concertina"). So, what does this have to do with the product? Not much, except to say that the same high quality that was there more than half a century ago is still there today. Contadina Tomato Paste has the same rich flavor and the same thickness that it has always had. This is the perfect brand to buy for any dish that calls for tomato paste (or as a way of making tomato or spaghetti sauce a bit thicker and smoother). Moreover, Contadina contains no high fructose corn syrup, an additive found in some tomato pastes, which is certainly an added reason to pick up a can of Contadina next time you go shopping.
1763	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I was so excited to get these but when they arrived I was really disappointed.  I tasted them and they were stale, dry, and crumbly.

In this case just heat and serve and you have delicious bowl of clam chowder with lots of clams and potatoes. About 180 calories per serving and there are two servings in the can.

I've already used it, and threw the majority of the entire can in the trash.  The flavor was not so awful, it was the hard texture of the potatoes that made it bad for me.

9072	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is a quality product. The corn is delicious and has obviously been cared for in the harvesting and canning process. The reason I say this is that all the kernels are close to being the same and I have never found anything inside the can other than good quality corn. It is all bright yellow, prepares quickly and has a great taste. I also don't find a can overfilled with liquid as there is almost all corn in the can.

4890	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Despite having several cake recipes that I will only make from scratch, I am a huge Betty Crocker fan for basic white or chocolate cakes.  I enjoy the tender moistness of the pudding added and the directions on the back are clear and easy to read.  Beyond those basic instructions, I find their mixes to be very versatile if you choose to substitute liquids such as milk, coffee, or sour cream for the water or desire to add other ingredients.  With the milk chocolate variety, I find that stirring in finely chopped chocolate chips & almonds makes a delightful cake.  The real trick to the best result is to ALWAYS set your timer for 5-10 minutes less than the minimum time for the size you are making.  Test for doneness by appearance (pulling from the sides of the pan) and then touch or toothpick at the center.  You can always cook a little longer if needed but you cannot "uncook". More than 40 years of cake baking has taught me that most cakes are already overdone by the time the minimum time stated has elapsed.

This boxed Bumble Bee "Snack on the Run!" comes in a box containing a zip-top small can with 2-3/4 ounces of tuna fish salad, 6 "buttery" round crackers, and a small plastic serving spoon. This tuna salad flavor is distinct from the other Bumble Bee flavors by the addition of garlic & onion, rosemary, and sea salt. The tuna salad also has mayonnaise, celery, and water chestnuts to add a crunch to some bites, all of which tastes very good. This is a snack, not a meal, but it packs a fat, protein, and carb punch.

6105	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I was extra excited to get these on subscribe and save. Idahoan are the only instant potatoes I can find without wheat ingredients. And these ones are my favorites, but all the other flavors are really good, too. You can even see the red skins -- add a microwaved potato for "lumps" and no one will know these are instant. They are that good. The bonus is that you only have to add water -- not water, milk, etc. Just 2 cups of boiling water and butter if you like, but they don't really need it. The parmesan and garlic flavor is subtle and really good. You can dress them up or just eat as is. We do both. One of our favorites is to make the potatoes as directed and spread in the bottom of a greased pan, then sprinkle with cheese and add 6 raw scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper etc. on top and bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes. Makes a great breakfast casserole. Also good on top of a bowl of chilli or stew.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

6176	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	When I was a kid (a long long time ago) all you could buy was tuna packed in oil. At some point some genius said why not pack it in water. Tuna in a can has never been quite the same since. I bought this type in oil to feed a high protein treat to my cats on an occasion. My fussy kitties though seem to prefer the tuna in water version better. While this version is less expensive, the oil has to be drained off first before serving it, which is a messy, smelly process. With the tuna in water the cats also love to lick-up the water broth. No need to drain it. The water version tastes so good to me that it's almost too good to waste on cats. But I think in the future I will pay the extra cost for the packed in water version. Bumble Bee makes a premium product no matter which version you buy.

That is fine with me because I just like the clams for some flavor and a bit of chew.  Can't be easier..pop open can, heat and serve.  Oh, and this has flavor, not bland and insipid
Cons:
If I had to nitpick, my only criticism would be the decision to list the nutrition info based on 2.5 servings.  Seriously?  How is that helpful for anyone other than maybe a couple with one young child who would eat that half serving?  I don't understand why they don't just list it as two servings and adjust the nutrition accordingly so I don't have to do mental math.

5701	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a big cracker eater, perhaps because it's too tempting to eat the entire box at once. However, from time to time I buy some crackers. And when I do my first choice is Wheat Thins. They've been on the market for such a long time. I remember eating them at least 40 years ago. (I also remember that shortly after they came out Sandy Duncan was a spokesperson for them. She extolled the virtues of Wheat Thins while standing in the middle of a wheat field.) Today they have the same great flavor they had back then. They have a rich and slightly sweet wholewheat flavor, and remind me a bit of a honey wholewheat bread that I've made on occasion. With just a tad of saltiness, they're not overly high in sodium. All in all, they're a great tasting cracker.

It's got the sugars I need running, although the numbers aren't off the chart.  As the label shows, for an 8 oz serving it's only 130 calories, 5 mg sodium, and 30 grams (just over an ounce) of sugars.  On a hot day it's great slushy, almost frozen.  I've never experimented with any cocktail recipes, but that would probably be interesting as well.

To be honest, with the name, "Cheesy Tuna Melt", my hopes were not high.  I expected some bland tuna goo in a bland cheese sauce bath.  What I actually discovered was a totally pleasant surprise . . . . This is what I would have called a very, very good tuna salad.  Well seasoned with a pleasant tartness an identifiable morsels of tuna, celery, cheese, water chestnuts and so forth.  Very tasty.  I piled it high on each of the six crackers and still had a little left over (which I finished off using the little spoon).  This served as my lunch - I always prefer a very light lunch and this was just perfect for me.
3762	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Ok, this was a bit of a disappointment to me. I don't know why I thought these would be so much better than they were. It comes with tortillas, cheese and seasoning. I make tacos a lot so I have a HUGE taco seasoning from one of the wholesale clubs on hand. Basically all this kit gave me was four tortillas, and some cheese (I prefer to fresh grate cheese anyhow). This was my fault, should have read the package better but if you are a regular cook, you probably have most of the items they give you on hand already, save yourself a lot of money and just buy a big pack of tortillas yourself. You have to buy the meat, sour cream, taco sauce, salsa and tomatoes anyhow for this.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

The chips may be quite good, but I write this 1 star review to point out that ordering chips through PrimePantry may not be the smartest thing to do until they figure out how to package things appropriately. I would also encourage Hain Celestial Group to hold Amazon accountable for poor placement in the PrimePantry box.

INSTRUCTIONS: First you must get your skillet up to heat and then brown the rice for about 3 minutes using butter or margarine. You can't walk away from this step - it requires constant stirring. Next: add water, the flavor packet and bring it to a full boil. Finally put a cover over your skillet and reduce the heat to a simmer and wait about 20 minutes while you simmer it COVERED.

Other than that, I don't know if they are particularity useful for nausea... some people thing so ... I've not found that to be true... but I wouldn't be afraid to try these if that is an issue for you.  For those that are interested, this are not made in the USA... they are made in Indonesia.

These chips come in bags of 1, 1.5, 2, 8.5 and 13 ounces. It appears that the large size bags have the lowest cost per ounce for the chips. The only problem with the large bags is in trying not to eat all of the chips at once.

The chews have a strong ginger bite, and sweet, but not syrupy sweet. Each chew is powder coated so it doesn't stick to the packaging. I keep a couple of them in my purse and car. They are great for folks that get a bit motion sick, as ginger is known for its stomach calming properties. Each chew is about they size of a small tootsie roll and is 20 calories.

9429	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Honestly, I am normally an Oxi-Clean Stain Remover kind of momma because other than me it's an all male household. Clothes normally never make it through a half day without some kind of mess. With that said, there was a great Prime Pantry deal so I scored a bottle of this. It works well on lighter stains, but anything set in or heavy duty I'll just stick with Oxi. I did find it works well with carpet stains, I pretreated with it before I ran my carpet machine over. So overall, wouldn't recommend for laundry but great for carpet spot treatments.

They aren't as good as fresh made mashed potatoes, but they are very good.  Potatoes just dry so easily, and so does milk.  They are maybe a tad bit salty, and I find we need 2 packs for a family of 3 with 2 guys that love their potatoes, but it's a good product and Amazon's price is competitive with what I find in my local stores.

My only complaint is I was buying this for 4.99 a bottle and now they are over ten dollars! I understand prices might go up but it is now over twice as much. I can't justify buying it at the higher price.

You'll want to transfer them into a suitable container as you open each 4-pound bag, since the bags don't pour or seal very well.  There are 2 bags in the box.  These must be packaged for food service, as it says "not for retail sale" on the box.  The ones I got are best if used by about 18 months from receipt and actually should be good for 8-12 months after that.

But this stuff.... I mistakenly poured out about a third of a new bottle opening it, it pours like a thin salad dressing, nothing like the original stiff dijon that had a little thickness to it, more than a little viscosity. this stuff's got a singular bland and slightly unappetizing color, nothing like the original.

2416	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	The Dole Fruit Bowls are perfect for adding fruit to lunches in a handy small 4 oz. container. The top just peels off and voila you have delicious fruit in a bowl. It is handy for long car rides, camping, and school lunches. They match the description to a "T". Packaging and shipping were also deserving of an "A".
8036	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful crispy, crunchy, almost no flavor, but that is ok, the chips are for dipping good stuff on top of them

a Can of tomato paste and a onion will get you miles of flavor past this dreck.
6043	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I generally HATE instant mashed potatoes. They are usually gritty, and lacking flavor. These are nothing like that. Since trying this brand of instant potatoes, I rarely make homemade mashed potatoes because these are too easy and too tasty. I do use milk rather than water and generally add a little extra butter or olive oil. I have tried various flavors, and they are all great. I am sold.
5256	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great tea; You should buy some as green tea is the best tea for you!!!

6397	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Eating plain or with cottage cheese is great
Let me just say these are very tasty! Rip the pouch open and the aroma of herbs stir the senses as it is blended into the water.  Let it sit for a minute...it really does help to stir until moist and let set a moment.  If you are having company or if presentation is important to you, I recommend that you scoop out the mashed potatoes from your mixing bowl and place in a clean bowl.  This prevents others from seeing that you reconstituted them with water.  LOL  They really look like the hand mashed potatoes and taste smooth and creamy.

3813	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Stand up taco shells are much easier to fill, and these are also good quality.  We live 75 miles from Mexico, and so we know tacos.  These are good pre-made shells.  Yes, sometimes we fry tortillas, but these are easy, instant, and convenient.

9632	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	One of the best tasting cereals out there with high fiber content.  A one cup serving provides almost HALF of your daily recommended fiber intake.  Since my bowl usually contains more than just one cup, I am fairly confident I am actually getting more than half. It stays crispy-crunchy in milk and the little clusters of oaty stuff give a really nice texture.  You cannot even compare this to the original "Fiber One" that was like eating a bowl of twigs that would have made better kindling for a fire than it did as a breakfast cereal.
6723	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love it! Having this year round is wonderful. We used to think of cranberry sauce only at Thanksgiving, but I do enjoy having it year round. The price for this is great. This is a delightful buy!

8699	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	They could improve on them, but for now, they are the best out there on the market.  I say they could improve because it seems that the blue scrubby side doesn't seem to last very long; at least not as long as it used to.
8292	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Very good quality albacore. Only a little water in the can so I feel like you get a good amount of product. I didn't eat this myself (vegetarian) but the person I made the tuna melt for said it was the best canned tuna he's had.

After everything has been mixed, place stuffing contents into your two pans.  I normally use two 8 1/2 x 11 inch aluminum throw away pans.  Cover with aluminum foil and cook for 30-40 minutes at 375 degrees.  Remove the aluminum foil for the last ten minutes.

Cornbread is ready in a few minutes. This cornbread is often used as a side for my hamburger vegetable soup, however, since Thanksgiving is this week, I thought I would also post my cornbread stuffing mix recipe.

The cardboard the bottles sit in is soaked, the plastic is sticky, the shipping box bottom is soaked also.

9861	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	In an effort to get my kids (6 and 2) to eat a little healthier, I purchased a few organic items and Earth's Best items from Amazon Pantry. My son and daughter absolutely LOVE these, but in my opinion, they are a little small. They are almost half the length of similar products (i.e. Nutri Grain bars), and almost double the price... so they were gone within 2 days.

The liquid cheese is the key..Im sure of it!  I adore this mixture and try to have it in my pantry at all times as a side for dinner.  I highly recommend it.  I haven't seen any no name brands with the liquid cheese option but, I think either way I'd stick with Velveeta for my yummy mac and cheese nights.

I've used many different brands of soaps, and this ranks at the bottom, in my opinion. I'm especially surprised how much it irritates my hands. So badly that I actually had to use cortisone cream on them. I know my skin is sensitive and often dry in the cold, winter months. That's why I like using natural soaps, especially this time of year. Yes, it cleans and suds up nicely. I don't like how much it irritates my hands, though.

These crunchy chips are real taste treats. All in all, these snacks are pretty nutritious, too. Organic whole grain kernels, no genetically modified ingredients, gluten free, and a high rating from ChefsBest. Daily allotments: saturated fat only 3%, Trans fat--0 grams, cholesterol at 0,  sodium at 6%, carbohydrates at 6%, and fiber at 8%. Not bad numbers for snacks.

  -  Let the batter rest for several minutes to allow the flours to absorb the moisture.  I always do this when baking gluten free and it makes a world of difference, it cuts out the gritty texture because the flour grains have had a chance to soften up from swelling with moisture and fat.

The second cookie, I was, "Oh, this isn't so bad." By the third cookie a few days later, it seems my tongue acclimated to this texture and could appreciate this for what it is: a healthier cookie.
The Bad: Know that despite the cylinder pictured, this will come in a large box with two plastic bags inside. If you have a large containers to pour these into like we do, this won't be an issue, but I imagine it would be difficult to use straight out of the bags.

I love my Lays, but this brand is even better because the chips are thicker.  There's also something else about them that make these taste more superior.  I can't pinpoint it, but maybe it is just the thicker, crunchier texture.  (This brand is supposed to be healthier, perhaps that's it?)  Whatever it is, they are um, um, finger licking, good.

Nowhere as good as canned tomatoes like LaValle, but I do care about the Biphenyl lining in the cans and I want organic non-GMO tomatoes, so these fit the bill. I also use their whole peeled PLUM tomatoes. Most plum tomatoes today are "Plum Shaped" which means the use regular round tomatoes and shape them by machine. How pathetic is that?  Muir Glen stopped using Bi Phenyl BPA lining in the cans of it's tomato products back in 2010, but they now use vinyl. I have NO idea what kind of vinyl as of yet, but am looking into it. So, for now, at least I know I'm not getting BPA's and GMO tomatoes. The taste is GOOD!

Second and third, they reduced the net weight and increased the price.  Amazon price is twice supermarket price and supermarket price was increased.

This has become my new favorite hand soap! I have it at every sink in my house now. The scent is perfect...some reviews commented it was strong and one even said made them nauseous. I don't find this to be the case. The scent is a normal strength to me, and after washing my hands are lightly scented for the next few minutes. The lavender soap, however, made me very nauseous when I used it. I even use the honeysuckle multi-surface spray and dish soap now. I will say my hands are sometimes dry after washing, however this is probably due to the fact that I was my hands all the time now! I like the scent that much...I actually look for reasons to wash my hands.
4036	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I like this brand, the product is made in California and they are very transparent about their products.

The stuff you get in the supermarket is usually cut in perfect shapes that actually hold together which is another benefit.  Quite often I've had HORRIBLE cornbread over the years, which tastes like stale breadcrumbs, so luckily this Krusteaz honey-flavored cornbread is an improvement over most other brands.  Consider yourself very lucky!  I can only imagine how many people had to eat terrible tasting cornbread back in the 50's and 60's.  Wouldn't have been me, I can tell you that much.

5733	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I have bought this many tines but never on Amazon.  The oats are always fine, a reliable brand, and the price was average.  I can't rate the quality of this particular one though.  I made the mistake of ordering a couple of boxed food items with some other supplies in Prime Pantry.  I usually don't do that but I have always been happy with Amazon packing and shipping.  Unfortunately there simply wasn't enough packing material to keep items from tipping over and shifting around and glass cleaner tipped over onto the oats and leaked.  And I don't understand why the oats weren't placed in the other side of the divider with the other box of food which suffered no damage.  Personally I don't think Amazon should allow us to order chemicals and cleaning supplies together in the same box as food items.  I know I won't do it again and take partial responsibility.  I did file a packing complaint and I threw out the contaminated oats.

They use 100% green energy (either on-site solar and wind or through credits); convert all of their waste oil to biodiesel; had the first LEED gold certified (i.e. green) manufacturing plant in the U.S.; support various efforts from wetland conservation to hunger relief.

There are about half of these regular ones and then the others are the regular chex with a chocolatey powder sprinkled generously on them.  The milk becomes chocolatey quickly, and the chocolate chex also keep a lot of the chocolate on them.  If you like chocolate cereal or cereal that turns the milk chocolatey, you'll like this.  The flavor is a nice chocolate taste.  Not too sweet.  Just right.

I mean, for kettle cooked chips they are actually kind of reasonable.  These are the BEST chips for personal snacking, and nothing else comes close.  Could you use them for parties?  Well i guess... but why would I?  i mean they are not really dipping chips, and to be honest I don't want to share them.

8111	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	From start to finish, preparation is quick and easy.  It looks like rice, but it has a chemical taste that I just cannot get past.  It's essentially MRE rice packed under a name brand.  Great item for an emergency, but I wouldn't keep it around for anything beyond that purpose.  Personally, I will be sticking with the minute/quick rice varieties.

1006	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I can't imagine whose bright idea it was to ship a box of seventy-two packages of potato chips IN THE SAME PACKING BOX as TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS of cornmeal, but I would like to give them a a high five for their gift to me of an experience I won't be likely to forget soon. I don't know if it was the crushed potato chip box, or trying to lift the box with twenty-five pounds of cornmeal off the potato chip carton without crushing the few bags of chips that remained that was the more memorable of the long-lasting pleasures of unpacking those chips/cornmeal. Several chip bags had totally blown out, and some of the bags that were somewhat intact had been rocked by the cornmeal box on top of it until the chips resembled crumbs more than chips. On the pages describing Kettle Chips, the customer is alerted that the chips must be shipped separately from any other item in your order. Easy to understand why.

9390	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	It's probably a combination of being a young guy and having an active lifestyle. . . but every time I wash my clothes I find new stains that need to be removed. Simply washing them with detergent often isn't good enough to remove them completely, but using this spray in conjunction with the normal washing seems to do the trick. How effective it is definitely depends on how long you pre-treat it for, the type of stain you have and how much of the product you use. Even if I manage to avoid staining my clothes with the food I've eaten, kept them from getting any grass/dirt stains my shirts always have a ring around the collar. A quick spray with this before throwing it in the wash seems to do a great job at helping it out and making sure that my clothes look good the next time that I wear them.

Also, the palm oil in this peanut butter may or may not be ok. I am happy that it is not canola oil. However, there is nothing stating that it is expeller or cold pressed, and that does make a huge difference. Oils heated to high heat become rancid, resulting in the release of free radicals in the body. The beneficial properties are lost, and these types of oils can cause various types of disease. Generally, when the oils are cold and expeller pressed, the product would state such.

The mix is slightly sweet and moist. I used the directions for high altitude. And, because I was using a dark tin muffin pan adjusted the temperature down to 395 degree instead of 400, and reduced the cooking time to 18 minutes instead of 20 and they were perfectly cooked. It is easy to overcook the batter and end-up with a dry crumbly result, so I always test with a bamboo skewer when it a few minutes before bake time is complete.

In any case, I started using them as little rewards when the boy would do something right, as desert after a meal and as a sprinkling of things in his cereal. He just loves marshmellows. I try to keep the "candy" content of his diet down to a minimum, so I switched over to the smaller miniature marshmellows. He barely noticed. In any case the Kraft brand is excellent. They're nice and tasty and fresh. Perhaps with the next pack I'll try some of the flavored varieties.

Dump in a can or two of tuna into the soup and heat. Pour over the cooked rice. We think it is delicious. I use this tuna for casseroles, sandwiches, salad on top of tomatoes. That is yummy.

The problem is consistency. Sometimes the tuna is in solid chunks and looks white-absolutely great. Sometimes it looks like it has been chewed up and put in water.

The only time I buy actual lemons is if I need the zest for something, or if I plan to make fresh brewed iced tea. Other than that, I buy it by the bottle because when I put lemon juice in a fruit smoothie, youd never be able to discern whether or not it was fresh or bottled lemon anyway. Or at least my taste buds cant!

When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.

6651	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I'm always looking for new stuff to take with me for lunch at work, and Dole Mandarin Oranges are fabulous for so many reasons. They have a clean, "bright" flavor that adds so much to yogurt with chopped walnuts, cold diced chicken with a touch of dressing, or just plain on its own. Not fattening and they keep me away from the cookies and candy always on the table in the break room. Amazon delivery makes it easy to stock up, and the price is just about what I have paid in the supermarket here. I even sent a "goodie basket" using Prime for a friend in another state when they were a bit under the weather. Definitely recommended!

5309	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I have a set of four expensive storage containers. They don't leak. They do fine in the microwave. They do great in the dishwasher. They also cost about 6 times what these cost. I am budget conscious, and those were a gift. I lose lids. I bring dishes somewhere and then forget them. These storage containers are prefect for me because they are cheap and get the job done. Do they leak? Sure, sometimes. Do they work well in the microwave? Not particularly--they will heat in the microwave but doing so for too long seems to badly warp them. I am guessing it can also melt them. They work in the freezer. They can go into the dishwasher. Eventually the lids warp, but it's not a big ordeal for what I use these for (mostly storing fruits and vegetables for my kid to bring to school). You get what you pay for, and these are great for the budget conscious.
4107	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	These rice cakes are healthy in that they are organic and not filled with a lot of processed junk. They don't have much fiber at all and no discernable amount of vitamins as they are not enriched. They taste fine for what they are. I generally like the sweeter rice cakes as a healthy snack but I bought these to use as a sort of bread replacement. I put tuna or a few slices of turkey breast on one and the crunch is a great way to slow me down and actually get me to chew and enjoy my food. I usually eat super fast and don't even taste what I am eating. I like these but will probably see if they offer any sweetened ones like apple. I prefer them as a snack. Although they aren't packed with vitamins or fiber, they also aren't packed with a lot of chemicals so it's a good trade off in my mind.

It's exactly the same product as offered here, but just in a bigger bottle. I had a large glass with my evening meal at room temperature. It's quite good that way, but I'll later put it in the fridge for chilling and I like it even better chilled. This is just excellent tea! It's light and smooth and goes down so easily. I much prefer the unsweetened teas and they can be a bit hard to  find. As long as I can get these Teas' Tea varieties, I'll be happy.

8201	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	In the UK or Ireland we are well used to strongly flavored salt and vinegar chips (or crisps as we would say) and its nice to see Kettle bring out a bold version here. The vinegar punch is so strong that some people may be put off, but many will love them. The good thing about them being so strong is that I end up eating only a few at a time :) It would have been nice if they used a more interesting type of vinegar than white distilled  malt vinegar, unfiltered vinegar, or even cider apple vinegar would have been interesting. But even white vinegar can have health benefits if taken in moderation  its a very strong preservative / antimicrobial agent for one thing. These chips may just cure your sore throat!

Although I expected the Kashi Cookies Oatmeal Raisin Flax to be individually wrapped, they were not.

To cut down on calories and sugar, I only use a spoon of strawberry preserve or some other kind of jam. For texture, I add chopped walnuts.

I did not have many unpopped kernels.  There were a few.  However, I did overcook this the first time...  I can't say how long you should let it pop because that will vary based on your microwave.  (For me, the ideal time was around two minutes.)  I would strongly recommend staying in the room so you can hear the rate of popping, though.  There was a fair amount that got stuck in my teeth, so if you have problems with that, you may want some floss or a toothpick or something similar handy.

1178	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect for a light lunch for me in this nice summer weather.  No fuss, no muss and quite tasty.  Perfect portions for dieting.  I eat half one day, then just add some crackers and finish up the next day, i.e., that's just sixty-two cents a serving (of course, I must have a scoop of ice cream, as a "tea time" treat for me and my furry baby! mid-afternoon).  But, seriously, highly recommend.  It's got onions, carrots, water chestnuts mixed in and doesn't get 'wet' - my homemade always gets yucky if I don't eat it all at once; then if I share with my dog (she loves fish!) I can't put garlic/onions in it and it's kinda blah).  So, this if perfect for me.  I, shamefully, will order twenty-thirty at a time in my prime pantry box so I have plenty in stock.

883	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I purchased the Jalapeno flavored ones and I don't even like HOT potato chips, but I wanted to try them for such a good price.  Anyway, to my amazement they are not that hot as long as you keep eating them.  Once you stop your mouth feels the burn, but you really can't tell while eating them at all.  And the flavor is really good.  They are not just hot chips with no flavor that's why I went through all six (6) bags in one day :(  And I just ordered some more for next months subcribe/save.  They are good, believe me....addicting good!
I like that they are crisp and not very sweet. They have a nice cinnamon flavor. In my own experience they are a satisfying snack that doesn't alter my morning test numbers the way some other choices have.

6874	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff and would eat it all the time if I could! It is so delicious! Let's face it everybody loves Ritz crackers because they have been around for ages! This makes snacking on the go super convenient and easy. The crackers tasted just like your normal and classic Ritz crackers which still have that same great taste. The cheese is very smooth, firm, but kind of creamy all at the same time! The little snacks come with their very own red stick, which allows you to dip into the chees and spread it onto the crackers. What a neat way to have everything you need in one container for a great value. I wanted to test out how the pack would do if I put them in the refrigerator, so I did it and found out that it does make the cheese a bit firmer. However, it makes the cheese cool and I think that is just your own personal preference on how you want to eat it. Either way, they are a quick and easy snack!

It won't stop us from eating it but less often because of this harmful ingredient.  Corn syrup has been shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetis and also is harmful to the lining of arteries.

2248	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	These taste good, but I was disappointed in the consistency of these very small tidbits.  They are very firm, almost crunchy, as if taken from pineapple that wasn't quite ripe.  I prefer my pineapple a bit softer.  These are, of course, very handy for a lunch bag or when you need just a few pieces for something (such as pizza topping) and don't want to open a larger can or deal with a whole pineapple.  They are very well sealed and I've never had a problem with one leaking in my lunch bag.  I've been trying to include more fruits and vegetables in my diet, and these make it really easy to have a single serving of fruit always on hand.
3195	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	My husband and I have always loved the Progresso Soups, especially the Tomato Basil and the Chicken Enchilada but I can't find the latter anywhere, nor the Tomato& Basil even on Amazon.

7322	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I really like the smell of this soap, and I feel like it works well. My S.O. thinks it doesn't make enough suds, but I think that's probably due to the lack of sulfates, which I'm considering a win.

2999	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the Alfredo chicken and penne flavor and was surprised when I poured it into the bowl. There was a LOT of sauce and not a lot of solid food coming out. After warming it up, I noticed it had absolutely zero chicken in it. It was pasta and sauce, a litle bit of onion and that's it. The flavor was pretty good and the overall tase of my "vegetarian" soup was fine but don't put "chicken" on the label, put pictures of chicken on the label and then give the consumer no chicken. I went to a second location, bought the same product thinking it might be a fluke. Nope..second can. No chicken.

In any case, one of the items were four packs (8 ounces each) of Pacific Organic Almond Low-Fat Vanilla milk. Well, that was great. I've had this brand before and it was excellent. So I bought a four pack. I enjoy them very much. They have a mild vanilla flavor and are only 70 calories per 8-ounce serving. Plus, they're the perfect snack size for my little boy (4).

6544	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Sun-Maid raisins are, without a doubt, the best brand of raisins on the market.  This story I'm about to share is entirely true- I bought a pack of Sun-Maid raisins and they lasted well over two years.  That was a 6-pack of the small portions sold in tiny cardboard boxes with a strip of plastic around them.  If they can last that long in cardboard, imagine how long they'd last in this 20-ounce container?  Even after 2 years, the raisins only got slightly hard but were still totally edible.  Sun-Maid is clearly the best raisin company in the entire world!  They can keep raisins fresh for years.  It's amazing that I never got the idea to mix raisins with Wheaties.  I imagine the taste would be such an improvement (because let's face it, Wheaties are dry and bland the way they are) that I wouldn't know what to do with myself, haha.  Please pick up these Sun-Maid raisins and enjoy the inevitable freshness.

(I have dyed my hair red and if you have ever done so, you know how fragile it is and how readily it wants to wash out.)  It also works magic in the nether regions, completely replacing Summers Eve wash in my shower, my husband loves using it too.

Jasmine green tea is not for everyone, but if you like the subtle floral flavoring and the lack of sugar sweetness, then this might be a tea to try.  I enjoy this tea over ice better than straight from the bottle and it is best drunk nice and cold.  I have had other Ito En teas and I like that they are just tea and lack all of the added sugar, but it can take getting used to if you tend to drink the sweetened teas available out there.

This time I tried the Soft Tacobake and was not disappointed with it either. Very fast meal that tastes great.

3537	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	If you're gonna make Macaroni and Cheese from a box, this is the way to go.  Velveeta Shells and Cheese can be prepared very quickly and has a very creamy taste.  That's because you're actually using the cheese sauce Velveeta is famous for and not that powdered stuff common with other boxes.  You will only need to boil water, put the shells in and cook until tender.  Once you drain the water, squeeze in the cheese and (I recommend) let it set for a few minutes, so the cheese can set.  I also enhance the flavor a bit by adding some sharp cheese.  I can't make enough for my preschooler.  We all love it!

 The bottom line: Caution! These are addicting. The white Gold-Bear is Pineapple; the green Gold-Bear is Strawberry; the yellow Gold-Bear is Lemon; the orange Gold-Bear is Orange; and the red Gold-Bear is Raspberry. Haribo has perfected the gummy bear. There is no dispute on that. Each flavor is different, but can be eatten at the same time. These can be described as soft but not too soft.

1796	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I tried these cookies a year ago and I got hooked on them very quickly. The reason I like this brand (kashi) and flavor (oatmeal dark chocolate) of cookie is because they are not too sweet but they satisfy the need for a chocolatey/sweet treat in a healthier way. They only have eight grams of sugar per cookie and each one has 2 grams of protein and a healthy amount of fiber. The cookies are large, so one cookie is sufficient, just take your time to enjoy it! The chocolate tastes good. You should know that they are a little dry. They aren't crunchy dry, and it's not a negative comment either, it's just a good idea to have your favorite beverage nearby to wash them down with! It is a cookie with some body to it - it's a hearty treat. Everyone I have shared these cookies with - family and coworkers - all gave them a thumbs up.

They will swarm it and grub, (fight all instincts to bust out the flame throwers and send them to Hades,) let them eat to their hearts content.  They will take it back to their home and queen and share as they do and then the magic happens.  The Borax slowly poisons them and you never see them again!

4133	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Bought this since Thanksgiving was upon us & was expecting the crowd.  I've used it many, many times before but thought the convenience of having it shipped to my door would help.  All the family loves it as corn bread since it has a hint of sweetness & it goes great as an ingredient in stuffing.  It's cheaper than the grocery & free shipping helped it cost even less as well as being convenient.

Saran Wrap is easy to use.  It's cutting bar cuts the wrap smoothly and the end of the wrap is easy to remove from the roll, doesn't get all sticky and impossible to remove like on some other brands.  Some of the comments mention that Saran Wrap does not cling, but I have never had this problem when using this wrap at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the microwave.

My picky two year old would live off fruit and chicken noodle soup if i would let her. When it comes to annies shells in white cheddar though there is never an argument. I love it as a mom too because they don't use ant artificial flavors or colors. It has always grossed me out how florescent orange some of the other brand named boxed pasta sauces are. not this one.

7473	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	excellant
4675	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I use these tomatoes to make homemade sauce & they are a great substitute for fresh tomatoes. There are no skins or seeds, just pure crushed tomatoes to make a delicious sauce for pasta. I also use this with chicken breasts, mixing the crushed tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes, chopped peppers & mushrooms & pouring it over the chicken & baking. Then I melt parmesan cheese over the top- delish! Muir Glen is a good company that doesn't use Calcium Chloride, & their cans are BPA free.
6736	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	II love cranberry sauce. Ocean Spray is the only brand I'll buy because other brands just don't taste the same. Can't eat mashed potatoes without my cranberry sauce and I recommend it highly.

The one ounce bags are great for children or if you want portion control with your snacking/meals habits. This product is great for kids lunches as it's just the perfect amount without overdoing the calories/fat/salt intake and will teach kids proper portion control.

8429	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	It's real lemon juice - as advertised! The tiny bottle is enough to make quarts of lemonade. Dissolved a half to a full cup of sugar in warm water - squeeze half the bottle into the pitcher - stir and serve over ice!

5362	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My favorite tea of all time even beating my old standby Constant Comment. All of these Ito En Teas are great. I also love the rose tea in this line but this is redolent of the finest jasmin both in scent and flavor. I have this on the monthly delivery plan but I also buy it in between deliveries as this is my daily fix which I look forward to. How do they get that amazing tea flavor, aside from the heavenly jasmin?
5215	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	This is not good quality tea or even as good as tea you get at a fast food restaurant. I bought this at a upscale grocery store in my area so surprised the taste was "funky" like a bad taste to it I couldn't quite put my  finger on.  A friend of mine came by an saw what was left of it in my fridge, which was most the bottle, and I told them go ahead an have it if they liked it, as I didn't.  They took two sips and made the same conclusion, they didn't like it either.  They said it tasted like it had been made with low quality water, as in unfiltered - even dirty tap water!  Maybe that was the unpleasant under taste I could not identify?
2967	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Arrvd on time & well pkd.  You can't beat these  chilled, drained & tossed in. A salad!!
3541	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This is an easy side dish for nights we grill burgers or steaks.  The cheese sauce is very good and makes a thicker sauce than that powdery stuff.
7925	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Ahhh, naturel #2
1798	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	These taste great and have healthy ingredients.  The 4 star is because there were only 8 cookies in the package.  These aren't binge cookies anyway, but for the price for 8 cookies, you get the drift...


7867	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Another of my yummy snacking chips! No, I don't "snack" all the time, but great for that and again, goes well with soups and salads. Is a thin chip, so careful if the dips are thick & heavy! May need to spoon the thicker dips on them, but they are GOOD!

7584	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Nice.
3976	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Mainly I think this product is good value.  Also, there is an advantage to getting active dry yeast as opposed to cake yeast.  It has low moisture content, giving it longer shelf life.  The shelf life of active dry yeast is 2 years from the package date, but it's advisable to use it within a year.  If frozen, it can last for over 10 years.  The main disadvantage is that it's more vulnerable to thermal shock than other baking yeasts.
6768	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	cheap on amazon and great for the kids that like a quick snack

Sure, homemade chili is superior to anything out of a can if you are going to sit down and eat a big ole bowl of it-- but this is great for using in recipes.  And with freshly chopped onion and some grated cheddar, it is actually quite tasty when eaten straight from the can (after heating it, of course).  It is the perfect consistency for making homemade chili dogs, or coneys as some folks call them.  It can even make turkey hot dogs (ewww) palatable.  My favorite way to serve it: one can combined with half a block of cream cheese, topped with cheddar and baked until bubbly.  Served with warm tortilla chips, it is my idea of snack heaven.  Crap, now I am hungry!

Locally, the grocery stores are prominently featuring THEIR OWN brands of canned vegetables so I was extremely happy to find this available in Prime Pantry.

I purchased a box of each variety and tried the "plain" one first. Of course the first thing I had to do was bite one in half to see the chocolate center.  I had to really look to see the very small, thin strip of chocolate on one side of the inside of the hollow pillow.  Nothing like the box photo which seems to show a full chocolate center (could that be considered false advertising?).  I ate a few dry.  They were "just OK".  The outer shell is somewhat bland but the chocolate seemed to come through a bit, however nothing as strong or full as I'd expected.  Considering the size of the strip I wasn't totally surprised at this result.  So out comes the milk for a bowl full.  It works OK with milk but has a very odd mouth feel.  Somewhat grainy but the chocolate stood out more and presented a more chocolate flavor than when eaten dry.  It's not a *great* chocolate, tasting much like a chocolate syrup mixed with a chocolate spread, but acceptable for a breakfast cereal having a bit more chocolate flavor than most.  Then the side effects hit.  The chocolate didn't really melt as much as it combined with the shell turning into a paste that stuck to my teeth much like a gummy snack.  Bummer.  Then, after only a few spoonfuls, the shell began to get soggy.  The mouth feel was a bit better when soggy (not as grainy) but the gummy effect seemed to intensify.  I was very disappointed with the cereal and couldn't wait for the box to empty so I could move on to something better.  The sad part is I still have a box of the chocolate outer shell variety that I just can't bring myself to open.

This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house

 The bottom line:The only lemon juice you should buy and always keep in your kitchen. No it is not going to ever replace a lemon but can be used in lots of recipes that call for a lemon and you will never know the difference. I even put this in water to make lemon water.

4634	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Apple cider is beneficial for conditions that can increase any signs of Gerd which may include Obesity, Hiatal hernia, Pregnancy, Smoking, Dry mouth, Asthma, Diabetes, Delayed stomach emptying. I insure to consume apple cider with water+grounded cloves before my workouts within the same time that I consume my power drinks with different seeds that I ground. Only USDA approved apples, produced in US, in glass not plastic container, organic, raw, not pasteurized, not heated, not filtered. Pasteurized is worthless since just like any type of pasteurized juice regardless of the fruit, vegetable, etc. lose nutritional values. This is apple nothing else, nothing more. Apples are a healthy part of my diet and apple cider is a convenient way of getting my daily organic apples rather than making a trip to grocery store on daily basis. Although refrigeration not a requirement, I refrigerate. I use a straw when consuming so I would avoid getting the mix on my teeth as much as possible and make sure to rinse after since vinegar can be very damaging to teeth enamel. No brushing for couple of hours till saliva has dissolved any trace of the vinegar.

My initial impression is very good. The peanut butter is creamy and smells good as soon as the jar is opened and there's no oily skin on the surface. It spreads easily on a slice of bread like it should. The flavor is good - peanutty with a little sweetness, but no burned or scorched aftertaste. It makes a perfectly fine sandwich with grape jelly.

They are the hard crunchy type of chip. I don't find the eat them all mentality with this or their BBQ. Be your own judge on the health factor which these rack low to me.

I've purchased bread machine yeast in the past but find that by adding a little piece of ascorbic acid powder which I've ground from a tablet in a small ceramic mortar and pestle to this yeast, I can achieve the same results.  (I also often use all purpose flour with a little added vital wheat gluten instead of bread flour with great results.)  The Red Star yeast works wonderfully provided it's active, fresh, and is used in the correct environment.  If you are a beginning baker using yeast and you have been purchasing the small packets at the grocery store, this is a smart way to go. Even if you only use half of the yeast in the next two years which is about the truly active lifespan of the yeast after opening a fresh pouch, you have come out ahead.  Just keep it dry, cool and if you can, vacuum sealed for protection.

Its a good thing for me to have intensely flavored potato chips (as long as the ingredients are identifiable as real food) as Ill eat fewer of them compared to your more everyday plain potato chips. The only caveat is that if you eat too many Roasted Garlic chips late at night on an empty stomach, you may end up lying awake for hours, being chased around your bedroom by a huge garlic bulb (OK, perhaps I was dreaming). The Red Curry is also well worth trying; the Dill Pickle and Backyard BBQ were interesting at first but not outstanding for me.

4864	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This cake mix makes a good, moist cake.  My boys actually prefer Devil's Food Cake, because the chocolate flavor is more intense, but this one is good with a chocolate buttercream frosting (1 pound confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine, 1/4 cup cocoa powder and milk or cream to make it spreadable consistency, beaten smooth).  It is a little smaller than the cake mixes which Betty Crocker put out until recently, so be aware that you should shorten the baking time you're accustomed to using by a 2 to 4 minutes.

So I always have a couple of boxes in my pantry. Kosher salt is one dimensional in flavor so despite the TV chefs love for it I never use it to cook. If you want a salt to cook with look at more three dimensional salts with terrior to them. Imagine it this way, a short person wishes they were an inch or two taller. This table salt or kosher salt only add saltiness to the dish nothing else. A more specialty salt gives your dish that extra inch (you were wondering how short people worked in this). Then a freshly cracked black pepper add another in to your dish, even a specialty pepper adds another inch, soon your dish is a foot taller (more flavorful and unique).

The sponges are compact, easy to keep in just about any closet or kitchen cabinet; and they are inexpensive when you figure the cost of an individual sponge, too. They don't "go stale" before you can use them; and after you start using them they last forever and that's even more value.

640	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love kettle chips, and I love salt & vinegar, so of course this is my favorite out of all of Kettles flavors! Ive had some brands that are pretty strong, and can really make you pucker your mouth from the strong vinegar flavor, but these are the Goldilocks of the salt & vinegar chips....just right! The chips themselves are always nice and crisp, too. Never stale or old tasting. The only issue I have is that I often get a bag that has lots of small pieces, and Im not sure if thats just how they make them, or if its because they were handled too much during the delivery process.

The last frontier that Kettle needs to reach is sustainable packaging. Im tempted to give them only 4/5 green stars because their packaging is non-recyclable and non-compostable. After all, Sun Chips (a subsidiary of PepsiCo, for goodness sake!) introduced a compostable bag back in 2009. The bag turned out to be hilariously loud but they improved the packaging to make it quieter in 2011. Boulder Canyon, who make really tasty chips, introduced a better compostable bag made from wood pulp. Recently, Oceans Halo began selling seaweed chips (which are interesting) in nice compostable bags, also made from wood pulp. So why cant you, Kettle? Hmm? Until you do, Im tempted to curb my cravings for fried potato by making them at home  slice, par boil for 10 min, pan fry in olive oil for 5 min, season. Hey presto!

I would, however, prefer that the fruit be packed in it's own juice, no added sugar (syrup) at all. I'm diabetic, and it's hard to get good fruit in the northeast in the winter.

For home use, I transfer 4 oz. of yeast to an old yeast jar and store it in the refrigerator.  I use a clip to fasten the opened pouch, place it in a freezer bag that I seal and then store it in the freezer until I need to replenish the smaller jar.  This maintains the active aspect of the yeast until several months after the expiration date.

However, these chips are sometimes a hit or miss; I like my chips with a good amount of seasoning and the right amount of crunch.

The hand soap I used before just made it worse even though it was supposed to contain aloe. This doesn't make it worse.

Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be.

Is it effective from a nutrition perspective? Absolutely. Most Americans get less than half the daily recommended amount of 25g for women and 38g for men of fiber. Yet it is vital to many functions in your body. However, because most Americans are fiber deficient. You should start slowly, I would recommend no more than one serving per day until you feel comfortable. Your body needs time to adjust otherwise you will be spending a lot of time on the porcelain throne.
7837	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	It's Peanut Butter. It tastes good. It's creamy.  What to say?  The "Natural" bit is Palm Oil (vs. Hydrogenated Oils). It has about the very same amount of vitamins and such as regular PB, but a tiny bit more fat, actually. Not sure it's a big deal either way. Creamy and good taste. There was a very slight sheen of oil on top when I opened mine, not enough to be an issue. I like it.

PROS:
4988	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a snack in my dorm , every time I make them the smell fills my floor and it's awesome , always comes out of the microwave perfectly cooked , 5/5 would buy again
908	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My son loved these we had some with our sandwich
1447	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Fast delivery, great price, will do business again. A++++
9295	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	works great
4547	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I like to take shots of this for the health benefits. I can stomach this one with no problem. Best brand by far.
9275	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Like this chili very much and have ordered many times.

1018	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!
5500	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My grandma really liked these canned Del Monte Peaches in 100% Real Juice. They were sweet but not too sweet for her, like the one's you find packed in heavy syrup. They were tender and not tough. I will buy these again for her. I would recommend this product to others.
The bag re-seals securely, and the product I received has an expiration date ten months in the future. I can't always find this rice in local markets so I appreciate the convenience of buying it here. Good buy and excellent flavor.
This size and the entree size are the two I find most useful. My one star off is simply because I've had these lids slightly leak in lunch boxes when they weren't upright the entire time. I haven't had any problems using these in the microwave, but most of the time I am warming the contents for only about 60-90 seconds.
5277	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	WORKS WELL!
9449	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good product! Works for sauces that usually leave a grease stain, Sharpie ink (if you're quick!), and manufacturing oils. Works on many fabrics too, with no residue.
1343	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Delicious.
3414	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	yum
6808	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	TASTES GREAT! EXCELLENT PRICE. I RECOMMEND. FAST SHIPPING.
3496	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Big hit with the family! Smooth texture, not at all grainy. Much more like a muffin. The whole family wanted seconds. We used to make muffin style.
33	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	love tuna fish
4552	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Delicious!
8911	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I'm trying to avoid added salt/high sodium, and this corn is always fresh tasting and crisp. I bought another brand at the store that was organic even, but it was slightly mushy and had a weird taste compared to the Del Monte brand. I buy this in the Prime Pantry so the shipping is reasonable, and it's a staple in my diet now. It has an easy pop-top opener that I appreciate.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone who use sugar but wishes to watch just how much sugar they are consuming. They taste great and are much easier to store and lift than those big bags of sugar, when you go to refill the sugar bowl. I store mine box and all in a plastic food saver.
Have further questions? No problem--3M, the makers of Scotch Brite no scratch scrubbing sponges have a toll free number, a website and even a regular mailing address in case you wish to write to them. This information is printed on the see through plastic case that holds the unused sponges. Great PR!!!
3986	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We love organic brown rice!
7105	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Another prime pantry but for me. Packed very well and the animal crackers are always a good snack to have! Enjoyed these very much!
7631	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Excellent! Fresh, delicious - no complaints. A+
6003	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	It's absolutely delicious, but a little pricy
5718	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I like this product. I live in a rural area & find Prime Pantry convenient. Good prices & fair flat rate shipping.
9941	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I like this granola and the chewiness in milk.
2609	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Ok
5563	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love Wheat Thin Originals around the holiday's with great Wisconsin cheese and I definitely Love them on their own.
2745	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	really nice I was impressed.
9741	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good product, taste fresh, will buy again
6441	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Amazingly, the Amazon price for this item with delivery to your door is just about the same price as picking it up at the supermarket! This is a good item to have on hand. It's a great meal with cottage cheese and/or yogurt. Of course, it's fabulous to add to sugar-free jello so you can really fill-up without wrecking your diet. I've also used it with ham, slowly baking it in the oven.  Good stuff!
These are also great just as a mid-afternoon snack; the juice is delicious with no hint of bitter notes.  A favorite now available through Amazon's new Prime Pantry service.  Love 'em!
4191	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Great to add to lunches!

9413	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't do a thing for a day old stain.
7535	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	The flavor is that of a regular saltine cracker but it has a great crispness and crunch to it, not like a regular cracker. Would be sturdy for dips. I liked them. Because of the Ritz name I had expected them to taste like a Ritz cracker that buttery crunch. But doesn't
8358	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Taste so good like real lemon
1418	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Super tasty. Not a single bad piece in the whole pack
2615	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Came quick and easy love the taste.
1375	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	we just enjoyed them. Thanks
Great to put in lunch box or take to work
7646	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Just what I needed at a good cost in good time.
7823	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We like this peanut butter. No disappointments here. The taste and consistency are excellent, and we would probably purchase it again. We frequently make goodie baskets from Prime Pantry for family members far away, and this is certainly good enough to include as a gift.
9026	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I thought ordering some of my groceries through Amazon Pantry was going to be a great idea....boy was I wrong.  Out of the 39 canned good items I ordered 24 of those cans are dented; some pretty badly.  I ordered 4 cans of corn, 2 are dented.  I will be ordering any more canned good items from Amazon.  :(
8687	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	nice
5650	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I have not had these in a while and like some of the other reviews have said, the recipe has seemed to change. These are more bland and less salty than I had remembered. They are still OK but not as good in my opinion.
It's fresh, full of protein and tasty  .

847	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I'm a big fan of spicy chips, so these jalapeno chips hit the spot. These chips go well with any sandwich or as a stand-alone snack.
993	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	The texture and crunch of these chips are amazing. And the taste is just perfect. They are high in calories - 150 calories for about 13 chips. One serving, or 13 chips, contains about 15% of your fat. Good news is sodium is low - about 5%. No sugar. 5% carbs.
1192	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	DELICIOUS.  LIKE MOTHER MADE TUNA.  TASTY.
1515	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Good quality product. Not as great as the best fresh peach, but better than a lot of fresh peaches I've had. And I'm from Oregon!
570	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are the best bread crumbs! Very versatile! They are great for nearly everything. Chicken, pork chops, even on top of macaroni and cheese. I've used these bread crumbs for years and never been disappointed!
I added a couple of photos to the site so you can see what it looks like after it is mixed up.
If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!
3107	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	My daughter-in-law had the flu. Sent her a few things and for the boys too.
8708	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are my favorite sponges. No scratching, they don't smell, and they look nicer than those green and yellow ones.

2219	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	microwaved goodness
9844	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	All natural ketchup. Delicious.

808	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Very crisp/tasty.
1279	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Enjoy these as a snack.
6362	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Great way to get real fruit to elderly that can not get out to shop
3239	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Have used this salt for many, many years.  Wouldn't use anything else.  Be careful, though, because coarse salt is much saltier than blah table salt.
While I prefer buying this liquid lemon juice to purchasing whole lemons, this has to be refrigerated, and will spoil if not used quickly enough. When I lived in the SouthWest, I really preferred True Lemon crystals&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/True-Lemon-Shaker/dp/B004AMMPMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">True Lemon Shaker</a>&nbsp;for their ease of storage, use, and longevity. The problem with those is that since moving here to the South, the humidity has turned the crystals into one big gooey clump in my pantry. So I'm back to buying good old ReaLemon Lemon Juice.

8374	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	just like i went to the store but easier - open the front door and except delivery yeah, no gas money required to go to the store
5976	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are so easy to make.  I add velveta cheese and milk, sometimes some real bacon.  They are really good. I like the already portioned size instead of big box, plus they have several different types you can purchase.  The butter never seems to be available though
1817	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	They are totally healthy except for maybe the chocolate, but even the chocolate is about as healthy as chocolate can get. As stated, I have a sweet tooth, pile on the sugar every day (hypoglycemic). These cookies are plenty sweet and don't taste "healthy" at all. I expected them to taste like cardboard... but they are some of the tastiest cookies I've ever had!
3208	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	A healthy treat that was included in my two college student Granddaughters care package and they loved it.
6021	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Bagged or boxed mashed potatoes are kind of a forbidden thing in our family. But I have never been happier than when I cheated on my potato peeler with these!  They taste really good, my kids always want more.
6663	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Quality product, however I don like receiving dented cans.
686	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	AWFUL KOCH BROTHERS PRODUCT ALL NESTLE PRODUCTS SUCK
2077	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love to cook and therefore make most meals from scratch.  Having said that, I absolutely love this stuff.  I don't care that it is basically an instant type food and not homemade.  It is creamy and has a delicious flavor that goes well with just about anything.  I've been known to add some canned tuna or leftover chicken cubes and a vegetable to make a sort of one dish casserole.  I also can enjoy it just plain as a side dish, but it is even better with a little sprinkle of white pepper.
7979	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are delicious. They do go stale very quickly, but that should be expected with no preservatives. A fair trade off to avoid chemicals I'd say.
4923	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Really like this product.  Will buy again.
7956	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	A very meaty, good-tasting chip that can be eaten alone or with salsa and other dips.  Low salt. Organic.  Yum.
2802	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is a soup that tastes and feels like a meal.  The sweet and robust tomato soup is hearty with pasta and diced tomatoes and a touch of kale.  Add on top of that an Italian sausatge that has a slight bite.  Just enough spice to set off the sweet tomato base.  Good enough to be in an expensive Italian restaurant without the price tag and the need to dress up.  Plus, you can eat it as is, or top with a touch of mozzarella or Parmesan cheeses.  Sometimes I put both.  I am such a daredevil!  Seriously though, this is perfect for a cold night when you want a soup to stay with you, and not leave you hungry in a couple of hours.  The pasta and protein in the soup make sure of that!  It is so good that my local grocery store cannot keep it in stock.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to keep it on my shelves!
6984	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Who doesn't love animal crackers?
2053	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Easy to make, fun to eat.  I mix in one can of tuna for a very quick casserole.
8443	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Tastes like the real thing. Oh wait, it IS the real thing. 100% lemon juice. No wonder! Great pricing too.
7053	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Classic animal crackers that kids love in a nice resealable bag.
1348	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Good snacks.
8581	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Super nice tasting lemon juice.  Would buy again.
8428	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	As expected.

By the way if you add milk to Krave it goes from disgusting to garbage dunked in milk and blended with fish guts.
2984	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is another of my favorite soups, and I will get several for winter.  It's just what it says, hearty, rich and meaty.  Very very good soup.
7333	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	kind of pricey but really nice

The only line of unsweetened teas I can find on store shelves.  Love it.
4714	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	They are the right size can to made a batch of chili which my husband enjoys.  The tomato flavoring with basil gives it a better taste.

9673	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We tried to resist devouring the package it in one sitting...boy, was it hard! So good! Very sticky when chewing. I liked to just suck them...may them last longer. My husband liked chewing them. Either way, they are GOOD! We will be buying them again!
6224	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great Tuna, on time delivery

3637	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Other than the boxes being left on my porch soaking wet when the delivery person knew it was supposed to rain & the boxes falling apart & all paper packaged products inside being soaked as well this product is what is to be expected.
7950	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	"From a food science perspective, it is difficult to define a food product that is 'natural' because the food has probably been processed and is no longer the product of the earth. That said, FDA has not developed a definition for use of the term natural or its derivatives. However, the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."  This was taken directly from the FDA website.  I find "natural" labeling incredibly frustrating and a way to appeal to people who normally would purchase organic or healthy brands than Skippy.  This peanut butter tastes great, really!!  I would have no problem buying it again and eating it all by myself!  But stop labeling things natural... it means nothing.
8791	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	delicious
If my review helps you make a decision about this product, please mark it as helpful! Thanks!
466	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love us some manwich.  The funniest part of this is we ordered it as a quick meal for our exchange student to try.  He had never even heard of it.  We haven't made it yet but I can say without a doubt that when it comes to manwiches I can not even consider purchasing a no name brand.  I have to say that I highly recommend this product!  I will be ordering from prime pantry again as well. It has comparable pricing and great coupon opportunities and I don't have to go to the store!
976	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These chips are the greatest.  Bet you can't each just three....Taste is super...Crispy and fresh.  I love them way too much!

This was some time ago, and I think the general population is eating hotter food now.  So, maybe that is true about Gumbo...I don't know. I certainly did not expect anything hot when I ordered this.  Two stars because I ate it with crackers and a milk chaser.

8312	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Bumble Bee has been the preferred tuna in our household for years, but I had not tired the albacore in a gold can until ordering it with a Prime Pantry package.  My goodness, this is good tuna and since we eat a vegetarian based diet with seafood a couple times a week, we want the fish to be good.  This is solid, tasty, not offensive or stinky, and it makes a delicious salad for sandwiches or simple addition to a vegetable, pasta or grain salad.  This is now a staple in our pantry.

775	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Oatmeal is good for you. As you know, it's a great source of fiber and lowers cholesterol. Most Americans don't get nearly as much fiber as they should, so incorporating oatmeal into your morning routine has health benefits. My parents, for example, are in their 60's and 70's and they eat a bowl of oatmeal every day at breakfast. For heavy users such as them, this is the most economical way to buy Quaker Oats. At the time of writing, if you use Subscribe & Save, it's less than $7! One box has 91 servings, if you make it according to the suggested portion size. That's a fantastic bargain, especially if you have a large family. A single 42 oz canister costs nearly $5 where I live. This box is 8 lbs of the stuff!

3998	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	According to consumer reports, rice grown in California has the lowest levels of arsenic, however brown rice has the highest levels of arsenic because of the higher concentrations in the bran or the rice.  My family eats a lot of rice and the more I read about arsenic levels in rice the more concerned I became and I was happy to find out that there is rice available from areas that are fairly reliable when it comes to lower arsenic levels, but I remain concerned about the levels in all brown rices.  Lundberg brown basmati rice has always been very tasty and aromatic but we will eat less of it, while I wait for more research to come out about the harmful effects of higher arsenic levels vs the benefits of brown over white rice. Lundberg more than any other rice grower has responded with concern and is doing their own research into lowering arsenic levels in the rice, which I appreciate as a consumer.  I'm still giving this 4 stars because it is superior over other brands.

There is no question that this is a good tasting soup. We used to be strictly Campbell's customers, but discovered many Progresso soups earlier this year as we explored alternatives which would complement our new style of eating (losing weight instead of gaining weight! LOL). To our delight we found, on average, Progresso soups seem to be lower calorie, lower sodium, and better flavored than Campbells. There are a couple of Campbell's that we still like better (New England Clam Chowder, for example) but other than just a few exceptions Progresso has the bulk of our soup business now.

This is a great price- less than my local stores as of the time I am writing this - and it's nice it's been in stock here- I've recently had trouble finding Real Lemon on store shelves in my area.

94	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This tuna is really delicious. Albacore tuna is just so much better than even light tuna. It is packed in water so it's high in protein and low in calories. It has a great taste and can be used for sandwiches and in recipes. I love it! I have noticed that the pieces are smaller now and the chunks aren't as tightly packed. This last can looked a bit like cat food with more water than usual. The taste though is the same. Very flavorful and not too "fishy".

I didn't think I was an artichoke fan until a friend ordered artichoke and ham on a pizza.  Seriously, I know that sounds horrible and it's something I never would have ordered myself.  But when I tried it I really liked it.  So if you're feeling sporty consider trying our this Progresso recipe for Clam Chowder with Artichokes.  It's really quick and easy. Two steps and 15 minutes is all that it takes.
4766	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Great for people looking to reduce sodium, but you will end up needing to add something ... it's kinda bland. Curry powder helps :)
1189	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I bought these primarily as non-perishable back up food. At 220 calories for the tuna salad and 80 calories for the crackers, it is a snack or small meal that might satisfy your hunger for a while. The 170 fat calories will slow your digestive system as though you had eaten a larger meal. I would like more tuna and less mayonnaise. A higher percentage of carrots and celery would help. It isn't perfect but I like it and will buy more.

2201	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	New England clam chowder is my favorite soup, and I have tried almost every brand out there! I like the flavor in this one, and it has a decent amount of potatoes in it, as well. However, just like with all clam chowders Ive eaten, there is never enough clams in it in my opinion. I look forward to all the bits of chewy clam pieces in each bite, and I really need them and not just the flavor of clam, to make my clam chowder eating experience complete. To solve that, I always add a can of chopped or minced clams to it, and then it becomes the PERFECT bowl of soup! Ive never had any issues with quality when ordering from Amazon.....the expiration date is always far out, and no cans have ever arrived dented or leaking. Good stuff here!

4340	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Very crunchy and nice flavor thins! They are a great snack or additional to a vegetable salad. As they have pecans, I find them suitable for both savory and sweet snacks. Don't expect too much nuttiness, it's mostly rice cake with hints of pecan.

Keeps food stuffs fresh and wonderful to use to separate layers of freshly baked cookies and brownies stored in containers in the freezer.

Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.

I keep them in the refrigerator now, but they're basically impossible to use.  I'm thinking I will just make a gargantuan batch of sweet tea or lemonade with them, so I can melt the whole block down at once -- if not, it could come in handy as a weapon should I ever need to hit someone with a brick.

June 2 Update: I just tried the loaded baked potato and I cannot tell the difference in taste from the baby reds with roasted garlic and parmasean.

I cook 1 serving (40g) with 1 cup of water and the desired ingredients (fruits, nuts, seeds) for 2 minutes in the microwave. Then I stir and let it sit to cool. They cook to perfection and they keep me full for about 3 hours. You get 13 servings in this container.
The Oatmeal itself tastes just great! It is very easy to prepare.. and it is available at a very good price.
5344	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	EDIT, 10/31/15: still everything below true.  I think I have but two or three of the original set, left.  The rest either melted in the microwave or the tops tore, and I'm not sorry to see them go.  I got Ziplock and Tupperware and plain old (better, actually) Kroger brand to work better.  These all have FLAT tops.  The GLAD bowl design is better, but that top is a killer and too much temptation for me to buy again until the top is fixed.
Mix it all up, pour it in a deep dish pie plate, in my oven, I bake it on 370 for 38-40 minutes.  The top will be brown and a knife will come out moist but clean when done.  PERFECT!

1841	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great for serving with any Mexican meal.  They suggest you add a can of diced tomatoes... make sure you drain the juice from the tomatoes which they neglected to say on the instructions...I like a light, fluffy quality to my Spanish rice, as opposed to a stickier, mushier one that is obtained when you add the whole can, tomatoes and liquid.

8906	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	The best thing about this mix is it's fast and easy. Everything you need to know is on the back of the box. You don't have to measure anything. All it takes is 1 stick of butter, 1 egg, and a splash of vanilla extract. And you can actually go without the vanilla if you don't have any handy. With a bit of quick kitchen maneuvering (preheat the oven and get cookie sheets ready before you mix the dough), you can have the first batch of gluten free cookies in 15 minutes. That's not bad considering it will take at least 15 minutes to go pick up a box at the local store (if you have one down the street) when a craving hits and there is absolutely nothing to snack on in the house.

Well, I've changed my mind.  These Butter Golden Selects are the BEST instant mashed potatoes I've tried, and they're actually better than a lot of homemade mashed potatoes I've had, too.  Each packet makes two generous servings, and they are truly "instant" mashed potatoes.  Just add the packet to 2 cups of boiling water, stir, cover, let stand for 5 minutes, fluff with a fork, and you'll have amazingly good slightly "chunky" mashed potatoes.

4630	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Apple cider is beneficial for conditions that can increase any signs of Gerd which may include Obesity, Hiatal hernia, Pregnancy, Smoking, Dry mouth, Asthma, Diabetes, Delayed stomach emptying. I insure to consume apple cider with water+grounded cloves before my workouts within the same time that I consume my power drinks with different seeds that I ground. Only USDA approved apples, produced in US, in glass not plastic container, organic, raw, not pasteurized, not heated, not filtered. Pasteurized is worthless since just like any type of pasteurized juice regardless of the fruit, vegetable, etc. lose nutritional values. This is apple nothing else, nothing more. Apples are a healthy part of my diet and apple cider is a convenient way of getting my daily organic apples rather than making a trip to grocery store on daily basis. Although refrigeration not a requirement, I refrigerate. I use a straw when consuming so I would avoid getting the mix on my teeth as much as possible and make sure to rinse after since vinegar can be very damaging to teeth enamel. No brushing for couple of hours till saliva has dissolved any trace of the vinegar.

I basically beat this by hand and just followed the instructions. The cake is very easy to make and affordable. I would buy this product again. It is exactly as described. 4.5 stars (rounding up)

They're not overly oily, they're extra crunchy, and in the case of the Backyard Barbeque chips, they taste freakin' awesome.  The flavor is salty, sweet, and tart - but in all the right proportions.  The only problem I have with these chips is that there are simply not enough in the bag for me - not a bad thing though...have to exercise some restraint.  Maybe.  Totally would buy again.

3020	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love these little orange sections!  I eat them in many dishes but also enjoy eating them straight from the container.  Regular oranges do not treat me well, they always give me heartburn and they make the corners of my mouth burn.  I don't know why, nor do I know anyone else who has the problem with burning in the corners of the mouth (actually lips), I just know that it is uncomfortable enough to keep me from enjoying a fresh orange not matter how delicious they smell.  Mandarin oranges do not cause me any issues, and a container has half the vitamin C you should get each day. As a health bonus, these are packed in a blend of fruit juices (not a sticky syrup like others I've bought) That makes these my "go to" citrus fruit!  I did prefer the little cans the fruits used to come packed in, they were easier to open yet less likely to accidently get a hole poked in them, but PLASTIC seems to be the packaging of choice more and more.

I keep this in the freezer in a ziplock freezer bag. That keeps it fresh and usable past the expiration date. I do the same for all yeasts I use (except Herman) and things like Cream of Tartar or Baking Powder to make them last longer.
7814	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We buy these all the time. They are so good. These thick chips have a nice crunch with a great flavor. The sesame taste is very light. The chips are pretty as well as tasty so they work well for parties. Our favorite way to eat them is with salsa. I also use them for nachos, they are hardly enough to hold up being smothered in cheese.

Purchasing Red Star Active Dry Yeast, 2-Pound Pouch resulted in a tremendous savings and, with an expiration date of January 2017, the product is fresh and has enough longevity remaining that I need only use between 9 oz. and 10  oz. to reach the grocers price.  If you bake yeast breads, I definitely recommend purchasing your yeast from Amazon and their partner, America Anywhere.

Make a box of brownie mix.  Put it in a pan.
These are good all on their own, they don't need dip to be good but we do like them with a bit of sour cream. In terms of seasoning, they are closer to a dorito, in how they're coated, than your usual tortilla chip. The lime is heavy and the chili is mild but the aftertaste is spicy. Definitely worth trying if you like lime!

I loved it, but, oh so expensive (and there really isn't that much cereal in there, considering the size of the box).  Still, it was SO good, I wanted MORE!  I was happy to find it on Amazon AND on the subscribe and save program.  This cereal is great with milk, but, it is also delicious dry as a snack or part of a packed lunch.  A great "healthy" way to eat chocolate.

512	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Have you found what I have found. That canned fruit prices have sky rocketed in the past couple of years. The cost of a quality can of fruit is rapidly reached the $2.00 per can mark. We love canned fruit especially when we make a cottage cheese plate and these pears are excellent as are the peaches. Today I found an array of Del Monte fruits on sale for $1.00 a can and quickly purchased  several as they have an expiration date of July 2016. They will all be gone by that date. These are an excellent last minute dessert items and preparation is  a snap, just open the can and serve. You might want to place them in the frig for about an hour to cool down.

If you've never had corned beef hash, do yourself a favor and don't smell it or critique the way it looks in the can until you've fried it up and served it with your favorite breakfast meal. A lot of people think it resembles canned pet food. To be perfectly honest, it does, but the taste is heavenly.
The taste and texture is slightly drier than the other rice cakes, but I assume it's due to the rice being brown.

91	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I am not sure what to think here.  Many of the reviews are for the "Chunk Light" not the "Solid White Albacore" which is what I bought- and what I got.  That is the only option available, so I don't know why the verified purchases for light tuna are appearing here.  Additionally, some reviews are for the smaller pop top type cans that come in a multi-pack.  I quit buying chunk light tuna several years ago because of the decline to mushy texture and stronger fishy smell.  Full disclosure, I was buying Starkist, not Chicken of the Sea, but the Starkist chunk light tuna I grew up on had evolved into a product more like cat food than I cared to eat.  My only reason for trying this brand was BECAUSE it is labeled as Solid White Albacore, the price was better than my grocery store, and I had some room in my pantry box so this product popped up as a recommendation.  Had I come to the page and looked at the reviews or the photographs, I would absolutely positively passed on buying it.  The rusty cans shown at the top of the product page are disgusting.  It is not likely I will purchase this again even though the cans I received were fine and I couldn't really tell any difference from my usual brand.

I am always looking for new varieties from Dole, because whether it's pears, peaches, cherry mixed fruit, etc., it's ALWAYS yummy! These individual size fruit cups are perfect to pack in my kiddo's lunchbox, and I haven't had one leak yet. $2.00 for this 4-pack is a good deal on this product, especially when you can get free Prime Pantry shipping!

It is not sickeningly sweet and the flax and pumpkin seeds add a nutty flavor and vary the texture of the cereal.

It is wonderful when mixed with plain Greek yogurt - a creamy-crunchy combination that makes a wonderful breakfast or lunch.  I usually purchased this granola at the big warehouse store, but only when it was on sale.  Now that I've found it on Amazon where the price is significantly better, I'll be having it shipped regularly.  I recommend you do the same!

The scrubber part of the pad is rough and provides good abrasion, but it's gentle enough to avoid scratching, as long as a gentle cleanser such as Soft Scrub is used. Thus I use it to wash dishes, scrub my marble counter tops, stovetop and floors. Teflon no-stick pots and pans are wonderful, but we all know that some things can stick and a Teflon surface can be easy to ruin. I've used these pads on some tough jobs with Teflon and there has been no apparent damage. I find the Scotch Brite pads to be of use in the kitchen, bathroom, garage and anywhere a mess needs to be cleaned up. I might add that we have two cats and that amounts to a certain amount of messy cleaning. Scrub, scrub. Wipe, wipe. Wipe, scrub. Scrub, wipe.

Mainly because out of the ones I have tried this is the least salty and the most flavorful and turns out the closest to home made.

But the best part of these potatoes is you can really use them as a base and they make  mean shephards pie as well  I highly recommend these potatoes to anyone looking for a delicious and easy to make side dish.

1566	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Part of several Prime Pantry orders.  Opened first peach bowl.  Tasted good, BUT!  Diced peaches were mush.  Disgusting!  I drank the bowl which was all liquid.  The diced peaches looked okay but were slimy nothings.  I will drink the others.  Because of bad experiences with poor Prime Pantry box packing I have cancelled Prime.  $99 per year and $5.99 per pantry box is a rip-off.  Nothing in it for me.
6977	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	My son loves these!! It comes with 6 in a pack.  The price is decent, about the same you would pay at a local store.  Convenient for school lunches or if you are on the run.  Personally, I am not a big fan of the cheese in it, but that is my son's favorite part. The crackers are very crunchy and not overly salty.

1815	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	I have bought these cookies numerous times but will never buy another Kashi product again. Those ..... downsized the cookies significantly but left the box the same size! When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.
9799	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This rice has a moderate jasmine flavor. Ive had rice grown in India that was distinctly more floral tasting, but this rice is very good tasting, is grown in California so is not treated with any pesticides we don't know about, and has a great heavy duty package that seals tightly with a Velcro-like system. This closure is really nice, because it protects the rice from moisture, pantry moths, etc., keeps it from spilling, and does away with the need for storing this grain in a canister. The shape of the bag allows it to stand up on a shelf until empty, another plus. I'm a confessed rice aficionado--I think it is the single most perfect food--and Lundberg varieties are across the board excellent.
6787	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Awesome sauce
As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.
Perfect answer for those of us who are tired of their taco filling falling out due to them tipping over.  They are a little bit larger than a normal hard taco shell.
What I found most annoying was the relatively long prep time. First, you really need a LARGE skillet WITH a cover. No - you should not use a pot. Rice-A-Roni specifies a large skillet WITH COVER and for good reason. They want you to brown the rice and that takes a skillet. Then the skillet must be covered. That may or may not be the type of cookware you own.

2037	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	It is good pasta but too mild for me. I doctored it with parmesan cheese and loved it.
Two things sold me on them.  The first is the reasonable price.  The second is that they really really work well and they do it with scratching.  Lately I've been doing a lot of baking and crockpotting and generally making dishes that leave the sorts of mess that moms hate.  I have found these non-scratch scrubby sponges make cleanup a lot easier.  Before I'd soak the casserole dishes and then eventually have to take a Brillo pad to them.  The Brillo pad worked great but I know this is a terrible idea.  So I tentatively tried the sponge.  Worked just as well and didn't feel like it was scratching the glass or enamel  at all.

4127	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Awesome ground flax. I've seen stores trying to sell ground flaxseed for whackadoodle prices and that was just not cutting it for me. I'm so glad I found this on Amazon. I add this to smoothies mostly, but I also use this to make a "flax egg" instead of using eggs in recipes. Most people recommend using freshly ground flaxseed in order to get the best consistency, but I have not had trouble with mine. It's a little more runny than a perfect flax egg, but it works just fine in my recipes. I've used Spectrum brand flaxseeds (not ground) before and I was happy with those as well. This is a great price and a brand I trust.
Also important, especially for an acidic juice, according to Dole Nutrition News they don't use BPA in any of their cans, so there's no BPA leaching into the juice, a very good thing!

Sadly, Amazon has recently raised their prices on all Progresso soups. Last summer and fall they were considerably more cost effective to buy 12 at a time on Amazon. Now the Amazon prices are quite similar to the prices at the upscale super-market we patronize. Even the Subscribe and Save prices are not currently much of a deal compared to buying locally, and locally we don't have to buy a case at a time. Be sure to compare your local prices to these prices before you order here. Also, make sure you are getting free shipping or you will pay more. Finally, be very wary of buying food products from Amazon Resellers. Their prices are normally extremely high compared to local markets, plus they will always have shipping added.

I have a friend who, on a daily basis, drinks a glass of water, one tablespoon Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar and a squeeze of lemon. She tells me it decreases her need for sugar. If that is indeed true,than I am a convert. I have used this same combination with an addition of ice cubes for three days. Nothing substantial so far, but I shall continue to use this lemon, apple cider, water combination until I can say yea or nay to sugary products.

9658	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	After a lot of research, I purchased the Gin GIns ginger chews in lieu of other brands and I was not disappointed!  The majority of each chew is ginger, as evidenced by the strong ginger flavor, but there is cane sugar added to make them a sweet ginger chew.  I prefer natural remedies and ginger is known to help with upset stomachs, digestion and motion sickness.  Now that I have tried and love them, I will be purchasing some back up bags for the pantry.  One thing should be noted - these are very chewy (not a soft, easy to chew item).  If you have dental work, be warned.  I personally enjoy how chewy they are, but my mom was concerned when eating one about how chewy they are.  All in all, fantastic product, and much better than most of the ginger products on the market.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands.

4589	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff - if you've never used "real" vinegar like this, you have to try it. The "mother" makes all the difference! The taste is amazing, but it seems to have healing properties I've never experienced from regular Apple Cider vinegar.. Highly recommended for those with rashes, ringworm, fungus of any type because it boosts your intestinal flora with naturally occurring probiotics. I take a tablespoon of it every morning in 6-8 ounces of cold water and I feel better when I do, plus it kills my appetite for most of the day. This is now a staple in my house and I'll try never to run out of it.

I must say, I enjoy them now. I think I had to get the idea of Oreos/ChipsAhoy/Tate's/Etc type cookies out of my brain and expect a healthier cookie, not a junk cookie. Expectations matter. Imagine if you are going to take a sip of cocoa, but it turns out there's tea in the cup. Your mouth doesn't like what it just tasted, because of expectations.

8636	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This sponge has proven itself worth the purchase several times over. One side is soft for easy cleaning of dishes, countertops and stovetops, for general wiping, etc. The other side is meant for scrubbing stubborn stuck on foods. It safely cleans glass stove tops and non-stick pans without scratching. It's a great all around cleaning tool for the kitchen. Put it in the dishwasher to sanitize it. I like how Scotch has color coded their sponges. There is a chart on the description page showing which color/sponge works best for what items. If you need something stronger for scrubbing pans, check out the green one, or the stronger grey one for extreme scrubbing of things like oven racks. They each have a sponge side and a tougher scrubbing side. Contrarily, if you need something gentler, check out the purple one, or the pink one for the most delicate items like glasses or stemware. Note that the blue one is the only one that is non-scratch.  Happy scrubbing!

Smells great.

5867	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Oatmeal. I like it with butter and water, 5 minutes in the microwave, perhaps a diced nectarine and a little salt. Love the box, great for children's crafts.

It can't get much easier to frost a cake than to pop open a tub like this and layer the frosting over your cake. Hubby used about 3/4 of the tub, so it was a pretty thickly frosted cake! But it was also very delicious - smooth, creamy and rich. A small slice soon satisfied that chocolate fix!

This particular version is fabulous in lasagna.

1803	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I usually like most Kashi products, so I thought I would give these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies a whirl.  They are a good sized soft cookie and you can break them off in smaller bits and not have them crumble.  Just sweet enough, but not so sugar sweet as many store-bought cookies.  You can also definitely feel the chew of the oatmeal and the chocolate doesn't have that cheap taste.  I honestly enjoyed them, enough that I had trouble just stopping with one.
Japan's #1 selling Jasmine Tea! ITO EN uses jasmine flowers that have been picked when the blossoms are at the peak of their fragrance.
639	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are super good, crunchy and just right amount of salt. I weaned myself off of chocolate with these delicious chips and now am a reformed "salty" person instead of "sweet".  I even lost weight eating these because sugar is what creates fat, not fat!  Happy camper and still low blood pressure. The salt and pepper version that is sold at Trader Joe's are also favorites, probably like them even more.
4771	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this in a group of many other things as a gift for a friend who needed some pantry items to feed a family of 5.  I am happy to report that these arrived in good shape and according to my friend, tasty!

3333	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product and most stores don't carry it. Shipped on time at a great price. No complaints whatsoever.
1014	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.
4345	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	delicious
6282	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These seem like a highly indulgent snack but they are very high protein and the salt and fat are not as bad as you might think.  I keep a few cans around for when I am protein starved and on the verge of eating something awful like potato chips. The smoke flavor is not overpowering either and the price is pretty ridiculous for the small cans of the treat, which is good so you won't go through them like a cheap bag of potato chips. The nuts do fill you up like a protein source should and stop the dreaded junk food cravings
6727	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We have tried the store brands and we always come back to Ocean Spray when we want a quality cranberry sauce at our table. The product is always consistent with the previous can. Just a  little chilling and it is ready to serve. Great product which is very tasty.
494	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I go to the store and want some pears, all they have are the rock hard pears, I take them home and hope they will ripen in a day or two and then in the two and half days they're rotten. I like the Del Monte Pears, ripe without any chance of going bad before you open the can and to top it off not swimming in a lot of sugar.
2070	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Sorry to report I love this stuff.  I didn't want to but I do.  I make it according to package directions except instead of regular milk I substitute a small (5 oz.) can undiluted evaporated milk and add a dash of granulated garlic and white pepper.  Sometimes I add canned tuna or salmon and call it "neptunes surprise!"  There's plenty of sauce.  Frozen peas are also a nice addition. Hits the spot for a quick, no fuss entre.

They are a family of five and I just wanted to help with them with some shelf stable pantry and other items. These arrived quickly and in good condition.  I really appreciate that Amazon helps me to help them!

205	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Tuna is really all the same unless you can find a good albacore or yellowfin tuna.  This Albacore tuna is a good tuna with no oil providing exactly what you need for salads and sandwiches.  Very consistent taste and quality in the six cans we received.
