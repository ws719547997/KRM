This isn't going to replace a couple other hand saws I have (sometimes you just need a rigid blade) but this is definitely my favorite and the go-to saw for just about every project I can use it for. Get you one, these are great saws.
5936	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	As with every T, Y, or any other piece it directly abuts.  I found that 4" PVC has a bit greater diameter and I have a mitre saw, so I cut off a LOT of 2 1/2" lengths and used gorrila tape (great stuff!!) on each of the fittings or Gates to fit.  Can't tell you how many rounds to make, as every piece of PVC pipe seems to be a little different, but at least it is consistant for each piece of PVC.  For me it was somewhere between a round and a half, to half a round, to get a secure tight fit.  These take the abuse well that it takes to get everything tight.

SUGGESTIONS:
As for the complaints by other reviewers about the collet not letting go of the bits, that's a problem I have not yet encountered. Sometimes I have to tap the collet with the wrench and then the bit comes right out. Of the 20 or so guys in my shop that have this router, none have complained about bits that refuse to come free. Perhaps the other reviewers left the bit in for a very long time and the bit shanks rusted to the collet??? Not sure, but hasn't been a problem for me.
The power switch on this router is in an inconvenient spot (like most routers).  If you're running this router in a table, I suggest using a Billy Pedal, which allows you to turn the power on and off with your foot.  This keeps your hands and face far from the router itself, and it allows you to cut the power in an emergency.

After trying different methods to make setup more efficient I have labeled each of the various spacers with their thickness determined with a micrometer.  Then simply picking the right combination of thicknesses, putting them in place and doing a quick test cut pretty much eliminates the trial and error method I had been using.
You then tighten both cranks to working tightness by hand, something that seems to have escaped other reviewers here.
I fire it up. The eerily quiet motor (by circular saw standards) is refreshing. It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears. This saw is plenty powerful. I cut 2X treated lumber (very wet) with ease. The included blade is adequate. It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber. I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.

That was at least eight years ago and I have been using these ever since.  They do what they are designed to do - allow you to drive screws one handed.  I have had great success driving every length of screw up to and including 4" with this driver and my 9.6V DeWalt cordless drill.  I have never worn one of these out while using it for its designed purpose, but when I used it in a pinch to drive hundreds of metal barn siding fasteners (I removed the bit and was using the guide as a socket drive) the end mushroomed out and lost its shape.

9866	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm finding this blade tough to beat for the price.  Crosscuts are easily as clean as my Forrest's at about half the price, and it rips better than other crosscut blades I've used.  In fairness, my Forrest rips thick material better.  The LU88 has large teeth, Frued's best carbide, anti-vibration slots, and teflon coating.  Great for crosscutting and general purpose use on a TS, but I wouldn't recommend it for a CMS or RAS because of the aggressive hook angle.

2765	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one. It drills pretty well in any material. Except masonry. It's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel. The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee  Magnum. You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy. But that means  you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it. Some times when  all your batteries are dead (if you forget to charge them) you need a  corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are.

Fit and finish are nice.  The finish seems to be both tougher and thicker than the finish on my Super Sawzall tool case.

So, if you build Kayaks or need many perfectly uniform strips for edge-banding, these things are GREAT!
I own and use these clamps and I wouldn't be without them.  But, if I can get a Bessey on my projects (up to 80") then that's the clamp I reach for.

3246	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	When I first started remodeling I was taught the "DIY" way of installing crown (cutting 45s on the ends and trying to meet them up in the corner).  After much frustration and having to use half a tube of caulk to make the corners presentable, I took it upon myself to learn how to cope in crown properly.  However, we kept using these crown stops and the joints never lined up cleanly, even being coped.  One day I was sharing the saw with someone cutting shelf boards and so I just opted to do the old school double bevel cuts.  OMG!  I figured out the problem.  It was the stops.  Everything has lined up perfectly since I stopped using them.  No matter how much I adjusted or worked with them, they just do not allow for a proper angle to be cut.  It make take a little more time to do it old school, but my joints are tight now.
3358	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this for my jointer, but after setting all the pieces together on my bench, I realized the smallest width it could be was 16". My jointer measures 12". I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on. I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace. As with the other reviewers, It's sloppy with the 1 1/2" boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16" holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press, you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base.
1) The vise handle, track and pin and quite loose and plastic. Once you install the handles on the item you can't take them apart again as they are held in with pins you have to hammer in.

I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again.

7700	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have owned a few hole saws over the years. For people not familiar with them, they are basically attachments to a drill of simple round circles with sawing teeth. You usually have to buy a special drill bit to use them.


Dust "collection" is also loosely implied.  It does capture a good deal of sawdust, but invariably, you'll have plenty of dust floating around you too, unless you can hook the unit up to a vacuum system.  Not a complaint, as I expected that.

Having said that, this thing does work. In fact, it even works, with a little grinding down of two tabs, on an older Sears Craftsman cast iron base 10" compound mitre saw. And that was a lucky break for me because you cannot get the Craftsman part anymore.
4103	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	If the chippers had their width visible I would give it a 5.  I love the four blade chippers but setting up the desired width is a real challenge.  I recommend engraving the width after you determine the true tooth width.  But the cuts have a really smooth bottom which has been a dream.  I purchased the 6" since both my table and radial arm have adjustable blade height and I don't plan on cutting a dado deeper than 1/2".  But  then I am a beginner.

6198	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I don't have the years of hard earned credentials of most of those posting here, but here's my 2 cents worth.  I originally bought the Porter Cable Tiger Saw 11.5 amp Tiger Saw because all those at my work & Home Improvement stores etc said I didn't need that much saw.  I have always been willing to spend an extra 25% for the best when I knew it would pay back in the long run, and I should have stuck to my guns.  Luckily, the place I bought it took it back even though it had been used several times ( I have spend A LOT of money there), and let me trade up to this saw.  It has everything you'll ever want.  Pro's:  Metal case, not plastic;  the shoe pivots closer to the axis of the chuck and blade, instead of offset, so the shoe remains flat on the work, supported; the shoe adjusts for different distances with a simple pull of a large, secure lever that blends into the front end, not a hex key; the chuck holds the blades like a vice, not like a rubber band (the Porter Cable chuck allowed a 12" blade to move 1 1/2" or more up and down when set, a distraction when trying to do detail work);  the chuck allows the blade to be held up or down, not only down, for reverse "up" cuts (not the safest, but it is there if you need it); adjustable orbital action, not just on/off; speed control dial to set the max speed possible per pull of the trigger (blade, and work saver); quik-lok cord (some say they lose contact after awhile, but easily replaceable.  I believe I was told about $10 for a replacement. Anyone?); two blades included (6" 5/8 tpi wood, 6" 18 tpi metal "the torch"), not one; counter-balance to lessen some of that vibrating (the P.C. saw left me numb after 1/2 hr.  Also helps just a bit for copper plumbing work when not trying to shake loose all of the solder in the system and ending up with leaks); Lifetime vs 1 yr warranty.

3456	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this for the last 4 days while I renovate part of the house. I like the tool. I set it up on a DEWALT DWX724 Compact Miter Saw Stand (see:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U4S7S4/) using two of the 4 supplied bolts that came with the Dewalt stand. So far I've used if for framing and I can't imagine ever going back to using a hand saw for this kind of work. So far I've made both 90 and 45 degree cuts.
2828	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purhcased this a few weeks ago from Amazon. I played around on scrap while getting the hang of it. It is easy to setup and use.

With any new tool like this, I spend some time learning how it works, learning how to set it up and adjust it. That's a good practice anyway with any tool, but it paid off especially well with these. To test an extreme example, I cut multiple thin strips from a 10-foot 2 X 12. The board buddies allowed me to rip dozens of very narrow strips (about 1/16th inch) with only ONE set up! I did not have to use those "thin-strip jigs" which are often inaccurate and a nuisance since you must move the fence for each strip.

I just upgraded to a 60 gallon Ingersol Rand compressor so I changed out a number of items that I was using with my old 20 gallon compressor. Initially (when I bought the 20 gallon comp) I had gone to my local Home Depot and picked up some of the fittings and couplers I would need. They served well until the upgrade. Reading some of the reviews for Milton I thought I would try their fittings and couplers. After they arrived I put a male connection onto one of my new spray guns and then connected the hose (with the Home Depot coupler). Didn't work! The old coupler wouldn't accept this Milton. Surprise, surprise!
Design: The blade is allowed to go down so far it hits the floor or cuts into your work bench. There is an adjustable stop bar at the rear left, but it's useless.  The plastic wing nut doesn't hold the bar tight enough to stop the arm.  The Dewalt and Ridgid both use a bolt that creates a solid stop.  There is slop in the arm mechanism, which allows the blade to move about 1/8" side-to-side. Furthermore, there is slop in the motor's bearing, adding another 1/16" drift in the blade.  The Dewalt has absolutely no play.  I don't recall the Ridgid having this kind of slop neither.  The mechanism to lock the arm down is a stupid chain that hooks to the bottom of the handle.  Most other saws use the same chain lock.  But the Dewalt, has a well thought out pin you simply push to lock, pull to unlock. Adjust the Makita's fence requires a tool.  Dewalt and Ridgid are tool-less.  Makita has no tool holder to retain the fence and blade tool.  Although Dewalt and Ridgid require a tool to replace the blade, they have places to secure the tool so it doesn't get lost.  The Makita's base is narrower than Dewalt and Ridgid.  A wider base makes it easier to stabilize stock.

In the past I've used Dewalt, Makita and PC reciprocating saws extensively and most others on the market and none of them have performed like this.  I think the best part of this saw is the lack of vibration while cutting, it far outperfroms the others.  That said, there are also easy blade changes (watch out they're hot if you've just been using them) the detachable cord (love those things, got a couple of other Milwaukee tools with that and it couldn't be better), adjustable shoe, orbital action, and speed control dial.  I can't think of anything else they should put on the saw except for maybe someplace to rest a 12 ounce can of something cold.  I recommend this without reservation over every other saw on the market today.
3060	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have two DW733 planers. I bought one new and it came with a plastic hood. Nice because you could just snap it on and off. But it would sometimes fall off from the vibration. I ordered this hood for my 2nd planer which I bought used and didn't come with a hood. Much nicer! Screws on SOLID and won't vibrate off. Ok, so you have to unscrew it to access the knives...but how often is that done anyways?

3709	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a really good blade. It's held up for years and sharpens very well. I got it on sale and it was a bargin! Cuts 8/4 White Oak like butter when sharp (as it should)! I can cross cut well over a thousand  sq. feet 2.25" of W.O. flooring with it before it needs to be sharpened.
If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.

6544	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this a while back and have used on different occasions and really like it and have nothing bad to say about it.
I had read where someone recommended sanding off the ridges on the two attachments that come with the hose. Don't bother. Just keep push in and take out one of the attachments. The gray end of the hose attachment adapter is pliable and will stretch out enough that one can insert attachments without too much difficulty.

This this is BIG.  It's not especially heavy, just big. It takes up much more room that a standard miter saw. The sliding mechanism is the primary culprit. The old saw stand in my shop, is now a laundry cabinet in the basement.  I had to build an all new, BIGGER, cabinet.

4289	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I picked up the basic Freud SD206 6" stacked dado set on sale at a local hardware store.  Despite what some reviewers have written here, I had no problem mouting this dado stack on my DeWalt 746 table saw.  Granted, when all of the chippers are in use the arbor is completely filled - but it does fit.  After making many 1/2" deep and 3/4" wide cuts in white oak I found the performance of this dado stack to be excellent.  There was no chipping or tearout whatsoever when I was cutting with the grain and only very minor chipping when cutting across the grain.  The dado cuts were very smooth on all surfaces and the bottom of the cut was perfectly flat.  Also, I was happy to see that the shims included were of very high quality (thin metal rather than paper).
6060	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This little unit makes drilling nice, straight dowels a breeze. Just mark your center on the side of the stock, line it up with the line on the jig, clamp it on, set your drill depth, and go! Doesn't get much easier than this. I'm curious to see how long the inserts last. Even if they don't last forever, I'll replace them or just get a new one. A must for your shop, if you use dowels at all.

  So why not just buy pre-hung doors and not bother to deal with it? The problem is that in order to trim the jamb to the thickness of the wall, you have to remove it from the door, disassemble it, then run it through the table saw, then reattach it. Or, in the event of a wall thicker than the pre-hung jamb, having to live with a seam, or a very large molding to cover it. With this kit, you can buy doors that are not pre-hung, and buy jamb boards that are wider than the jamb, trim them to size on your saw, then assemble for installation. Additionally you might want to create your jamb out of something other than the standard pine.

No incentive was received for this review - I just really like this product!!
7424	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my first router table, and for the last two weeks I've been making cabinet doors and wainscoting like a professional.  While the fence is not quite like that of a saw table as suggested in Kreg's video, the point is that both sides move in unison even though you must lock the fence on two sides. (No big deal.) I can't imagine trying to square both sides independently. That brings up the microadjuster, which unfortunately is sold separately instead of being bundled. With the fence and the microadjuster, you really can make precise cuts that are accurate beyond 64ths.  In making the transition from rough carpentry to cabinet making, I've found that you have to at least double your precision.  This is a game of 64ths, not 16ths, and the Kreg table allows for this without taking up valuable time. Attaching the router to the plate is daunting, and you really should use a drill press to make holes for your router screws, though I succeeded without one by using a portable drill with a level and proceeding with care. I have made coping cuts primarily by using a coping sled, but I have made square cuts using the miter slot.  This is easy because the fence squares in unison and is parallel to the miter slot. Moreover, because you can precisely level the router plate with the four levelers, everything--sleds, wood, jigs--slide across the table top. (I test for level by running a business card across the top until it catches on nothing.) Thanks to the metal stand and the table top, my 3.5hp router from Milwaukee does not shake the system when it runs at max. speed. I wish Kreg would do more of the fence assembly, but anyone seeking to move away from IKEA furniture and beadboard wainscoting should be willing to invest the time.  If you don't try to assemble the system with power tools/speed ratchets or pretend that plastic is steel, you won't break anything.  And the power to create precise, raised paneled cabinets and wainscoting DYI will not only prevent your kitchen and library remodeling from resembling a bad episode of Renovation Realities, it will allow you to make real hardwood stuff that will put the plywood/mdf professionals to shame.

3141	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These Bosch blades worked nicely with my older Makita jig saw to make some fairly tight curved cuts in 3/4" hard maple. The cuts made by these 12TPI blades were actually fairly smooth and didn't require too much additional clean up. The two blades that I've used so far still seem sharp and cut well. I've used many other Bosch jig saw blades over the years and they always seemed to be good quality. I think these blades are also decently made and reasonably priced at five to a pack.
I have used it for several heavy-duty projects over the past few months, routing all manner of wood species -- oak, maple, cherry, poplar, as well as several softwoods.  Whether doing edge profiles, tongue-and-groove joints, tenons, or a variety of other applications, the motor just keeps cutting without any hesitation.  And I've really put it to the test, giving it a workout in several  projects, running it continuously for over a half hour at a time, pushing one 6-foot-long board after another through it.  Then I'll turn it off, adjust the height, and run it again for another half hour of constant, heavy use.  Sometimes I even take a cut that's a little deeper than I should, but nevertheless, the motor never bogs down.

This DeWalt magnetic tip holder does an excellent job magnetizing your drill bit which then holds your screws to the bit.  If you have this tip holder and use a T25 Torx bit, you're just about guaranteed not to drop or have a screw fall off the bit.  The extendable screw sleeve can go over the length of the screw and provide further protection and even free up a hand when drilling overhead.  I don't use this feature all the time, but it's sure nice to have it there.  This summer I used the bit installing gutters and it was a real time and headache saver.  A contractor friend of mine who uses his drill 8 hours a day said if he lost or broke his magnetic tip holder; he'd go home for the day!

7027	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this to clean the gutters, which means I'm propping the ladder on the edge of our rood.  I liked it at first, but after a few uses it starting shifting position when when I was on top of the ladder which is pretty terrifying.  The hardware that fastens it to the ladder needs to be re-considered.
7586	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The relief area where the two mounting screw holes are was too tight and would not allow the insert to sit flush. Used the dremel to open up the area a little bit and now it slips right in place. It could be due to variations in the saw, 10" Deltas aren't exactly "high precision" machines. Any way, it fits now and serves it purpose. The price was worth not going through any aggrevation of trying to make one.
My one complaint is that, as one other reviewer pointed out, they don't apply pressure to force the pieces to "meet."  Imagine having another person holding your pieces but simply holding them perfectly square, not pressing them together.  Of course, this "press" is easily accomplished with another clamp or two.

I've been using it to trim out a house in a very cheap (Delta MS250) mitre saw and it has really exceeded all my expectations. I've made hundreds of cuts in PFJ millwork with almost zero tearout. I've since bought a couple other Freud blades that I've been very happy with. I do have to say that I am a noob at this and my only other hands on experience is with the blades that came in my saws (all cheap ones!)
7405	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've gone through so many router tables that I've filled up our local metal disposal plant.  However, I finally got a keeper.

I couldn't get those to work, but the standard (non T-slot) method pulls a cone headed screw up that pushes the plastic out and this holds very well. The featherboard is not as strong as a wood one but it seems to hold pretty well, how much force do you need to hold the wood against the fence? (I'm responding to the negative reviews here). The push stick is a necessity for a table saw, the push block would be more useful for a jointer (which I don't have) than for a table saw, but I've used mine when dadoing small stock. Overall - happy with this starter set.

This thing is clear, made in Mexico, fits the router perfectly and allows you to use a full range of bits. Yes, you can make one if you want or buy this one and wonder why it wasn't included in the first place. For that I knocked off a star.

It made it easy to install. The plate is machined well and fits perfectly. The 'snugging' corners work well and provide a solid secure fit. The center rings are not a problem to snap in or out. You want them tight, so I would expect to use some pressure to remove.
2974	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This thing is so well designed and assembles so easily (2 screws), that I  was cutting parts with a big smile on my face within 10 minutes of opening  the box!  The controls are where they should be, the air hose is just  strong enough to do the job. Blade changing takes less than 30 seconds and  the tension adjustment is superbly designed (turns the correct way and is  even labeled!).  FURTHERMORE, THE SAW IS WHISPER QUIET!!!  It purrs....  The table is solid.  The base is well designed and encloses all the moving  parts (keeps the dust out and makes it EASY to clean up).  Beveling is a  breeze.  The saw is so much fun to use that I wish they would have  shipped it with a pair of extra motor brushes.  Now..if they could just  make an attachment to the work-clamp (little plastic pieces or something)  that won't scratch really delicate work...  Life is too short for cheap  tools.  I'm not rich (just barely out of school), but I'm glad I scrapped  together the money to buy this saw rather than wasting my time and getting  frustrated with the other junk I have seen on the market.
routing, rabbeting, fluting, groving, etc., it's well worth it.

The plastic does wear off, but not until after a long time of hard use.  It use them at the miter saw table all the time.  Makes it easier to cope molding when it is clamped to something solid.
As you can see none of this is major... that why I five star this! Its an awesome tool and I love mine... may even give it a name :P
9611	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As always, DeWalt surpasses themselves.  Great quality.
Set up time is more than anyone would like, but unless you're able to use a router, this makes a nice cut.
I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5, because of the wrench problem. But as I said before the end product is really nice, so it is worth the little extra effort. Highly recommend this one.

Since I wear hearing protection with ALL power tools I cannot comment on how loud it is. (My ears don't ring all the time, either.)  The dust bag, as is usual with all dust bags, doesn't work and I haven't used it since the first try.  The shop vac does the trick.

If you have a smaller table saw and need dado or groove cuts for a job, get this blade. I can't wait to try it out at max width.
4157	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I upgraded to this freud dial a dado switching from the freud SD508 set.  All in all I like it.  However I do find it annoying that if you want to make a standard size dado (say 3/8") you have to look at the chart no matter what to figure out how to set it up.  Rather than use three 1/8" chippers it says to use the two outside blades, the 3/32" chipper and 16 clicks.  I find it annoying to have to pull the chart out every time to find out how many clicks each setup needs.  Also the included wrench does not fit a Sawstop table saw.  This is really not that big of an issue tough because the Sawstop arbor nut is wide enough to fit inside the dial a dado knob and still get Sawstop's blade wrenches on it.  I did install the full width dado on the Sawstop only to find that the arbor isn't quite long enough to support it safely, but that's ok too because I will never use the dado set to its full width.  I find it a little dangerous and would much rather use a smaller setup and make more passes.  The pros: The cuts are flawless as you would expect from any freud product.  Also not having to use shims to micro adjust your dado is great.  The carbides are also larger than the ones of the SD508.  I would recommend this set to any woodworker ... just don't lose that chart.

Surprisingly, even this ladder has a little bounce when maxxed out on the length, but if it's properly set up at least you feel secure while you're up there.  Adjusting the height is a breeze, just stand it up and pull on the rope, with a nice, heavy KER-THUNK at each level.  If you handle by yourself, it does take some strength in your rope hand, but you'll get the hang of it after a few times.

5689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This router table is made pretty well. I like how solid it feels and how easy the fence is to use. My two complaints are the lack of a power switch for the router (you have to open the front cabinet door to turn it off and on). Also, the screws for the miter fence vibrate out. Other then those two small items, works great.

Maybe: it works great, doesn't leak, is easy to maneuver, stays on the floor, stays flexible, has visible color, provides nice working distance. That's about it. Buy it if you are in the market for a hose.

I did not have any damage to the box or the bench from shipping that some others reported.  The workbench comes partially assembled.  It took me less than 30 minutes to unpack parts and to complete assembly.  I like that the workbench has two hight settings, and that jaws are removable, and that the front jaw can be used for clamping in both vertical and horizontal positions.

Here's my setup: I don't have a professional shop by any means. I have an older style Jet "lunch box" planer, and a newer Grizzly 6" jointer. They do the jobs I need them to do, but both machines have been a huge headache when it comes to chip/dust collection. I have some 4" dust collection hose from Grizzly as well as some of their hose clamps. The planer did not come with any kind of built-in collection port, so I retrofit one of my own from plywood. The jointer has a built-in port. My collector is an inexpensive 1hp shop fox dust collector.
 I highly recommend buying this Freud blade.

I was skeptical about this tool after previous reviewers complained of an annoying ringing sound, but I either cannot hear this or it just does not bother me.

2171	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great saw, and they've improved the dust collection -- my only complaint with an older model.  Buying it from Amazon/toolcrib, however, is a nuisance.  Trying to get presales support was useless, with conflicting information or tech people just reading me things from the web site.  More importantly, the delivery time they gave me was a window of more than two weeks, and it took nearly 3 weeks to get the thing.  AND, it arrived BROKEN.  Fortunately, Dewalt is sending me a new one, but clearly someone had dropped this saw along the way since the lockdown pin was bent and the handle housing was broken.  I bought from amazon only because they had a (...) when I bought the saw, but the price they quoted changed from day to day on the web site.
- The cut leaves two small over cuts in the corners of the dado.  If you raise your saw up so it is supposed to cut 1/4" the entire middle will be exactly the same but in each corner of the cut there will be a small corner that is a bit deeper in the shape of a triangle (blade).  If you have any exposed dado's then you need to cut a bit shy of your final and shave it into place.  This isn't ideal but for 1/3 the price of the nice sets I can't complain.

Yes that's right on the first cut.  The straight blades are better than these semicircular type with less surface to heat and are typically much thicker.

I tried to find out where they're made but I couldn't find any information on the Lenox home page. They're not marked as American made, and Lenox brags that they have over 2,500 employees world wide, so they may well be made in Asia or Mexico or somewhere else, but they are a well made saw, more than capable of commercial use in the trades.

The tool seems well built, has adequate power, and I do not need a tilting fence for beveled joints.  The fence height adjustment could be a little easier, but I almost always use 3/4" stock so I rarely have to adjust it. It does make a disconcerting rattle when it is shut off, but this seems to be normal.  The price is also reasonable for what is basically an angle grinder with a fence and carbide blade.  If you are a typical hobbyist like me, then this joiner is all you'll ever need.  Save yourself the $...that you would need to spend on the fancier models for biscuits, glue, stock, etc.

Compared to buying a dedicated mortiser or doing it by hand this tool is chpear than the former and quicker than the latter. The good things are that it does work. Once you have it installed, aligned, and tweaked it seems to work fine. I use it in oak without a problem. People who are burning or breaking bits may need to adjust the position of the dril vs the position of the square chisel. Or maybe they have a defect of some sort. It seems to help if you back out often and allow the bit to clear itself of debris.

I had the Milwaukee Magnum 10" but sold it because it was too heavy and hard to use. These Makita 10" saws have a great feel to them and are prefered by our crews. We have never had a repair problem with them except for truing the fence which gets knocked out of square after extended use as is typical with all miter saws I've used. Overall the best 10" saw out there.
2593	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	My father builds houses and has had his current Milwaukee saw for 15 years. I have always wanted one and was slightly dissapointed when this one arrived. Not built as heavy duty as they used to be and I was shocked to see the MADE IN CHINA wording on the saw's spec sticker. I was hoping I was paying extra versus most saws for USA made but unfortunately I was not. My only gripe is the tilt-lok handle has to be placed to lowest angle setting to fit in the case and the cord is not grounded. Has a nice weight to it and is very easy to get straight cuts out of. Included blade is decent.
A large black wing-nut similarly adjusts the angle (or bevel) of cut, and the angle is shown with a pointer (my old Craftsman did not have any method for showing the angle, so this seems like a luxury).

Very versatile for many uses.  A quality product and good weight for a wide range of products.  I would advise anyone doing general carpentry or jobs around the house to get this straight claw version.  It is much more versatile for prying where as you can always put a block under the claw to make up for no curve.  The curved claws can be difficult to get in/under tight places.  One last tip.  If you decide to get this, or any other hammer, find a metal surface or tool to hit the hammer against.  If it dings ( like a chime), then it has an air bubble in it.  It'll drive you nuts if have a lot of nails to hammer.  Send it back till you get one that doesn't.
704	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These work great. REMEMBER TO NOT TOUCH THE BULB WITH YOUR FINGERS. Remove from package with a tissue and insert with a tissue. Otherwise, the oil from your skin will cause the bulb to fail in just a couple of weeks. It took me a lot of bulbs to learn this lesson.  Under continuous use, these have lasted on average about a year.

They will cut anything you want to cut with power to spare. The quick change blade clamp is very simple and  very useful . The orbital action is great for speeding up any cutting job  in anything except metal. Just watch for splinters. The variable speed  makes it much easier to start a cut.  The only complaint I have with the  saw is that it vibrates a whole lot. My hands go numb after only a few  minutes with this saw. If Porter cable would put a counter balance in like  Milwaukee , this would be a 5 star saw.

With previous deck builds, it makes it nearly impossible to pull deck boards together and hold them tight enough by one person. With this, not only does it make it easier to pull the boards together but easy to hold them in place. Nearly all 5/4 decking has a small bow in it but this helps to pull that bow out and hold it in place. What would normally take a couple days to put deck boards on, especially if it is pretty high in the air like mine, now takes a couple hours.

4794	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a very good hose to hook up to a strong vacuum for floor and shop cleaning.  It works well also for connecting power hand tools (orbital and belt sanders, etc.)  Because the internal surface is not smooth, and  because it is only 2 1/2" in diameter, I would not expect to link  several 12-foot lengths together without substantially reducing air flow.  The 12 feet works out well on a portable vacuum.  If you use this with a  stationary vacuum and need more than 12 feet of length, then you will  probably need a 2-3 hp vacuum to do a decent job.

No relief to back off vacuum pressure which was very helpful for selective vacumming with theCraftsman handle. after three different attempts at adapters I finally cut up a wand.

6358	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These Pony cabinet claws are absolutely perfect.  There is nothing more I can say about them!  They made my cabinet install a breeze to be sure, BUT I couldn't help but notice that Menards has the same Pony claws for $59.98.  The only difference that I can tell is that these have a "vise" type bolt handle on them, whereas the model 8510 at Menards has a different handle more akin to a bicycle handle, and these are painted orange instead of bare aluminum.  Other than that, there is no difference.  To be quite honest, there is no need to wrench down on these like a vise.  They work just fine hand tightened.  These appear to be some sort of updated version?  I don't know.  I ordered mine from Amazon prior to noticing them at Menards, and immediately felt like a sucker.  Do yourself a favor, unless Amazon reduces the price of these, save yourself a few bucks and just go to Menards.  Save time and shipping, and walk out of the store $16.84 richer with a great product in hand.  Other than that, these Pony claws are the way to go!

Pleasantly surprised to see the saw guard by the power switch is made from aluminum, and not plastic like the original I took off. The alignment dowel pins the cast iron riser were ever so slightly off at the top - but after I started tightening the large bolt, it instantly lined itself up. I would recommend taking a file to all contact points between the riser and your bandsaws cast iron structure to eliminate burrs and chips, excessive paint, etc.

 Installation of this splitter with a Delta Unifence installed is a real hassle. It is obviously intended to partner-up with the Biesemeyer fence instead, which does not have the round rear guide bar to restrict access to the back of ones' saw. Of course, once the installation block is affixed and aligned, it should not require any attention. The quick-disconnect feature works very well, and the splitter reinstalls in perfect alignment each time.

The price was in line of all sources I reviewed.
Sure, I can make one, but for me it's more fun to use my saw to make other stuff, rather than more stuff just to use the table saw. Considering the value of my labor, materials and TIME, obviously I think its worth it (and I am cheap as hell.)
There are three settings - really bright, kinda' bright, and off.  The light is a little bluish, which makes white pages stand out really well.

It's not fragile, and the LED lights will make the batteries last a long time.  Far and away the best reading light I've ever owned.
Overall a great little hobby table, but probably not to useful for any real production work.

thank you so much happy new year
9870	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Do not buy this level.  It is not accurate.  When the bubble is centered in the horizontal position it is actually not level.  I returned the first one I received and got a replacement.  The second was just as bad as the first.  To make matters even worse, the bubble is small and the lines are far apart so the bubble doesn't touch the lines.  That makes it very hard to tell if the bubble is in the center.  I placed it on top of a large contractor's level just to be sure, and the bubble was way off center on this one when the contractor's level bubble was centered.

5554	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This ended up doing what I wanted but not as slickly as I hoped for.  The description didn't give me a complete picture of how this would work.  I had hoped it would slip over or into the 4" exhaust on my bandsaw, it didn't.  It also is 4" so I cut it down to about 3/4" lenghth and duct taped it to the bandsaw.  My 2 1/2" shopvac hose fits perfectly on the other end.  I'm happy with this arrangment since it kept the price down for the modification.

As a cabinetmaker, I use my Starrett squares for layout work all day, every day. Of all my hand tools, this square has brought me the most unqualified performance and enjoyment of any tool I own. The action is smooth, the gradients on the rule are precise and clear, and the quality is beyond compare. This is typical of all Starrett products. Starrett is not flashy and not given to gimmicky marketing tricks. They just produce top quality tools. Period. Precise measurements and layouts make all the difference in woodworking and machining, and you will get what you pay for. I would recommend any Starrett product.

Why a small quality table even if you're NOT a contractor?
This table is great for the DIY woodworker.  It stores easily (mine living under my radial arm saw until I need it).  I keep one my Dewalt DW618PK fixed base installed, and just snap the motor in place when I need to use it.
If you can get the Freud on sale, snatch it up. It won't let you down.

  This blade is also super for cutting calking or paint along joints when dismantling wood trim that has to be reinstalled. Run it along the calked wallboard or plaster to wood joint and you can pull the trim piece off without tearing the paint or wallpaper on the adjacent wall. I used to use a razor knife for this; I also used to make a lot of slash marks on the walls and trim.
9873	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I could not have done my recent tigerwood deck project without this tool.  For much of the decking, I was able to work all by myself.  I was just a matter of getting the wrench in the right position on the joist so it would lock in place, leaving my hands free to screw down the board.
Despite that, I haven't found an LED bulb to date that gives me as brilliant and natural a light as halogens.

I haven't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed.  Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money, and that my projects are relatively basic, this seemed to be a good match.  I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.

As for the fence, I agree with the great majority, I had to play with it.

I agree with those dissatisfy, Jet needs to come up with a better fence system so the end away from the locking mechanism does not swing.

6243	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are a lot of reciprocating saws on the market today; unfortunately some masquerade as a 'Sawzall', but Milwaukee invented the genre decades ago and, quite frankly, nothing is even in the same league as a genuine 'Sawzall'.  DeWalt, Makita, Ryobi, Hitachi, Porter Cable all make reciprocating saws; some are professional grade, some say they are and some are just consumer models.  When you decide either through using lesser tools or simply want to own the very best, Milwaukee stands head and shoulders above the competition in the reciprocating saw market.
5601	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price, fits right, quick delivery.
4993	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I received a hand me down DW705 with a busted dust collection bag from a friend.  After reading all the negative reviews on amazon, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this replacement, but did go ahead nevertheless.  First, the bag fits perfectly, is the same size and design than the original one and even has DeWalt written in big yellow letters all over it (not shown on picture).  After working with my new old miter saw for a day, I looked into the bag and it was full of saw dust.  Maybe half of the dust was not collected, but that still means that half was and for me that is better than having no a bag at all.  Let's be clear, the bag simply collects the dust that is "thrown" its way by the saw as it cuts through the wood. If not all the dust is collected, it is because of this a passive collection method and NOT a feature of this specific replacement part.  When cutting pressure treated wood, the intake of the bag can occasionally get clogged with the moist sawdust.  Overall, I am very happy.
2175	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used these in my Ridgid flashlight since I can not find any locally. They fit perfect and are very bright. Hopefully they last as long as people say they do.


2590	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Brightness is very poor for an 18V light. Beam quality is terrible for a modern flashlight. The reflector can't be focused and isn't o-ring sealed. It is well balanced, stands on it's own with no problem, and is easy to point.
Didn't get a case with it, but don't expect to remove it from the table so won't miss it much. The guide will end up stuffed in one of the bin's in my shop hutch and will probably live out its life there. The finish could have been better, but I don't plan on displaying it, and it doesn't effect its operation. Overall I am pleased with the router and plan to buy another to install in another table, and leave it set up with a 3/4 straight bit for cutting dadoes. For the price and what you get, power/smooth operation/easy adjustment, I don't think you can beat the deal. I think its a perfect table router. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the "manual".
I like the feel and balance of the hammer but the leather wrapped handle is just not working for me.  I plan to continue to use the hammer with the hope that in time the leather wrap will soften and become tacky.  I purchased another hammer last week with a rubber handle which I use now more than this hammer.
6058	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A friend of mine gave me this as he had long since upgraded to a bigger and better dust collection system.
I wish it had a third "extra dim" setting.
Wood expands or contracts depending on ambient moisture levels. Mr. Hoadley shows you how to calculate how much your wood will "move" in response to this, but to do so you must first know the initial moisture level in your wood. (The calculations are not complicated, by the way.)
It is just as effective to select the dado blade set, with no shims,  for a groove a little undersize. Then make a slight rabbet cut on the inserted board (shelf) to fit the dado, like fitting a tenon to a mortise. Use a piloted rabbet bit in a router to make the fitting cut. Once adjusted to depth, you can repeat the process accurately as many times as the project requires.

3952	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I received the SD206 6" Dado Set and immediatly noted some differences in what was advertised and what was received. The SD206M has 20 teeth (10 on each outside blade) and not the 24 that is advertised. Popular Woodwooker as recently as their April 2001 issue listed the set with 12 teeth as well as on the case the set arrived in.  Another point, the blades also have a polished finish as opposed to earlier versions matte black oxide that are often illustrated. Such was the overwhelming body of data I was concerned that perhaps I had received a "knock-off" instead of the real Freud.  So...I ended up calling Freud's 800 number and was reassured that the 6" version indeed has less teeth than advertised. Once something is put in print, I guess it's just assumed to be true.

3717	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The base is an absolute necessity for a saw such as my Unisaw. It weights more than 350 pounds and it cannot be moved around the shop without this mobile base.

But, I am happy that I now have a very accurate square. I won't try to return it for a third one. It's too much hassle. I just hope that the one that I am keeping doesn't start to rust where the finish was scratched from the blade.
Well you might not, but I do.  I work for a commercial cabinet company and have found this to be an invaluable tool over the last 25 months.  I know this already has a lot of reviews, but I wanted to say I have owned it for two years and it is still dead on.  I ordered the smaller Denali the other day since I need to measure tight spaces once in a while and it was off by .7 so I sent it back.  I will most likely give it another try and I know it is 1/4 - 1/5 the price (depending on the day you log on to Amazon) but I saw no way to adjust it when it was off so very far.

5819	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I decided to purchase the Bench Dog to replace my stamped metal router table.  Everything fit together well and the table works great. My only concern is with the plastic router mounting plate. There are numerous "pre-drilled" and countersunk holes in the plate for some of the different routers that can be installed. However, I wanted to install a router (Milwaukee 3 1/2 HP) that didn't have the "pre-drilled" holes. So using the supplied template I made my own holes in the plate.  Some of the countersinks that I drilled overlapped some of the existing holes.  I don't like all the extra unused holes in the router plate because I feel that it weakens it.  I guess I would feel better if I could have used some of the existing holes because it is a lot of extra work to make your own. Also, I still need to drill one more hole for the top adjusting T-wrench.  It would be nice if you could purchase a plate from Bench Dog with only mounting holes to fit the router you want to install.
I only mention LED bulbs because they now cheap and will use one-tenth of the energy of these.  I am looking for good WARM WHITE LED;s to replace these.  Until then, these are wonderful.
Make sure these will fit your clamps or they will be as useless for you as they are for  me.

220	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great book light. I love it! I've had it for a while now, and use it all the time while working on my laptop computer. It does seem to go through batteries fast, but that is not a deterrent for me. I really don't know how I got along without it! The only thing I would suggest to improve this, is to put some horizontal grooves on the front part of the clip so that it doesn't slip out of your fingers. Other than that, great product! I would highly recommend!

8842	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As expected the combination square arrived perfectly square (unlike the $15.00 one I got at the big box store), with engraved precise scale markings (instead of the stamped and crude markings on the cheapo one).
5391	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Fast shipping good price.
These clamps are an industry standard.
The set comes in a plastic case with very thin plastic spacers to separate the chippers and blades.  I don't think these will hold up very well, but it will be easy enough to make substitutes.  There's a useful DVD behind the foam in the upper section of the case, along with a chart showing how to combine the blades and chippers for various widths.
5290	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as described.
In that the protractor is only 6" wide it will only extend marks 3" out from center, with care one could probably extend these marks another three or four inches without too much loss in accuracy.  I would like to see Incra offer a 12" and possibly a 18" model using slightly thicker  aluminum and the same precision.  I do recommend this fine tool.


If you didn't know, there is a place for a spare bulb inside the head of the flashlight, so a 2 pack is the perfect size.

tool pros, stick to factory original parts like this
4337	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am very happy with this product.  I bought it for one particular project that I was working on, and it did the job wonderfully.  I may not use it again for a year, but it's a tool that is well-made and is worth having for the times it is needed.  Was very reasonably priced, as well.
One thing - DON'T LET IT FREEZE!!! It will last for years if kept cool and dark but it will be toast if it freezes. Don't ask me how I know this.
I am very impressed with the quality of this air hose.  This is a great air hose at a great price.  I highly recommend this hose.

2605	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	It is just OK but certainly not worth the price. Should have got two for the price and I think Dewalt should increase the price of their saw and include them with the saw.

Thinking it over, I should have returned this piece of junk as soon as I opened it, but it was already too close to Christmas to take a chance on getting another before then, and I had to finish the projects I was working on (all of which included having to plane end-grain).  So it took me many hours to get the sole relatively flat so that I could finish the project I was worried about.  Luckily I was able to sharpen the blade successfully (finishing with an 8000 grit stone), and it took a good edge.

Anyway, the run cap was totally melted down so I took the motor to a local repair technician that spent 2 hours talking to me and diagnosing the motor. He hooked up a new run cap and bench tested it first. Everything sounded fine but a squeal started emitting from inside of the motor. So he pulled the motor apart only to find the inside full of wood dust. The wood entered through the holes in the case where the cap wires pass through. Then HE said "Not good". The windings were discolored. They began to overheat causing more resistance in the windings causing the run cap to overheat causing the cap to catch fire.
6929	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love these stabilizers. They work great on uneven surfaces. No more blocking up the ladder. These are easy to install as well.
Please don't go try a craftsman... UG! I've done that which is why I went top drawer this time. Tools are meant to last a lifetime and this is a proud machine to own. What a beautiful soft start to this powerhouse !
1381	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have not received a bad bulb.  I haven't kept track of how long they last but as cheap as they are, I feel like its a great deal. much cheaper that the box stores i use to buy them at and i think they last just as long.

2599	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this edge guide to go with my 618. I have used it to route dados, rabbets, through cuts and some straight inlays. It make it so much easier. Take light passed and be sure your work is secured and you have a straight line. It makes setup 10x faster for routing the sliding dovetail shelves I built. Take the guesswork out and line it up by eye, secure it, route. One tip, be sure the fence is on your waste side of your route, if applicable. Any slippage or missteps will be routed away later, Saves headache on those expensive chunks of hardwood.  LOVE this guide.

UPDATE 04/15/2006

The top on my case closed off to one side just a bit.  By twisting the open top counter-clockwise, I "bent" the metal so that it now closes uniformly.
I could've continued to use the system like that but I had some extra foam weather stripping laying around so I ran that between the seam of the lid and the can to help fill any gaps. That made the fit pretty snug. I don't know if that improved the performance at all, but I felt better knowing that the lid fit more snuggly.
1792	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had one  of these sanders before and loved it my hand s never got numb using this tool. Clamping the paper is a little different than others but to me it really doesn't matter
8908	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the second shark saw I have owned.  I bought the 1st one about 10 years ago and it still cuts like it was brand new.  These tools are excellent for getting into places where electric tools won't get to with greater precision.  If you store them carefully you will get years and years of use out of them.  They are excellent for trimming door jams for putting in tile or new wood floors just set the tile or wood down and the saw will do the rest.  Since these are pull saws they are easy to get started with just 1 or 2 pull strokes.  Excellent hand tools for an excellent price.
6428	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Must have for cabinet installation! A well thought out and constructed tool. There is a pivoting drill guide that is placed just right where you need it to pilot for screwing your stile together, once you've drilled, it pivots out of the way so you can install the screw.

6913	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It's a pipe wrench. Don't know what else to say, it's lightweight and sturdy and a good addition to our tool collection.

8665	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like the tough nylon handle because its texture grips your hand compared to the slicker "leather" handle of the same weight. As with any Estwing, the first thing you notice is its craftsmanship and extraordinary balance. The former means it will last for many years of everyday work; the latter makes a difference when you swing it half a day during remodeling jobs or light demolition. Make sure you get this one; I'm happy I did.

The Pana... had excellent reviews and people wrote of them lasting 10 to 15 years.  Sounds great, but I'm not aware of many Pana... power tools so finding service or additional parts might be difficult.  So I went for the Milwaukee.
With me working by myself about 95% of the time, this has saved me A LOT of time and frustration!

6524	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nice insert and was fairly easy to install and use. It works as advertised and recommend it.
2796	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It is heavy duty and his heavier than the average cirlular saw.  I just used it cutting pressure  treated 6x6 timers and cut through them like butter.  The guide is different than I am used to.  Your drawn line does not align with with the edge of the slot  thus the blade.  There is a mark on the guide next to the slot that you center over your line for the blade to cut on the line. May be able to adjust thiss but thats the way it came.  Just have to get acustom to it.

5298	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't find one of these at any of the "big box stores" so I got it from here, which is better anyway since I probably would have paid more at the store I'm sure. These wheels don't wear down for a long time. I've still got the original in my 500X and that's after sharpening at least 100 bits many times over. In my opinion the grinding wheel is better than the machine itself, at least the 500X (see my review for that if you wish).

8979	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent dado for the price.  You could pick up a better one, but you'll probably pay an extra $75 or more.  It creates smooth, flat bottomed dadoes in red oak, pine, and MDF.  I haven't tried it on anything else.  The set comes with a reasonable set of shims, which allowed me to cut the precise widths that I needed.

4215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just built a 650 sq ft deck with this bad boy. I already know its great for trim but cutting a 1" X 6" on a 45 degree angle was when i needed a slider. it made probably close to 500 cuts in Ipe lumber which we know is some hard wood. Oddly enough the dust colector worked pretty well also which is not something you see everyday on a slider.
I really like this table.  The table looks great, and feels more rigid than some of the ones I looked at in the store.  I like the dust collection port on the back as well.  I've only used it a few times so far, but it's worked great.  The cabinet-style is nice, when not in use I can stash my depth gauge and push sticks inside it.  The fence is easily adjustable, and it is easy to make zero-tolerance fences that you can swap out when needed.  I did notice that the cabinet seems to reverberate the noise from my router, and it actually sounds louder when inside the table.  I am planning on adding some thin pieces of foam to the inside walls to deaden the noise a little bit.
Light lasts a long time on XRP batteries 3-4 hours continuous use
- power adapter does not justify paying twice as much for this book light given the long battery life and the inconvenience of running an electric wire on your bed
The black end fits perfectly on the Fein vac.  The grey end is flexible plastic that works with just about everything. It slips right over the outside of a typical 1.25" vacuum hose wand. I use this for dust collection with a wide range of tools.  It works better on some Festool tools than the Festool hose does.  The Fein step adaptor is useful for some tools:
6572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The bar clamp is an excellent invention and it's useful in so many different applications. I hadn't used a mini bar clamp until borrowing a cheap one from my neighbor.  I used it to hold and glue a small item.  The clamp I borrowed (not the Irwin clamp)  was cheap, flimsy, unreliable but with some creative effort it worked.
  Anyway, I find set-up to be a simple two step process: (1) slip on the collar and the load the desired size mortise bit/chisel, and (2) bolt the auxiliary fence to your table.  Too keep everything square, I just clip a 12-inch ruler or straight stick to the back side of the chisel and set the fence at the desired clearance on both ends of the ruler.

1905	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have had my PC for almost a year at this point. The soft start, the plunge, the variable speed controls, the on/off switch on the handle and the micro-meter adjustment are all wonderful. The chip deflector will fall off every so often but it is okay as well. My only problem was the space age looking guide that I had to buy extra. It looked as if it would be perfect as it too has a micro-meter adjustment. However, the guide itself would never stay where it was set so the router wandered. Very dissapointed in this and wish PC would fix it. Without question, I would buy another one as the power is great as is the finish.
8626	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought 2 of these compressors - one for me and one for my son.  Each of our compressors has failed in the identical fashion, his multiple times.  I think the basic compressor, i.e. the electric motor and vane compressor, is quite solid, but the control circuit which turns the motor on and off is quite cheesy and prone to failure.  It is also *very* expensive to replace.

3309	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Maybe it doesn't take an hour to clean up the sawdust, but I wonder why a lot of people mount it on a "portable station" (maybe to wheel it outside??)This is a well made Compound Slide Miter Saw with one simple problem. Absolutely no thought was put into dust collection (If you were going to permanently mount it in a Workshop!!). The dust bag is absolutely worthless. So if your a contractor that will be using this saw in the great outdoors this is definitely the saw for you (or have it mounted on a Portable stand!!). Sure saws make sawdust (genius!!) but I never owned a miter saw that was this poor in collecting dust.. It was as if the Bosch Engineers where done with the design, and said, "We have made the Best Slide Miter saw in the World", then one said "Ah-Oh we forgot to incorporate Dust Collection", and the other said, "Ah just hang a bag on it"!!. Bottom line, if you can create a saw that has this many innovations, and is as accurate as this, why can't you at least have it set up to connect to a shop vac??

9487	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to shape raw wood into bowls and trays. I have been happy with the results, the cut is fast and reasonably smooth. Use a light touch, as this removes a lot of material in a hurry. (As always, with noisy power tools, eye and ear protection is a must.) The teeth are easy to sharpen with ordinary chainsaw sharpening tools. For a finer finish, I am going to next try one of the sanding wheels.  You'll want to figure out a system to fasten the wood being carved to a fixed point. You want two hands on the tool for control and safety, and unless you are carving a tree trunk, the wood can get tossed around. I like to use my Black and Decker workmate, which I can take outside and let the chips fall where they may. It's hard to devise a good chip collection system for this tool as you are moving around quite a bit and the chips shoot out in all directions.
9235	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This battery seems to fit "snugger" than the original battery. The original seemed to drop-out if it was "seated" exactly. Good quality product...great price for a replacement for my tool.
1) The box becomes an echo chamber for your router.  Routers are loud to begin with, this thing is like having a router inside of a bass drum.  the entire box vibrates and basically amplifies the sound.
2498	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Growing up, I can recall my Dad using a circular saw for everything.  After I purchased a home of my own, and being a bit of a DIY'r, I invested in a miter saw, table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw, none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick (4x4) or wet treated lumber, especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power.  I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.  As a result, I'm looking at other Milwaukee tools.  In fact, I just purchased a Milwaukee 2457-21 power ratchet wrench kit which I am anxious to use.
821	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered these using the data printed on the light cover. The pins are a bit too wide for the fixture. I can get them into the holes, but the bulbs don't light. Filament appears intact. Just checked the continuity through the bulb and it checks out. Checked the bulbs in a second fixture, and they also don't light in that fixture.

  With table and radial arm saws, there is a loud noise [thud, twang, clunk, etc.], THEN you check to see if any body parts, especially extremities, are missing.  Now I can't speak for ALL woodworkers, but my fingers, eyes, arms, major arteries, etc, are worth more than a mere $40usd and the few minutes it takes to install these.  One common example when using a table saw, your blade comes to a hidden knot then. . . thud, twang, clunk, or a chorus of all three!!  Board Buddies help to keep the board on the table where it belongs rather than sliding off the table at high speed and directly at YOU.

4665	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This blade is sweet.  I have been using Freud blades for years and they seem to just get better.  Oh it's not an expensive blade as some blades go.  I won't mention anyone manufacturer in particular other than to say you can own two (2) of these for the price of one in some instances.  It actually may be to sharp, as the cut leaves almost a mirror shine to it.  If trim is your game this should fit the bill nicely.  If you are not a trim guy I can only say this to you, a sharp blade makes less work and a much nicer job.  Amazon seems to be the most reasonable for pricing and occasionally the prices are dramatically reduced.  Some may prefer the $150.00 or $200.00 blades but two of these can be had for less money and you will always have a SHARP blade.  I have a Bosch slider and this blade with the 5 degree negative hook angle on that saw is a perfect match, the negative hook angle is the secret to clean cuts and the saw not wanting to climb.  You should not be disappointed with this purchase especially if you own a slider!

3766	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought one of these for my father, a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs.  At first, he loved this little drill.  The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you weren't paying close attention to what you were doing.  In the end though, what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing.  After only a few jobs, a plastic component around the motor cracked, allowing the teeth to slip under strain.  A DeWalt service shop charged... to fix this problem.  The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out.  It was a great idea, but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work...  I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill.

8272	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The marking holes and slots on this protractor are great.  I have used protractors before but had to always eyeball the markings with various degrees of accuracy.  This protractor takes away that error.

3730	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this blade to upgrade the standard blade that came with my 7 1/2" miter saw that I bought to carry around to smaller jobs.  BIG mistake.
All of the top colored layer had to be removed for wood to glide smoothly across it.
3244	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the standard by which every other power tool ought to be judged, not just saws.  I worked (OK, DIY) with a sidewinder for years, but I should have just paid the extra money and gotten the Skil 77.  I expect that mine will be used by my grandson.  If you are undertaking any major projects involving sawing a lot of 2-by-whatever lumber, or thicker plywood, like a room addition or deck, this is a highly recommended purchase.  As a DIYer, if you get out the saw over, say, 15 times a year, you will probably get your money's worth out of the saw.  If you only use a saw a few times a year, it's probably more than you need.  For a DIYer, you should be aware that this unit weighs more than the less expensive consumer saws you may have used before, and some practice with scrap is advisable.  And check and keep the oil level up - that's the only real care needed for what is otherwise almost indestructible.

5151	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I consider this a "must have" for any shop. It lets you sweep the floor without needing a dust pan to pick up the dirt. Between this, and a 4" to 2-1/2" adapter so I can connect the hose from my shop vac to the dust collector, I manage to keep my workshop almost clean. Now if only the dust collector had a port in my kitchen... (High capacity central vacuum anyone?)

6489	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just what I wanted

Overall verdict:  If you were looking for a real "high accuracy" edge guide with dead-nuts 1/64 precision right out of the box - this ain't it.  If you mess around with it, you can probably work out the calibration for the fine adjustment down to 1/32 or so.  And if you are careful, plan your work and allow for test cuts to verify each change in settings - it can give you fairly accurate, straight cuts.
5537	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I actually have a couple of these. The do a good job of reducing hose size well maintaining good air flow. I use it to hook my bench top band saw and table saw to my dust collector. I also use one to connect my contractor saw to my shop vac when I have to move it away from the dust collector. I have a small shop in the basement and a larger one in the garage, and sometimes tools end up being used in the other shop, or outside. So I need to be able to change between 2-1/2" and 4" dust collection.

This sander is powerful.  I sanded three layers of old paint  off a door in about 1/2 hr.  The body is constructed of metal, giving it a  nice solid feel.  When sanding, you can simply glide the sander back and  forth, without having to push down at all.  Porter-Cable came up with a  design that gives you a lot of power, but at the same time control over  that power.  This is what a belt sander SHOULD be like.
8076	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought these after reading the glowing reviews and I have to agree they are very sturdy, light weight, and fold up into a very small space.  (I hang them on the wall using a ladder hanger hook, and they're very easy to lift up to the hook.)  The "manufacturer's description", however, is incorrect.  First, the horses themselves have 500 lbs. molded into them as the weight limit, not 600 lbs. (1200/pair).  Second, there are no rubber feet on the 10008 model.  I would like to have had the feet for my slick epoxy garage floor, but the feet are really just a continuation of the plastic legs, extruded a bit beyond the leg to form two round feet, inside of which the metal leg reinforcing rods are inserted.  The manufacturer was nice enough to send me some rubber strips that probably go with another model, but looking at the feet of the 10008's, there's no way you could put the strips down there.  Even without the rubber feet, though, the sawhorses don't slide around super easily like I feared they might on the epoxy floor.  Despite the inaccuracies of the product description this is still overall a great product!

=== Summary ===
I will also include my stock comment about batteries: All batteries, including button style, are so affordable now with Amazon as not to be a factor in the vast majority of battery powered gadgets. When you can get five Sony button batteries on Amazon prime for $3.18 total, cost is no longer an issue, IMHO.
In the end, after significant modifications, the fence is square, true, calibrated, functional and locks to the rail, so I'm not going to return it because it would likely be too much bother for too little gain.
So I'm going to have to replace the batteries.  Big Deal!  In fact, I'm of the opinion that that's the only way to go with these devices.  If my opinion changes, I'll update my review.

Is excellent in doing the job it was designed to do. This litter router has the power to do the job it was intended to do. Don't try to make it do jobs that it wasen't designed to do. If you need to do fine work get the 310, if you need a laminate router get this one.
7180	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I planned to install hardwood floor in my 4 bedrooms. I was new to installing floors. My friends recommended to install the floor using Floating method. I did that and it worked but I did not like the feeling of the floor. It was a floating feeling. So, I decided to spend some money and do it right. I purchased a Makita air compressor (Hot Dog), Bostitch N62FNK-2 Finish nailer and a MIIIFS Floor stapler from Amazon.com. Air compressor and Nailer, stapler work great together. I installed one room, no jams and it works like a charm. Compressor keeps up with the demand. I used 3/8" Rubber hose with the compressor. Stapler came in a beatup box. I was concerned about it but when I used the stapler it worked fine from the word go. To install first 2 rows,I used the finish nailer to face nail the planks and then used the stapler. I love the feeling of a solid floor instead of floating it. Every body in the family loves the new floor. Great tools. Highly recommended.

I'm very impressed with the build quality of this light. It works as well now as when new. I truly love proven durability. Batteries last a long time because LED's use so little power. I really haven't used the optional plug-in power adapter because portability is key. The goose neck is still sturdy and the switch still works. The rubberized grip pads have stayed unpetrified and spring tension is still good.
Don't get me wrong, i'll use a router and jig for many dado operations.  It is hard to beat the easy set up and perfectly smooth dado bottom.  However, there are situations where a dado set is ideal (long dados, tenons, unusual width dados, etc.).  This makes the additional set up worth it.
As far as corded drills,Milwaukee rules.
Cost:
9920	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent blade! Kerf thickness is just right to get a glass smooth crosscut in hardwoods and not put excessive load on the saw motor. I purchased this as a back up blade for when my Forrest chopmaster is out being sharpened. I have to say this blade is EVERY bit as good as the Foreset and about $60.00 less. I have made it through two cabinet jobs so far, 23 cabinets made of hard maple on one job and 34 cabinets made of red oak on the other and this blade is still cutting like new. Whether you are a professional like me or a weekend warrior looking for a cut above, I would highly recommend this blade!
1356	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These bulbs are about 1000% percent more expensive at my local hardware store. For the price, I don't care if they don't last quite as long as a store brand bulb. The savings is worth it. I'd buy these again (thought I won't have to for years and years considering I only have 3 accent lights that use them).

The book light requires 3 AAA batteries to operate. My book light provides 15-20 hours of light before the light STARTS to be noticeably dimmer. The book light can provide about 35 - 40 hours of usable light before I have to replace the batteries (I use 1000 mAH AAA rechargeable batteries).

In my younger days I had a pair of the old steel finger biters but had long ago given them away. These are a great replacement. They do take up more space for storing but that is a small price to pay for the overall quality and stability. I opted for the larger units so as to accommodate an aluminum walking plank. I haven't used them for under the ladder as yet but am sure they will work fine for that position as well. I would recommend even for the weekend warrior!!
7028	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love that these are made right here in the USA and yet are a good price.  Of course the quality is top notch.

On the first call, they told me to put the whole thing into one box and send it in a single shipment. I reminded them that it was unlikely that UPS would pick up a box that weighed in excess of 200 pounds. So they said that they would have UPS pick it up at my office. Except that they didn't tell UPS to do so. Call #3 got them to actually tell UPS to pick it up. At the wrong address, and only one box. Call #4 got cut off after waiting for 15 minutes to get transferred to a supervisor. Finally, on call #5, I talked to a very delightful lady who seemed to understand what needed to be done.

The router came in and I was quite pleased with it even though it does not have the bells and whistles that the Dewalt had.  It runs fine, is easy to adjust in the router table (thanks to the extension handle) and most importantly, it is still running!

This drill will handle anything you throw at it, but I greatly dislike the chuck.  You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip.  It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.

The Freud continues to work OK--I have become used to the motor noise, which sounds like a handful of ball bearings rattling around in a coffee can. The dust collection system is its worst failing--the chintzy plastic manifold doesn't make a good seal and dust blows out the joint into your face. And when you have to remove the manifold to get the tool into a corner, you find access to the screw is blocked by the biscuit size selection dial. Oh, and dust goes right through the bag too, again right in your face if you're bending over to see what you're doing.

I am, on the other hand, a DIY'er and I love spending time out in my own workshop.  What I've found is that my air compressor is probably my most used tool - and I actually have a couple of them.

7090	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Honestly, I didn't want to buy a pipe wrench, because other than putting in new faucets, I leave the plumbing in my home to the pros. However, the pneumatic cylinder of my office chair recently broke and I was sent a replacement by the manufacturer. I was told to use a pipe wrench to remove the old cylinder. I rolled my eyes and thought to myself, "I'll just use whatever wrench I have in my toolbox and I'll be all set." Well, after wasting about 25 minutes trying to work the cylinder off, I finally gave up and decided to buy a new chair. I'd already put the new chair in my Amazon shopping cart when I decided to take a quick look at the pipe wrenches. After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that the Ridgid was the way to go. I don't buy a lot of tools, but when I do, I like to buy high quality ones, even if I think I'll only need to use it once. So, I decided to spend the few bucks on the Ridgid pipe wrench rather than the nearly $200 for the new office chair I'd selected.
The depth-adjustment is done with a KNOB on the front of the saw. That's easier, more precise and more secure than typical levers we find on the side of most circ-saws. Levers are faster. This knob is better.

8959	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	First off I bought this for some cross cut 1"x1" notches in soft wood, I have seen better cuts performed with a chain saw. Probably one of the worst preforming dado sets I have used. Including the 6" $20 cheapo set I have. Part of the problem may be the rake angle of the teeth, little or none, this might have been fine for some other application but not mine. It may not be obvious from the description but this set is of an odd design, the chipper teeth are very wide and then to achieve your desired width you almost always use the spacers. This seems to me like a way of saving money since they only have to have 3 chippers this way, if this blade made good cuts it would be a minor annoyance just because it is different from a normal dado were you just stack the appropriate chippers instead of having to mess with shims every time.
1583	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A similar replacement bulb for my microwave light was nearly $10 at the hardware store, where this deal gave me 10 bulbs for about $2 more.

8194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I just received this jig to replace a number of doors for a client and have yet to use it, but wanted to pass on some rather important info to anyone trying to decide between this one and the bosch unit.  I was originally vacillating between them but ended up buying this one merely because my old boss had one years ago, and based on reviews, it sounded less problematic.  I plan to do some tall doors eventually, so I was a little concerned that the fourth-hinge kit is listed as no longer being available but figured that I'd work it out somehow.  What I wanted to pass on to prospective buyers is that the basic kit I just received included the fourth hinge template and rail to accomodate doors up to 8-feet tall.  It also included the corner chisel gizmo for square-cornered hinges.  These extras make it a heck of a deal.  Now all I have to do is use it within the next week to gauge its functionality, and I'll get back to you.  I'm expecting good results but will update it then.
8144	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works nice. There is a little bit of a learning curve. I did not realize there were spacers on both sides of the blade carrier. I find the blades to be sharp and work well. There is a little difference between cuts at times. I do not know if that is a blade issue or a saw issue. I am using a jobsite saw for precision cuts. I am happy I went with this set of blade. Thanks.

Saw in another review where another user had this same problem with another Freud blade.  This is only the second Freud I've purchased.  I bought one for my 10" Radial Arm Saw thinking it might make it safer to rip with with the anti-kickback feature.  WRONG ! ! !

Some woodworkers know that BLACK PIPE can stain wood. One solution is to wrap the pipe in blue tape. The advantage of this method is that glue squeeze-out is easy to clean up. You can still use the cheaper black pipe, but you have to use more tape for glue-ups.

All the lock down knobs seem to introduce a bit of flex when you crank them down - yet another negative impact on accuracy.  You could "dial out" that inaccuracy if the fine adjustment were better engineered.
6204	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I generally agree with the other reviewers here about the quality of this vise.  It is extremely well made and heavy duty, as well as reasonably priced.  The 9 1/2" mount pattern surprised me too. I was lucky and just *barely* had enough room. Amazon should update the description to include the required dimensions for stuff like this.  Otherwise installation was very easy.
2456	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome addition to router arsenal. Fits my Makita also. Very happy with purchase. Well made, easy to set up and adjust.
If you're looking for a medium weight hammer that can handle most residential jobs and that will last as long as you do, this is not a bad choice.

3610	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It's basic but built solidly and powerful enough to inspire more confidence than I've had in any other saw. I've had 10" Hitachi, Dewalt and Ryobi compound miter saws in the past. All of my past saws have worked well and have had a number of features that seemed to lend to as many problems as they resolved. The Ryobi was surprisingly durable given the price. The Dewalt was comparable to the Makita but it seemed more cumbersome and I don't feel that -given the build quality- it was as good of a value as the Makita. This saw just feels right.

I hope Freud doesn't see this, or they might raise the price!
I'll probably ultimately round out my drills with a cordless hammer drill for rehabbing work but this and my subcompact are all I need for now.
So what to do? When I am using the top handle saw with a single hand, I modify my grip by grabbing it around the body, instead of using the top handle. By doing it that way, you get more of the barrel grip control, even though the rear part of the top handle gets in the way.
My original one was ever so slightly bent at the blade.  It caused the wood to move slightly after the cut started and then catch the blade. If you've ever had a blade catch, its scary!  Especially if it sends the piece flying.  Since the original was cheap cast pot metal it couldn't be bent back.
8603	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had one 'go missing' during one of my son's projects and got replacements.  Still made as well as the original pair I bought 15 years ago and expected to have forever.  These have a good balance and feel in use and being all steel will not break.  Never had much wear on the rubber handles, either.  These to not transmit the rebound and shock into my hands.
FAR FAR cheaper than the other back light kits sold specifically for TV's and this achieves the same results.



Battery life on these flashlights is about 3 hours of continuous use and I have changed the bulbs only about 3 times on each light. The light is bright enough to light up the dogs pretty well about 60 to 75 feet away - depending on the battery charge state. When we lose power I set up a couple of the lights in the house and point them at the ceiling to light up the rooms. MUCH safer than candles...

3088	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I prefer reverse tooth or fine blades when I don't want splinters. That  way I can keep a close eye on the cut which is harder with these. If you  are using a straight edge I suppose they would be more useful. For a truly  clean cut I make a rough cut about 1/8" larger and then use a router  and a straight edge for the final clean up. I would spend my money on good  blades rather than these.

I haven't noticed any wabble and it seems to be very very accurate.  I would definately recommend this blade.
4765	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Key challenge for a hand held jig saw maker is to provide a tool that holds a stiff blade perfectly straight so that the cut is straight and true and the blade is not moved off line by the material.

Another great reason to have one of these; how many times have you accidentally sucked up an important piece of hardware and spent hours sifting through a dust bag trying to find it?  Metal parts will drop to the bottom of the barrel where they are easily found.  This also saves the impeller blades of your dust collector from damaging impacts.  I always empty it before sweeping the floor, just in case I encounter a stray chunk I want to recover.

I was mistaken, for this product was difficult to assemble and almost impossible to use.  The catches that hold it closed are flimsy thin metal that bend instead of unlatching.  The larger surface comes at the expense of a third, useless piece of wood,that is a challenge to use.  The product's customer support representative said that they receive more complaining calls on this product than for any other item in their catalog.  I plan on dumping this bad item and returning to my older version, which -- though worn -- looks really good compared to the new piece of trash.

7118	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I ended up making beautiful raised panel doors using 3/4" stock.  Very impressed with these bits.  I would recommend getting a 3 HP+ router for the raised panel bit.  I used a Bosch router table and a Bosch 2 1/4 HP router to make my doors.  It is likely that I will upgrade to a kreg, woodpeckers or JessEm router table and 3 HP+ router eventually when I can afford one (I'm 21 years old)!  Currently I have only made doors out of pine because I first wanted to make sure that I could make these cuts with my router before I went straight to Oak. This set also has an instruction sheet in the box with the bits so it does a good job explaining how to make a raised panel door.

The saw's power cord is fairly long and has a nice flexible round rubber jacket. The plug on the end of the power cord is only two-prong (no ground prong), and the ground is not required given the double insulated construction.

3437	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have hung my share of drywall over the years (not as a pro) and always used either hammer and drywall nails or a cordless drill with a bit to drive screws.  This drywall screwdriver really speeds up the process--even for a small room.  It does take a while to get the hang of it, however, because unless you drive the in screw perfectly straight, it won't seat properly and you'll have to back it out and try again.  I'd practice driving a few screws on a scrap of drywall first to get the knack of using it and to adjust the depth setting for your job before beginning work--the screw should be just below the surface of the paper so you don't hit it with a taping knife--if the knife "clicks" on the screw when you go over it, you need to set the depth a little lower.

I like this feature, a lot.  It also comes with 3 AAA batteries, so you're set to go the minute you receive it.  The problem is that the clip-on part is so big it obscures my Kindle.  The bottom of the clip is about 2" X 1/1.5".  Better clips for a Kindle don't take up so much room.  Also, this clip doesn't fold up very well.  It's not compact, which also makes it less convenient for a Kindle.  The clip also slides around a lot on the Kindle.  It is find on a regular (paper) book.  But, the hard plastic of this light's clip against the hard plastic of the Kindle causes it to move around while I'm reading, which is annoying.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a book light, but not if your looking for a light for your Kindle.

  With the larger 4" footprint, it is possible to remove a lot of material fast, without digging troughs in the work, which is possible with many belt sanders. Troughs-ridges show in the finished product. For fine finishes that are even and flat, a dedicated planer, then a finish sander, and finally a fine grade of hand sanding will give you the desired result.

6157	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works great considering the price: this and a free 5-gal bucket gets you pretty decent primary chip separation. I don't find a need to add any gasket around the rim where it sits on the 5-gallon bucket -- you just pull the metal bucket handle up and it wedges the lid down in place: seems like a good design to me! Plus when you turn on the vac the suction pulls it down. So no problem there. It is true that you need an adapter to use with 2-1/2" OD hose, I use these from Rockler  ("Shop Vac Adapter" allows your 2-1/2" OD hose to work with your shop vac. Small end has a 2-1/4" outer diameter and a 2" inner diameter. Large end outer diameter is 2-7/16" for 2-1/2" hose). but my 2-1/4" Ridgid hose fits right into the ports on these.

5567	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good, sturdy design and good assembly documentation.  It needs a dust collection hole in the cabinet, but luckily because it's wood it is easy to add one in just the manner you need.

Black and Decker makes a lightweight unit, and will suffice for the occasional weekend warrior.
Edit: After reviewing the reviews and realizing that I was among only a few that had trouble with the instructions I read the instructions again. Solution:  The instructions do not elaborate on the fact that  you don't bolt the "black" connectors from underneath the bench frame but raher directly to the planks (jaws) themselves. The jaws don't touch the frame itself. Problem now solved. I still maintain that the instructions are not clear.  In addition, I removed the plastic belt so that the sides of the movable jaw can be adjusted independently. That's the way the original product operated and I think it's superior.  I'm now happy with the product itself.

There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing, and did I mention how quiet it is?

I have another deck to build this summer and look forward to see how it handles standard PT decking.

  Highly recommended. The Forrest name is synonymous with the best in quality.

  I love the overall quality. If I had to be critical, I would say that it is annoying to hear the blade kiss off of the side of the insert when it is starting up, and also create a slight rattle as it touches it on the edges. That creates a cheaper sound, especially annoying when you are using a saw that is of the caliber of the PMatic 66. It sings normally. Leecraft in their instructions advises you to take a small file and enlarge the opening slightly to eliminate that. That is not a defect, just a consideration when first using the blade insert.

Sure you can buy much more expensive planes that will perform better out of the box but for the moderate user this plane is a great value.  Trueing your plane only takes a little time and is well worth the effort.  I'm sure those who have rated this tool poorly do not know how to tune a plane.  The mechanism is not quite up to par with really expensive planes but with a little work can be made to perform within good limits.  Microns do not necessarily good woodwork/furniture make...

One other improvement on the latest Mag 77 is a fatter flange on the blade guard.  This prevents binding on thinner material, especially when cutting at angles.  Some professionals will pin or remove their guards due to this problem, I strongly recommend that the guard be left intact.  Saftey is much more important than convenience.  I would rather keep all of my limbs and deal with an annoying guard than the other way around.  Accidents happen way too often without inviting them.

I must admit, the installation tip that I am about to discuss, I discovered by from installing the Bench Dog RT-250 router extension table. It is the way Bench Dog does their installation.

2017	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	very high quality and well-made set.  They fit both my Dewalt and Milwaukee routers easily.  My one complaint is that they reduce the distance a plunge router can plunge due to the size of the screw on flange.
2728	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have had one of these for many years and use it mostly 3/4 pine projects (some red oak and maple also).  It handles the job it was designed for well (home use), if you try to push the machine it just won't handle it well (and you my want a stronger machine for that).  The belt sizes and disc size (along with the 1/3 hp motor) dictates the maximum stock sizes you should try to use with it.  If you want to use it to sharpen tools instead of a grinder, it will do that also.  Just be sure to remove all sawdust before you do, the metal sparks and filings could ignite inside the sander.  The sander is also pretty quiet for its type (at least quieter than the competitors) and also operates smoother.  It would be nice if Delta offered a second table as an inexpensive option.
The concentric rings are not coplanar and stick up considerably above the flat plate.

But don't think that this will "extend" as such.
The big secret to creating a WorkMate modular system is to start by screwing and gluing a 2x strong-back to the underside of a 3'x3' or 3'x4' piece of 1" plywood floor sheathing (double-up the plywood for an even better bench setup); this simple assembly then gets clamped in the WM and becomes a more usefully sized workbench.  For my router table, I'm going to fabricate a plywood box, w/ a door, that gets attached to a proper router table top and has that strong-back that finally gets clamped in the WM.  This setup will be much quieter than the dedicated, more expensive, open-framed units, and I'll be able to get really good dust extraction from it as well.  I've done this w/ my thickness planer (plywood base is permanently bolted to the planer).  Clearly, many bench top tools can be bettered with this approach.  BTW, 2 WM's working together is a very awesome setup -- think work platform, really large workbench, very solid clamp/stand for aggressive work on big pieces like doors or fence posts or beams.

4599	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I do a lot of tongue and groove in plywood and it used to be that I would always spend a lot of time fitting the joints with a plane because, as anyone knows, plywood is not flat and you have to press down consistently to get anything close to a consistent cut.  After a run using these, I didn't have to do any fitting at all...payed for itself in saved time on the first run.
So I had the idea to look into getting a toolbag instead of another toolbox.  And after doing a lot of research, I decided to give the Bucket Boss brand of toolbags a try.  I was down to the Gatemouth and the Gatemouth Jr.  Having never before purchased a Bucket Boss product, I decided to go with the cheaper one (the Jr.) just in case it turned out to be a piece of junk.  But I couldn't have been more wrong.  The Bucket Boss Gatemouth Jr. really is a fantastic piece of equipment.  It's made of a very durable nylon-type material.  All of the seams are dual or triple reinforced.  The zipper is made of massive, strong teeth.  And everything that can be reinforced, is.

With its outstanding quality and precision construction, I imagine that the $159 310 is significantly more expensive to produce than the 7310, and is thus not at a competetive price point with the $100 trimmers made by DeWalt, Bosch, and others.

Not so with the DW7080 extension kit and the DW716 (both are advertised as being compatible).  I couldn't believe that it doesn't slide under the base more than a few inches.  This is practically useless since I don't always want 20" sticking out the side of the saw.  Others noted the same issue with their model saws.  If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed.  Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews.  I didn't have any issues, just a little annoying but not a big deal since the instructions explained this.

It is a little on the big side as it weighs as much as most of my kids books but he enjoys the light and having two brightness levels is great. Very happy and still in the first set of batteries. Works great as a bookmark too.

6764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I thought these would replace my spring clamps, which are sometimes too strong for small jobs. However, the Handi-Clamps don't provide enough clamping pressure. I returned mine. I would recommend the Quick-Grip bar clamps, they are just as quick to use and can provide a large amount of clamping pressure. I use them on almost every project.

Do order the smaller-diameter spade bits for the edge bore. The standard 1" is a bit large for some lock fronts. 15/16" and 7/8" are available from boringjigs.com, Classic Engineering's website. Also available: carbide bits for cross boring.
Worked great for a month.  we cross cut a lot of hardwood moldings.
5994	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This fit my Dewalt 7491 RS table saw.  I was able to cut the slot for zero clearance by first removing the riving knife and then raising the blade slowly with the saw on.  I was able to cut it long enough to then be able to use the riving knife guide with it.  I am a radio control airplane hobbyist and have to cut a lot of small parts when building my models and this product fits the bill.

Having said that, I will mirror what other reviewer state:  If you don't read AND FOLLOW the instructions, you can/will find yourself in a bad place in a hurry.  You must always start unstowing the ladder FROM the bottom, not the top (yes, they say you can start at the top if you're deploying it to the maximum extension. But I'd err on the side of conservative with this ladder).  And at each rung, as you're raising it, two little detents pop into place.  You must make ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that these two little detents are LOCKED.  Honestly, it might add up to a total of one whopping minute to make certain this is done, so in my opinion it's totally worth the time to ascertain that they have done so.  If you do this, this is one nice ladder.  If you get in a hurry, you may be in for a surprise.  After reading the one reviewer that took a spill, I've gotten into the habit of double checking every detent, just to be sure.

7654	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Looks great in the small box it comes in. Used it one time and did a fast clean cut. Looks real durable but what i love is the easy way i can change out the hole bits to new bits. EASY and FAST which is what all contractors want.

3624	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I always wanted a belt sander but never had an actual need until I started a shop workbench consisting of a 2x4 laminated top.  Once everything was glued and dried, I pulled her out of the box, attached the dust bag and adjusted the belt tracking on medium course sanding belt and let it rip on high speed.  I was pleased at what quick work the sander made of smoothing the laminated top.  Only light pressure was required for the sander to do its work.  The sander fit comfortably in my hands with very little vibration.  The dust bag was able to capture some of the dust being generated but just as much went airborne.  I guess this is to be expected with any belt sander though.  The variable speed came into play when I need to smooth some uneven edges on the cabinet carcass.  By dialing the unit down to a medium-low setting I was able to control the amount of material being removed safely.  Keep your eye on the electrical cord as I found out the hard way it can be grabbed by the belt and yanked up into the sander.
6994	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They  fit perfectly
If you've ponied up for a Forrest blade, you're in an exclusive 'Best Tool' club, so don't even hesitate. I put this one my new saw with the new Forrest blade. My first cut was as good as it gets, and that's the way I like to work.

891	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought almost 2 dozen "under cabinet" puck lights at Home Depot a couple years ago.  All the replacement bulbs bought there were a different color or pattern.  These appear to be the OEM bulbs, color matched, same pattern, and CHEAP!  50 cents apiece instead of $4!  They look great!
8949	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very impressed. I don't know how the $300 set could be $200 better. Superb results...couldn't be more pleased. I highly recommend this product.
A saw is mounted to the arbor by threading, then pulling out and continuing to screw it on. This is necessary because when fully mounted, the saw and arbor "mate" to prevent loosening or unwanted rotation. Following drilling, insert a flat-blade screwdriver in the "speed slot" and move it up to eject the plug.

Pros:
My only complaint is that the little port which blows dust into the dust bag occasionally clogs up.  I figured out that on woods like oak, if I just cut a little slower by pushing in the cutter a little slower, the little port never gets clogged up.  It only gets clogged up if I jam it in really fast, making huge curly cue shavings of wood.  The motor has no problem cutting the slot quickly, but just go a little slower, and the dust is finer and it never gets clogged.  And then when you go slower, the cut comes  out looking cleaner and nicer anyway.

I was told that "no one on a job site would want to mess with a CD", but who is really buying this?  I think DeWalt didn't do their research before putting out this product.  Otherwise, an outstanding product.  Not only charges, but can run off the DeWalt battery.  Never buy batteries for your portable radio again!

My father had an Estwing stacked leather handle hatchet. I always liked the design and the way it worked. I needed a hammer and, on looking around, found that the Estwing design, from 1923 is still being manufactured. Naturally I bought one, and was so taken with the idea of owning something of such classic and proven design that now I own practically a complete set of Estwing leather handled tools. You can't buy an American made "Perfect Handle" wrench or screwdriver anymore, but Estwing keeps right on making their striking tools to the same standard as when they designed their original 90 years ago.
One word of warning, the blade is very flexible, cutting a straight line on thick sections is not easy.
2097	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Haven't had for years, but have had other sizes for 20+ years by same manufacturer.  These other sizes still look and work like  brand new, so, hopefully these will too.  Wanted to complain about the case though.  It is hard plastic that will shatter or easily break if slightly tweeked (as in lid will be broken off shortly).  Will need to find better storage soon.
1376	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a lamp (really a sculpture) which requires this lamp. When I needed to replace a burned out bulb, I found that these are hard to find in the USA - most suppliers are European.  Since the original bulb lasted 15 years, this should be a lifetime supply - for me and my kids :)
4646	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm a professional woodworker and this blade (Freud LU91R010) has become my standard all-purpose blade.  I use them on both of of my table saws, as well as on my radial saws.  The only time I use anything else is for long rips through heavy stock.  I build custom furniture, doors, and all sorts of small-but-precision items. I work with many kinds of hardwoods, including exotics like Hawaiian Curly Koa, wenge and others.  I LOVE this blade.  It never disappoints.  The cuts are consistently so smooth that 220 grit sanding finished the job.  The negative rake and small teeth also make this a safe blade (if a table saw with no guards can ever be safe) because it minimizes the chance of kick-back and the teeth are nowhere near as aggressive as, say, my Forrest blades. This becomes important to me because I find myself often working with small pieces of wood, and my saws don't have any so-called "safety guards" that only get in the way and make things less safe than if you could actually see what you're doing.  Caveat:  This is my way of working and I would never recommend to anyone else that they remove all those "safety" features. There.  I said it.
7917	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My husband asked for this hammer for Christmas. I didn't understand the big deal. I mean a hammer is a hammer right? Nope, it's heavy but very comfortable. I tried it myself and was amazed at the difference between this hammer and your everyday hammer. It swings nicely and doesn't tire your arm out like others. Nice balance to it and drives a nail like no other. For someone like me that is horrible at driving nails, hates heavy hammers this one is perfect. Even I feel like a pro now. I highly recommend this hammer. Don't let the price put you off because it is worth every penny and then some. I will be getting the stronger half more Eastwing products for this Christmas, birthday or just because.
The reason for the low rating is the way Porter Cable decided to solve the problem of dust getting in the motor. I was wondering why the bag never filled, I thought the chanel where the dust goes from the back of the sander was blocked with debris. When I took the side off I was right it was blocked, with a piece of metal put in at the factory and siliconed to seal it. I cut the piece out and now use a vacume to help with the dust collection. This is better, but the impellor only blocks the way, next time that will be removed to allow the vacume to do it's job. I don't care if it voids the warranty, I'm more worried about the warranty on my lungs, a concern Porter Cable should also share.

7832	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Occasinally, I do small to medium DIY projects at home.  I used to do them on the garage floor or on a paint bucket turned upside down.  Then a neighbor let me borrow his Black & Decker WM425. It was infinitely more comfortable to work on than my previous "work surfaces".  I watched the price of this workbench on Amazon, and bought one when it dropped to ~$90.

4010	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are nice, sharp blades that last reasonably well. They will dull quickly when used to plane off old paint, but that is to be expected. Its great that they are two sided so they have an extended life per set.

Very reasonably priced too. I'd seen  bulbs like these selling for up to $11. each !!
The splitter that comes with the uniguard is its  second great feature.  It is easily removed for non-through cuts, and more  to the point, easily replaced afterwards.  The splitter is separate from  the guard, so you can remove it and still guard the blade, unlike the  standard blade guard that comes with the table saw.

8374	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is thin and doesn't hold the rolled-up shape that most long extension cords do.  I used it to run across the ceiling of my garage to get electric to the back of the garage to power a storage battery charger for the winter.  It went up without a hitch.  The lighted end made it possible to see if the cord was receiving power just by looking in the garage door window.
5058	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw cuts like a razor through warm butter.  I had been using Freud blades but took a chance that this would live up to all the hype, and it has for me.  I use a Bosch 4100 so it's not a lot of horsepower so I would get bogging down and burning on hardwoods especially if they were thick and/or long.  Not with this blade though. I am really glad I took the chance on the switch.  There's also the resharpening service Forrest offers which I expect to make up for the higher initial cost.

5794	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the plane even after reading the bad reviews. I have own many Stanley planes some antiques and son giving to me by my grandfather. I have always been very happy with them. So, I purchased this rabbet planer with the purpose of cleaning up the middle ridge made by a dado. When I first got the plane, like you need to do with all planes, I tuned it and adjusted it. The plane works great. I have been using it with no problems. It did take a bit of time to adjust. If you are not sure on how to adjust the plane or the tuning of it, you can e-mail Stanley's service department and they will be glade to mail out the information on the model you have. I would and more then likely will purchase other Stanley plane in the future. I gave this four stars because nothing is perfect.

1989	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I am in the process of making raised panel doors for my entire house with the 7815 mounted in a Kreg router table. It truly is a powerhouse and I don't feel it is overkill, after trying successfully but scarily to run the large bits with my smaller Bosch router. It worked, but I doubt it would survive the experience. This one, having the same power (amperage) as my Bosch table saw, glides right through maple. Someone mentioned the poor R&D response by PC to several issues with this router. I have not had a problem with the mode of adjustment, without a router lift, and with a mirror it is highly accurate and easy. But I do have an issue with the speed control slider switch. This is not a good arrangement as constantly I am finding myself bumping it when turning the router on and off, and it easily will unintentionally change to a different speed when touched while adjusting height. It simply is an inferior design for a router table set-up. The on and off switch also is not ideal for a router table set-up as you find yourself groping around, under the table, to find the switch. An auxiliary paddle safety switch is a very good idea which will take care of both these issues, until you again need to adjust the height by groping around under the table. Changing bits is not that difficult: one wrench under, the other wrench above the table. Easy.
This is a glorious tool and more drill than any non-contractor is likely to ever need.
2678	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This Milwaukee circular saw is among the best tools made.  The motor is strong and cuts through the hardest woods with relative ease.  It is well balanced and of moderate weight thanks to the alloy construction.  Fit and finish is suberb, as is the case with most Milwaukee products.  The case is sturdy and a plus if you move your saw frequently between jobs.  The Milwaukee gets 5 stars and is a credit to their line of quality power tools.  I'd buy another one without a second thought.
3470	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Some may find this sander too heavy. It takes strong hands and arms to hold on to this sander when it is running at full speed. This powerhouse sander will do the heavy sanding you need to accomplish and in short order.  I have used it to shape wood. I have used it to do flooring and decks. It is an excellent sander and will not waste sand paper.  The belt tracks very well, all the time. It is of high quality and is American Made.
-When making a full depth cut, the lower blade guard will not open as you cut, you must flip it up with your finger on the lever.
6069	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Okay so for the price, this is a decent solution for making a 2 stage dust collection on a budget or limited work space. Without adding or making changes, this provided not so great suction. I have to make mods to make it function better.
379	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very nice overall - two brightness settings and a good spread of light.  Works very nicely on my Kindle.  I wish the dim setting was a little more dim - I worry it is too bright and keeps my wife awake.
7578	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This tool does what its made for. It works very well for straightening twisted studs. Basically for 2x4 or 2x6 lumber anything bigger and it doesn't have the grip necessary to straighten.
2005	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used this router in a Xacta-Lift router table lift system, and it was perfect.  Served all my table routing needs with its high power, accuracy, and 5 speed settings.  Great to have lower speeds for those large diameter bits.  A true workhorse of a router.
9670	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I attached this coupler to my Goodyear air hose. It's solid. Does what it is supposed to do. Make sure to always use teflon tape to secure all your air compressor attachments.
8693	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been cutting through the tough concrete foundation of the house to install underground electrical service conduit.  After using this one for a few hours I changed it out with a Bosch segmented blade (the kind with slots) and didn't notice much difference in the ease of deep cutting.  In fact this DeWalt blade seemed to do a tiny bit better.  So this is a quality blade.
I would recommend this product to others.
Ok some sandpaper work is to be expected.  Broke out the 600 grit, hummm its not hardly touching it.  Switched to 400 grit and it ain't getting the job done either.  Tried 220 and now I can see bright spots showing up on the edges but it will take hours to whittle this thing down.

We have a few similar 3/4 inch pipe clamps we bought at Lowe's that are blue and those work far better than these. The adjustable portion of this that is crucial to the function of the clamp get stuck all the time. When it gets stuck it can't be used. It is frustrating because it usually happens in the middle of a glue up. Otherwise, these clamps are sturdy. When they work, they help us get nicely glued up panels. We have two of these, and it happens with both.
8912	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have you ever seen something that seemed to good to be true? For instance, a Japanese Ryoba saw for TWENTY DOLLARS! I've used saws like this before, in other woodworker's shops. I'd seen ones that cost over $200 and some that were around $100 (usually made somewhere other than Japan). I use a lot of dowels in my furniture building, also plugs to cover the places I have to put in screws. So when I saw this, I thought it would be a cheap piece of junk that would be dull after cutting a couple dowels and rake angles so off it would take 20 minutes to cut off a 1/2" dowel.
Brief overview:
8674	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say, Estwing makes great hammers. However, I was surprised at how easily it rusted. I still rated it 5/5 since it is a tool I abuse anyway.
After having used the table for a few months, I wonder how I got along without it before.  Would I purchase this table again if necessary?  The answer is yes I absolutely would.
4335	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great for small jobs
Firstly, the bit system involves holding a spring loaded sleeve (which locks the shaft for bit change)down and tightening the collet with a wrench using your other hand which should be free. I found it so difficult to hold the bit to the correct height (for some specialty bit) as well as hold the spring sleeve tightly locked so that the collet can be tightened with another hand.

Excellent. I used it with an angle grinder to cut out a cook top opening in 1" thick Black Galaxy granite. it cut smoother than i had expected. The blade did not show any signs of degradation after finishing the job. I think it will out last the grinder.

3779	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For the price I don't see how you can beat this saw. I've been researching table saws for about two months.  Knowing that I would either go with a Jet or a Powermatic I decided on the Jet. Can't beat the price for double cast iron extensions.
7558	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Wonderful tool. I was not sure that it could do what I wanted it to do. Once I got it, I was totally surprised. It did work. Well worth the investment.
  By the way the owners manual, which is available here at Amazon at this listing, and the listing on the 5540 as well shows you that the hook and loop pad is available as an option, with several different types of pads, depending on the application you are using.
Most boatbuilders use the 6" version with a traditional saw, but I bought the 4-1/2" version for use with my Makita rechargeable saw. The thin kerf and lower drag are a huge help with this little saw, and help extend battery life as well as allowing it to cut through thicker plywood.
6715	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I already owned ten such clamps when I ordered these.  Only two of the others are Irwin Quick-Grips, and the others are somewhat lower in quality.  I believe this brand is the very best, and it really is like having a helper right beside you.  One hand is all it takes to apply the clamp, loosen it if necessary for re-adjustment, or remove it.  And although this is called a mini-clamp, it is of a size that makes it perfect for countless uses around the house or shop.
All in all the tool is super well engineered. After hearing everybody raving about it, and checking how high it was in the Amazon sales rank, I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. What a universal tool. Precision made. Lightweight, since it is housed in Cast Aluminum, and built for strength and durability, even in a harsh environment. The directions say, if you get it wet from submerging it in water, it must be dried out, before it gives you accurate readings again. You have to respect that kind of durability.

6823	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was given two of these ladders over a year ago, and used them so much that I ordered two more!  Although a bit heavy/bulky for the taste of two of my people, the rest of the crew loves them.  One of our more common uses for the stool is to set them up as indoor scaffolding when performing lengthly ceiling/overhead work.  Sorry I didn't discover this item years sooner!
This is a truly great product and great value and I would buy it again if I needed another.

With that said, after the table assembly is complete the out feed table does the job for which it was intended.  I am extremely happy with it. It significantly enhances the operational capabilities my saw and it definitely increases the safety of using my saw.  The inherent difficulty of ripping long stock or 4x8 sheets of plywood essentially vanishes when the saw has proper out feed and side extension support.
580	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The light is great as it is bright and made of plastic so it doesn't scratch the Kindle. I am however a little surprised that there isn't a light more "Kindle Specific". That is one that is a little smaller and would fit in the case with the Kindle. Good bargain though and two light settings which is a very nice feature.
Japan is now considered to be the Asian counterpart to "German engineering" and thier factory workers are paid premium wages, often in short supply leading Japan to respond by allowing more immigrants across their borders to fill the gap left behind as the majority of the Japan's workers moved into the technical valley from the industrial park, "uninterested in doing those kinds of jobs".  Sound familiar?
1029	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Bulbs would not fit into the under cabinet fixtures. The prongs were too long
It "spreads" its grip over a larger area of the blade (like a big nut-washer) so the blade is clamped closer to the cutting-edge. That keeps blade-rotation near a theoretical "ideal" in a single plane.
  Mine has only been service once, by me, for a cord changeout. (Edit: I shortened the original cord to 2 feet because I always need and extension cord anyway.) Parts seem to be readily available from Dewalt. I expect the trigger to go sometime (no matter what brand, if you use it a lot the trigger is usually the first to go behind the cord.) Trigger is $35.00 online. Comforting to know I can get service parts.

Use them for their intended purposes, and they will give you great results, super easy.
For those worried about cutting to 'nominal thickness' or undersized plywood, it included instructions for 1/4" to 7/8" in 32nd increments. That was one of my concerns as the product packaging isn't exactly clear about the 1/32" increments.
Again, I did not give the Harbor Freight clamps a fair run-through as I did with the other 3, other than just enough to know that I prefer them over the Irwin clamp.

7107	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This a very good panel joiner kit with the exception of the fact it does not come with very good instructions. But if you're not sure how to set the cutter up you probably should not be using this type of shaper anyway. This cutter should not be used with anything less than a very stable commercial router table. I use these with three horse powered Makita routers turning better than 12,000 RPMs. You could probably use the panel cutter with a 1 1/2 horse router as long as it turns better than 10,000 RPMs. The panel cutter is by far the most dangerous cutter in the set as it removes a lot of wood with each pass. This is the reason you must make at least three passes as you cut the raised panels. I have always found Freud cutters to be of the very highest quality and rate them right up there with Amana cutters.

Neither of these solve the issue of aligning both the faces and the vertical frames, but the claws do with some limitation--they cannot resolve angled installs of corner cabinets. I recently installed a set of Hickory cabinets, a species that, while it is relatively warp resistant, is also very resistant to attmepts to straighten what bows do happen. The claws worked very well, though I would suggest either a better gearing ratio and/or larger grips would make the effort more sucessful.

They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them. This not your typical throw-away Black&Decker or Craftsman drill. I love the Quik-Lok cord feature; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord. I have five 5.5amp Magnums (USA Made) and they never quit on me. They should last me the rest of my life; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then.
Highly recommend...

The price for the qty of 2- 24 inch clamps, and the qty of 2-40 inch clamps go for less money in the kit, than they do individually, and you get the supports that hold up the clamps for free-no extra charge. Since clamp buying is a hobby with these, you may want to load up that way instead. These Bessey clamps take top honors in strength, weight, and ease of use. Definitely a top quality product.

4676	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I ended up buying two of these because I have a step son. The first unit was great. The cuts were square, and there was some scoring on the face to keep it from sliding. The second unit is useful for building a barn, if you are not picky. The bottom is not flat, and neither is the front. The scoring on the face is insufficient, and even with a jig, it wobbles because of its not being square. You may get one that is fine.

7918	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I was a kid in the late 70s my father a carpenter had every hammer known to man including a few Estwings so when I was old enough I tried them out to find my own personal best hammer. Sadly the Estwings of the era felt wrong on the downswing and the leather grip was so slippery it was hard to keep the thing from flying out of your hands. Thankfully someone redesigned the damn things and now they are nearly perfect, the feel is just right and the grips are very comfortable in the hand and don't slide at all! For those with poor aim the waffle head helps keep the head on the nail. The way these are made will probably last a lifetime. I cant complain about this hammer, its perfect.

There is a chart that comes with it telling the mix of blades and chippers  for each common thickness (I put mine in a sheet protecter to help me find  it).  If it is off just a little, slip in one or more of the supplied  plastic shims to acheive perfection!  I have a cheap caliper that I check  plywood with and that gets me pretty close on the first try.

=====================================
6368	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Because of its size, this clamp does have some limitations; it cannot hold a great deal of weight or generate great amounts of pressure.  For small projects like miniature boxes, frames or models, it is ideal.  I use mine  for all of the above and on my N-Guage railroad layout.
4369	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works very well.  Franklin also has an "extended" open time version of Titebond II and its original formulation.  If you're like me, the longer open times allow for much less hurried glue ups.  I hope that  Amazon considers carrying the extended versions!
7596	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used this tool to demo a flagstone/concrete patio and about 80 feet of sidewalk.  I first tried the sledgehammer/prybar route, but that was too slow and tiresome.  I got the job done by myself in less than 8 hours with this tool.  It is quieter than gas/air powered hammers, but I still wore ear protection.  It is easy to operate and not very fatiguing-the most tiring part is picking it up and setting it down.  It is heavy, but I could lift it into the trunk of my car by myself.  With 2 people lifting it is a breeze and the cart makes transporting it very easy.  I ran it hard all day and it never complained- and this was a pretty beat up rental tool.  I highly recommend this tool if electricity is available-it is much more convenient than gas and compressed air hammers.  Plus it is powerful and durable enough for all but the biggest demolition jobs.

  If I had to be critical of the buddies, I would be concerned for certain fence types that can not accept the challenge of the buddies creating lift on the fence. With the buddies set to press down on the work piece, when it enters the buddy it will press them up, and that creates a lifting.  A less than substantial fence with a tie down only on the side, closest to you, may create a lifting concern. If your fence, when fastened holds on the rear and front, then the lift is of no concern. If your fence only holds down on one end, an easy way to determine the buddies usability is to simply fasten it, then use something to pry on it to test the level of resistance. The buddies are spring loaded and adjustable. To get the maximum usability without more frequent adjusting, a front and rear hold down fence is preferred.

The specs say the thin kerf and the titanium coating make cutting easier and enhance blade life up to 2x standard blades. I believe that. We've used cheaper blades, and they often last for only one project.

The Xtra Flex 2 LED Book Light is both attractive and functional. Plus, it is very affordable and reasonably priced. You really can't go wrong with this one!
1) It uses short, cheap bits - so you spend less on replacement parts.
SUMMARY: It is a good drill, and does do the job well..... but, though they took the jobs to China, we pretty much still get a higher USA price!  I am disappointed by that.  Had I known it was not a USA made drill, and it was just another, pick a "China vs. China" product, I would have bought a less expensive unit like Sears, B & D, or Skill, etc. for about $25 to $30 less money.  I do think that we need to demand that Amazon require these folks to list where it is made in the listing.... that is only reasonable.

8655	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	BROKE - Despite the lower price, what is the point when it breaks so easily.  After 2 years of light use, mine went disfunctional.  Take the plastic cover off of the pressure relief apparatus and you will see how fragile the magnetic shut off and cheap plastic push button switch are.  I'm debating on learning how to fix, replace or just go out and buy something designed a bit simpler.  My unit keeps cycling and won't hold pressure.

I've only been using them for a month or so, so I can't give a review on longevity.  I will update the review at some point.
4153	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Yee-ha!  I love this tool!  I bought it for  cutting 12 X 12 cinder block tiles for my patio.  Also bought a Makita 14 inch diamond blade for the job.  Could not be any happier. One of the best buy in my lifetime.
8927	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I would have liked to get the Freud dial dado set, but don't use a dado blade often enough to justify the cost.

The toggle switch on the PC 690 is not very conveniently located.  The D-handle base has the  trigger switch, which turns on and off without fumbling or taking your eyes  off the work.  In addition, I think it gives me a more stable grip than  holding the two standard knobs on the sides.  Forward-backward tilt is much  more easily controlled with the D-handle.

3168	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This light leaves a lot to be desired. The neck needs to be stiffer so it doesn't droop and the power needs to be increased for a stronger bulb. The amount of light provided by this lamp is weak.

Use the thicker rods for the 618 router.  A previous reviewer stated that the rods screw together for a longer offset.  This is not true.  The thin set of rods are threaded to allow them to screw into the Dewalt 610 router.  The thicker set of rods are not threaded.  If you have a longer offset than this guide will handle, you would be better off using a clamp and guide.  But for cuts near the edge of a workpiece, fluted columns, strip inlays, and mortises ---> this edgeguide is great!
2319	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A very high quality tool indeed. My first project was a wooden gear clock and the Dewalt scroll saw did a great job on the delicate parts needed to complete it. It runs so smooth and quiet I was amazed.
BTW, if you go to the shark website, and read their PDF on their incredible hand-finished tools, the exact things that are missing are the "V-blade" in the cat's paw they claim grabs the nail.  It's closer to a pinched U now.
6589	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Jobs that require a pipe wrench tend to require some oomf.  This wrench brings plenty of it.  Built to last a lifetime and get passed down.
9730	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I don't have much experience with these hoses, but after reading reviews I decided to get this one and am happy with it.  Seems well constructed and is pliable, coilable, etc. It doesn't seem to be made of cheap rubber/plastic that would make it hard to coil or prone to kinking.
6661	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Much more torque or power than you would expect for a small driver. Adjustable clutch prevents stripping screws. Angle grip or straight with power trigger in a great location.  I liked it so much I purchased two more for friends.
It is a bit tricky to have to "peek" over the adjustment housing to actually see the cut.  Again, the SS was better, and the guide "notch" for cut guide reference is not ideal.  At first it's easy to cut on the wrong side.  Minor points.  It's a good saw and definitely worth the money.  Would be nice if it came with a rip fence.  Almost nothing get's a five star rating in my book, (the Super Sawcat would have) but this is probably 4 1/2.
2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.
4355	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Not 5/8" arbor as described. The hole is much smaller. If you zoom in on the photo, which I didn't do before ordering, it says "10 mm arbor" in very tiny lettering on the blade. Returned.


I purchased a Shop-Vac 9064900 2-1/2-to-1-1/2-Inch Conversion Unit adapter from Amazon and it fixes my issues with this hose not fitting the Shop-Vac attachments. It also allows me to connect the hose to my DEWALT DWE7491RS 10-Inch Jobsite Table Saw. Still haven't figured out how to re-use the screw-in swivel adapter from the original Shop-Vac hose with this hose.

6869	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great wrenches, easier on the arms for all day use than similar sized steel wrenches. The offset wrench helps get in tight spots.



1017	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
As far as the saw goes, it is nice. I found virtually no vibration just like others have said. It cuts quickly and accurately. Being new to scroll saws I was amazed at how tiny the saw blade is. At first I thought it was a piece of wire in the bag of parts. I've cut some 1/2" MDF, 1/4" ply and some 1/2" walnut. The cuts are smooth and as accurate as I can follow a line right now.
Made in the U.S.A
My only minor gripe is that it doesn't ship from amazon but a 3rd party.  Despite that, it arrived quickly (though packaged poorly) and they worked fine.

3886	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Overall, I wish that I had applied the purchase price of this drill press attachment to the purchase of a stand-alone mortising machine.
All-in-all, I think this fence will do just what I want it to. It fits my Makita RT0701C and, knowing how much the fence moves per dial rev, and more importantly, that it actually moves that much, making adjustments on will be much easier and more accurate.

These inserts make it safer and cleaner when operating your saw. Being that mine are bright yellow, they also act as a reminder to me when I'm entering the DANGER ZONE.... You won't regret getting one, or more, of these for your shop.
Cons-
this meets all of my criteria for this purpose
Since hiring a pro to install my cabinets would have cost about $2000 it was well worth buying the Pony Clamps and T-Jak. Then I sold them for 75% of what I paid for them. Even if I hadn't sold them they paid for themselves many times over.
This tool has my highest recommendation.
8913	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is fairly large  and takes a little getting used to.  It cuts on the pull stroke and so has a very fine flexible blade.  Does a great job on plain old firing and also on hardwoods.  Indispensable addition to the shop although it is moderately large and takes some effort to find a good place for storage.  The current handle is plastic and doesn't see to be particularly sturdy but no signs on any problems so far.


So handle with care.  I  recommend it.

The Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem.  It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw. As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line. Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that, and it is a hard habit to break.  I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.

The Lenox set's claimed tooth life is double that of their older version, and seems believable. One of the best features, as the name implies, is the "speed slot" for easy removal of cut-out wood plugs from the saw -- it's simple, but it really works well.

They have the stair-stepped "speed slots" to use a screwdriver to remove the plug. Also, the old version (which the hole saws are painted completely white, ie no black teeth) have HOLLOW shafts on the mandrels! Those are total crap quality, but the redesigned mandrels have solid shafts and are great! (FYI, there are still more sizes Lenox makes that aren't included in this kit!) They are available at certain box stores.

Maybe TMI, but they are at a 20* angle, which was problematic.  The first couple were fine so I went merrily along doing the other seven, the last of which was barely cutting the wood.  Had to make another half and start over.  The thumbwheel that locks the height is kinda small .. you may want to give it a little extra "umph" with pliers if you are going in at an angle rather than straight in.

Then  as soon as the "holder" touches the surface (or say you overdrive a bit and countersink the screw) you're driving the screw into, the top of the "holder" presses back and releases the bit.  Then the only thing keeping it hanging off the so-called holder is the magnetism of the holder.

Totally recommend buying these bulbs. Each one comes in a little box.




On the downside it leaves a rather gaping hole on one side of the joint so it is not the preferred method for joining boards that are visible on both sides.  They sell wooden plugs (in different wood species), but I am not impressed with them as they take a lot of fiddling to get them in and flush. I also have not used it for joining boards into panels (table tops or cabinet sides) because I prefer an old school biscuit joint with good clamping technique for a flush surface.
In the end, I'm thrilled with what I got with this separator. Is woodstock charging $30 for a $3 piece of plastic? Probably, but until someone else comes out with something to compete, they can ask what we'll pay, and it's still far cheaper than buying a brand new two-stage system.

1918	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and "excellent" joint - I don't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits.  Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners.  No doubt, you will come back to buy these.  So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer, eh?  I don't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose.  Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there. Simply put, these are the industry standard for a reason.
I cannot say that I am yet ready to sink hundreds of dollars into new clamps, nor will I throw away my trusty Pony pipe clamps, but my starter set of these Besseys will get A LOT of use around my shop in the years to come.  I highly recommend that you try these for yourself!
The saw only uses plain blades. You cannot use pin blades in this unit.  While that isn't a problem for my wife, some of you might like to have that option. If you must use pin blades, you'll need a different saw.
In summary...I'm an occasional woodworker and I don't use this router table very often, but every time I do, I wish I'd bought something else.  There are better ones available in the same price range.

The next Euroboxes I hang will be done with the European version of the clamps!
Not heavy and easy to carry to work sites.
4663	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are a great safety device and they help make sure that cuts on the table saw are straight. I have recommended these to several others in the trades and they also really like them. Highly recommended.

5673	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works grate on small drills

Overall I'm satisfied with the unit, and believe it will make using my table saw both more safe and more enjoyable.  I'll save time over having to remove and reinstall the old blade guard the way I used to, but considering the time to install the Uniguard, payback won't come for awhile.
On a test hole (through a fresh 2x4), the  inch saw worked efficiently and quickly. I did not test with metal, but was pleased to see that Lenox included a laminated card listing all the saws and their recommended speeds through five different kinds of metal (mild steel, stainless steel, iron, brass, and aluminum/copper/zinc).

I'm holding back 1 star to see how well the tool holds up over time, but 25% of the way into my basement project, I'm extremely pleased with its performance.
8857	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw you will not believe what a nice clean cut it does...  Takes a little getting use to, but once you learn what/how to do, it's an ease.  I should have purchased one years ago.  One thing the course is real course and if used wrong will draw blood.  On the other hand the fine is the smoothest cut you'll ever get from a hand saw....
6140	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought a package of these blades to use to help cut the roots on a stump of a tree in my yard. The good news is that the stump is out. The bad it took 2 blades to do the trick. Ice hardened or not, the blades don't cut rocks. The teeth are still there but they are not sharp. These blades have a 5 year warranty, but I don't see how they'd last that long... Back to my story, when I hit a small rock, sparks flew, dirt spewed, roots still cut though.
1332	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just like the ones in the store only I got 10 instead of one or two for the same price. They work well and are a great purchase.
One definite minus is that Fein includes no instructions.  I know that a sander is a pretty simple machine, but there are a couple of items in the box that didn't make sense to me right away, and it's nice to have instructions to make you feel confident you're doing things correctly.
7710	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had this tool for about 6 hours now and it has payed for itself.  It saves your hands not to mention time and material.  The specific caulk we use this on has a tenancy to leak bout the back of the tube into the barrel of the calking gun and jam everything up.  With the caulk master it uses air pressure to push out the material so none leaks out the back.  This thing is great and I wish I had it months ago when i started this job.
8797	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a Mitutoyo set that I have been using for 5 years and thought there was none better out there. I ordered the Starret set for work and when it arrived I was impressed and I immediately began checking it out against the highest accuracy precission ground square and the square head and the protractor(set at 90) where dead on. This is a great tool! My only gripe is that it came in a cardboard box. Doesn't a great tool deserve a great case? I guess Starret doesn't think so and now I will spend a good couple of days building it a proper home. Come on... would a nice wooden box have added that much to the price?

I've heard some of the internal electronics aren't known for their longevity. If I get at least a couple years out of this beast I think it will have been worth every penny but people seem to have them longer than that. But don't let nostalgia rule your purchasing decision. Yes this model is tried and true but Makita has one like that still on the market with some nice upgrades and I was on the verge of getting that Milwaukee fixed base myself. The price I got was much cheaper than those. It's not worth more than the finest modern routers of its class which is what too many people think they're going to get for it used, apparently.

3763	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that this screwdriver is a bit pricey and also a bit large for a 3.6V model.  But if you do a lot of electronic assembly or repair, this is the screwdriver for you.  This model has a 2 speed transmission with a surprising amount of torque in low gear and fast (600 RPM) in high gear.  The most important feature though is the electronic clutch.  You will not strip even the most delicate screws with this screwdriver.  If you are looking for an all purpose drill driver or you want something with lots of power, the DeWalt may be a better choice as it is cheaper and more powerful.  But if you need a screwdriver for delicate work that is fast, fairly powerful and won't strip out small screws, this is the only choice.  Normally, I say the more power the better but if you want a screwdriver with a precision clutch for delicate work, this is THE tool for you.
No problems with these blades.
For remodeling, basement finishing, or extensions this drill really shines.  Trying to accomplish drilling many holes in wall studs with a standard electric drill would be very time consuming if not impossible for simply not being able to fit one between the studs.  If however you do this kind of work every day as a business I would consider either the Hole Hawg or the new Super Hole Hawg.  These units are more expensive but feature higher chuck speeds and a transmission that allows you to select the high or low speed without the use of tools.  This will allow you to get work done faster when on really big jobs.  But for the home owner that enjoys remodeling this Right Angle Drill is really the best choice as it is two tools in one when you consider the D-handle alone with the RAD unit removed.

There is another problem with the PC collets.  I had a great deal of difficulty getting bits in and out of the 3 examples I received (two 1/2" and one 1/4", which I ordered separately).  The final straw came with the last bit I tested on the second 7518 I received.  It was a brand new, 1/2" shank Whiteside bit, with the protective coating still in place, covering the cutting edges.  I struggled to get it into the collet and when I tried to remove it, I had to use so much force that the protective coating came off the bit and my thumb slid along the cutting edge, cutting it very deeply.  After dealing with the medical emergency, I looked closely at the interior bore of the collet with a loupe.  I was surprised to see a significant number of burrs attached to the slots in the bore.  I went to work on the collet with needle files and some 1000 grit wet/dry paper and eventually got it to the point where I could get bits in and out without too much trouble.
8315	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Initially when I looked at this tool, I thought that it was a bit pricey for a digital protractor. Now I find myself using this tool for framing, trim work, and saw alignment. It has been invaluable in checking miter gauges for accuracy, you could use a protractor or speed square, but this is more accurate than a speed square and much quicker than either, especially if you need to make adjustments. This tool impressed me when I was checking alignment on my sliding compound miter saw. I wanted to verify its accuracy out of the box so I dialed into 90 / 0 degrees, the BOSCH protractor read 90.3, flipped it over and measured the other side of the blade and it read 89.7. Definitley much quicker than the conventional way, and you can easily use this with the table saw. Typically over time ( about 5 months now ) this tool reads between 0.0 and 0.1 accuracy, and like most scales you can check its accuracy and know what your margin of accuracy is. The back spring angle feature is very handy for crown molding, and for checking corners the back edge is rounded so as not to foil your reading in an inside corner measurement. This tool does so much more than I have mentioned, these are just tasks that I have used repeatedly and successfully. A carrying case would be nice, as this unit is nicely machined, it has a level built in which is handy and for quick checks, it saves holding two tools. So far, I am very satisfied with this tool.
9046	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great
- Compact and Lightweight
2677	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This saw is awesome....except.  Don't expect square cuts, because the shoe on every single one I have seen/used is warped right where you need to hold your square to set the blade-to-shoe bevel to be square when adjusting it.  If this saw had the same MAG shoe as the Porter Cable, I would have kept it. But, I exchanged it for a Porter Cable, and even though I don't have Tilt-lok, I have a keyless blade change, and good square cuts.
The solution I found was to get a 45 degree pvc plumbing joint for about $3.  I could not find any other plumbing part that fit snugly, all the others were loose.  The elbow holds the reducer snugly as well as the port from the tablesaw.  I epoxied the adapter to the pvc elbow.  You can then tape or glue the elbow to your tablesaw port as you desire for your purposes.  This method worked a lot better than spending another $25 on a 4" hose that I did not need.

4896	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this saw and have used it a lot in refurbishing an old house.  It is a powerful and excellent saw and it cuts exceptionally true even through very thick stock.  The only problem some people might have with it is that it is quite large and heavy.  I have large hands so this is not a serious problem but thank God I did not buy the even larger Bosch model which is REALLY huge!  Also, changing blades is a pain if you do not do it all the time since the procedure is overly complicated.  No wonder they put it on the barrel of the saw!

If you don't mind the lower light output and a yellower light these fit the bill.
Dust seems to fly even with a good dust collection system attached to the saw's dust collection chute. I've found that if you position a hose near the rear base of the blade (careful when you're sliding) that dust collection is much better. The optional standalone dust collection bag is worthless. Although it does collect some sawdust; more of it goes airborne than is trapped in the bag.
8313	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought two of these several years ago and they are still working great.  Good quality, sturdy insulation and flexible.  It is a bit pricey.  The US Wire 74050 12/3 50-Foot extension cord is similar for less $$.  I own both.

I installed a set of five upper cabinets I made without a helper. The line between adjacent cabinets is barely noticeable. I give the product 5 stars because it does exactly what it is suppose to do. I cannot comment on how long the clamps will last, but for me it does not matter because I do not install cabinets for a living. I assume that plastic will break eventually if you use the clamps on a daily basis.
The plastic part that contacts the workpiece is smooth, and slides with very little resistance.  The guide has a dust collection port with reducer.  My flexible woodcraft shop vac hose fit the edgeguide without an adapter.  By the way the woodcraft hose also fits the DW618 plunge router without an adapter too.  Anyway I now have good dust collection through the plunge base for inboard cuts, or through the edgeguide for profiling cuts.  A nice feature is the split fence, which you can slide outward to create an opening for the bit.

So Now I have a tool with 3 stripped screws. Just for information, I also tried the front face screws, which also would no budge. I'm guessing that even though the instructions require their removal to add the swing pin, these screws have been chemically locked in.

8430	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I hadn't been able to perfectly square-up my 12" radial arm saw until I bought the Bosch DWM40L Miter Finder Digital Protractor/Angle Finder.  Using a large square, or my other protractor tools, the blade appeared to be at a perfect right angle to the fence, but cuts were ever so slighly off-square.  Placing one edge of this tool on the 12" blade and the other on the left side of saw fence, it read 89.7 degrees.  Placing it on the blade and the right side of the fence, it read 90.3 degrees -- the perfect complement of the first reading.  After a good bit of adjusting on the saw, I was finally able to get a 90.0 reading on both sides.  Now, the radial arm saw cuts accurate right angles.  I used this tool to "perfectly" set right angles on several tools, and have used it sucessfully in construction projects to precisely match angles.
4192	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	As one reviewer has already noted, the dial a width dado by Freud is a bit of a challenge to tighten on the Dewalt 746 hybrid saw. But it is worth the hassel. You cannot use the supplied wrench, and your saw wrench will not fit either. I found that a big ol craftsman combo wrench works just fine to tighten the nut. The "box" end grips just enough to allow you to tighten the nut perfectly. It is worth the extra effort. This is absolutely the best dado I have ever used. Even cuts across grain in veneer plywood are clean and have no tearout, and dadoes cut in hardwoods are things of beauty. Adjustment of the cut is fast and easy, and if you keep a "log" of settings, you can return to a particular cut with confidence that it will duplicate the last cut. Hard to do with shims.

Except for the wheels and feet, there are no plastic parts on this mobile base.  Its all steel construction which I very much like in my shop.  Even the lever for the pivot wheel is steel.


In younger days, I did a bit of framing. For that I prefer a slightly heavier hammer, 20 or 22 ounce. For most hammering needs, this is the best and most versatile hammer. It's light, but not wimpy light. You can still drive a bunch of long nails fast. Also, at the end of the day, your wrist and elbows won't ache as much. Lighter weight and shock absorption makes a HUGE difference in how your joints feel the next day.

I actually got the idea for using this drill as a sander from the book,BUILDING BEAUTIFUL BOXES WITH YOUR BANDSAW, by Lois Keener Ventura (seperate review).

Again, these are good and handy clamps, just be careful of over tightening the QG150 and Mini Bar or you will be replacing them.  I gave these 5 stars because the failures were due to my over use.

The only limit after the length of the blade is the  length of your extension cord and the breadth of your imagination.  You  will want to use a little slower blade speed to keep the blade from  "whipping," but on thicker wood you can speed it up.  You will  find lots of uses for a recip blade this long.  Maybe timber framing?  I  don't know, but someday I'd like to try it.

- Legs: There's no appreciable front to back wobble, but the legs have little rigidity side-to-side.  Feeding a board through the router shouldn't also move the table sideways by 1/2 inch.  (Each side is bolted to the table top through two posts that project slightly below the strengthening ridges on the bottom of the table top.  That provides them an excellent axis for the legs to wiggle.)  Drilling a couple of holes and bolting some bar stock (a piece of wood would work just as well) between the bottom of the two legs helped stabilize it.  This obviously isn't a problem if you clamp the entire thing down as the manual recommends, but poor design is still poor design...you'll notice that competing router tables all have something that connects the right-side legs with the left-side legs.

8863	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Had no experience with a pull saw until I got this one and the Shark 10-2204 detail saw. It comes very sharp and was easy to learn to use. Rip cuts or cross cuts it cuts clean and straight.
All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase. I attached the saw to a mobile stand (the Trojan) and bought a better blade than the one provided when I am doing fine cutting. The blade that was provided works fine for rough carpentry projects.

For speed and efficiency of sanding, most users probably use the highest speed setting.  And doing that will melt the edges of the pad and it's velcro surface.  As good as this tool is, it certainly has its limitations, and this is one of them.
If Dewalt wants to reimburse me some way for having to fix this, I would change my review. I don't see that happening so it will probably stay this way.

But after setting them up and snapping the base plate in place, it was definately love at second sight. Extremely stable and no joke about the support ability. Great for carrying around and very compact storage. Only flaw is the top grooved cap piece being held on by a wire tie, which can be lived with because all the rest of the sawhorse is great. Now the problem is the back order status of the outfeed rollers.  These are truely pieces of equipment that will hold up last a long time.

This is the best book light I've ever used (it has gotten me through something like ten or fifteen overnight bus rides and flights) and I'm sure it will continue to be for many years to come.
The top tray is adequate for a collection of accessories, like driver bits, right-angle driver, and loose bits.  It will not take any of the drill index boxes I own.
9056	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	After a few years it became sticky and slimy. It was exposed to no harsh chemicals. It just aged badly. The hose remained reasonably flexible although it was always hard to wind up or coil. It was just disgusting to use. I had to replace it but the only thing wrong with it was the coating. I think the rubber is treated to resist stains and that breaks down over time and turns to something like the coating on a used lollipop on a summer sidewalk.
I also purchased a stand and light with the saw.  Assembly was a snap.  The light is a real blessing.  It stays right where I put it so far.  The stand is 3 legged and I wish it was on some sort of roller but I am not sure how stable it would be on wheels with only 3 legs.  I have to give this more thought.

The blade itself is ground at 25 degrees and mine actually had a bit of a ding in it out of the box, however, the manual states the blade should be honed to 30 degrees anyway, so after about 20 minutes with a diamond sharpening stone and plane blade sharpening jig, I was able to remove the ding at 25 degrees and then hone a nice sharp edge at 30 degrees. A few quick tests of the product and it worked great.
7284	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Been using them for years, collection of 20+.  Throw a wrench to the handle for extra cranking power, it will take it.

I've added oak blocks with pipe holes and 2" extension above the head and screwed it to the heads.

So, when it came time to replace my Dewalt cutoff saw, I didn't hesitate to order a Makita.  This ended up being a disappointment in design, construction and performance.  I'm comparing this saw side-by-side with a Dewalt D28715, same price in stores as this Makita.  I'm also comparing it to what I can remember of my lower priced Ridgid, which got stolen.  The only pro is that the Makita weighs less the others, but that's not all good because that weight savings is due to poor construction.
RLC
I got the 6" version for use in an under-powered (1.5HP) table saw. If your saw is beefier, the 8" version would enable you to cut deeper dadoes.

So why have I given it a 4 star rating?  Two words, dust collection... or lack thereof.  For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool.  There is a boot PC sells as an add-on that fits over the base.  However, unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out.  Something, anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies, work place safety boards, fire marshals and insurance companies.
This stand is a bit tedious to assemble, but the included drawing helped a bit.  The instructions make it very clear they want you to bolt this thing down, but don't worry it.  I suppose someone tipped it over on a dog once, so they added this to the instructions to reduce liability.  It is a tripod, so keep the kids from playing monkey-bar with it and you'll be fine.

6743	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My usual clamps are Bessey but I have several sets of Quick Grips which are very handy.  The entire line of quick Grips are great for being able to quickly apply clamping pressure while holding the work piece in place with one hand and working this clamp with the other. Quite often I use there to hold things in place before applying the sturdier Bessey clamps, but more and more I am finding these (quick clamps) are sufficient.  Irwin makes 4 different families of One-Handed Bar Clamps that basically differ in strength and robustness.  Be careful of over tightening the lighter duty ones as this will result in a sprung clamp that will lose its ability to hold pressure (it will slip).  This has happened to me with several Irwin bar clamps and they had to be tossed.  NOTE: I have yet to break aSL300 or XP600 series clamp under normal conditions. In testing (repeatedly clamping at different lengths applying as much trigger pressure as I could) I was able to eventually get an SL300 to slip at different points along the bar.  However, this was only after a lot of this abuse.  The XP600 never failed. But as I said, it was easy to over tighten and cause failure in the QG150 and Mini Bar series.

NO SINGLE DEVICE like this will fix a cheap machine, bad bearings or sloppy adjustment.
I have not reviewed or commented on any of the finger joint fixtures or jigs that are available on the market, because I built my own fixture, and it works integrally with the Dial-A-Width dado set. The critical distance that allows you to precisely vary the tightness or looseness of the finger joint is the distance from the side of the blade nearest the indexing pin to the indexing pin itself.  I made the indexing pin out of steel, and securely mounted it. Once you fix this distance( and in my case I made it exactly the same width as the steel indexing pin), then you can use the dial-a-width feature of this blade set to adjust the tightness of fit( again within .004", which is good enough for me). In the finger joint fixtures I've seen on the market, the adjustment of blade to indexing pin seems very imprecise, thus the joint tightness or looseness seems difficult to control.
Speaking of the graduations on the adjustment dial - there's no tick-mark to line it up to (at least I don't see one).  Options - 1) pick a spot to use as your zero point 2) make a mark with a paint pen 3) use a small file to make a small notch.

I actually look forward sanding my projects. I can use it for hours without the fatigue I experience with random orbit sanders and get a much better finish. As another reviewer noted it lacks dust collection. I'm not to impressed with any of the dust collection systems I've seen on other sanders anyway. Buy or build yourself a sanding table, and sand away. This is far and away the best power tool purchase I have ever made.

About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear, so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs, but the difference is barely noticeable. I give them a thumbs-up.

Went to local big box and got this Milwaukee.  I can tell you it's one sweet saw.  Powerful enough to cut thru 2x treated lumber with ease.  Hasn't bound up on me, although I guess if one cuts crooked enough any CS would bind, my craftsmans was always binding, motor running blade stopped stuf like that.  These things don't exist with this saw.  I think the blade that comes with this saw is pretty good.  I used it all thru my deck rebuild with no problems.  As another has said, this saw is not very loud, it is a pleasure to use.  This saw isn't the least expensive out there, but it's well worth the money.  I haven't read all the reviews but can't believe anyone who has used this saw would not like it.  Highly recommend it.

This is an add on for the Bosch Digital Protractor. What this extension allows you to do is extend it just a little bit, or as much as you need, not off the end of the leg, but rather BACK OVER THE ELBOW OF THE UNIT, to measure the angle of something that may be only 3 or 4 inches in length. By extending it the short distance, getting the angle, then deducting it from 180 degrees you can get an accurate measurement. The instructions that come with it, show you a picture of someone who is outside,holding the protractor against a wall, and extending the extension backwards across the knee to get the slope measurement of an outside window sill plate.

In the end, when you are on the end of a tall ladder and you would rather be holding onto the ladder than holding onto the screw so you can drive it, this is the tool for you.

So far (knock on wood) I haven't experienced the switch problem or dust attachment problem that other reviewers have had.  We almost always use it attached to a vacuum.  And that's one of the reasons why it probably gets more use than some of our other sanders.  The vacuum attachment works better with it than on our other sanders.  So far, despite a lightweight appearance that would make you suspicious of its durability, it's still sanding through some rough territory for us.

Unfortunately it bogs down constantly when I use it and is essentially worthless for any heavy duty grinding tasks. It might be great if you need a light-duty variable speed grinder but otherwise it's a waste of money; might as well just buy a cordless. Bosch doesn't seem to make any 5" grinders over 10 amps.
And if you're thinking cordless - don't do it.  Cordless tools have their place, but this isn't one of them.  As mentioned above, you want to keep this thing pegged as you're popping screws in.

But getting this for your grinder is like adding a whole new tool to your collection that has a ton of uses.
For jigs though, Makita was wise to make the planer/jointer blade guides very easy to remove.  I would also suggest a better water distrubution system made by the user, and to search "David Reed Smith Makita Sharpening" to get an idea of what can be done with the tool.  The design challenges begin whether you want to make the jigs from the tool or external, and from there it seems you can sharpen practically anything to the ideal bevel from basically no bevel**, if you can make the jig.

The most freqent use I get from them is making dados in plywood or hardwood cases for plywood shelves and dividers.  The adjustability with the various blades and shims helps me to match the groove exactly to the various widths of my sheet stock.  The bottoms of the dados are very smooth.  Not router bit smooth, but perfectly  acceptable for fit, finish, and glueups.  They make very clean cuts and I have seen almost no tearing or chipping when cutting in veneered plywood.  In a pinch I had to use this set once on a project that used green treat lumber.  They tore through it with ease, and most importantly kept their edge.  These are very high quality blades and should cut great for years if properly taken care of.  I store them back in their hard case with the supplied dividers between blades after every use, so they still look like new after many hours of use.

3762	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you run 10" thin kerf blades this is a great addition to your saw. I purchased this set from another source, impulse buying is usually not something I do, but it said Freud so I knew it had to be good. The machine work and finish is everything you would expect from Freud. When I installed both stabilizers I found that the blade would rub on the throat cover. Due to the design of the top of my table saw, making a zero clearance one is gonna be a real pain. I worried about running only the outside stabilizer until I read the review of "rohoove". I decided to give it a try. Works like a champ. It definitly improved the cutting performance of my blade and for some reason has made the saw run quieter when cutting. It is a noticable differance in both aspects. This is a definite must have. I may try the other stabilizer on my old chop saw, see if it helps there also.
In conclusion, this is a well made meter, seems to give accurate and consistent results. It's usefulness depends on your willingness to learn about wood and it's reaction to moisture.
This light is VERY easy to use and manipulate.  I also use it to read outside at night.  Perfect!  The batteries last a long long time.  I gave my dad one for his birthday September 2008.  He uses it almost every day and battery still working nearly one year later.
343	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This light is amazing.  I bought it for bedtime reading since my husband goes to bed much earlier than I do.  However, I find that I use if for so much more.  For example, I clip it onto my shirt when I am doing my nails for more direct light.  I was worried it would be too heavy for my paperbacks but as long as I clip a chunk of pages together it works no problem!

Far too light on the base, I am contemplating filling the open spaces in the base with body lead. Using regular dewalt 18v's the light will fall over alot if it isn't positioned with care.  I'd gladly have a 5 pound base if it meant i could hang the light head wherever I wanted.

Overall, I'd not wish this product on my worst enemy. It is poorly made, poorly designed, and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it.

My routers are mounted on 3/4" medium density particle board and clamped to saw horses.  They make a breeze of raised panel doors, dados, and decorative trims.

2751	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	After about a month or so, I have had no major problems with this saw. I love the blade changes and tensioner. It did have some vibration at full speed. I have it mounted on a sturdy 2x4 and plywood stand that I built. I did purchase some good blades, the ones that come with the saw are cheap and do not do a very good job. I bought Flying Dutchman blades from Mikes Workshop and they are great. It is a very heavy saw, not something you would want to move around a lot. I would also recommend purchasing a work light for it. If not for the slight vibration and cheap blades, I would have rated it five stars.

2699	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is one powerful saw!  I've yet to slow it down, yet alone bog it down.  It just eats wood.  That aside, it has some super features.  The tilt handle is great.  It is not hard to adjust, and makes the saw much more pleasant to use.  The sightline is excellent, and the saw tracks well.  I also like the padded forward grip, and being able to see the bevel scale without turning the saw around.  The base is flat and promises to stay that way, and the saw is light weight.  I have had no problems with it whatever.  In fact, I gave my backup yellow saw away - and it was a good saw too.  This Milwaukee saw rocks!  It is professional through and through - definitely five star material.
The motor seems plenty powerful for the size of blade, and I never detected any slowing even when cutting through some reluctant material on my driveway.
The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.
Sadly, Milwaukee as have many other manufacturers, moved the production of this model offshore, Japan specifically, but has not suffered in build quality as have many other tools making this journey.

Here's an opinion and some advice... If you've wanted a belt sander for belt-sanding tasks, this is the one to get.  If you've been eyeing those drum sanders that cost more than twice what the 362VS costs, you might want to consider the 362VS as a great alternative that can do not only the same task as a drum sander, but is also much more versatile and consumes very little space in the ol' shop.

Now the negatives.  The router has  an awkward power switch that clicks up into position.  For comparison, I  use the Bosch 1617EVS router, which has a toggle switch that turns on and  off with a light push.  This is a relatively small matter, especially when  plunging (in my opinion) since you usually turn the machine on, then SLOWLY  move it into the wood or lower it into the workpiece; you're not trying to  hurry up and plunge right after you flip the switch on.  The plunging  operation of this router is accurate, but a little stiff.  Again, not a big  deal, although I suppose other routers edge it out in this category.  The  last negative I have about this router is that it comes only with the  1/2" chuck.  I have many 1/4" bits, but I cannot use them with  this router.  This, again, is a relatively small matter, since 1/2"  bits are preferable anyway.  Also, many of my 1/4" bits would never be  used free-hand.  But, comparitively speaking, other router have an edge in  this category as well.
Bye bye mind control

One more thing, buy a good blade!  The saw is only as good as the blade you have on it!  I use a Diablo fine tooth for finishing and less expensive blades for general cutting.

436	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My husband has gone through many book lights.  This was one of his first, until the kids disassembled it, and after quite a few book light failures after, we ordered another of these, and it is still of high quality.  It has a great neck, a strong clip, bright lights that don't fade or blink, multiple brightnesses (two bulbs, three lighting choices), and was a decent price for one that we expect to last a while.  Coming from someone who has bought many book lights, I would recommend the Mighty Bright lights over less-expensive lights- in this case, you really do get what you pay for.  Cheaper varieties left me disappointed.

I bought mine YEARS ago, and it was just stolen, so I'll be buying another one....not even going to shop around for another brand/ model!!  Plenty of power (use the removable side handle, and keep a good stance when doing high torque applications where the bit can grab).  Very rugged construction.  Comfortable grip and control (although not at the lowest end...but I don't use it for those applications anyway).  The removable cord and easy access to replace the motor brushes are nice touches. The handle threading into both the left and right-hand sides makes it easy to share with left-handers at the jobsite.

  The barrel-grip vs. the handle-grip is a matter of personal preference, of course, but so far I have enjoyed the b-g design.  It seems more versatile for tight spaces, plus your hand has more leverage down close to the action.  Unlike a trigger switch, where you just let go, you do have to remember to shut it off when you get to the end of your cut, but that should come with experience.

Speaking of what hammers do, they can do MUCH more than hammer nails. A good RIP hammer like this one, ( as opposed to a "claw" hammer,) is better at removing nails. I have found RIP style hammers are better than claw hammers for removing nails. They are also better at demolition tasks like beating through drywall or prying old studs. RIP hammers are better for lifting and positioning framing members. Some claim a rip hammer can save you from a fall off a roof. I've yet to see that work and hope I never test it.  I do know RIP hammers are faster at removing waste in dados, especially if you sharpen them a bit.

  These combination squares are great for taking a measurement in a difficult to get to area.

342	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love to read, but my bedroom is far away from the only window in my 420-square-foot apartment so I always needed to use the wall-mounted light to read by day or night. After being here for over five years I felt it was about time to invest in a book-light. I have had them in the past but forget why they didn't seem to work out. I looked this one over and decided it looked like it was small, lightweight, easy to use, and in my favorite color (purple) at a really decent price. When it arrived I clipped it to the book I was reading, The Executioner's Song (also ordered from Amazon) and tried it out. It was PERFECT! The only time I may have problems is when I am down to the last few pages since I did clip it onto quite a few pages which I will not be able to do once I am down to only that many pages to read. Still, it is certainly nice that when I am through reading for the night I can just turn off the book-light rather than having to get off my bed, walk around to where the wall switch is to turn off the room light, and then return to my bed. The light comes with the option to use two lights, or just one, and so far I have used both lights so I have to push the button twice to turn it off, but that is no problem. I also have a good supply of AAA's already so when I need to replace the batteries I can do so right away. I can easily adjust the flexible neck to aim the light where I need it, or raise it up high enough to fully illuminate both pages at once. If there is a con to this product, I have not yet found it.

When it's standing on its side while it is folded up, it doesn't seem to be too steady so what I did was I added 4 leveling rubber feet to the bottom. I drilled 4 holes, tapped it and screwed in leveling rubber feet. Now it doesn't tilt over, it doesn't mar or scratch the floor or damage the bottom of the workbench when standing up. I made my own one time tap screw since I didn't own any. I got a bolt with the same screw threading, used the workbench and clamp dogs to clamp on the bolt and used my rotory tool to slices 4 slots on the bolt. Then drilled a hole slightly smaller than the threading into the bottom of the workbench , used a ratchet and slowly tapped the hole to create the threading. (See the pictures that I added)
Overall the design of the support structure for this out feed table appears to have been taken straight from the Rube Goldberg text book on over complicated design and difficult ways to achieve simple results.  It appears as though the assignment to design this out feed table was handed to some young mechanical engineer fresh out of college as his very first task at his new company.  Furthermore it appears that the senior engineers and management at Delta neglected to conduct any design reviews on his work.  Assembly of this table is exasperating at best.

  The real frustration of using a vinyl hose is that it can stand up while moving across the floor, high enough to snag on things, or even pull something onto the floor.

By following the instructions and pushing a button a few times , this baby will do the math for you. Giving both bevel and miter angles for any wall angle. What if the crown you bought has a different back angle than what you are accustomed to ? This will help you find that too . It really saves valuable time. The only thing I would like to see is a smaller version to get into tighter places. Oh well I do have a bevel gauge and a protractor.

7182	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased this set for some doors that I was doing for a china cabinet.  I used birch as the primary lumber and I was amazed at the results.  The doors came out perfect and I was very surprised at the alignment.  They were much easier to set up than expected.  Although these might seem a little expensive, they are worth every penny.
3673	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had mine for years and it works great. I use primarily at the Miter Saw since that's the only tool in my shop that is stationary. For any small shop it works great. This used to be my DC for my basement shop before I moved into the garage. The only problem I had with it was on my belt/disc sander. It didn't pick up the dust that well but the there was roughly 25 feet of hose and PVC to go thru. Not the DC's fault. Overall, I'd recommend it for any small shop
9326	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great air hose at an outstanding price.  It came packaged in a tight coil, but as soon as I opened it up, the hose uncoiled with ease.  The yellow rubber looks to be very durable and heavy-walled and the fittings are high quality brass coated.  You won't be able to find a better air hose at a box store for a price this good.  My only complaint is that I didn't purchase another one!

When the return process first began, they entered a new order for a replacement. It was scheduled to be shipped in June. I can't wait that long, so I told them to give me a refund. Sure hope I get it. In the meantime, I bought this router table at the local Woodcraft store. Paid more, but I have the table in my shop now.
98	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The light is nice and bright and the clip stays put on my Kindle. Only problem I've had is that the thing drains batteries really fast. I use it a lot, and I have to replace the three AAA's at least once a week. The light gets too dim to be useful if I don't.
3609	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	this is no exception. the one we had before this lasted years and years. i expect this one to do the same.
3908	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Deluxe Uniguard is a good value at $270 - and I took advantage of Amazon's $25 off sale so my final cost was $245. Such a deal!

I not unhappy with the performance at all.  It does require the new cabinet for cutting large stock.  The stability on heavy wide stock as demands the unit be anchored well too.

7704	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a really good hammer. I replaced my old one and used this to put siding on half of my house. It's comfortable and a good weight for someone that isn't super weak. I would consider myself of average strength. It might be a bit heavy for someone that is really weak.

5316	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I must admit that the only reason I'm reviewing this product is because I can use the Title "Well connected". And that is what it does and it does it as advertised 4" to 4" connection. What more can I say than I am better connected to my dust collection system than I was before and that is a good thing.

5767	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The hose is constructed very well - perfect fit for my dust collection machine port.  I bought it to hook up to a sander but with the added tools it is a great general cleaner for the shop.
8935	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It no way effected the performance of the product, but the ones i received were silver and the ones advertised where black. The one issue I had durning set up, using the 3/8 set up that the chipper and the two outer blades carbon  kept bumping into each other and it took me about 20 minutes to figure it out. Hopefully I don't have to use that set up to often.
I was working for a framing contractor who owned about 10 or 12 of these.  We had air, but depended on these about 85% or more of the time.  Having no hose was the biggest benefit, especially when framing 14:12 hip rafters.
1439	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They work fine and the price was great. I can't say anything about longevity of the bulbs. I'll try to update the review if they don't last.

9531	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This thing is my workhorse for personal and industrial projects.  Still working great, no leaks, the best. This length works for any project, big or small. Buy with confidence.
3536	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have my own furniture business and the PC 97366 is a great sander. It is much more aggressive than my DW421. Dust collection is great, variable speed is very handy for fine work, after 2 months pad brake still working  and all this with no swirl marks. A great sander for most work, but still  not the only sander I need and use.
After watching countless Rob Cosman videos and trying every trick he shows I gave up.
9712	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	You can buy cheaper hoses but you cannot buy better.  Spend just a few cold days fighting a cheap PVC hose and you will become a believer in rubber air hoses.  Avoid the frustration and buy a good rubber hose right off the bat.  While a little more expensive, rubber hoses are more flexible and much easier to handle than PVC.
9269	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works well, you can't get any better.

80	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this every night when I read in bed. Best and brightest light I have ever used! Works even better when I bought the adapter to plug it in with. Would buy this again and again and again!
Parts are NOT clearly identified; They must think that everyone who is going to assemble this workbench must already be "Tim the Toolman."  Having never owned one of these workbenches before and NOT being a carpenter or mechanic, this will take several hours to try to assemble and that's even by using the horrible instructions.  I might be better off not trying to read the instructions and just figure out the assembly by common sense.
9997	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the very best quick loading tool I have used. It works well with DeWalt, Craftsman and Ryobi bits (from my testing) whether they have the ball lock design or just the slit ring. They hold it absolutely solid and do not budge. You will definitely know when the bit is secured.
3150	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Worked well. Thought the instruction could be a little better.

The top is particle board held to the metal frame with steel bolts.  It has stood up well; I've tossed it in the back of vehicles and hauled it around the yard in the Garden Way cart and it's never given me any problems.  It just works.

2075	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have been using mine now for about 5 years and it has never failed to perform an excellent job.  Original excuse for getting it was to clean up the edges of some hardwood flooring.  Now I use it for all my finish work.  Very quiet, fairly vibration and dust free... and with the hook and loop pad, very easy to switch between sand paper grades
Placed extras in strategic locations for my next emergency blackout when I would have forgotten where I put my spare bulb.

7776	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Had this product for a about 3 years - got it from Lowes for about $55 at the time. It's not very sturdy, and the hand cranks that move the vise are made of plastic - they broke within the first year. I've had to rig it in various ways to keep the vise function working. I would not buy it again due to its cheap parts.
I love the fact I can use vise / bench dogs in it too for clamping odd size pieces.

4238	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Increasing the capacity of your band saw opens up many possibilities. The Jet block worked well on a 14" Rockwell machine.
4518	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this joiner tool all the time.  It's very easy to adjust for the different size biscuits and material thickness.  The dust collection bag works great too.  If you don't use the bag, it will kick out a lot of saw dust, so use the bag and save you a lot of clean up.  I've used this biscuit cutter in almost every angle, mostly in poplar wood.  Very accurate and simple to use.
5059	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Both ends fit as expected.
7590	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	No complaints fits tight in the table.guides well on the wood. Small rip cuts - it works well if you have a straight edge to run it down.
Maybe i'll break down and actually do the required maintenance. It will probably help, huh?
373	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like it. Nice, strong clip. Holds onto a textbook no prob. The light is not too bright and is focused in an area about the size of the page. After using it for about an hour ... I got back on Amazon and ordered 2 more.
One tip for when you are doing a blade change- get a small block of wood and set it on the table to hold up the throat of the unit in the "up" position to make sure you are getting the right tension.
* The reduction in dust was amazing. There is nothing special about my ShopVac- it is the typical $50 version from any big-box store. I would recommend using one of the filters to keep the dust from blowing straight through the vacuum and back into the room. I also have the feeling that sandpaper lasted a bit longer, since there isn't as much sawdust to clog up the grit...but I didn't measure it.
8169	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great Dado Set!  I purchased because I was making some mortise and tenon joints for a maple coffee table that was for my dads 60th birthday.  It worked great!  The product is easy to set up and sharp which means it provides a clean, almost splint free cut.  Also of note I did not even use this on a "nice" table saw, instead it was on a contractor low grade saw and still performed wonderfully.
8125	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The tool makes work much easier and accurate. The actual model is not the unfinished wood like in the pictures, but nicely stained and looks really nice. Also, it comes in a nice plastic tube to store it it. Glad that I waited for it and did not get the cheap one from the local Homedepot.

Con; compared to my trusty old Bosch 4X24, the Makita seems to leave a lot of "trails", upon closer inspection the bottom plate where the belt rides is not flat and a little ripply compared to the Bosch that is much more flat, I can make a table top almost perfectly flat with the Bosch, not so with this, but if you just want to hog off material with 36 grit rock on!
2. The pressure regulator is a plastic unit and seems to me that it will break soon.  It's positioned such that it is easily knocked.
7848	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good hammer. I swing this thing around like Thor when I'm at work building stuff

5127	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Originally ordered the wrong size. This will connect a 4" bare hose to a rigid shop vac 2.5" fitting (or 2.5" powertec fitting-- both are actually 2.25" in diameter).
Great product.
9144	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Been using and abusing this for 3 years now, and it's held up great, much better than the "premium" Craftsman hose it replaced.
The sole was extremely rough and concave - an hour of lapping starting with 80 grit only got the 'key areas' around the nose, toe, and throat area lapped. Much of the area behind the blade is still untouched. The adjustable nose plate was the roughest - right at the edge in front of the blade was worst. Exactly where you don't want it to be rough. Still mill marks there after an hour.
Some of the earlier Biesemeyer overhead blade guards came with a removable splitter that sold separately for about $30.00.  The 78-431 is about $130.00 and more meaty than the thirty dollar freebee.
5129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this dust collector when I had my shop in a two car garage and thought I would need a bigger one when I finally build a dedicated work shop, but I installed it until I could afford more.  That was about a year and a half ago and it is still collecting dust and chips just fine.  I have always used a 30 gal garbage can with the 'cyclone' top to catch the large things before they could get to the impeller and it has worked well.  I installed a JDS system that turns on the collector whenever a blast gate is open so it forces me to make sure that I keep everthing closed unless I am using it and I have always had plenty of airflow. It is loud, but not in a high-pitched way like a router or a shop vac so it is tolerable.  It was delivered with a few dents but nothing of consequence and was easy to assemble.
1325	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bulbs worked great. Wanted the frosted but so much more expensive. Honestly cannot tell any difference. Great price. Great deal!!!
5073	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	works great!
8766	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As always, products from Starrett are excellent and dead accurate.  Save you money on buying the cheap ones and spend a little more to get one you can trust.  I have cheap ones and they are not reliable as I learned the hard way.
5827	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I haven't had to use this wheel yet, but if it works like the one that came in the machine, all is going to be ok.  The wheel in the machine sharpens drill bits really well!
247	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This book light works very well for a variety of uses. Great quality, many uses, and worth the price.
2403	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For the fool who suggested a LED flashlight instead... Yeah that works well on construction sites, really lights things up.  Sheesh.
It's a very squat drill press that isn't as top rear heavy as most, and because this is a design that lowers to flat, (like on my laguna bandsaw) rather than stays mobile until you lock a wheel, I thought it would be the one.
1006	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect replacement for the bulb that blew out in my travel trailer.
3682	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Excellent flash light!  Very bright!  It was an extra that came with the set but I'm happy to have it.  Nice to know it's there when you need a good flash light
An multi LED version or better yet a combo LED/incandescent would be a good redesign for the nano version. I don't like the feel of 100% LED lamps.
5285	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Used this with the PSI big gulp and a 6 inch piece of 4 inch vacuum tubing and a couple of hose clamps.  This helped me wrangle the dust collection on my shop miter saw and lathe.

8425	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This was just a one time use item to make some cuts in tile and foundation.  Did both with ease.  I attached to a non dewalt cut off tool which required some additional washers but aside from that the blade was fine.
413	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	IGOOD LIGHT!  This would make a good stocking stuffer. I use mine on my kindle for when we go camping. It shows a nice light and clips nicely to my kindle.

4557	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you have Board buddies this is a great accessory.  The track allows you to move the Buddies without remounting them on different areas of your fence.  It saves alot of time.  I attached a 1" x 3" x 3' piece of pine on the side of my fence and then mounted the track on top of that.  I didn't really see a way to mount the track directly on the fence.  I can't say enough about this product.  It is a must have.
-I'm happy.
I read in other reviews that R4512 owners didn't know what to do with the riving knife locking lever.  When you remove your regular blade and the riving knife simply leave the locking lever UNLOCKED in the upright position.  It is perfectly safe and you can still make a deep dado without the lever hitting the zero clearance insert.  This is also stated in the Ridgid manual.
8196	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Been a finish carpenter for 40 years and have always loved my Estwing hammer ! Just right !

3195	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was in the market for a miter saw for a whole-house crown molding project.  I spent a few weeks going to local stores as well as reading online reviews.  I settled on the 3915 from Amazon.com and have been very pleased with my decision.  Below are some key findings:
619	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is really cute and rather feminine.  Its purple overall with a pretty little frilly heart design.  The graphic has a big heart with several little hearts in the design, and there are styluses and other products that match it available.  The pretty soft lavener and true purple colors should please anyone that likes purple.  The graphic is hip and fun.


Final tally - 5 stars the only corded drill that I will own.

6297	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great router table for the price.
3757	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I agree with the review that you should stabilize your saw and not your blade, but at some point you are going to want a blade stabilizer. If you do a lot of crosscuts/miters on your table saw it really helps out to give you that "shinny" crosscut. This stabilizer is the worst that could ever have been invented. Who wants to have their blade offset approx 1/4"? There are two stabilizers in the kit and I have yet to see a table saw that you can remove the original flange mounted to the arbor so you don't warp your blade with only one stabilizer. (The stabilizer is larger than most arbor flanges) Freud really should have thought out this design. They make wonderful blades, but this product makes them look like idiots. You have to adjust your fence to compensate. Homemade box cutting jigs are shot. The only nice thing is that they are not as large as other blade stabilizers. I threw this one in the trash and bought the forest 5" blade stabilizer. Does everything I want. I can use it with my dado. Which is a Freud. DO NOT USE ONLY ONE OF THESE. That can cause serious injury or death.
 I also highly recommend the electric brake. In fact that was the main reason I was looking for a saw - my old skilsaw would spin for almost ever after cutting - which made me nervous. Now I'm used to the brake and wouldn't have a saw without it. In fact, once in a while the brake will fail to engage (I think if I let go of the trigger too slow or something) and it kind of bugs me; I'll usually flip it on again to get it to work.
Work well but obviously lifetime is somewhat limited in that environment.
-Drain valves in position that can easily be broken off

The packing of the out feed table was of superior quality. It came in a very heavy gauge cardboard carton.  The contents were packed well and reached my door step in perfect condition.  Many reviewers noted that their table was damaged in shipping due to less than quality packaging.  Not so in my case.  Perhaps Delta has responded to all the negative customer feedback.
3303	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great fit and finish, overall it is well made This light serves the purpose well and has an attractive appearance.


First issue, there's a ton of tear out on the rear of the work piece using this blade. The only way to get a semi-decent cut piece is to cut at an extremely slow rate. Even then, it's barely acceptable.  Compared to the Diablo blades, I shouldn't have to baby this, and the results are abysmal for the price tag.
1845	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great tool, just what I needed for the job
5599	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Like it.

9037	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Not sure what professional-grade air hoses go for today. I don't buy them very often and didn't do a lot of research before buying this one. It looks to be very well made and better than the ones I used to use at the corner garage back when they offered free air.....remember those days? The end fittings are of good quality and put on straight. It's a joy to finally get rid of that hard plastic coiled headache I've been using. If I need another, I'd buy this one again.

4189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  But now, maybe, the dial-in model is newer and easier if it produces as good a cut as SD 508???
3057	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Fit and ok
4818	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've used this joiner for aligning panels and attaching face frames.  The adjustments for angle, depth, and biscuit size are all very easy to use, and accurate.  The machine has plenty of power and cuts through hard maple with ease.  I would've given it a 5, however the small dust collection bag they provide with it seems to be useless (the chute keeps clogging).  I just use it without the bag and clean up afterwards.

1566	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good price
6749	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	My device came from Amazon with a faulty probe connector, but I noticed the problem 2 months too late (after just a couple uses, but after taking readings with the device). Hopefully Sonin RMA can just send me a new probe cable as I used a continuity tester to diagnose the problem. Their performance remains to be seen..
so why did i only give it 4 stars?  someone at freud  just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8" chipper. Quality control cost ya a star Freud.
8215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I, like probably many people (especially wives/girlfriends buying for Their Guys) was dazzled by its good looks. However, I'm not sure what it's good for, unless I really need to mark 22.5 degree angles and the like. Frankly, why would I need to mark in 1/2 degree increments? Furthermore, this unit requires you to use a 0.5 mm pencil, which they helpfully supply, but WITHOUT leads. There are far better center-finding protractors (made of plastic) on the market.
-I had to turn my monitor until I got one that went in the same direction I needed.
If you have ever, even almost steped off the wrong side of a lesser two foot ladder, spend the difference and get twice the ladder. With steps on both halves it safer, your worth it.
 All in all, definitely 5 stars. The more you use it, the more it will become your favorite one.
5203	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works as intended. Used this to help adapt 4" hose from a dust collector to a sand blasting cabinet.

2668	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice accessory to use with your 18VDC Dewalt tool.

This one should last a long time.
1487	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The lights are individually boxed.  Price for these lights at the RV store is 2/$5.50 or in that area.

Lots of adjustment and combinations. The raised panel bit is very large and gives a 10mm flat to slide into the groove. The router certainly needs to be as slow as possible as this cutter is very big.

5027	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	If your worried about this thing fitting STOP !! This fitting fits inside the standard 4" collection hose no problem. As for the reduction end it's also true and mated with my shop vac hose just fine. Here's a little helpful hint. If your having problems with fittings or your dust collection hose has a weird tweek in it and won't fit up under your machine like you want. Use a heat gun or a hair drier to slowely heat up the hose and then position it however you need to. Now get out there and collect some dust.

The biggest downside I see to this unit it that the router is enclosed in a box.  It says in the instructions "To prevent router overheating periodically open the cabinet door during use, and never let dust and debris collect inside the cabinet. Always use a vacuum at the fence mounted dust port. For extended operation you must install a dust port in the cabinet or remove the door during operation.".  Ok, so this unit is built really nice, with a high quality and well finished plywood enclosure and there is this warning about potentially damaging my router?  The fix for me would be to cut into the enclosure and add a dust port.  Why didn't dust dog include an extra port? If they had I would have given them 5 starts!

2630	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I own the discontinued Dewalt DW703 compound miter saw and only occasionally pull it out of my shed to set up in the garage on a portable workbench when I have a project that needs to be done. Right now I'm working on replacing boards on my deck. I had been moving a second portable workbench and saw horses around to either side of the saw to support the extended lengths of the boards and thought that there must be an easier way to do this. I started pricing these DW7080 Support Extensions online but noticed that many of the stores listed them as "out of stock". Since amazon.com had them "in stock" I decided to buy two, before they also became discontinued Dewalt items. Amazon is excellent when it comes to shipping their products and I received mine in 2 days. Yes, they are expensive, but so was the miter saw when I bought it. Although these extensions do not slide underneath the saw for storage, for the occasional carpenter like me it won't be a problem to disassemble everything to put away until my next project. I was aware of the comments about the difficulties in inserting the self-tapping T-30 Torx/flathead screw to secure the supports but I had no problems with that after starting the screw with a flathead screwdriver and then tightening it down using a T-30 Torx hex bit inserted in to a  inch socket in to a 3/8 inch adapter attached to my ratchet. Dis-assembly and future re-assembly should not be a problem. If it wasn't for the price I would have given this item 5 Stars.

2806	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Easy setup, rock solid saw. Very little vibration, very accurate. The dust blower works well to keep the cutting area clear.
The scroll saw doesn't generate a lot of sawdust so a dust collection attachment for a shopvac isn't a requirement. However, it 'would be nice' to have that option. I'm sure that some people like to keep their work area completely sawdust free, so for them it would be an added bonus.

Just do a search for both names. The saw is worth the small inconvenience in locating blades.

The top fence is a little flimsy as are the adjustment knobs.  In my experience it is difficult to get 100% accuracy when joining two boards.  When using the top fence I see about 1/16" error fairly frequently.  When indexing off the bottom plate, I see about 1/32" error.

With that being said this dado set is no different than any of the other freud products I have in my possession.  Cuts a nice dado with smooth edges and flat bottoms.  This is not the fastest cutting dado set in the world, but then again.  I do not really expect it to be in its price range.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the shims that come with it.  You can not really read the thickness markings on the shims, which isn't that big a deal if you have a good dial caliper, but not everyone has a good dial caliper.  Other than that it is a great dado set.

The Rust Free contains a mild acidic base. Several applications were necessary to remove all the rust and soil stains. Good ventilation should be provided to avoid the fumes. I had a problem with the spray bottle freezing up on me from so much pumping. I had to "rest" it for a few seconds and then continue pumping every now and then. The use of a spray bottle in this case is not such a good idea since it is hard to be accurate spraying an acidic solution--getting it on the paint is inevitable. I switched to a small sponge instead, the sixe of a half dollar, which worked very well and much faster. I could see the rust and soil stains being lifted off with each application.

You might ask why I would go through the trouble of modifying the Delta outfeed?  Well currently the only ready made flip up/down outfeed for the Sawstop is a pivoting roller rack, which is almost identical to the one I put on my old PM66.  Its was a very sturdy unit but I didn't like the roller rack because  it let small work pieces fall through or wedge between the rollers, and I had to constantly lower it to clear the miter slides on jigs/guides.  If you forget to raise it back up, boards can and do slide back towards the blade.  Now I know that if the guard is in place this isn't a problem, but I use a lot of jigs that don't work with a guard.  That's way I bought a Sawstop which has at a riving knife in place most of the time and a blade brake all the time.

There is a bit of accumulation of dust on the table, but I see that as less a problem with table top machining than with a whimpy dust blower.  The blower does work, it just doesn't move the dust very far.  I've got full-shop dust collection so I just do a quick clean periodically with a 2" hose I leave free and that seems to be able to keep up, but for a small blade it seems to create a lot of dust.

Table arrived in 3 days, was packaged well, assembly was straight forward. Was beyond impressed with the quality and detail to function ~ fit/finish was outstanding. Assembly took 15-30 min, but I went slow paying attention to detail. The fence is very robust (same extrusion as their famous full-size router table fence. The fence included 2 small square bars about 8-9" long that aren't mentioned in the manual, so I downloaded the fence manual online and found out they are shims for the outtake side of the fence so the table can be used as a joiner - Kewl!  All-in-all am very impressed with what all you get in such a small package and the quality is exactly the same as the other BenchDog products - easily recommend this for anyone looking at a bench top router table.
This is a lightweight; very portable and maneuverable saw; having less torque & power than a full-sized circular saw.  Those are distinct advantages in many situations, such as using it vertically or over your head, or when cutting trim-sized stock.  On some jobs it's just more practical to use a small saw.  It's also safer than a large saw because it's lower torque means a reduced chance of the saw getting away from you.

As for some of the bad removes about crap quality or broken C-clips. The quality seems as good as any simple metal device could be.  Since the outer cylinder extends a few millimeters paster the inner, that does mean that when you screw something down at high speed, the impact will transfer to the cylinder and the C-clip.  Apparently, the clip can pop off or the cylinder actually splits, based on poor reviews.  Some solutions to consider to extend the life of this tool is:

  Some ways back, when I was just getting back into woodworking, I bought a boatload of clamps that were so cheap, and made in China. The clamping mechanism is sometimes a hassle to deal with, which is not what you want, when glue is setting up. These Bessey's are hassle free and reliable. The cheap clamps are made with a square tube the clamp rides along. Consequently they take a great deal of pressure without showing any signs of bending.

Well I bought both, and found the Freud to cut a surface so smooth that it was glass like. If I was going to put a finish on it, I would rough it up with 200 grit to improve the adhesion, it was that smooth. Also the Freud had absolutely no tear out, not even a little bit. Perfect is the word here. So why did I buy the Forrest Woodworker II also? Because everybody was raving about it. Forrest makes great products.

Blade insertion is very fast and easy. It takes only a few second to thread the blade though a hole and reconnect the blade.
However, it cannot fix a cheap saw, a dull blade, a poor set-up or a careless operator.
Read the reviews.  Hidden herein, there are several, "can't adjust the depth guage"... and then people just blow it off.
 One other feature is that it has a hold button, so if you are on a scaffold, or ladder, and reaching for a measurement, you can hit the hold button while in place, and it will hold the display of the measurement, even if you bump it to a new setting.

Ok, that's the bad. This table works, and works well. I wrestled with building my own but in hind site it would be tough to make one as sturdy, light, and with folding capabilities. My shop is in my garage and it's sometimes shared with the car, so having a folding table is nice. The design is very flexible so it should attach to almost any cabinet saw (requires some drilling in your cabinet). It uses lots of angle iron and fastners but the instructions are enough to get you through it. Once installed it makes sheet cutting a breeze. I can't believe I used roller supports for so long. It's expensive for what it is....basically painted angle iron, fastners, and a cheezy table board. But it works great. I would buy it again.

I also bought the DW3278 rip fence, which secures to the saw deck using a channel in a casting that is attached to the top of the deck. A knurled nut, which comes with the rip fence, threads through the channel to lock the rip fence in position. Many other circular saws come with the rip fence, but for some reason DeWalt decided to cheap out a bit by making this inexpensive part into an optional accessory.
8234	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	really nice
Even contractors I know will not use it, but rather the much lighter plastic hose.  I  bought it to connect my compressor in the RV basement to my tires.  Way too heavy to deal with!

7020	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I picked up a couple of these to incorporate as hold-downs on a table saw sled I built.  They are working very well for the task and just have them attached using #8 x 3/4" wood screws.  The holes on the base are two large to use #6 screws (just an FYI).  There are multiple points of adjustment on these so they offer quite a bit of flexibility.  They do tend to be a little stiff out of the box, but I suspect they will loosen up a little with some lubrication and use.  So if you need a couple of toggle clamps for a saw sled and are intimidated by the multitude of options from a place like McMaster-Carr, just get a couple of these.  They are flexible enough to meet most needs.

Just one word of caution, make sure to keep an eye on the sanding paper.  The first piece I used was almost down to the backing when I checked it.  The crazy part...it was still cutting the glass.  People have already stated on here that your sanding medium will last a lot longer because the grit doesnt get filled in with the dust, and they were right.

8703	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this dado set for my DeWalt DWE7480 table saw.

Now looking at Rousseau's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings.  Being a weird sized plate means I'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate.  Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings. Also Rousseau's customer service is a nightmare.

When I do use it, I will sharpen my planer, jointer, chisels, and cooking knives all in one swoop.  This is a great tool.  When I first got this I knew little about sharpening and boy did I have alot to learn.  Assuming whoever reads this knows about sharpening, you first sharpen the back(a little), then set the main bevel, and then create a micro-bevel.  I bought the rough and the 4000 grit wheel, but I never use them.  If something needs a lot of metal removal , I use a bench grinder with Norton wheels.  Im my opinion, the whetstones work better after about an hour using them.  I think this is the water absorbing in the grinding stone. Its all about the slurry thats created. I learned to soak it an hour before using it. Wear work clothes when using this.  There's a lot of splatter as the slurry contacts the knives.  It doesnt come out of your clothes.  When done clean the metal particles off the wheel.

Second, I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence (DW3278).  You can usually find it up for around $10.00, and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier.  Definitely a good investment!
Overall, I do not recommend this product.
The real value in this product is the T-9 protection. With it you can keep rust away far better and far longer than just using paste wax. Just give it a good cleaning first with the Rust Free and you've got a very good maintenace program with this set.
It has a longer neck, which help give more power  on a strike, and the claw is sharp and can be used great as a pry bar and for demolition. In my other review, I did say I use my 16 oz more often, which I do, bit it doesn't mean that this hammer is any less. 22 oz is a good weight for just about anything. Anything more, I would say is great for someone who does professional framing or works on construction. I will say, I have seen people with 32 oz hammers use them while putting up trim and sinking nails in 2 hits.

  According to many data sources, the two most notorious tools for severe injuries are radial arm and table saws.  Speed is part of the reason for these data.  So fast in fact that in most cases, you will not have the time to react and remove yourself from harm's way until AFTER the fact[much like ducking after hearing a rifle shot as sound travels a rough average of 1170 ft/sec but many rifle rounds travel an average far above that].  WHAT reaction time??
This is a very nice, wide-beam flashlight.  The craftsmanship is what you would expect from DeWalt.  The light is made of quality materials.  And, due to the design and the bottom-heaviness of the battery pack, this flashlight can "stand" on its own.  Perfect for those times when you don't have someone to hold the light for you.  And, because it throws a wide beam, this unit can illuminate quite a lot of area.  I highly recommend this high quality light to those who already own a DeWalt tool that uses the 14.4 volt battery pack.

I've used these screws with my Kreg jig with good results. I've had no breakage, although I have experienced stripping out of the wood when driving them carelessly at top speed.

It's not a regular drill where you have to slowly bring the screw up to speed. With drywall guns, the bit doesn't turn till you push the screw to the wall, when it catches it drives the screw at top speed, then stops turning once it hits the right depth.  It all happens in the blink of an eye.
6129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The thing works well and its a must have for a planer and a big plus for a joiner. However I cant believe this cant be made with hose fittings so a quick disconnect can be attached instead. I had to use PVC to hose fittings ,attempt to glue and seal them into the unit and duct tape to hold firm. It worked ok. Its sorta like this unit is only half designed. For me it has to be able to be disconnected after use as the hoses have disconnects for other machines. As well as the fact that with the trash can and all, it takes up a lot of room and space is always at a premium in the shop. As important as dust and waste control are its a shame no companies really give more thought ,design and care in the sizing.manufacturing and compatibility of the fittings. Id love to see a good company dedicated to dust control for small shops spring up that manufactures  good quality products with more design thought and a larger list of available workable fittings

3392	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This base I found to be fairly well made and the assembly was straight forward. So far I have found that moving my jointer has been a breeze and it quite simple to operate. I like the "KISS" principle, you know "Keep It Simple Stupid". I did however find two of the plastic end caps already broken in the box, but I really did't worry about it since they do not affect the function.
It is not much but the edge of the insert definitely catches the work piece when I slide it across.
5.) The 330 doesn't have a dust collection system, unlike the 340. Granted, if you buy a 330 you probably have a downdraft table and don't want the drag of the vacuum hose to interfere with the feedback of the sander, but it would still be nice.
5050	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my fourth router (and the best ever).  It is primarily used in a router table and was selected for stability and ease of non-stick plunging.  I have altered the adjustment knob to facilitate adjustment by replacing it with a shop made crank which greatly enhances cutter adjustment.  Otherwise, the machine is relatively large for certain small types of hand work. I have it mounted in 1/4" phenolic using 3 flat head Phillips metric screws: 6MMx1.0, cut from 30MM down to about 17MM or 11/16".  Almost any hardware store has metric screws.  The unit is smooth in both starting and plunge cutting. If the collet is not properly seated in its tightening nut, it may SEEM to be too small.  It is, however, quite precisely 1/2" (and for those that like metric it's 12.7MM)  All bits and the supplied 1/4" adapter fit perfectly.  It's the best deal going.
9793	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this one to replace the one I bought at Lowe's and lost after nearly 5 years of use in my 18v cordless. Apparently the old adage it true... if you want to find something, buy the replacement. I found my lost one and put it in my new compact drill and will continue to use it until it is worn out, which apparently won't be for a long time. I'm not sure why Lowe's and Home Depot stopped selling these, but it's their loss since it's available at Amazon. Easy, one-handed bit insertion and removal make this a convenient addition to any drill.

This hose does not come with them. I was bummed out when I opened the box and even more bummed out once I found out that I would have to pay for return shipping since it was my fault I ordered the wrong item. So I decided to keep it and use it.

5786	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As a general review, this is exactly as described.  Very rigid, doesn't kink.  It seems expensive (took me a while to decide to buy)  After 5 seconds of use... you'll smile that "oh good, it's worth the money," smile.  I think the vac performance is improved (more CFMs)  The smooth interior and rigidity of this hose keep air moving with less line friction.
4922	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I read the reviews and had it narrowed down to two jointers; DeWalt and Porter Cable. I decided that the price was right on the DeWalt and figured it would do the job. I tested a few joints with it and noticed that the wood was a little off. I figured that it was user error and continued on with my project. Then I decided to check for sqareness off the adjustable fence. The pointer lined up just past the "0" mark and sure enough it was off. No problem, I thought, since it had an adjustment screw, I could not adjust it to where I needed it to go. I had to file the stop block to get it at "90". This failed to fix the problem with the line up of the wood. I finally measured the cut and found that it was a 32nd higher on the right side of the cut. No matter how I hold the tool to the surface it was off. A visual look at the blade and you can see the blade comes out at an angle. Bottom line, the mechanics of the tool are strong, but the machining of everything else hooked to the motor needs more attention. It is going back tomorrow. A 32nd sounds picky, but it sure racks your project when you put all the biscuits in place. Not a good tool for fine woodworking projects.

4682	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	First of all I think that the board buddy is a good idea. Safety is always an important issue with me. The board buddy is well made. In saying that I gave only 2 stars because the board buddy is a pain for people with metal fences. I have an expensive  biesemeyer fence on my saw . I'm  not about to drill holes and tap them in my fence to put in a track so I can use the board buddy.(fence has no pre-drilled holes ) I think that this should have been  something that Woodstock should have stated in their description or made an adapter . I had to go online and research this to fix my problem. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use the board buddy when I needed it.  I would not have bought the board buddy if I knew what I know now. I would have done  something else. Good wood fences are not  cheap unless you make one . It is something that a good wood worker can do and I'm not at that skill level yet. Not happy with Woodstock.

My father had an Estwing stacked leather handle hatchet. I always liked the design and the way it worked. I needed a hammer and, on looking around, found that the Estwing design, from 1923 is still being manufactured. Naturally I bought one, and was so taken with the idea of owning something of such classic and proven design that now I own practically a complete set of Estwing leather handled tools. You can't buy an American made "Perfect Handle" wrench or screwdriver anymore, but Estwing keeps right on making their striking tools to the same standard as when they designed their original 90 years ago.

Mind you, you still need to be sure your fence and blade are parallel or even with this "magic" blade you will get burn marks.  I did buy the stiffner so I can't comment on with/without.  You do loose some cutting depth with the stiffner, but all of what I cut on the table saw has not been an issue.  The lesson I learned is that I spent good money on a saw, but the blade is where the best investment is made.

Purchased and found it to be very solid and strong in holding power. With the quick release button, setting the height is very fast. This is the best clamp I've used (have owned 4-different brand sliders), but also one of the more expensive hold downs (reason for only 4 stars)!
It has excellent torque for a small motor. Difficult to bog down unless I'm using a large diamond disc.

8950	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This was a bit cheaper than the other dado setups.  Takes a little patience to set up the cut width.  Once setup, it performs very well.  I use mine on a Dewalt 744x.
I finally took the Avenger set back and bought this Freud 6 inch set.  The difference is night and day.  If I set up the Freud set for a 3/8 inch dado, it is dead on at 3/8 inch.  The bottom of the dado is absolutely smooth - not even a hint of unevenness.

It has a rubber pad on the end of the clip, which matches up with a rubber pad on the base, helping it to stay in place on hard surfaces.  Some reviews have noted that it slides around a bit on thin book covers, and I saw that too *IF* I didn't push the clip as far down as it would go on the cover.

I must be missing something here.  For the $160 price the PC 310 cost, you can buy the PC 690LR ($125) with more power and still get some router bits for less.

The light is adequate for reading, and the neck is smoothly flexible.  I also love that it uses LEDs.  Can someone point me in the direction of an adaptor?  I would be interested in one.  I would like to note that this light did come with 4 AAA batteries.  Also, the light has 3 settings:  off, on, and "really on".  There's not that much discernible difference between the two "on" settings.  It's clear that one of the LEDs isn't lit for the dimmer setting, but the reduction in light output is barely noticeable.

They certainly do a nice and safe job. I cannot say that the bottoms are perfectly smooth, but they are flat. The side blades do a nice job of not splintering the wood. Needless to say that they are a huge step up from the usual beginner-level of dado cutting.

Corny, you say?  It's just a pricey combination square, you say?  Perhaps.  But for me, there are only a handful of tools in my collection that evoke an emotional response whereby their very use transports me back to my grandfather's shop, where I can feel the textures, hear the machinery, and smell the varnish, dust, motor oil and age.  This is one of those tools.  It makes me nostalgic for an age- real or imagined- before outsourcing and cheap tools, when quality was the norm.  This combi square simply looks and feels different than many of my other layout tools, aside from being more accurate and precise than any of them.  It looks...  machined.

I have already returned one set for a refund that Amazon said not to bother sending back BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFECTIVE. So, I went ahead and ordered a second set AND THEY DO NOT WORK EITHER.

The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because with the pipe I bought, the locking mechanism mars the surface and can get a bit stuck but I'm pretty sure this is more of a problem with the cheap pipe I bought from Home Depot then the clamp design.

For the more seasoned user, this plane will work well after a couple of hours tuning. For the rookie, it provides a good learning base - it's not very expensive so you aren't as afraid to do something to it to learn how to tune it. It will never be quite as good as a Veritas or LN, but it can be 90% as good at about 25% the price. Spend time researching the internet for tuning how-to's - there's a lot of good and bad information out there. Learn how to sharpen - Brent Beach has an excellent site. Stone or sand all edges to deburr until things adjust smoothly. Get the sole flat. Get the end of the cap against the blade flat. Enjoy learning about hand planes and in the end you will have a very good user.
Cons? The packaging IS flimsy and I was surprised that mine arrived in decent condition given how much of a mess the box was in. Also, the documentation for building it was pretty lousy. It's simple enough to build but some aspects of it like attaching the handles for the cranks were harder than they needed to be and a better manual would have been the reassurance I needed that I wasn't trying to do something the wrong way. They could probably give the part of it that you swivel up for perpendicular vising action smoother action without adding gobs more to the cost.
Overall I am well pleased and would buy again.

I belive this is better than having to try and remove material from the insert when it sits high, and is almost certianly a result of the variation in the manufacture of the saw tables and the makers of the insert have taken this variation in depth of shoulder in the saw table into account in their design. If they are really unhappy with the product, let them make something better, I know I couldn't do better.
The Uniguard is one of the least expensive, and actually has a lot of features.  It has a split guard, which means that, on short cuts, the guard is still down.  It has an accessory tray and a place to mount an upper switch.  It is one of the few guards that can be altered to fit a wide variety of saw tables.  And it even looks cool - or as cool as a table saw add-on might look.

The light can be set at two brightness levels (one or two individual LED's on), and even the lower level is usually bright enough to read comfortably. I carry this in my attache for reading my textbooks in Starbucks and libraries, where overhead lighting can be dim or inconsistent. If the ambient light changes because of sunlight, it is easy to switch the light off, the on/off button is super easy to operate. The clamp is very strong but is shaped in a way that protects the book and pages, it doesn't leave any marks or indents on the book or paper. And the adjustable neck is very high quality, it adjusts to infinite positions and stays right where you bend it.

The only issue I had was that the middle board was slightly warped other than that everything else was perfect. I called customer service and they said they will send me a complimentary replacement and should receive it in 7-10 business days.
My latest one has lasted three years. The housing eventually cracks at the corners where the bit slides through. I ended up just buying single piece set to replace the holder. The springs on the vix part (that push against the retactable head) have held up and have not failed. I have replaced all of the drill bits and screw tips countless times. I have not yet seen a better setup than this.

The real benefit to this unit, is that it takes a nightmare problem, and makes it a piece of cake. It works great with a standard 4" dust collection system. Myself personally, I already had a 6HP Sears 16 gallon shop vac. To the shop vac which has a 2 1/2" hose, I hook up the Jet adapter bringing it up to 4". I also use a Y adapter, and gates, to enable me to hook it up to two pieces of equipment at a time. I have a lot of equipment in a small shop, with everything mounted on universal bases. So I roll out what I need, hook it up to the dust collection. Cramped for space, my shop vac sits under my lathe table.

This is especially true for air compressors, table/miter saws, etc. If you've ever experienced your power tools bogging down, try a better (heavier gauge) cord, you might be surprised.  As mentioned, the lighted cord end when it's plugged in is handy/cool, as well.
2900	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Way back in '89 I destroyed a worm gear drive saw. I replaced it with a major brand, big discount store, consumer grade saw,,, then 2 more. Finally I realized that I had spent as much as a nice commercial grade saw would have cost, in just 4 years !! So I began studying and researching and found this saw. I never did like the way that the worm drive saw would torque to the side when I pulled the trigger. The saw wasn't hard to control after the initial start-up but that sideways jump annoyed me. So I didn't even consider another worm drive saw. This saw looked rugged enough and the base plate was precisely adjustable for paralell to the blade. I was sold. It self destructed in '04.
It's plastic, it's round. I don't know what more to say. They work.

1906	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I really use these a lot more than I thought I would when I first bought them. I make cabinet faces out of 1-1/2" maple, and I like the width of these FF Joiner Biscuits because, if I'm careful and set the depth of cut just right, I can put one, and a few times even two, biscuits on the end of a 1-1/2" board without the cut showing on the sides. This makes for an invisible, and well not quite bullet proof, and very sturdy joint.

That way I have 2', 3', and 4' clamping CAPACITY with each.  I also threaded both  ends of the pipe, so with 3/4" pipe connectors, the possibilities are  expanded.  I do use wood strips to pad the jaws, otherwise they can damage  wood under pressure.  I have mounted them backwards on the pipe and used  them to spread joints a couple of times.  With a simple 2x4 rack, I can  glue up wide panels with them.  You need a few of these in your shop, too.

It has a quality oil lubricated motor and is competitively priced with "oil-less" compressors of similar size and capacity.  It works great with my various small air tools (palm nailer, impact wrench, etc).  My only complaint:  After a few hours of light use, the regulator dial became very hard to turn, and eventually stopped working altogether.  I dismantled it and found that the dial threads had stripped.  I replaced the regulator with an inexpensive AmFlo model purchased at Lowes, and am much happier with the new one -- easier to adjust, more precise, and more accurate.  If Hitachi included a better regulator, they would have a 5 star product.
This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring  a smile to your face everytime you use it.
4356	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I think I paid less then 10.00 for this blade. I've been paneling my man-cave (enclosed patio) the past week and this saw blade has been indispensable. I bought it for my Black & Decker Firestorm Cordless Saw and wasn't sure it would fit. The blade fits perfectly, but just remember the direction. Initially, I put it on with the print facing out - oops, wrong direction. The direction of the arrows indicate that the print side faces in and the bare blade faces out. I cut several sheets of 5/32" thick, 4' x 8'  MDF (hardboard) panels to cover the frames around my windows. The blade cut smoothly and did a great job.
6962	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These units are outstanding- Solidly made of high quality aluminum extrusions (and made in the USA Too!), Easy to install, and easy to use.  Used together with a top stabilizer they provide a feeling of ladder security that allows me to feel comfortable atop my 24ft extension ladder for the first time. I was concerned about adding more weight (about 3-4 pounds I estimate)to my ladder, but I find that with the extra 10" of height they give, I can separate my extension ladder to give effectively a 13ft straight ladder with adjustable feet that is long enough for most jobs and only about 24 pounds. Since the feet don't interfere with the ability to recombine the ladder to the extension mode, I can do so for the few times I need to go higher. While the combined ladder is 3-4 pounds heavier, the additional safety, convenience and height is well worth the extra weight. At age 74 I finally have the best of all ladder worlds. I'm sorry I didn't buy these 30 years ago!

In summary, I recommend that you consider the 7518 and 7519 only if you'll be mounting the motors in a router lift. If you don't want to spend the money on a router lift, consider one of the newer routers that has built-in above-table adjustment. 12A routers are now available from Milwaukee (Model 5616-20), Porter-Cable (model 894PK), Freud (model FT1700VCE), and others. The Triton TRC001 is a 15A router that is reputedly excellent for use under a router table, but I haven't used it.

8698	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I thought the blade worked great. I did find out after I had purchased the blade and angle grinder that they (Dewalt) recommend a 2-sided shield to attach to their grinder when using a cutting blade. I needed it for making curved cuts in 1/2" porcelain tile and I was waiting on the item to complete the job so I put on goggles, mask and ear protection and went for it. You will definitely need to wear a mask and goggles and blow out your grinder periodically with compressed air as it creates a lot of fine dust. The blade cut through the tile beautifully - I made a few passes so the blade would not have to work so hard. I had tried cutting the tile with other diamond-tipped jigsaw and rotary tool blades and nothing compares to the efficiency of this blade and the grinder.
9427	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	excellent  ill by again
I will give this one piece of advice. Keep the blade guards on until you are ready to cut, keep your fingers and any other appendages you want to keep away from the saw while you're cutting, and put the guards back on as soon as you finish the cut. THIS SAW IS SHARP! I can tell you that after cutting hundreds of hardwood dowels, plugs, trimming ends, and even a few dovetails just to see if it would do it...this saw will draw blood without much effort on your part.

 The removable cord is a nice feature, as is the removable and ambidextrous side handle.

1404	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago, and one a recent purchase. The older lamp failed about 3 months ago, and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished. Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again. Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two (being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers), and the new lamp was back to working. So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old (presumed dead) desk lamp. After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life. They are both still working, and I am delighted with this purchase.

One part, the backing, of a tough durable steel and the knife edge made from high speed Steel to hold the edge so necessary to the blades performance.  Not only are they some of the toughest knives for the price, they can be resharpened unlike the subsequent  planer models that use not so cheap  disposable blades.  The DW733 is probably the best value thickness planer and DW did it right.  I just wish they had take the good from the DW733 and improved upon it rather than making the replacement models they have come up with and are currently marketing.

7172	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The tool bags themselves are acceptable albeit a little thin . The tool belt which I thought from the picture had velcro padded wrap around with tool belt closure is actually a thin nylon strap with waist adjustment that required me to sew it to size and the plastic clasp does not easily stay closed . Had I known I definitely would have purchased another only slightly more expensive tool bag.
 Also, although mine shipped with no significant damage to the particle board top(s), the surfaces were so badly warped that I had to purchase some 1-1/2"x1-1/2" angle iron to place underneath the tops for straightening. Other than that, the device assembled and functioned quite well.
9773	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	works well, but could use some improvements: a longer bar for better leverage, since wroking alone with some  boards require a fair amount of oomph, another inch of clearance above the deck so that the bar doesn't rub on the deck boards, and a wider area on the plate that pushes against the crooked board. That said I could not have laid decking on my own deck without it.
2nd, the table top doesn't appear to be totally rectangular, though the infeed and outfeed sides are parallel and that's all I care about.
I have never experienced the red coating coming off on the wood as others have stated. This includes several other Freud blades that I use.  Sounds to me like an overheating problem maybe due to alignment or forcing cuts when dull.  I have seen some minor wear of the coating on 7 1/2" framing blades after heavy and prolonged use.

* mark the "zero" on the thickness adjusting dial.  Turn it until the back of the dial is perfectly flush with the back of the blade and write a "0" above that tick mark (again, silver Sharpie works great).  That way, when the manual says "a 1/2 inch dado is these three blades plus four clicks" you'll know that you're really at four and not, say, three or five.

I wasn't sure if the crown stops would make the job easier, but thought I'd give them a try.  The results were great.  I did a stacked molding, so my first layer along with my extra wood strip nailed to the top of the cabinet helped insure angles were pretty dead-on. As a result, the crown stops made easy work of cutting my crown angles. If you needed to make minor angle adjustments they may be a little difficult using the crown stops.  Quality of the product is very good, fit great on my DW716.  Well worth the price.

The rails mounted correctly to the table without modification but the fence was too long to catch the rear rail. I did not wish to modify the fence in case I needed to return the item. I used three over sized nuts as spacers to push the rear rail away from the table. This required longer mounting screws. The spacers worked perfectly and the fence now grabs the rail. I have used the fence heavily for two months and it works as advertised. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend this item.

Since this is a tool that I don't use very often, I was very reluctant to spend this kind of money, especially for a tool that was so similar to one I already own - or so I thought.  I received this new Makita sander, took it out of the box, put a belt on, plugged it in and pulled the trigger.  I held it up and adjusted the tracking slightly to get the belt running true, and then gently laid it on one of my oak panel doors.  I sanded for a few seconds, turned it off, laid it down, and immediately walked over to where my Craftsman sander was, picked it up and threw it into the trash.

Both WorkMates are easy to assemble and to use. Both are extremely stable and can be used with the feet extended or folded under. This model (the bigger WM 425) has a one hand clamping system.

If you want a single router for use in router table and hand-held, buy a multi-base kit to make it easy to switch functions. It is very time-consuming to convert a table-mounted router to handheld use when the router is screwed to the router plate.

7042	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is definitely an improvement over the older model it replaces. It packs more power and I like that. We also got the Makita 2414b which has a double pivot cutting arm. ( not the 2414nb) It cuts faster because of that mechanism. Other than that using the saws is about the same . They both have plenty of power. They have quick release material clamps. The Dewalt has a horizontal handle whereas the Makita is angled. I think I like the Dewalt handle better. All the other chop saws seem to be made in Taiwan. If I could only have one I would go with the Makita. I really like that double pivot mechanism. It lets you rock the whole cutting head back and forth to engage the workpiece at differing angles giving both a cleaner and faster cut. If you really want a nice saw get a dry cut saw. They run at much lower RPMs and use a carbide blade to give the fastest and cleanest cut available today.

Much more than for woodworking, the Irwin Quick-Grip are great for clamping 1/4" polycarbonate sheet where holes need to be drilled through the entire stack.  The same situation arises with stacked metal plates where a quality vise is not available. As other reviewers have mentioned, the one-hand operation is great for quick application of glue, especially for the type that expands. Use of Gorilla Glue often requires such clamps because the expansion force pushes apart the two pieces to be fused. The low cost of these clamps suggests that avid hobbyists and DYI home repair types purchase these clamps before they are needed.

The "Stiffener / Dampener" reduces blade-noise like a drummer gripping a cymbal. It "chokes" or dampens those "singing" vibrations. Even on a cheap saw, you will HEAR that difference, especially if you stop the machine mid-cut. When machines run smoothly and quietly, they are more likely to work well. When ANY machine is LOUD, it means there is a source of vibration: enemy of precision.

The only drawback is that in order to adjust the height of the cut, you must loosen the locking nut, and manually move the fence up or down. With this method it is possible to jump to a spot, which may be more or less than is needed. A micro fine adjusting knob would be nice. Some of the more expensive units have that feature.

just a quick note to all you skilsaw lovers: this saw is a hypoid saw, like the makita. it has an off-set gearing system to deliver an awesome amount of power (torque), but it's not a worm-drive. bosch now owns the skil company and their worm-drive saw has the same worm-drive motor as the skilsaw and has more features than the skil mag77. my friend prefers the makita hypoid because it has an xtra gearing system that allows it to start slow without jerking the saw on start-up like every other saw. it's heavy though. i prefer to use my dewalt over the makita and the mag77. i haven't used the bosch yet, but i always hear great things from the people who do. any of the above saws will give you tons of testosterone satisfaction and get the job done right the first time, but i still prefer my dewalt.

7709	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A great tool, although I own a WM-400, not a 425, but I will guess them to be pretty comparable.  Any real woodworker knows that besides him/herself, the workbench is the 1st and most important tool in the shop.  In my case, I don't have a proper shop and do most of my work in the driveway, so the WorkMate is the heart of my project work, and it is about the best solution I can imagine for those who have very little storage space, practically no work space, and are forced to routinely set up and take down the work center -- I should know, as I'm an architect and skilled builder.
6694	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a pin-type meter designed for measuring relative wetness in drywall, concrete, and wood.  Regardless what the sales literature says, it's really not designed for measuring absolute lumber moisture content.  For the latter, one needs a good wood moisture meter, which can be quite pricey.  I own a Wagner MMC-220 that costs $270 that I use to measure lumber moisture content.  The readings given by the Wagner and this Sonin are drastically different when they are used to measure wood moisture content.  I suspect the problem is it's almost impossible to push those thick pins of the Sonin-Rapidtest meter into lumber to get a good reading.  If the pins are not pushed in deep enough into lumber or drywall, the reading will be off.  It's not too difficult to push enough of the pins into drywall to get a meaningful reading, but it's almost impossible to push them into most woods.  However, that said, it's important to keep in mind that this Sonin meter is intended primarily for home inspectors rather than woodworkers.  For woodworkers and lumber yard owners the absolute moisture content is very important, but for home inspectors a general relative wetness indication (i.e. damp vs. dry) is good enough.  Even though if used on wood, the moisture content will be way off, it is still useful as a general wet wood/dry wood indicator.  Just don't rely on the absolute % of water content on the scale.  Surprisingly it's not hard at all to get meaningful readings on concrete because you just have to push the pins hard against concrete without having to penetrate the concrete.

Unfortunately once I had the item in hand I realized that the way it is designed to work you cannot use it on a small homeowners saw, or to cut very long pieces. Just keep this in mind. Mine is useless to me, with a bench top saw I could only cut a 12" piece using this tool.

I've had this jointer for over a year now and have put it to moderate use with home woodworking projects.  It seems to be of good quality.  The tool is lightweight and I agree with other reviews that the trigger placement is very user-friendly.  However, I have one annoyance with this tool that I just can't seem to get over.  I use this primarily in oak and pine, and the dust chute clogs with chips after just 2 or 3 cuts.  The chute seems too small for the amount and/or size of the chips that are extracted.  I am constantly removing the dust bag to clear the chips from the tool. Perhaps this problem could be avoided with a dust collection attachment, but bulky collection hoses can be restricting, and the bag otherwise does a great job catching dust (until it clogs).

The large 12" blade combined with its sliding capability mean you can easily miter and bevel larger stock. Although it's not a true replacement for a radial arm saw it may adequately serve that purpose in your shop. It's sliding blade allows you to easily cut even large stock to length. You might think that the sliding blade will allow you to cut dados and rabbets but Dewalt does not support the use of dado head cutter blades in this saw.

As I approach dead level, the beeps get faster till it changes over to a solid tone. Accuracy is exellent. I did sand off 1 paint knob but for a tool that I use so often, those 2 minutes of "set-up" were well worth the time. Most of the finish is still on the tool. Fair for 8 years of use. It measures in 3 modes % grade, inches of rise per foot and 90 degree scales level or plumb. Automatic compensation for reading upside down, for overhead work. Display is aways right side up. Calibration is simple and quick, usually when I check it though, it's still dead-on. GREAT TOOL , BUY ONE NOW!!!

The worst thing about this router is that when you go to order parts on-line, you discover the terrible truth of what you bought - the parts department isn't Porter Cable, it is DeWalt !

The salesmen at one of the nearby "Orange Big Box" stores have repeatedly warned me about the bad service from these folks, and of course, DeWalt is one of their big brands (they recognize me as a very frequent repeat customer, so I get the "come over here a minute - whisper, whisper, whisper" dope, not the official party line).

Make sure you get this one; I'm happy I did.

A sad ending, cos I really wanted the WM425 and I'm giving it one star for it's good-looking design.

6721	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used one of these for years working on ag airplanes, which consist of dozens of panels held together with hundreds of stainless steel phillips machine screws that cost about $1 each.  The torque setting keeps you from stripping the heads.  The lock setting will even let you operate "dzus" fasteners with a flat blade.  The interchangable batteries keeps you going all day.
8771	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The steel rule is bowed.  It's not really bad but I payed a premium price for this and I'm really disappointed.  It's my first and probably last Starrett tool.  I thought I was getting a really high quality product for the price, but I guess not.
5149	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Bought this item to increase the efficiency in my shop and garage and it functions very well for the purpose intended.
9071	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good blade.  Just what I was expecting.  I have use them before.
5216	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The results from using this are absolutely remarkable for me. Dramatically less vibration, noise, scratching, and thus sanding, are worth the minimal cost. Instructions say to clean blade, arbor, arbor backing, and stabilizer with solvent and to stone away any burrs that might be on blade or arbor so you get a really clean, tight mating of all surfaces. Works impressively well, in my experience and still allows me a 2-1/4" cut above the throat plate. This is on what I thought to be a pretty well-tuned saw, too - exposing some adjustment needed to make the fence more parallel and that I had the miter slots nailed.

- I strongly recommend getting a set of rubber clamp pads when you order your clamp fixtures.  You only need one set for two fixtures.  Don't gouge up your wood.
1072	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought a 10-pack of the 10W bulbs about five years ago for a picture frame light that burns at least six hours per day. I have since saved a fortune over individual bulbs at my local stores. They last as long as any other halogen bulb I've used. This current batch of 20W bulbs keeps a few landscape lights happy. As long as you are not blasting them with way over 12 volts, the life expectancy is pretty good. For those having issues with quick burnouts, I suspect their power supplies might be running a little high. Make sure you handle the bulb with a tissue or piece of paper when installing.

Good Luck!

947	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought these with some hesitation because they seemed almost too good of a value, but I am very pleased the product.

7392	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very nice table, instructions are good, table itself is extremely solid. Don't buy the casters, I feel they are overpriced. I just went to Lowes and got some nice casters for $5 a piece. The table is set up so that you can actually build an enclosure around it. I made one out of plywood and it came out pretty well. I also purchased the Kreg router table switch and I feel as if you could just use any old switch or power strip in it's place. The fence comes in very many pieces as stated in a previous review and it is not overly difficult to put together, however you really must fine tune it for accuracy and to your liking once installed. I don't really buy into the fact that it is being compared to a table saw fence. It is a nice fence but it isn't really one side adjustable. I still use a tape measure when adjusting it.


2801	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I started buying DeWalt tools I got the batteries and chargers but then started buying "bare bones" items. After all, after you have a few batteries you don't need more. This lowers the cost of additional tools while ensuring batteries don't languish and die from lack of use.
1055	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great bulbs.  Long lasting, great price.  Does the job advertised.
1685	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice base, it moves smoothly and is very easy to adjust the depth. The one thing I was less enthusiastic about was how it connected to the router motor, basically just has a screw with a rubber clamps. i would have liked it to connect in a more positive way seems like the concept was an after thought.
1043	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent value as regards cost as well as quality of product.  Actually, this product is offered at a bargain price and at a similar high quality as the higher priced lamps.
2)  Value!!  This is a 10" slider for the price of most chop-only saws.  The single bevel can sometimes mean a bit more effort but I simply couldn't justify paying nearly 50% more for a dual-bevel sliding Bosch or Makita.  And the 10" slide handles wider pieces of wood than its 12" chop-only counterparts.

In addtionl to the durabiltiy inherent in nearly ALL their tools, i've also found them to be highly ACCURATE, which is absolutely required when crafting furniture.
8491	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this tool primarily because it seems like a nice gadget to have to make sure my carcases and cabinets are square. But after getting it, I find myself using it for a new purpose all the time. As with all Bosch tools, the construction of this digital protractor is excellent. Checking the accuracy of the protractor with a few expensive engineering squares showed that the protractor is dead on. I think I can finally build that corner cupboard I have always wanted to. Perfect birthday or Christmas present for the woodworker in your life.

Furthermore, the plate can sag with a "memory" effect over time, especially if a heavy router is left on the table.
Runout isn't a huge deal with short/low diameter bits (as long as we're not talking about very small bits which may be broken by it), you may not even notice it.. But when you throw a raised panel or rail/stile bits in, get ready for some serious vibration. Also, if you do Incra style dovetails or box joints, any runout is going to make your cuts wider than they should be. With dovetails this makes it impossible to get a consistent dovetail tightness based on depth of cut.. so if you change bits and go back and try again with the same DOC, your results will be different. Sure you can cut test pieces every time but that's a huge waste of time and wood. I could never understand why I was having such issues and then discovered runout was the problem. Any dados you cut with a specific width bit will be wider as well.

Also note: ordered an INCRA Mast-R-Lift II to go with the router table (made by JessEm but with magnetic inserts around the bit) they make the lift in two sizes, 8-1/4" is needed for the BenchDog (note: you can buy & change the top to the 9-1/4 later if you change your table) - when trying to install it, it wouldn't fit - the metal support on the front right side needed to be clearanced about a 1/4-3/8 inch in one spot about an inch long - easily solved with a dremmel, took 5-10 min. - router lift fits great now along with a mounted Milwaukee 5625 router.

Jorgensen makes a nice product here, and this type of clamp is really useful for many jobs around your wood shop.  I purchased this one to use with the Incra I-box jig (reviewed separately) that I got to make box joints, and it is a must for that application.  This type of clamp has many other applications too, so as a relatively novice woodworker I plan to buy more of this type of Jorgensen clamp in various sizes.

1750	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this for dadoes and rabbets only. Does not replace a table saw with a set of dado blades, but if you don't own that then this will work. I love porter cable but Frankly i regret this purchase. Cost too much in my opinion. 5 stars because its a quality product. I will not give it less stars only because it really didn't work out for me. That was my bad
This guide cost two to three times as much as a cheap basic guide, but if you're doing a lot of edge
Why set two separate mitre angles when you can use only one 45 degree angle and be totally successful with crown?? Highly recommended.

Freud is the best. 6" works best for under powered saws or loose belts. We also use an 8" that seems to do a little better cleaner job. Freud is the best! Don't waste your money on more expensive dado's, these are top of the line and we use them every day in our commercial shop.

(oh and only 4 stars because the instructions really are kind of useless, and I think they should include a case with some extra bits - they have to box the thing anyways, how much more would a blow molded case cost them instead?  50 cents?...  The tool itself gets 5 stars)
2157	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've used one of every style and I'm on my 2nd wood.  I need to ore more of the wood style.  These Dewalt blades are superior to most other in longevity.

I use the smooth faced hammer for finish work and the milled face for framing. I love the balance and length of the handles. These are tough hammers, more than once when too lazy to get the right tool I have used the claws to break up concrete. I have put an 8' length of pipe on these and used them to pry stuff apart. Try that with a fiberglass or wood handle! I have yet to wear out the rubber grips and my oldest Estwing has been with me 15 years.

The 20 ounce feels good, is well balanced, and seems to be easier to handle than the 16 ounce version of other hammer brands (I've used the same  Stanley for 30+ years). I think I like the curved claw better than the straight claw, but that's just because I'm used to it. I use a wood block as a fulcrum for the straight claw, which is actually better on the wood.

I did find much more correct dado stack setups at the Freud site.  The chart I recieved with my purchase did not have the same information, so they must have figured this out and revised it online. I hope this one IS correct. [...]
2893	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this saw over 10 years ago, as soon as DeWalt released it. At the time it was the gold standard of sidewinders and in many ways it still is. I love the adjustability: super fast and accurate depth adjustment (the front knob and rear pivot is brilliant DeWalt!), fast, smooth and accurate angle adjustment. While the base was an improvement over most saws of it's time, it has been surpassed by cast bases such as Bosch's, and I'd like to see DeWalt put a better base on this saw. Mine has not stayed flat. If they did that, and perhaps boosted the amperage a bit, it would be as perfect as a sidewinder gets.
Updated May 11 2017:
  My hat is off to the Bosch engineers for designing this one. A complicated job made simple. Highly recommended. This tool falls in the category of most favored tools. It solves all of the problems.
I will definitely use this lamp when reading books at night. I doubt I will ever use it as a flashlight or a work light unless I had no other choice.

8426	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Pamper your power tools...they deserve it.  Buy at least 12/3 for your short runs, and 10/3 for longer than 50' and for higher draw (over 10 amps) tools.  This is especially true for air compressors, table/miter saws, etc. If you've ever experienced your power tools bogging down, try a better (heavier gauge) cord, you might be surprised.

When I realized the parts to fix were going to approach the price of this one, I just ordered it. I received it in short time and it seems as good as the older model.

Enough of waxing emotional.  this is a high quality, precision tool that belongs in your tool box if you need that kind of precision (squaring-up your miter saw or table saw, for example) and can afford it.  I notice that this is now going for thirty bucks more than when I bought it two years ago.  Yikes.  Is it thirty bucks better?  I doubt it.  But then, I'm devoting five stars to this tool in part because of how the quality makes me feel, not just whether it is worth the dough for something that is very, very square and well-made.
7236	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Kreg screws hold up better than any other Pan Head screw.  Unless you're running a production shop, the price is worth it and negligible.

2106	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I prefer brass. The Porter Cable guides are fine, they install easily, center easily, and perform flawlessly,, Most of the time. Just once in a while though, they fail completely. Steel, no matter how you protect it, will eventually corrode. Mine turned white and rusted, not all over, but on one side or the other. My guides often get removed from the case and hauled out to the job-sites while attached to the router. Early, foggy mornings and those sudden summer-time cloud bursts, expose my tools to far more of the elements than I like. So maybe,, it's my fault. But brass just hasn't let me down yet.

5808	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had my ShopVac for over five years now and I always found it a hassle when vacuuming out my car. I would have to roll it to one side and then pull it all the way around to get to the other side. Occasionally this would be impractical because my wife's vehicle would be in the garage at the same time and there would be no room. With this new nozzle, the vacuum can remain in one central position in the garage and easily reach both sides of the car, both front and back seats as well. The extra long hose really makes a difference. I have also noticed that this nozzle produces a much more powerful suction than the one that came with the ShopVac. Even with a dirty filter the suction was strong. The only problem I had when I first got it was some difficulty getting the nozzle mounted onto the hose. It was so tight I thought that it might have been the wrong size. After awhile it finally slid on fully and I have no intention of ever taking it off. I highly recommend this product.
1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.

I didn't know Estwing made anything smaller than a 16oz. This is perfect for my needs.
I used the couplings to have 3 10' clamps. Another join I use each of the six 5' pipes to join the butcher block width-wise. I bought 6 pony clamps and got Prime shipping. I also bought the pads that go with these.

I would buy 10 more of these without hesitation.
I like the frosted finish that give a softer light.

Having said that, I must point out that you cannot use the entire board with this method. The board must always be wide enough that some portion of it is under the rollers. You will end up not using the entire board, and that might be considered 'waste" if you do not have other uses for the leftovers. Therefore, this is not a perfect solution to everyone's needs, but it certainly is great for those types of rips.

8132	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased a PL200 Stair wizard and also the extensions as an accessory.  Items were well packaged the stair wizard came in a 3.5" diameter tube the extensions came in a plastic bag.  I did have a time putting them back in the original bag but now that I recieved the PL200  put them all inside the tube.  The best way to get them in the tube is to pull the unit all the way out and put them in the center of the stair wizard and slide them in the tube.  The unit is designed very well it has black spacer blocks that are used to store the wizard. Do not lose them they absorb shock if you drop it. Definitely want to take your time removing  the unit from the package and noting where everything is located so you can reassemble and put it back in the tube. The wizard has rubber side bumpers to allow movement after setting is locked in place due to wall tilting inward.  The wizard can be used on other trim carpentry too like windows and other hard to transfer template layouts.  This item was very well thought out it saves a lot of time.  The speed in cutting the stair treads to exact size saves a tremendous amount of time!
1216	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised.  Cheaper than box store.  Not sure how long they will last, but was willing to take a chance since I had 7 that were out.  Mine seem to fail due to corrosion at the pins rather than burnout.  I did grease the pins, hopefully that will help.

So, as a kit for a plane, 4 stars. As a ready-to-use plane, 0 stars. I gave it the average of the two.

8113	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very good hole-saws, and this kit is by far the most complete I have ever seen.  A really good price for this many different sizes.  I have used these  in hardwoods with good results, just remember to back it off often and clean the shavings out of the teeth.  If you don't it will start to burn and the heat will shorten the life of the teeth as it anneals the steel. The slots on the sides are great for prying out wood plugs with a flat-blade screwdriver.  I have also used these hole-saws to cut holes in heavy gauge steel electrical junction boxes without any problems.  They remain sharp and last for many cuts.  Very important! Always drill your pilot hole through sheet metal before you put the hole saw on the arbor!  Otherwise you will have bent or broken pilot bits and missing teeth on your hole saw (I was an apprentice once and I know this for a fact!).  This is not the first Lenox set I have bought and I keep buying them for a reason.  I have used Milwaukee, Greenlee, Ridgid, and other quality brands of hole-saws.  Lenox is at least as good a anyone out there in this price range.

The best accessory for this? That foot pedal. No more trying to hold my wood with one hand while the blade is going, and reach up or down to turn the machine off ! When I need a break, the phone rings, or a neighbor drops by, I take my foot off the pedal and it comes to a "dead stop" just as advertised. Great one on Amazon for about $22.  Magnifying light is terrific to have too.
This table is an excellent addition to my wood shop, it's used a lot and is definitely worth the price.
As you clamp the workpiece be aware that the body of the clamp moves - unlike the clamps with two handles (or knobs) that screw in to hold the pieces at 90 degrees.  This movement can be disconcerting the first time, but once you realize it is there it is no problem to control.  The sides of the clamp are painted and slick so the stock will move inside the jaws easily before the clamping pressure is set; however, this also allows you to easily make small adjustments in the position of the stock.  Some users may want to glue sandpaper onto the jaws but I think I will leave it as is because once the clamp pressure is set the wood goes nowhere.

4623	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Using on my old DeWalt 925 H radial arm saw. Works perfectly and makes using this saw a pleasure. The saw stays set at 90 and I can count on it producing a very smooth splinter-free cut.  While the negative hook tames the saw's tendency to aggressively pull itself forward through the wood it doesn't eliminate it, so be careful....as always.
An extended fence was used which supports the plastic strip on both sides of the blade.  A cutout was placed in the fence at the blade position and a stop was placed in the T-Fence slot so once the blade got through the plastic it never touched the extended fence.

EDIT: 1 month later and this is broken. I'm not sure what happened, but the top part with the light in it got separated from the middle, and the inside wires snapped. My daughter was very careful with it and is now very disappointed. I have taken a star away, since this product is clearly not very durable and I expected it to last longer than a month
2) The edge guides that are available to help make perfectly straight 8' long cuts on sheet goods are also aluminum. (this saw's shoe is aluminum) Aluminum rubbing against aluminum doesn't work well; it binds. A steel, plastic, or magnesium shoe would be better.

If that's true, then it helps explain why this saw cuts so smoothly right out of the box. The difference between the 3-thou spec of most manufactures and the one-thou spec claimed by DeWalt's engineer may not seem like much. However, any experienced woodworker knows that a table-saw that is out by more than three-thou make ugly cuts and is dangerous. The difference between a one-thou and a three-thou spec has a HUGE effect on performance and safety. Obviously if we start within ONE THOU, we have a better chance at good clean safe cuts. After some use and abuse on the job, it sure is good to be able to adjust your saw to maintain those clean safe cuts.
If you have a square that has a handle that was riveted, welded, or glued on, chances are it is off. The single stamped pieces of metal are usually accurate.
Installation: Simple enough, except for the leveling screws which were too short to be of any use at all. Screwed all the way down, they barely protuded on the underside of the insert. And I mean barely. The stock screws are M4-10mm. Luckily, I had some M4-12mm screws handy that I'd bought for another project, so a trip to the hardware store wasn't required. Keep it in mind, though. Oh, and you'll need flat head machine screws or a grinder/Dremel of some sort to makecthem flat. Leecraft might want to think about this, as at least one other person complained about it.
4.) The new 330 isn't counter-balanced as well as the old, perhaps because of the lighter plastic case.
- You could superglue or use tape(or a mix of both) over the clip (I used painters tape because it is essentially paper and becomes a very hard acrylic compositve when mixed).

The problem came when I got it all assembled and on the bandsaw table. The unit wouldn't clamp solid and would move. This is not what it was supposed to do so I started investigating. Well, it turns out that I may not have been the first person to have this unit. The internal lever that clamps to the rail was missing the rubber pad so it wouldn't clamp to the rail at all. Closer inspection showed a bend in the lever as well as the missing pad. I had no way to know if this bend was normal or not, but the pad was definitely not there.

I had seen some complaints that the hoses did not fit snugly, but mine are tight and don't need any tape, etc.  The only difficulty I have had, is that the hoses make the bucket a bit top heavy so it is easily tipped over, but watching how you set it up solves that quickly.  On another note, I first used a bucket from Lowes.  Although it is a good bucket, the handle did not lock down the lid.  The HD bucket handle is of a slightly different design and locks this down easily.  Nothing really wrong with either bucket handle, one just fits this devise better than the other.  This is money well spent.

This specific model Estwing really shines when used for trim work. Every other hammer I have (I do have some other brands, for throw away hammers and loaners and such) is much more likely to slip off the nail, even on a perfectly placed strike.

2041	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I wanted to make about about 60 feet of raised panel wainscoting (over 25 panels) for my dining room using 3/4 in. MDF board.  I selected the PC 7518 router because of the power, favorable reviews and other recommendations.  I mounted it in a Bench Dog Pro Lift and mounted that in a Bench Dog ProTop router table and used Freud bits including a 3.5 in. raised panel bit with a back cutter.  This set up breezed through the rail and stile cuts like butter with 1 pass and made very smooth cuts.  The cuts were so precise that no sanding was required where the rails and stiles were joined.  The raised panel bit also generated very smooth cuts but I would recommend 3 passes for safety and a better result.  I was using the set-up on a 15 amp line in the garage (it is a 15 amp tool) with a shop vac to suck up the dust and boy does MDF generate dust.  After blowing the circuit breaker a few times (using the panel cutter), I moved the vac and work lights to a different circuit and that solved the circuit breaker problem.  However the router still shut down if the cut was too heavy or the feed too fast.  It was easily re-set by simply unpluging and repluging the power cord.  Since this was my first major router project, I attribute this to "operator error" hence the 3 pass recommendation for the raised panel cutter.  That cutter really pushes this router to its limits and once I got the hang of it, it performed really well.  However if your looking to do a raised panel with 1 pass in MDF, get a shaper.  The end result is that I have a very happy wife who loves her wainscoting.

For whatever reason the parallel wheels don't use the exact same carriage bolts that everything else uses, despite the frame having square holes to accept them, and it seems logical that many use up their bolts and then think they've run out at the end when it comes time to add the final piece (the foot pedal and swivel).

I do small projects in my garage using a table saw, radial arm saw and various sanders to make small boxes with multiple sides.  The lids are made of wedges glued together on a backer of the same wood.  In order for sixteen little pieces to fit tightly (eight sided lid) the angles must be exact.  This tool enables me to achieve the accuracy I need.  For those who might wonder, it does come with a pencil that appears to be .05 mm.  Using this instrument I can mark any angle down to .5 degree, using a magnifier I can mark as close as .25 degrees (doubt I can cut that close).  Warning: this protractor is a delicate instrument and needs to be treated as such.  Don't be surprised if you notice smudges when you first begin handling the instrument, this is simply oil from your fingers being transferred to the aluminum.  This bothered me a little so I rubbed it down with a bit of cooking oil and wiped it clean.  I look forward to many years of using this wonderful tool.
1872	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A satisfying commodity-type product.
Having read other overwhelmingly positive reviews I ordered the saw.  When it arrived I was careful not to lift it by the arm.  I attached the table to the saw and installed a blade, careful to face the teeth forward and down, per the instructions.
9526	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bends 5/4 ipe boards no problem, as long as board is over 6 feet long.  Pine boards would be a no-brainer, I assume.  Slips a little on deck protector flashing, but can be managed.
8024	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The product is not bad. Like many of the previous reviewers, it is not the best plane that you can get. But, for the price, it does its job very well. I recently purchased an older house and am remodeling it. This plane has been very useful to shave down doors in which I can't fix by adjusting the hinges. As one of my carpenter friends told me: "An expensive tool is no good if you don't know how to use it."
As for these clamps, they are absolutely a joy to use.  The clamp faces are wonderfully non-marring and resistant to glue sticking.  They also will stand up by themselves and don't easily rack and fall over as I slide boards across them.  Once a panel is in the clamps, the whole piece can be stood on the end of the clamps in a corner while the glue dries.

6160	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been reluctant to buy and use a clamp like this, preferring to clamp and use squares to make sure I'm 90 degrees.  How stupid!  The Kreg clamps and these were considered.  The Bessey's seemed more simple and got the nod.

The construction on the square just reeks of precision and quality components.  The rule slides as smoothly as satin through the head.  The satin finish is easy to read and perfect in every dimension.  It's graduated in 32nds and 64ths on one side and 8ths and 16ths on the other.  It's got a bubble level in the head where the bubble is the perfect size and a scribe in the end which is friction fitted tightly enough that it will never come out.  If you only invest in one precision measuring tool for your woodworking, let this be it.  You will wonder how you got on without it before.

Brief overview:
2475	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my scroll saw and would recommend it
My only issue with is the markings on the thinner spacers. The guide has the measurements in Imperial but the spacers are stamped with metric. I just wrote on them with a Sharpie so the two matched up.
2187	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The Dewalt has taken center stage in my basement shop, right across from my table saw. The Dewalt has the most cutting capacity on the market and the double bevel is extremely handy. Sure beats flipping long mouldings around. Bevel cuts are repeatable on both sides of the saw using the positive stops. For bevels greater than 45 degrees, I recommend the old fashion way; A table saw with a miter gage or a block plane, as this feature on the Dewalt ...No complaints on accuracy.

I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.
This is really one easy to use saw.  I bolted on a new carbide blade and found that I no longer dread jobs that call for a circular saw.  I doubt that I'll ever pick up my 7 1/4 circular saw again.

8506	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used this cutting wheel to make cuts on subway tile and floor tile. This wheel is incredible. The only thing that was confusing was attaching it to my angle grinder. I recommend putting the back flange under the wheel - that's the conclusion I came to with trial and error. This wheel is excellent for grinding down rough cuts too, makes it smooth. I strongly recommend using a tile nipper for cleaning up small C cuts. Meaning if you are making a C shaped cut in tile that is smaller than 2 inches wide, you cannot go through the tile completely with the wheel; otherwise you will over do it with the cut. If you are doing L shaped cuts, you are good. Make sure to use a china pencil to make your marks, it is totally worth doing.
Overall, this is a very good late-night reading solution and a good value.  Highly recommended.
8043	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are not too many like these on job sites. It is exceptional tool for laying stair treads. Speeds up the task and removes any possible mistakes. You may build your own tool, but taking in account materials and time it will take to build i just recomend buying this. It will not make you regret it
It's got some nice features ... plenty of cutting speed, 6 amps of power and you can control the start-up speed with a dial, which is nice for detail work.

one end would fit into the bag holder or the miter saw port, but the other end was the same size as the saw bag end and the same size as the saw dust port on the miter saw.

I'm also very, very big on supporting U.S. manufacturing (though some of Starrett's products are made overseas now).

4872	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Heavy duty and easy to use with practice.  This is not a sander that needs to be forced, just gently controlled.  Practice with it first on something that doesn't matter because it is a real wood eater.
8695	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used lots of grinding wheel but this is the most universal one to date.  I cut off lag bolts from the floor easily.  I have trimmed up some concrete and no problems.  The most interesting thing is that the blade itself remains cool to the touch.  I was amazed by that. Even though the bolts you cut off are red hot the blade is still cool.  Nice to have such versatility in one blade.
5197	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I can't complain about this dampener too much, except to say that it will diminish the depth of your cut... you won't be able to raise your blade as high as before (it'll hit your throat plate).  That's the only complaint.
I had a tough time selecting which set to go with, and chose the SD508 because of price.  I can speak to the comparison because the dado set comes with a DVD that describes the set-up and use of each of the sets they sell all on one disk.  The dial version (next step up) is easier to fine tune to a width, but a) not every cut requires shims, and b) looking at the combined instructions for setting up each of the dado sets (nice poster, by the way), it looks like every standard width requires dial adjustments amounting to 6 to 15 clicks.  This set has four very precise shims, each a different thickness, so you get very fine control.  So I am fine with the shims in light of the large difference in cost.
3686	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I brought this collector sight unseen based on the reviews and am pleased with the purchase. Setup is a snap, performance is flawless, and the workmanship first rate. Even the manual is what I expect from a power tool... detailed and well versed in the available accessories.
It's fairly well built and will provide great usable light for more than 30 minutes.  The head of the flashlight rotates so that you can position the beam where you need it.
  Well this is everything I thought it would be and more, The only draw back is that this baby has some weight to it, My wife helps out alot and she complained the firest time she picked it up so if your not a strong arm person , this is not the saw for you.

Other reviewers have dinged this set because of the low quality of the box it comes in.  I agree that it is poor quality, particularly the red, blow molded insert, which arrived cracked and a bit shredded, but still useable.  Personally, I would prefer to have Freud put their money into the dado stack, not the box.  These things are expensive enough; I don't really want to pay even more for a better box.  If it really bothers me in the future, I might make my own *really beautiful* box, but I probably won't.

3242	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Being a construction worker and a tool fanatic I must say this is the best saw on the market. At least 80 percent of constuction sites are occupied by the HD77 or it's brother the MAG77. I like the HD77 alittle better due to it's weight. I have yet to experience any heavy kickback and have yet to find any piece of lumber this won't rip through. This is a easy tool to use if you can handle a little weight (it doesn't take that long to get used to if you use lighter saws). This saw can handle being dropped several times and will last forever with an occasional oil. I don't have enough good things to say about this great saw.

 If I had to be critical of it, I would say that when changing a bit, I remove the base, which isn't that hard, for easy access. The base is designed to come on and off real easy, since it is one part of a multi base system.

It has two pieces, basically split vertically in half if the router is also vertical.  One of my pieces is bent slightly towards the workpiece, or perhaps one piece is bent slightly away.  It still works, but honestly is my most disappointing purchase as far as quality goes; not good for very accurate cutting.
The tilt lock handle is fantastic. I cannot conceive of using a saw without it now that I have it;

If it isn't very bright change the batteries.  I'd borrowed one before I bought it and almost thought it wasn't bright enough.  You can clip it on something nearby (like the headboard) too.  Besides it's purple!!

In short, it really is a simple and helpful device, and there are ways to prevent breaking it.  Just use your imagination!
8885	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been making furniture as a hobby for some years now and I discovered very early that practically ALL woodworking tools came as a project, not as a finished product.  That is to say that most tools need to be sharpened or adjusted or tuned,etc.  Starrett tools are the exception, my square came out of the box perfectly square and functioning flawlessly.  That is the very reason why I purchased this tool.  I use it to adjust and tune and square all those OTHER tools!  Every serious shop needs a few very good reference tools, this is one.

And yet - was there room in my shop for something that wasn't gray (or blue, for floor-tools)?  Only one way to find out: I had to try the Big Red "Sawz Everything."
The one-piece design inspires confidence that I won't see the head of this baby go flying by my head on the back swing.  If my mind were to wander to thoughts of lunch, I know that a misplaced blow won't pulverize some wooden handle or worse, send slivers of fiberglass into my eye. All metal construction, sufficient mass, and quality craftsmanship combine in an exceptional all-purpose hammer.
7400	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These clamps are very well built,
Only thing is my old one has an aluminum socket that holds the bits, which eventually tears up because it's so much softer than steel.
4591	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent blade for the price.
But more important than the aggravation, and the lost time, is that instead of a "precision" device, assembled by someone with a lot of experience putting it together, and a set of jigs available to make sure everything goes together perfectly, I am going to get something put together by a guy who has never built this item before, has no training, no jigs, and no experience with the product, someone likely to make a mistake or two - me.  So I am NOT getting what I paid for, not even close.

The Workmate is a simple, folding structure with two height settings, selected by folding out the spider-like legs or not doing so.

1530	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had undercabinet lighting in my kitchens for many years.  Earlier systems used small florescent bulbs that were bulky and somewhat expensive if you needed more than one.  Then, halogen lighting started to appear, but they were low-voltage systems and required an external transformer, an inconvenience and unreliable.  Then, a big-box home improvement store offered individual, small, round, lights with each operating independently, i.e., no transformer, running directly from 120 vac.  Each light has its own ac plug which is somewhat inconvenient when you have 6 or 8 or more to plug in.  What I do is to cut the plug off and connect them all together in one or more electrical boxes mounted under the cabinet.  This approach also allows you to install a single dimmer to adjust the brightnest of all. Very nice effect and reduces the heat coming off the lamps.  I once did this during a major kitchen upgrade which was pretty easy.  But, recently, I did this to an existing kitchen.  This required making holes in the backsplash and patching them later, or, in my case taking this opportunity to add a tile backspash which covered the patched holes. The only downside to using these halogen lamps is that replacements at the big-box store are quite expensive - $4 to $5.  I haven't had to replace too many but was pleased to find this much lower cost source of lamps at Amazon.  I only have one in service now so I don't have any feel for their operational life vs the life of a big box lamp.
9215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought the rubber hose because the one I bought at lowes started cracking after a year and I couldn't cut off enough of it to get it to work again.  Hopefully the rubber hose will last a bit longer.

Nice gifts for people who are visiting, particularly as places where guests may sleep our house do not always have good lighting for in-bed reading.  These are wonderful.  The color of the light is good.  Not too blue or too yellow.  They are very durable.  I take one traveling.  In case of a power failure, you can even put on a baseball cap and clip it on the cap.  Because it has an l.e.d., the batteries last a long time.  Uses 3 AAA batteries, cheap and easy to find.

5265	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a great product, especially for the thin kerf saw blades. The cuts are super smooth. However, it does limit the depth of cut and it must be removed to use the entire available depth of the saw blade for deeper cuts.
Then I spent an hour sharpening the iron (I have a WorkSharp WS3000 which I use to keep planes and chisels razor sharp, along with 8000 and 16000 grit water stones) and it was ready.  It easliy shaved continuous wafer-thin shavings from the edge of a piece of 30-year-old rock 1" thick rock maple.  I'm very happy with this tool.
Cons:  none
5945	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great little brute, Ive tried to stall it out but it just wouldn't stop. It handles 36Grit with no problem. The only drawback is the dust it creates is more than that little bag is going to hold. Get the the sweeper attachment part #DW4111 worth the money if your going to use this in the house or shop. that is why I give it a 4 star. Amazon.com should sell the attachment !!!! hint.
The shipping box was torn terrible, BUT there wasn't any damage to the table itself.
A word on the orbital action, which I didn't find out until I went to the [...] website, is that you just won't see it in operation.  According to the website, this orbital action is happening at 53 times each way per second, and that only when the blade is in contact with the material to be cut.  So it's there, it's working, you just can't see it.

4944	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had mine for several years now. I don't really give it much thought.  It always does what I ask it to. I love not having nail holes in my face  frames. Not a lick of trouble. I don't have the problem  of clogging. If  I'm inside , I use a shop vac. If I'm outside , I use the dust chute and  the ground. I don't point it at my person, I point it away. Nor do I have  the problem of out of square cuts. Even if they were it wouldn't be a  problem.  The slots are wider than the biscuits anyway. If you properly  clamp your work the joint will be straight even if your cuts are off. It's  amazing how forgiving these little football shaped pieces of smashed wood  really are. The glue causes the biscuit to swell and fill the voids. I  really like biscuits. They are pretty strong if you use common sense. I  have large pieces of furniture made exclusively with biscuits(no mortise  and tenons and no screws or nails) that are several years old and have been  moved twice to different locations with NO failures of any joints. The  Porter Cable looked inviting to me but it's not really any better from my  experience with it. I've never used a lamello. I'm sure I would dump my  Dewalt in its favor if I did but I'm very happy with this one that is sooo  much cheaper.
5450	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As the majority of commenters have noted, this router is a workhorse (or team of oxen) that is an incredible value. It's variable speed and will plow through anything you throw at it. I've had mine a couple of years now and don't get a chance to use it nearly as much as I'd like, but thought I'd offer up some observations.
4025	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A very nice saw. Very heavy (which I take to be a good thing) and I went for this model because it has the electric brake (didn't like the idea of standing there forever waiting for the blade to slow down. The handle sits nicely in my hand and all in all I'm very pleased with it. I bought a better blade so can't comment on the blade it comes with (actually I have used that one once when I was ripping out a piece of old subfloor and was worried about hitting nails with my good blade - it worked fine).
3471	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased the Dewalt DW318 SCMS and ordered this clamp at the same time. I was disappointed when I compared the clamp that came with the saw with this one. The stock clamp has a smaller knob on the top for tightening against the work piece, and only the DW7082 has the quick release button to quickly raise or lower it. The stock clamp does have a bolt on the back of the arm that can lower it on the leg, but the fence of the saw only allows 1/4" of play unless it's slid out of the way. Originally I only ordered one DW7082 clamp knowing that the saw would already come with a clamp, but after comparing the two side by side, I ordered a second DW7082 and put the stock clamp aside. To invest in the saw and not have accessories that perform the way I want them doesn't make sense to me.

2629	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	These extension wings will be fine if you want them permanently mounted on your saw. I returned them because they are not easily removeable for saw storage. My Hitachi saw has similar wings that slide in and out with one top mounted set screw, the Dewalt requires mounting from beneath the saw and are not made to install and remove readily, so I returned the items.

I bought this thin kerf one. and have used it to cut ceda/pine board, plywood board, and also cross cut and ripped 2 inches thick walnut, as same as everyone is saying, this blade works perfectly on all those things. The edge is very clean, smooth. Almost as smooth as what the hand plane leaves (I still use hand planes to smooth it though)

3940	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I haven't used this a lot, but I do have some comments. I have the Delta DP400 drill press. I bought the mortising attachment from another company not knowing it was also a Delta brand. When I got it, I read the instructions and started to install it. At first I found out that all three bushings that were supplied didn't fit. A couple of pages later I found out that for my type of Delta press, they weren't needed and it fit perfectly without needing one. The manual didn't make any mention of the DP400 model specifically.
8. The "Lighted" Power Switch (option) also matches nicely and is SO practical and safe by being able to put it ON top of the fence.
I have only one complaint about this tool, and that's its dust & chip collection.  The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag.  So badly, in fact, that I've taken to clearing it out after every few holes.  I use the tool with a vac whenever possible, and the port stays clear.
1816	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Affordable and very dependable kit for my router table.  It was easy to use and operate for my routing needs.  Customer service was great.  The material it is made from is very strong and light.
Only two issues with the application and not a fault of the PC7310 router is the router noise level and single speed. Otherwise the PC7310 router design is well suited for this application and is an excellent choice for the price.

7645	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this cat paw after my old stanley got to wide at the claws and this is a beast of a tool. it is longer than a normal one and this gives you more leverage which is very nice. pulls gun nails out very easily. if your a framer or carpenter this will be a new favorite tool. also check out their flat bar which i bought before this, also a really good product.

3126	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Big help for Crown molding.  You have to cut it upside down, which takes a bit of getting used to.  I install cabinets and have ot cut crown several times a week.  These are a big time saver.  I get perfect joints every time now.
Though the set leaves flat bottoms, it does leave what I might call "scribe lines" on the outer edges of the dado channel.  If the width of the dado is exactly what you want then this effect will never be noticed.  If you plan to use the dado set however to make tenons, and you plan to run the board across the dado stack multiple times, there will be scribe lines left on the tenon.  It's not that big of a deal, but something to be aware of.

Lots of power, no worries about grabbing all those chips and dust.

It is well made, and yes it does spec out properly. I used Incra measuring instruments to check the rule, and the Bosch digital protractor to check to see if it was dead on 90. It wasn't off by even a tenth of a degree.

7013	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great pack of blades. I have a blade to cut pretty much anything. They cut very well I must add. If your buying your first Sawzall, like I did, this is the perfect starter pack of blades and is a great deal. Five stars.
3696	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This light works good, but I was a little dissappointed in the "belt-clip" that was supposed to "conveniently hook" to my belt.  The one I received won't clip to anything, and near as I can figure, you need another part of the "system" to attach to your belt for it to work.  Now I'll have to find that part or else jury-rig something...
8911	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a good quality saw and the price is reasonable.  The seller provided fast service and a perfectly packed item too.  If you need a larger fine cut trim saw you will be pleased with this items value, quality, and price.
Some suggestions:  I used 1 x 2 red oak, and glued it up to make 2x2 boards (actual finished size 1.5 x 1.5).  You can buy 2x2 oak, but there was a sale on 1x2 boards so I saved about $7.  The boards were cut as directed by the instructions, and the glue seam was placed vertically.  I assembled each board to its corresponding two corner braces with wood clamps, then marked for each hole using a self-centering punch.  Once all the holes were marked, I used a drill press to drill all 20 holes.  Since I had a drill press and I'd marked the holes using the punch, I was able to use 5/16" holes for the 5/16" bolts (not 7/16" like the instructions mention).  This made the assembly very tight and rigid, and I had no trouble getting the bolts in.  Also, the bolts are long enough, you just don't have extra threads protruding from the nuts.
4857	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I order this tool for a special project and was ready to use it as soon I got it out of the box. I started to cut the first joint and the handle collasped forward and smashed by fingers. On closer inspection I found that the threads in one side of the handle were stripped completely out. With care I continued to use the tool to finish the project. Later I filled the hole with metal epoxy and re-threaded it. I am sure dewalt would have made it good but I didn't have time. Somewhat dissapointed but the tool works great if you keep your fingers "from between the bricks"
8189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Smooth cutting.
5572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	great product
Overall this is better than not having a mortiser and the price is right. I would buy it again since I don't want or need to invest the money or storage space required for a dedicated mortiser.
It could be made better, I'm sure. There isn't a gasket or anything to seal it on the trash can, so there is a trivial amount of suction loss. But no big deal. More engineering would probably make it more expensive.
The jack comes with a 1/4" bolt and wing nut to prevent the jack from being lifted from the rung when in use. Since these loose parts are easy to lose, I replaced them with a 1/4" x 2 1/2" square lock pin that I can attach with a lanyard.
This steering control that I am mentioning is not a major item. I am not going to pick up a barrel grip instead and consider selling mine. I just would prefer the barrel grip for that fine level of single handed control. Both are magnificent saws.
6065	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Bought this as a less expensive alternative to a dust deputy and because I wasn't confident in my ability to diy my own cyclone.  Slapped this on a 5 gallon bucket and have been very impressed with how well it works.  It keeps pretty much all of the sawdust out of my shop vacuum, except for the one time when I tipped the cart over.
I returned it.
8646	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This level is the loooooow end of the scale, I can do it easier with string line level or clear tubing.
The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life, unlike the the itty-bittys, which I found went through batteries like crazy. Of course, the LED "bulbs" don't burn out like the itty-bitty blubs (and the XtraFlex2 doesn't heat up from its bulbs, either). The XtraFlex2's integrated battery pack is also great; no getting tangled up in a cord while you're in bed.

6080	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great
3919	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The Fein Multimaster is an indispensable tool. Not perfect but It is much better than any of the other brands. However, the blades are greatly overpriced. They vibrate a lot, burn the wood, can break, and dull easily. That would be OK if they were inexpensive so that you could replace them as often as needed. Can't wait until another manufacturer comes up with an inexpensive good blade. No one will buy Fein blades anymore.
1343	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	burns out too quickly
7501	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The old Kreg screws that most, if not all, of the 5 star review are for are not the screws you receive when order the new ones.  I recently finished off my last box of 1,000 screws I had ordered several years ago.  These new zinc-plated screws do not self thread nearly as easily and the square drive does not nearly as securely.  I am very disappointed to see the steep drop-off in quality.
4764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you've ever used Bosch blades, you know they are great quality. I'm just writing this to confirm that my order was as stated  genuine Bosch.
1385	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great bang for the buck halogens. They are bright and well made. The color and output blended perfectly with the 40W Xenon's that were already installed on the chandelier. I love how they are individually packaged, and the product is exactly as pictured and described. You cannot tell the difference between these and the ones at your major hardware store that cost 8 bucks each. Very well worth the price, and off course, you can't go wrong with Amazon Prime shipping. Highly recommended.
I've been using sawzall's for quite a while now and I have always admired Milwaukee Sawzalls for their dependability and durability. The added power of the Super Sawzall and ease of use make this an ideal choice if your building something new, tearing something down, or fabricating something for a job. I would highly recomend this product to anyone who wanted to purchase a sawzall.

6041	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Most quality products rate at something around 4.5 stars - IMO this is a 5 Star product.  For years I have used shop made wooden inserts, but when I bought a new table saw I decided to try ready made inserts.  These Leecraft inserts have made a believer out of me.  With the two adjustment screws and tabs, they fit my Dewalt DW 744 precisely and snugly.  Add to that the nice finger size hole in the insert, and you have an insert that fits right and is easy to swap in and out.  True, you can't use them with the rive knife, but I don't use it anyway.  I bought 2 to begin with, one for a thin kerf blade and one for dado use.  Now that I see how well they work, I'll buy more for all the common dado widths I use.  On most products I find myself thinking "if only they would have..."  Can't think of anything I wish they had done on these inserts - simply put, "Buy it, you'll like it!"  Makes me wonder why Dewalt doesn't offer a comparable, but if they did that, then they would have to offer a decent miter - not going to happen!
7597	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product works very very well. I hooked it up to a non Fein dust collection system and there's hardly any airborne dust that I notice. Very aggressive sander, usually requiring two hand operation. But, boy does it chew up wood. Not good for small work, but for the furniture I build, it's great. Highly recommended.
7794	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	1978 was the first time I saw an Estwing hammer. When the boat-builder I was working with let me try it, I went out at lunchtime to buy one. That lasted until 1992 when almost all my tools were stolen. It was on my top-ten list to replace first.

7179	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used this tool on my first DIY prefinished hardwood flooring job. My compressor regulator was set at ninety pounds and with B & C Eagle ABCS1516 2-Inch Hardwood Flooring Staples, using it was a breeze. Pulls the boards in tight and flat to the floor and didn't damage the tongues. Never had a jam, although if you don't have it seated and firmly planted on the floor, you may get a staple that doesn't go all the way through. Used a Dremel to cut the staple and then restapled. With 3&1/4 boards, only had to face nail one row against the wall. Smaller than that I'd say you may have to do two rows. All in all, I would definitely buy and use this tool again.
5770	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this hose over 10 yrs ago. It is very well made. There is NO comparison in this hose and the hose that comes with a shop vac. This hose reminds me of a hose that you use with a commercial automotive vacuum or a car wash vacuum. Well worth the money. PLEASE NOTE.....If you want to use "stock" attachments that came with your vacuum, you will need an adapter. I didn't need one because we use our vac for our trks and suv's. Awesome hose!!!!!
7078	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm on my second Bostitch nailer in 10 years.  This unit is built to last and performs well.  I can't remember the last time this unit misfired or jammed.  It's easy to maintain and very dependable on the job.
3325	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I'm dumbfounded that after all of these years, DeWalt still hasn't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long. I thought, jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011, there should be an improvement by now... lol, nope. I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes, bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag.
The instructions are very basic and only refer to installing the fence to the base. They do mention the rod sizes as 8mm and 10mm. The threads on the 8mm rods are for mounting the unit to a dewalt dw610 base. The rods do not screw together. The 10mm rods are just rods without other features. The 8mm rods measure 280mm plus the threads. The 10mm rods measure 380mm. The length of the rods could allow for some added capacity of fence depth.
8933	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Before I purchased I had read a number of reviews on different dado sets and the Freud kept coming up as great value for money (especially to an Australian purchaser) and good quality. I have not been disappointed at all and now I have my new table saw I am using the set more and more. I find it easy to set up and once you learn the tricks of the trade regarding the use of shims quite quick to use. It gives good clean cuts, which is what it's all about and I thoroughly recommend to any prospective purchaser. I am now waiting for my Freud P410 Premier Fusion blade to arrive and hopefully I'll be as happy with that as I am with this set.
It will offer SOME improvement even on decent hybrid or contractor-saws.
1973	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After finally getting the saw. ( the first one came in broken durng shipping). It was put to the test and really has impressed me. It's just what the doctor ordered for trim and getting those sheets of plywood down to a workable size. The saw is powerful yet small enough to not be a burden.  I was having problems getting blades at the local stores but went back to amazon and there they are, as many as one would need.  I must admit during this transaction, I was somewhat disappointed that the first one was delivered broken but Amazon came through and made the second shipment as painless a anyone could expect.  The saw is a little pricey but worth it..... If it's trim and plywood sheets you need to size this, is the tool to buy.
74	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Kind of big and bulky but real easy to use and the light is terrific. For being a large book light it is pretty lightweight too so that's nice. I like it, works great for reading in bed.

Fence and miter track made of extruded aluminum, substantial material, not cheap.
3182	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product rocks. A bit pricey for what it does, and the instructions make some odd assumptions for you (following them on your measurements, for example, will make it way oversized, and I preferred to make it fit my tools exactly, also, the instructions call for almost 3/16 of slop in drilling the bolt holes; again, opted to make mine fit). Also, if you're assembling it, you might want to plan on having a drill press handy, there are about 20 holes that need to be drilled pretty straight and true.
  Recommend this light for every late night reader, it's the best I've found.  You do not need the transformer cord to plug into the wall. The batteries are so inexpensive because they last well powering the two LED's.

2939	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Sometime in the recent past, DeWalt moved the manufacturing for this saw from Canada to Asia.  I recently ordered the saw for my father, and the one he got (and TWO replacements) all had problems due to poor quality control or manufacturing or both.  I am a woodworker and own and have used many quality DeWalt tools over the years, so I was surprised at these problems.

I love the light....it's great in the evening when hubs is watching tv and I do not want all the bright lights on. It is good when we go camping and it the car. It clips on and stays on my Kindle (I've also used it on paperbacks sucessfully), and it is easy to adjust. Shortly after purchasing I thought I was going to have to pitch it because the brightness of the light itself became dim (I'd only had it a few weeks). I purchased new batteries and it resolved that problem. I changed the batteries again about three months later because I use the light so much camping/road trips but I imagine others would not have to do it as often.

Like I said, the hose may or may not work fine; I couldn't get mine threaded to even try it so 1 star. Others seem happy with it, and that's great, but I don't like to be duped. Don't sell me a harbor freight hose at goodyear prices. The genuine goodyear hose is only eight bucks more so I bought one of those and this one is en router back to amazon for a refund.

The top steps of this beauty make a wide and sturdy platform for your feet, but frequently two feet is too high, so I find that having steps on both sides of this ladder makes using the first step stabler and safer than with ordinary one-sided step ladders.  I can stand straddling the ladder with one foot firmly on each of the first steps; much steadier than with two feet together on one rung with only a portion of each shoe in contact with the rung.

Great for fencing and indoor framing without a need for a compressor. Still using the original battery. Even though the housing is plastic; This is not a toy...
For instance it comes with a drill bit and collar for the bit that I would have had to buy separately with the other set up I was going to get originally.  Also it comes with a handy long #2 square drive for your electric drill witch is great for getting into even tight spots.  You also have the ability to set it up for the thickness of wood that you are going to be using and not have to measure ever time you use the too.  That is a big time saver.

Since it is rubber it gets softer when it is up on a hot roof in the summer and it gets stiffer when it is used in freezing weather. But it resists tangling as long as I take the time to get the twist out as I unroll it. I have had no problem with soft spots, blow outs nor leaks.

I've run probably around 100 boardfeet of poplar, oak, pine and mahogany through my planer and jointer with this set up. I could not have asked for anything better out of a $38 setup.

So, I want to get a new power screwdriver, but which one?  Initial research reduced the number of brands to three which wasn't too bad: DeW..., Pana... and Milwaukee.  I must tell you that although I like the look and specifications of DeW... tools, they tend to be a fifty-fifty hit with quality overall.  They're great for certain tools like drills and circular saws, but I didn't find great reviews on the screwdriver.  The one thing that made me stay away from the DeW... was the design of the bit chuck.  Owners wrote that the chuck is pulled back to lock the bit in place, but complained of bits falling out when inserting the tool in a workbelt or when the screwdriver was accidentally dropped.  Having a bit fall out when up in the attic with hands full really doesn't sound too cool to me.

This is also the first saw I have used that has adjustments for aligning the blade and the side of the saw deck, so if you are cutting along a straight edge, or using the optional rip fence, the blade does not start to wander sideways along the cut.

I recommend waxing the table with finishing wax to make it slippery. Without the wax, materials snagged on the keyhole. I also recommend taping a bag under the bottom arm to catch saw dust. If you are electronically inclined, rig up a small LED near the bottom blade holder. It is hard to see the blade down there because it is dark. I also recommend getting a small lamp and taping another bag to the right side to catch sawdust on the top.
These are a must have!!

3634	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Yes its an edge guide, but geese PC couldn't you have made this a little nicer than you did? This guide works, but the casting is so rough ( and flimsy ) that it makes it hard to run the router smoothly along your work's edge. It really is that bad. Compared to the BOSCH edge guide the PC is marginal at best. I modified mine with a phenolic ( polyethelene ) material cut to the same size as the guides, and used 3M double sided structural tape between the phenolic " glides " and the PC guides, and it works much better. Come on PC, I know you sell enough of the 690 series routers and accessories to justify some improvement.
If you are insistent on a DeWalt, then TEST IT FIRST.  More often than not it's not going to move, and being as or more expensive than a Mikata or Ridgid of similar RPM, just get one of those instead.

I keep thinking it is going to be plywood, but it is not.  The second comment is that they ship a table top stiffner that does not fit along with it.  The stiffner is from their larger tables.  No need and no way to use it on this table.  Incidentally, I have not had good luck with the larger Bench Dog tables.  The thin MDF table is just not stiff enough for the application.  They get buy with it in this table because of the smaller size.

When it came to laying the upper and lower decks for the backyard play ground, this was a lifesaver.  It worked perfectly.  While I had only a 1 time need for this, it was the exact right tool for the job and I would not have been able to do the project without.  The decking was straight and true.

It's a bit bulky on the base/clip, but even the smallest paperback will hold this up using multiple pages (including the back or front cover of the book).

6559	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Funny how a number of peeps complain about the raised center. Most router plates I've measured and/or read about have a sunken/dished center (even though they're sold as 'flat'.) I can't speak for anyone else but I normally place my featherboards so they push down at the center of the plate, where the bit is. If the center is dished what are you supposed to do, just about everything you do will have a curve in it as the piece dips in and out of the depression. Silly...
I cannot say that I am yet ready to sink hundreds of dollars into new clamps, nor will I throw away my trusty Pony pipe clamps, but my starter set of these Besseys will get A LOT of use around my shop in the years to come. I highly recommend that you try these for yourself!
As a sidenote: you can easily slot the back of this plate so that the riving knife will slide in. There's nothing in this design that will prevent you from doing that. The plate is so thick that such a slot will probably not cause ANY flexing anyway. However I am not going to bother.
7023	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They are very well put together and are heavy duty. Hold down as they are supposed to, got in very good time.
Note: Be aware that this router only accepts 1/4" collets so if you have 1/2" bits for a larger router they will not work with this. I also bought "MLCS 6077 Woodworking 1/4-Inch shank Carbide-tipped Router Bit Set, 15-Piece" when I bought this even though I have close to 100 1/2" collet bits.
  appears to be crooked.  Fixed with a new thin piece of Lexan with the line scribed.  I mounted it with heavy duty 2 sided foam
I think this is a great hose, but it may be a little thick for my little compressor.  I'm afraid, because of the weight and strength of this hose, that I run the risk of breaking the connector off on the compressor.  Also, because of the thickness and volume of space within the hose, hooking it up to my little compressor decompresses the tank quite a bit.  If I had to do it again, I would probably purchase a thinner hose.  None the less, this hose performs excellently and I'm confident that it will last me my entire life.
Though it does seem a little cheap when looking at competitors.

7029	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a very knowledgeable plumber, nor someone who does a lot of plumbing.  As a homeowner, I have done some and will certainly do more, and pipe wrenches are an essential part of a basic plumbing tool kit, even for many simple finish plumbing jobs.  Advice I have found online and gotten from people with whom I work is that the 14" size is the most generally useful, so this is a good first wrench.  Or better yet, buy a pair of them if you are assembling threaded pipe.  However, Channel lock pliers and vice grips are also quite useful, and in many jobs, more useful than a pipe wrench.  Nonetheless, as I said, pipe wrenches are still essential plumbing tools.  From experience and advice, I have decided to get 6", 10", and 14".  And possibly, if I ever need one, I will also buy an 18".  Keep in mind that these WILL leave teeth marks on whatever you are gripping.  If this is unnacceptable, you can possibly put something between the jaws and the object (as the cost of a less secure grip).
3085	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been using my Bosch saw now for about six months.  I agonized over my decision of which sliding compound miter saw to buy, comparing the Hitachi, Makita, Freud, Milwaukee, DeWalt, and Bosch.  After testing each  one in stores to get a feel for the saw, I went with the Bosch.  At first,  I was worried that maybe I should have chosen the DeWalt, since I usually  love DeWalt products.  However, I am so happy with the Bosch that I no  longer have any regrets.  The saw is accurate, easy to adjust, and  incredibly solid.  The left side has an extension built in that, together  with the excellent clamp that comes with the saw, will hold down boards  over 100" in length without a problem.  I have cut wood at several  angles, and I have done compound cuts (i.e., bevel and miter), and in every  case it's been perfect -- and I mean PERFECT.  The blade that comes with  the saw makes glass-smooth edges.  As a matter of fact, I use the saw  regularly to make a nice edge on the wood I buy, and again it's performed  perfectly.  Also, it has a larger cross-cut capacity that almost any other  sliding compound miter saw on the market, able to cross-cut up to a full  12" -- and if you are careful turning the board around, you can  cross-cut up to 24".  This means you can get away without a radial arm  saw, which is precisely what I have done.  One note about price: even  though this saw is more expensive than other 10" sliding compound  miter saws, you have to keep in mind that the blade that comes with it is  worth at least $60.  The DeWalt comes with a mediocre blade that is no good  for finish-quality edges, so you would have to right away buy another blade  if you buy the DeWalt.  So, you have to take $60 off the price of the Bosch  to compare fairly, or you have to add $60 to the price of the 10"  DeWalt.  I have come to believe that Bosch excels in the saw department  (see my review of the Bosch Progressor jig saw) while DeWalt is good with  jointers, sanders, etc.  Bottom line: I can't praise this saw enough.  You  will be extremely happy to have it in your shop.

If I needed a another compound miter saw, I would not hesitate to buy this again.  I like this saw so much, I wouldn't even take time to evaluate other brands.  Of course I am sure the other major brand saws are comparable.  I just like everything about this.  I know the new ones offer a laser, but I could get a laser disk to put on this if I found a need.

5903	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased several of these a couple years ago, they fit well, but as noted by other reviewers you can't use your splitter and gaurd when using these inserts. Plus if you cut a lot of dadoes, you need one for each size. About 6-8 months ago I discovered Betterly Tru Cut inserts. These are made from high quality machined aluminum, made to fit your saw. The blade section has a removable phenolic insert. While the main insert  cost's twice what the Leecraft does, you only buy it once. The phenolic inserts come two to a pkg and cost half what the Leecraft does, so if you need a lot of inserts, I do, then you come out money ahead with this system. The winning part of this system for me, was that you can still use your blade gaurd and splitter, as the insert is milled to fit your specific saw. Therefor it is grooved to accept the factory guard and splitter. It has enough adjustments on it to keep even the most [...] level nut happy and locks into the saw table with compression. It is very solid. The fit and finish are excellent. Changing inserts is a breeze and you don't have to go thru the leveling routine every time you change an insert. If you only need one insert then the Leecraft is probably a good deal, but if ya need more go with the Tru Cut.

Any saw will bind up under too much pressure from any material.  If this happens to the Mag, the motor will continue to spin and the blade will stop moving, this is a built-in saftey feature to prevent burning up the motor by seizing it with too much torque.

Once installed, the unit offers a world of convenience and safety compared to the splitter and blade guard that came with your saw.  For non-thru cuts, you can easily remove the splitter without tools, but still have the benefit of the blade guard.

My 9 year old likes to read.  The first reading light I bought didn't have a timer or auto-off, which meant we burned through a battery's charge pretty quickly.  This unit has an elongated oval button.  One side works like a traditional on/off and the other side of the button is for the timer.  Each click of the timer side adds 15 minutes of light, up to 4 clicks for an hour.  Each click is shown as a small red led light on the top of the light.

  I had a body shop for 20 years, did a lot of high-end cars. Spend a zillion hours behind a polisher. Had a multi step polishing procedure. First you wet sand the car with 600 grit or 800 grit wet dry sandpaper. Then you use a true silky smooth tie on lambs wool bonnet and Dupont 606 hand application compound. (The secret is after going over the car the first time with the 606S compound, put on a fresh lambs wool bonnet, and go over the car a second time. It is amazing how it improves the gloss. That way you have a true polished surface to build your protection on.  Then use liquid ebony to eliminate the swirl marks, then Maguire's machine glaze, and then hand glaze. People couldn't help but come over and ask you about the finish on the car. Three new bonnets are required) Anyhow, 1750 rpm's didn't do something, like warm up the finish enough to give you mind blowing gloss. The 5540 gives you up to 2800 RPM's with a speed setting dial, so you can tweak it in to the desired speed, which is 2400 for, automotive.

I would like to know if anyone has created a slot in this insert that accomodates the 'curved' splitter that is attached to a Dewalt 7491 blade guard.  I need to calculate required slot length for the 7491 curved splitter to allow for blade heights between say 1/2 inch and 1.75 inches max.  My goal is to use the 7491  blade guard, splitter and anti-kickback teeth in combination with the zero clearance insert.  For added stability, I want insert material left at the back end of the insert and also material between the blade slot and splitter slot. Therefore I do not want to use the table saw to create the splitter slot.  I don't own a bandsaw so I'm thinking drill, scroll saw, hacksaw and file to create the slot.  I'm a table saw newbie hobbyist with a primary goal of keeping all 10 fingers and avoiding kickback.  Your advice is appreciated.

I still have my old original WorkMate table (a model 300) that is fast up on the quarter century mark. And it works better in every respect than the 7 year old model 425 I received as a gift. The steel on the 425 is rough edged and thin, all pivot points are pop-riveted and, after seven years of use, so tight it is still difficult to open the table. The ergonomics of the opening latches are such that you have to push down on them while trying to pull up on the table to release it ...nothing beats third world design. The larger bamboo wood table insert warped within a year. The overall fit, finish and function of this WorkMate is rough and cheap ...such a far remove from the originals. Had this not been a gift it would have been returned. I certainly wouldn't recommend this waste of steel to anyone.

1169	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great and low cost.  Does the job.
If you can afford it--replace your siding. New poplar siding is about 15 cents a foot (in 2005. Prices fluctuate) in the US. Materials for an average home would cost about $4,000. Plus lots of labor. Vinyl siding is usually a poor choice. It costs $5,000, looks fake, and causes weird moisture issues between the vinyl and the old siding.
Just wanted to add, Amazon sells this 42 tooth blade as well: Tenryu SL-14042C that will fit with a 5/8" to 1/2" bushing. This one is 5 1/2" About $29.00.

I purchased the Milwaukee 6547-22 Kit, 2.4 Volt, 2 Speed cordless screwdriver for $110 from Amazon.  The kit comes with two batteries, a charger, a chuck, a few bits (including a few drill bits), and the screwdriver.  It's works well for light drilling such as when mounting wall anchors and such, but it doesn't replace a drill.  I didn't expect that since I bought it for driving screws (hence the name).  It's also very light and easily fits in a workbelt.

It took about 3 hours to flatten the sole, blade, and cap iron, and deburr everything (I spent 1 1/2 hours on a Veritas LAJ cleaning it up to my liking). The sides are not perpendicular to the sole, which is ok for me - this plane is too light to use on a shooting board anyway. All the other surfaces are in correct alignment and just needed to be smoothed up. I now get blade wide whisper thin shavings, as well as thicker ones without chatter if wanted - I believe that is the purpose of a plane. Blade and mouth adjustments are smooth. I really like the thinner profile/width and lighter weight of this plane vs the 12-920 and 12-139 (own them as well). It will be very good for light trimming/edge clean-up activities where my other block planes feel a bit bulky.

The quality is there and the smoothness of motion and power to drive through a cut is obvious once you use it.  Earthquakes are real in Japan and they do a lot of reinforced concrete as a result they have built tools to support their needs.

6187	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I got this separator for my Jet DC-1100.  First let me say that it doesn't look exactly like the picture.  The holes look more like Lee Valley's 'Veritas' lid.  The intake into the dust collector is dead center while the intake into the can is on a drastic angle to form a "cyclone" effect.  Mine was $41 from Amazon with free shipping...I see it's $28 from some other vendors now.  I think it's really worth about $28 in materials.  It's worth more than $41 in value.  I looked at the other lids that are basically a 90 deg. PVC elbow imbedded in the lid.  This one is a lot more aerodynamic.  It is a large lid.  The largest diameter can it fits is about 23.5-24.5", while there is a second internal ring that fits cans around 21.25-22.25".  Even the 30 gallon galvanized steel trash cans I found are closer to 20.5".  I did find that Rubermaid Brute 44 galon trash cans are a perfect size (although I haven't tested their implosion resistance so I can't say anything about that).  And with horse country all around me, my local Tractor Supply has very thick (nearly 1/2") plastic feed barrels that are 24" diameter, tall and very durable.  About $20-25 will get you a nice can.  That's what I chose.  I figured it'd be quieter than steel anyway.  Back to the lid...it's got a foam gasket that has qualities of memory foam (slow to bounce back but shape conforming).  I have high quality ( a.k.a. expensive) 4" clear flexible tubing and it does "screw" into the holes.  It could be a little more snug in my opinion.  I will probably rig something to make the fit a little more air tight.  All-in-all I would still buy this again...or the Veritas because there's not much else out there without dropin some $$$ on a real cyclone.  If you have a dust collector and can't fit or afford a cyclone this is a relatively cheap upgrade.
On my DW745 type 3, when the blade is raised to the top height the motor housing comes up very high, just about 1/4 from the table top surface. This insert is about 1/2 thick so it interferes with the motor housing when the blade is raised. The motor housing will push this throat plate UP, causing a potentially dangerous situation of blade binding or worse! The DW745's factory throat plate (insert) has a cutout/notch on the underside so that the motor housing comes up and into the notched-out portion of the insert. This Leecraft insert does not have that same notch/cutout, so I used my router to make a cutout, using the the factory insert as my measurement reference.

I do not know what is going on with the engineers at Dewalt but this is not good.
So yes, it is a great ladder, and is an awesome choice if you need to get up 40 feet.  But, if you don't need to go that high, a lighter smaller ladder would be a better choice.
The add-on "kit" to use this with a Biesemeyer fence is just a flat piece of metal, and it's too soft/thin so it flexes and fails to support everything properly.  The price is ludicrous for what you get.  You're much better off buying a piece of angle iron and drilling it yourself.

Adding this blade dampener/stiffener just guarantees that you will do the most to be sure of having the highest quality tool. Whatever this costs is worth it to know that you are enhancing your blade for the best performance possible. I don't do that many deep cuts, so have yet to moan about limited depth - hasn't been a concern yet.

I took mine out of the box and before I could even connect hoses to it I noticed it wasn't even sitting flat on the bucket.  A very loose fit doesn't help either...lots of play.  With the loose fit and rocking bow I couldn't see suction pulling this tight for a better seal.  Because of the loose fit I stood there looking at it wondering how I would fasten it down to ensure any shop movement wouldn't release seal.

2594	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	While not a professional carpenter like many who've already reviewed this excellent pice of equipment I'd like to add my $.02 worth to these reviews. A few months ago I was doing a complete remodel of the kitchen in our rental condo and for the first few weeks my old Skil saw (at least 10 years old and possibly damaged when I used it, with the proper blade, as a concrete saw a couple of years back) was doing just fine. However, when it came time to cut the laminated countertops to length it just wasn't up to the task and it was obvious I'd need a new one. Did a bunch of online research and narrowed my choices down to this Milwaukee model and one from Dewalt. Chose the Milwaukee mostly because of the Tilt-Lok handle and I could not be happier with my choice! It cut through those countertops like the proverbial knife through hot butter and left edges as smooth and clean as if they'd been cut on my Delta Unisaw table saw. This is one outstanding tool that I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a really good circular saw that will get the job done and probably last them for many, many years and over many, many projects.

4140	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It really is hard to express how great of a dado cut this set makes.  I'm building a new set of kitchen cabinets, and I really can get exact dado's for a tight sturdy fit.  My one complaint is that the chippers are not marked...  so you literally have to sit there with a ruler and measure them out to find the small one and the large one.  The spacers are all marked, however, so that wasn't a problem.
I did not give the Harbor Freight clamp as much use(maybe just from a mental block of it being $0.99), but I know that I prefer it over the Irwin, as the Irwin, as you can see from the photos, has the thinnest bar, the only bar that bends under pressure at the rivet near the head, the only clamp whose pad lifts at an angle under full pressure, the shortest throat depth, & the second shortest jaw capacity. This makes me not even want to consider Irwin for the larger clamps, unfortunately.

I've had this hose (3/8" x 50' Goodyear yellow safety rubber hose) and a same-size Goodyear Pliovic all the time.  I typically leave this hose hooked up and pressurized all the time and I leave the Pliovic hung up on the side of the garage, unpressurized, and hook it up only when I need an additional 50' run.

I probably really need a 32'er, but I was intimidated when I looked at one, especially since I was going to be handling it mostly by myself.

Twice removed-
Personally, I like the leather grip over any of the plastic grips.
In production use, the tool seems heavy and poorly balanced. The on/off switch is awkwardly located, at least for me--I have to turn it on and then position it for a cut (instead of lining it up and just switching it on briefly for a quick cut. Then I have to set the tool down and turn it off. You have to wonder what they were thinking when they built this thing.
To try these out, I used a very cheap battery-operated (V12) drill and a standard 2x4. After a few minutes, I had a perfectly smooth hole drilled through the wood. The backside of the hole was just a little rough. If I wanted it smoother, it would only take a little bit of sanding.
I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.

The fence arrived within two days. From an earlier review, it seems that one would need to drill a whole in the mounting bracket to fit the Ridgid saw. Much to my surpise, this was not needed for my saw. The holes line up perfectly, and the all the hardware that came with it fits the Ridgid saw perfectly. It's as if this was made for the saw. I guess the new orange/black Ridgid share the exact same dimensions as the Jet model, even the threading of the hole in the table is the same!

3616	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A while back following a major wallet-emptying experience buying new windows for my house I decided to save money by recycling the 60 year old case molding.  Having admired from afar the Porter Cable 9444 I finally  felt justified in purchasing one.  It was the right thing to do.  This  machine with it's 1.8 amp motor has the power to remove material  surprisingly fast in small places while giving you excellent control.  Despite the seemingly small footprint of the sanding pad and the  accessories, this machine cut far faster than I had hoped for.  Over 640'  of molding that had been badly re-painted several times came clean quickly.  There was always a profile head that matched a particular nook or cranny.  Originally, I had thought to use the 9444 only to do the grooves and tight  places, but I found it fast enough to do the faces and edges of the molding  as well - it was easier (and safer for the molding) than getting out the  belt sander. When you use this machine your hand circles the entire motor.  This is not a perfect feeling and I found myself having to stop at times to  rest my hand.  However there was far less vibration transferred to your  hand that I expected.  Porter Cable seems to think that you will never  need a place to store extra sandpaper in the ubiquitous molded plastic case  - there is a place for everything that comes with the purchase but nothing  extra.  When will toolmakers realize that they are missing a free  marketing-moment by this sort of shortsighted design?  I consider these  gripes somewhat minor compared to the overall excellence of the machine. If  you only have occasional tight-place sanding to do, there is probably a  less expensive rodent-like solution out there.  But if you have a seriously  large project to do or are in the trades you can't go wrong with this  machine.

8051	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Jorgensen hand screws are now apparently made in China, and the quality has dropped accordingly.  They are no longer any better than the shoddy hand screws you can buy at China Freight or R*ckler.  The threading on the new ones is not a square thread, the handles are much cheaper now, and the rivets holding the handles on are chincy and break free.  Very lame.  Congratulations if you receive a genuine made-in-USA version, but don't count on it.
The nightmare before getting the Woodstock unit, is that with a 16 gallon shop vac, and using the planer, it loads up with chips after one good size board. Then I have to remove the lid, and dump, and comb the filter and start over. Makes planing boards a hassle. With the Woodstock unit. I plane several boards, before it is even half full. My friends are amazed when I show them the half full Woodstock unit, and the shop vac has less than a cup, of material in it. The filter does collect the fine airborne powder.
I added a rubber weather strip on the inside, where it covers the 5 gallon bucket. This improved the suction, however I need to add silicone where the 2 hoses connect and add a base with casisters to prevent the bucket from tipping over.

I'm a real fan of DeWalt tools, and this one didn't let me down.  I have a whole bunch of DeWalt tools, some of them are like 20 years old with tons of use, and they all work great.  The only thing I've ever had to replace was a battery back for my 18 volt drill after getting tons of use out of it.
  Then I looked at the Jorgensen's. They have their Cabinet Master Parallel steel line, which is aimed at competing with the Bessey K-Clamps. They have a wider face on them, so you can lay a clamp on its side, and get a longer clamping surface. With the Bessey's that is possible, albeit a slightly narrower surface. Myself, I choose to use a couple of inch thick straight oak piece as a wedge, giving me all the clamping surface I need.

For some reason, this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job.  It wobbles all over the place.

3633	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Instead of a PC product, this is more like a dirt cheap sand casting from a 3rd world country. The "machining" is just as crude to boot. For instance, the guide rods are not even parallel in both the vertical and horizontal planes. And those cheap thumbscrews need pliers to keep the thing from slipping.

After installing the board buddies I cut some 4' x 8' oak plywood sheets by myself and got prefectly  straight cuts. I used them for both 3/4" and 1/4".  They did work better on the 3/4" than the 14" as the 1/4" 4/8 tends to flex all over.  The board buddies held the sheets down tight and snug against the fence. I now rip to size instead of slightly oversize and only make one pass.
3910	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The Delta 34-976 Uniguard blade guard and splitter is a good choice for your Delta Contractor Saw or Unisaw (and works with some other brands).  There are similar and superior products out there (Excalibur by Sommerville Design, Biesemeyer, Exaktor, Brett Guard; search google for "Tablesaw Splitters and Blade Covers" for a review by Kelly Mehler), but the Uniguard  is very good for the price.  I have only minor complaints: no integrated dust collection (as in more expensive units), and it took longer to install and align than I expected.

3764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I use this tool for electronics assembly, mostly computers. What sets this model apart from 98% of the rest is the electronic clutch. Unlike the mechanical clutches on other tools, its action does not vary based on how hard you push on the screw. That means you can achieve more reliable torque settings and can work on more delicate assemblies. Further more it doesn't make that awful ratcheting sound when the clutch engages. The Makita 6705DW also has electronic clutch, but its form is too large and its handle does not articulate into a pistol grip.
7066	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bites hard on pipe. No slipping. I bought two more in other lengths. Perfect.
The biggest gripe I have is trying to clean up squeeze out, especially in inside corners.  A wet towel will pick it up if you work quickly, but that tends to spread a thin coat of glue on a wider area.  Scraping the wet glue up with a little shingle seems to work a little better.  After it is dry, the wood that has even the smallest amount of this glue on it will not take stain evenly.  The only solution is to sand or use a cabinet scraper to get to a layer with no glue.
1931	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Haven't yoused it yet looks ok

9580	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very convenient. I got both this and a magnetic holder. The magnetic holder is "quicker" to deal with, but not as accurate in pushing long screws straight. Moreover, if you are working against something with resistance, ur screw can still struggle if you push too hard. This, on the other hand, really holds the screw straight, making it ideal for longer screws or going into hard materials. Definitely worth the cost.

I read with fear the problem with the below-deck holes not in alignment. For the $419 price via Amazon, I decided to roll the dice.  My delivery date was way out - like middle of Frebruary or later.  Buyers remorse set in after I bought the machine so I went back to Amazon to cancel only to find out it was shipping.  No turning back. The saw arrived in a couple days.  Out of the box...no problems at all.  Holes in perfect alignment and top is milled flat.  Fit and finish is very good. Only 'problem' was a missing below deck hold screw for the blade.  A call to DeWalt customer sevice got it here next day ovenight air.  This saw is a good, solid performer.  I would recommend it. In addition I would recommend getting Flying Dutchman blades from Mike (google it) - what a world of difference they make.

- Plan to tap the lowering level with a hammer to release it from the locked position.  It's not always easy to move it from locked to unlocked for lowering, and more than once (but less than 1/3 of the time) I had to use a hammer to tap it out into position.
It does require some patience to assemble it.  There is no way you can do it 15 minutes as one reviewer suggests. Just making sure you have all the parts will take nearly that long.  I think I am a pretty handy guy and it took me almost 3 hours of fussing to get it completely set up and ready for use.

5431	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I mounted this router in a table, using a Rousseau router plate. I have used the machine for some light molding and grooving over the last year, and it works very quietly and smoothly. You can't even tell the router is cutting under load. I just experimented with a couple 3 1/2 inch panel raising bits, today. My samples were 3/4" pine. I cut a cove pattern and an ogee pattern on two separate samples. Both profiles were cut in a single pass. You can tell the router is working hard, but it didn't bog down. My shop vac was providing chip collection while the router was operating. The router eventually needed all 15A, and 15A circuit breaker popped. For panel construction, I will definitely use 2 passes over the panel raising bit. I experienced no tear out on the cross grain cut, or the long side cut. This router is a great performer, from my perspective.

What I wanted to share with you is that the Kreg Pocket Hole offerings made the number one spot across the board in the November 2003 issue of Better Homes and Gardens "Wood" magazine. Everything from the mini on through to the automated production machine were given the top ratings. It was a clean sweep for Kreg. They tested a lot of machines too. Some of the advantages are the flush edge joining to the workpiece prevented tearout. The case hardened steel guides didn't show wear or metal shavings. Easy to make or buy the premade plug holes out of wood. (Some were an odd shape, and wouldn't accept plugs very well)

Overall, this is a good, strong, versatile glue, but you should try to limit squeeze out to avoid cleanup problems.  If you are going to paint your project, it is no problem, but if you want a natural wood look, this looks unnatural.  I prefer polyurethane glues that do take stain (such as Gorilla, available on Amazon) when doing natural wood projects.  Polyurethanes are also better all weather glues.

3299	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	So far this is a good product.  The only design challenge I see is that the foot pedal that engages the mobility wheel is wide to the point  it cannot be placed on the narrow side of my jointer.  The jointers side is 14.5 wide as it is a 6 jet jointer.  That having been said; I must place the mobility wheel in front of the machine instead of on the side where it would provide the most mobility.  If you have a narrow machine you should bare this design challenge in mind.  If you have a larger machine (like a band saw) it should not be a problem.
Update, the replacement set was also bent. Do not buy these. Waste of $20.

3310	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After studying most of the sliding compound saws currently availible, (and some older used models), I came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to find a saw with every feature I wanted, so I comprimised and bought the Bosch 10" slider. I did some hands-on testing of the Hitachi 10", Makita 10', and the Dewalt 12" sliders. Each saw has at least one desirable or unique feature the others don't, and yet each has it's unique drawbacks as well. I didn't care for the Dewalt blade deflection and dust problem (notice the dust port does a 90 degree to the bag, and I don't think the dust knows how to negotiate a hard left turn). The Makita appears to be a top-notch design, but 'ouch' on the price. The Hitachi was a serious contender in most areas, but a 'hands-on' at a local tool dealer revealed the extemely out-dated knob/screw design used on the cross-cut angle table lock/detente. This system not only flunked Ergonomics 101, but I didn't care for the preset angle detente bypass/override design, either, and that's ditto for most of the other saws I studied. I have an old radial arm saw that has adaquate detente by-passes on cross-cut and bevel which allows for minute angle adjustments near 90*, 45*, etc. I wanted to replace it with a slider that had a similar system. Unless I misunderstood the detente by-pass designs on the other models, I found the Bosch to be the only clear choice. I need this feature often for the type of work I do, so this was a big plus for swaying me over to the Bosch slider. A right/left bevel was a feature I wish had come on the Bosch, but for me it's only a minor inconvenience. I have upgraded most of my 'old reliables' to Bosch and don't have any regrets yet. This slider is just one more smooth running machine in my collection. Bosch includes items as standard that Hitachi does not,(why should a 10 cent dust bag be an option), and the provided hold down clamp features a nice quick release handle. I didn't order any work support extensions as I plan to mount the saw on Dewalt's folding miter saw stand and use their extension system. Amazon shipped on time and it arrived with no damage or missing parts.
But the table itself is wonderful. The stand is built like an Abrams tank, and the table is a nice size. The fence works exactly like they say it does. Square and easy to use. So the product gets five starts, Kreg gets four stars, and Amazon gets zero stars for bad customer service.

3831	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to eventually use with a dovetail jig.  Since I already have a PC 690 combo set, it was a good way to get a D-handle without having to get a second motor.
1478	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I moved into my new house a few years ago, I installed a bunch of outdoor landscape lighting.  I went a little nuts.  Front yard, back yard, two porches, an atrium, all-in-all over 30 fixtures that use these little G4 base 10w and 20w 12V bulbs.  I quickly discovered that these halogen bulbs are a lot less reliable than the 7w wedge base bulbs I had used before.  What is more, at around $6.50 for a two pack at the local builder store, they are also a lot more expensive.
- Setting the fence height is slightly difficult. The scale on the front isn't super accurate, so a few test cuts in scrap wood helped get things lined up before making real cuts.
  I'd like to know if other brands of pads are just as bad.
This is a lightweight; very portable and maneuverable saw; having less torque & power than a full-sized circular saw.  Those are distinct advantages in many situations, such as using it vertically or over your head, or when cutting trim-sized stock.  On some jobs it's just more practical to use a small saw.  It's also safer than a large saw because it's lower torque means a reduced chance of the saw getting away from you.  E.g., my wife wouldn't use my [huge] worm-drive or standard-sized circular saws, but this one is perfect for her.

5095	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This unit is better than I expected.  The price is good.  The box was intact on arrival but the styrofoam was broken.  Never-the-less the unit was undamaged.  Went together in about a half-hour with no help.  Agree with others about the lockwashers.  They belong next to the nuts not the bolt heads.  Also (and Delta admits this is a problem with several manuals) they never tell you when to tighten the "finger-tighten-only" assemblies.  Please don't forget this step or thing will collapse quickly.  Also,  their "helper" clips for installing the lower bag are unecessary,  it's not that hard to do as long as you thread the steel band through the "belt" loops.  Don't like their 4" twin-wire hose clamps so I got some stainless band clamps.  I intend to convert the motor to 240 volts as I did with my saw.  They just work better that way and you have less voltage drop in the cords.  An added bonus is an increase in horsepower due to the better magnetic properties of the induction fields in the windings of the motor.  Strongly recommend this unit.  It will also interface well into a whole-shop 6" piping system.

I don't have the advantage of having used other scroll saws to compare it with but It seems to be well made and easy to use.

I also had a chance to get in touch with the customer service. The jig which I received had a minor manufacturing issue: it came with too short 1/2" screws in the spreaders, but with long 3/4" screws in the body. I sent an e-mail to the customer service in the evening and got a call from DNB tools early in the morning next day. They quickly identified the problem as wrong length screws and first suggested to ship me replacement screws, but then called again later that day to tell me that they discussed this issue and can suggest an even faster solution - check if adjustable stop screws are 3/4", and if they are, swap them with screws in the spreaders. This worked and the problem was resolved for the next several days until replacement screws arrived from the manufacturer. Promptness of their response and attention to the customer problem were first class.

The pros say the best way is to level, plumb and attach wall cabinets to each other, then lift and hang them as a single unit. This works well if you have skilled helpers or an electric cabinet lift. I had neither, so I hung them one at a time with one helper, a set of Pony clamps, and a T-Jak. First I screwed a ledger to the wall, then lifted one cabinet at a time onto the ledger, then held it in place with a T-Jak. The T-Jak is invaluable for leveling them in place, and holding them securely while you shim and fuss and get everything lined up. Then I clamped the face frames together with the Pony clamps and got them all perfect. Then drove in the screws to attach the cabinets to the wall studs, and then last of all drive in the face frame screws. I took off one star because the Pony clamps have drill guides for your face frame pilot holes, but they're a bit sloppy so you still have to drill carefully to get the right angle.
There are two bolts which hold the table in place, and on ALL THREE SAWS the bolt holes were apparently drilled off-center and mis-aligned, causing the blade to hit the side of the table slot (on the same side all 3 times).  We spoke to the scroll saw manager at DeWalt and he was very aware of the problem but didn't offer to do anything to fix it other than return our money. (He even admitted to have several saws in his office that had been returned from customers with this problem.) He said he had "reported the issue to management" multiple times but nothing had been done for several months.  Apparently this affects a large portion of the new saws coming from the new manufacturing facility in Asia.  Buyer BEWARE.
You don't want this to be your only power sander though.  It works fast, but that also means it can cause a lot of damage in a hurry too.  For example, a little slip and you've rounded an edge rather nicely.  It would be very hard to round all the corners evenly though.

  Back to the Dewalt, little extras like a guard that really works, the high fence, the vernier scale and the slots in the guard to see the cut are very nice and well thought out. Guards on the other saws are see through plastic that quickly become opaque.  You then have to bend over to see the blade on the mark.  Some remove the guard alltogether after years of constant bending over. The reviewer that couldn't tighten the bevel on the DeWalt so it wouldn't move must have very very weak hands. This is not a problem for the rest of us.

  Makita also has available as an option, the side handles that we have all come to know, the standard throughout the years. Those side handles are my personal choice for automotive. The handle that this 9227c comes with does not feel intuitively comfortable in my opinion. At first I thought that handle would grow on me after awhile. NOT, it is uncomfortable. I had bought the Makita 4 1/2" grinder at an earlier time from Home Depot, when they run their tool sale, just about giving it away. That side handle works perfectly on the polisher as well.

Every few years I remove the pitch and it still cuts like a dream.  Forrest will also resharpen your blade if it ever needs it and, for my family, they do a great job with that too.
The saw does not have a start safety, so you simply press the trigger to start the saw (no need to press another button first like on some saws...depending on your viewpoint, this feature may be good or bad). The blade brake works to stop the saw within a second or two of releasing the trigger. This is great when you want to set the saw down with the blade already stopped so you don't have to worry about it causing mischief.

But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.

What I've  learned about this router is that you need a second router to do hand held  work for trimming laminate and doing small routing work.

First, get the Router Raizer and the Xtreme Xtension. I cannot stress enough how useful these are. Let me elaborate. First, this is a big router. While it's awesome to have that kind of horsepower in your hands as a plunge router (the first time I used it, to put a bead on a shelf, I assumed something was wrong and it wasn't cutting, because I didn't feel or hear anything as it routed my profile), you're probably going to want to mount it in a table and leave it there.
7532	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for anything I want to do with wood projects.  Like the features and handy fold up for storage.  Removable plank is adjustable for clamping most lumber.  Very stable and nice adjustments - have had no issues with this portable bench.
4791	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to go with the Mr. Nozzle 115-DB kit and it works great.  I mean, it's just a hose, but it's not flimsy and doesn't collapse like the cheapie that came with my Craftsman wall mounted vac.  Now with the 15 footer that came in the Mr. Nozzle 115-DB kit, and this 12 footer, I can roam around 27 ft. of my garage sucking up anything in my path, and I don't notice a bit of drop in suction at 27 ft. vs. 15 ft.  I love the convenience of my wall mounted vac and 27 ft. of hose.  I'm giving my "lug-along" ShopVac to my brother-in-law.

Now do I get the V28 combo kit a year before I really need it or do I just content myself with some completely gratuitous M12 toys and hold out for an M28 line that may or may not appear next fall? Or do I just buy a freakin' 15 amp super sawzall and put out an ad on Craigslist to come destroy !@#$ for people for the cost of new blades and high-risk emergency medical insurance?
  The UPS people did their usual guerilla routine with the package.  So even though Delta packs this guard very well using both wood and cardboard, UPS still destroyed it.

-It bends air, which, I believe, most straight pipes can't do.
If I want more pressure, I can use a bar clamp (takes up more room) or a c-clamp (takes two hands) but these quick-grips are quick and light weight.  Also, the plastic is less likely to ding a sharpened tool than a metal c-clamp.
1838	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.

3107	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I put a Laguna 1412 bandsaw on this base which weighs 258 pounds, under the stand's rated weight.  When the stand is raised the metal corner pieces flex quite a bit before lifting the corners.  This causes the rubber feet to only lift a small amount off the floor, and in my case one foot still rubs.
When using the supplied base, the adjustment mechanism requires turning the aluminum-encased motor housing inside a huge aluminum screw in the base. (Few engineers would design with aluminum sliding on aluminum, particularly when the surfaces can't be lubricated.) Operation is rough and awkward, particularly under a router table. There's nothing to keep dust out of the adjustment mechanism, so the aluminum screw can collect grit, and under extreme conditions can jam. A router lift circumvents all these problems.
2219	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The bendable portion of the light is great especial when you bounce the light off the ceiling / wall. I have the LED bulb in mine and it works a treat.
2503	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this 3/8 inch drill to replace my favorite Hitachi that finally gave up after 20 years. I expect that this Dewalt should last as long. By the way, it is a VSR drill even though that designation is not always evident in the advertising. This Dewalt is solid as a rock and quite powerful for a 3/8 inch drill. The trigger action is smooth and offers full control. I do have two complaints about this drill. First, it is poorly balanced. With it's large chuck and metal housing the weight is shifted way forward and will fatigue you quickly if you are holding it horizontally such as to shoot screws into wallboard for example. Second, the drill should be more compact than it is. If you put in a standard spade bit, the combined length of drill and bit is too long to conveniently drill holes in a 16 inch stud bay.
5757	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I sharpen quite a few drill bits when working with decorative iron.  As such, I drill a lot of holes and dull quite a few drill bits.  When sharpening slows down, it is time to replace the wheel and this replacement is great to have on hand when the need arises.

There is sometimes a little blow-out on the cross-cuts, but any dado set will do that. Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge.

2004	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this router 4 months ago and am very happy with it.  Plenty of power and simple depth of cut adjustment make it a joy to use.  It uses two wrenches to change a bit which I prefer to a spindle lock.  I have owned three Porter Cable routers in the past 20 years and they have all been excellent.

Well, I've had this drill for 8 years now, and I still love it. It still looks and performs as new. The speed range is perfect for woodworking. The only thing missing is one of Milwaukee's famous hard cases. The drill itself is easy enough to put on a shelf, but the damned side handle will not stay put if you put it down somewhere; it rolls all over the place. Milwaukee would do well to make the flared guard area hexagonal or something that wouldn't be so prone to rolling.

7372	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have been using the Rousseau 2600 PortaMax Jr. Stand for over a month now, I'm very satisfied with its durability.  It has transformed my Makita 2703 table saw from something that I had regretted ever buying to something I now enjoy using. The Rousseau 2600 provided a rip fence that's dependable plus a large table top surface. The reason for only 4 stars is the rip fence is approximately 2" high and doesn't have any holes to mount anything to it.
Made from aluminum and weighs 40% less than cast-iron counterparts

I found slipping the assembly over the arbor threads to be a little bit of a challenge due to the thickness of the components.  There is no 'slop' in the 5/8" arbor hole so you need to have room to slide them on square with the arbor threads.

I made some checkerboards where the dark wood was 1/16" higher than the light wood.  This would have meant a lot of sanding with the random orbit sander.  It's the kind of task you always see the drum sanders doing in their advertisements.  The 362VS can take one of those boards down to dead flat in about 1 minute.  It is amazing... not just the speed of the task, but the quality of the product.

I use it to help me be able to see the stitches I'm making better when I'm working in places where the light leaves a lot to be desired. It has two light settings, which allows me to get the supplemental light I need.  And it's flexible, so I can position it to reach exactly where I need it.  Plus, because of flexible neck, it folds up rather small and fits nicely in my embroidery bag.  I've only had it for about a month, and don't use it every day, so I can't comment on how long it will last, but I'm happy for now!  Also, the seller contacted me about a month after the purchase to make sure I was happy, which I thought was nice.  They really seem to care that I'm a happy customer.

2343	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The guide comes with two sets of rods to accommodate various DeWalt routers' rod spacings and rod diameters. The thicker rods could not insert into the guide. Obviously this was not checked at the factory. The brass screws that hold the rods in the guide would not retract enough to give clearance for the rods. Rendering the guide useless. Quality Control in china is understood by Chinese workers as the perfect state in which the product is off their work station. This is according to my brother-in-law who worked in China for Microsoft builds.

2880	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this drill to get into places that my large Milwaukee right angle drill can not fit into while installing an electrical system and plumbing in what was previously an Amish farm house.  This is an excellent tool.  It is quiet and powerful.  The variable speed is a great safety factor, when boring large holes with auger style drill bits in wood that just might contain nails you don't want to be drilling full speed when the inevitable nail is found, that can be very hard on the wrist.
7490	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I installed the Prazi on my Skil "77M" and used it to cut 11 7/8" engineered floor joists to length and square. It worked beautifully! No other "beam cutter" saw could cut that wide of joist in a single pass without cutting from the side of the joist. It also allows me to stack about 5 to 6 2x rafters up and cut the bird's mouth cuts all at once. I did find that the saw causes tear-out at the top of the cut, so it is a good idea to use a utility knife to scribe a line just outside the limits of the cut to prevent that.
6659	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this machine.  I can't believe I wasted so many years with a hacksaw.  Only had it a week, but so far it has worked perfectly on unistrut, rebar, steel tube, heavy-wall aluminum tube, and steel plate.  I'm totally satisfied with it.

I didn't like that thought because my basic philosophy is to buy quality, buy it once, and know I can do the work required for decades to come. This router has proven up to the task from day one, exceeding all expectations along the way.  Yes, 3 1/4 hp is actually necessary and I know I bought the right tool for the job today and in the days to come.
You should keep the barrel dumped fairly often, as this will increase efficency.  The only thing better would be a cyclone system, but they are more costly and take up more space.  This unit is also quite portable, which is handy in a one-hose shop.

4571	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a Ridgid 14" bandsaw, which is the new orange/black version, not the older grey saw. I've been looking for a decent rip fence with reasonable price for a while. After some reseach, it seems that this fence would fit the Ridgid saw with some slight modification. And since Amazonwarehouse was offering an unbeliveable deal, I snatched one quickly.
8634	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I initially bought this to cut backerboard for some custom tile work that required a lot of odd cement board cuts.  It works great for that and makes quick work of it.  I also use it for making rough cuts in tile for toilet holes (that won't be seen) and other masonry applications.  It will cut metal, plastic, wood and all sorts of stuff.  I use it in a Dewalt 4-1/2 grinder and it is my do-all blade.  I have all sorts of grinding/cutoff blades but if this is on the grinder and I need to do a quick cut on a piece of metal, it will do.  I recommend this product to many people.

Do-able. Just be cool.
7734	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Shame on B&D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench. AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate. I own an original and expected good quality. Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER? Cheap metal, rough cut in places, thin cheap wood compared to the originals, an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt (wow!) and handles that adjust as one. I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood, the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely. Doesn't sound good to me. I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk. I will be buying a "jawhorse" and sell this new workmate on craigslist.

The  weight is right, the handle angle is right, plenty of power, and it works  every time.  I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY-special Black and  Decker and the difference was a revelation (of course, any  professional-quality tool would have been a revelation).
-  The unit uses three AAA batteries.  I haven't had to change mine yet, so those three batteries should last you a long time.  Other reviewers have mentioned they got over 40 hours of use from a set of three batteries, and I see no reason to doubt that, especially if you only have to use one LED when reading, as I do, rather than two.

Obviously, if you don't care about precision, that's not a big problem. There are legitimate reasons why some users do not need this thing. Construction carpenters must work FAST and don't need extremely fine tolerances. Some hobbyists are just making decks, lawn furniture or garage shelves. They do not need or care about precision within one-thousandth of an inch.

Woodcraft offered the Porter Cable 892 kit as a replacement for this one. The guy said that Porter Cable quit making these. But this one is half the price and actually meant to be used one handed.

I like the option of using one LED or two, depending on the level of light I need at the time. I do find myself re-positioning it from the left page to the right, but it's a quick and easy adjustment. The flexible arm is long enough to put the light right where I want it and stays in position well. I'm on my third book with it and have no regrets.
Things are different for the DIY'er like myself who has 2 Paslode projects a year.

553	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As I was about to take a family vacation with small children where we'd be sharing a hotel room, I needed a book light that would allow me to stay up and read after they'd fallen asleep, without disturbing them.  After researching for a few hours, the Xtra Flex LED Book Light seemed to have the features I wanted and had the best overall reviewer ratings, so I ordered one.  Now that I've used it, below are my pro's and con's for this unit.
9199	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What more could you ask for in an air hose?!  Handles (at least) 200 lbs of pressure.  Maybe more?!  Don't know, I haven't tried it higher than that yet.  I do use these hoses for nearly EVERYTHING though.  They certainly stand up to the elements.

6399	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I like this clamp but picture is misleading. If you purchase this expect newer version model 1964742, not the model picture which is 546ZR. Really disappointed ordered twice and receive incorrect clamp had to return.

3260	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Replace the stock bulb with LORIZA Dimmable E17 LED Bulb Reflector R14 Light 4w available on Amazon. You will be the happiest person on the planet for doing so. You'll get 10 times more light without the heat build up produced by the stock bulb. Note that it can be a little tricky getting the replacement bulb in as it's a very tight fit. Helps if you grow your finger nails for a few weeks first. This lamp overall is very likely best used with drill presses, miter saws and the like.
3287	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this stand kit for use with my Delta 14" bandsaw.  It came quickly, and was packaged quite well.  The instructions were clear and easy to understand (a rarity, these days).  I followed them to measure and cut four oak pieces to make the base fit my saw.  I had no issues with assembly.  In use, it works quite well.  It holds the saw in place firmly when stationary, and with a quick flip of the foot pedal, transforms into a maneuverable base that handles the saws heft with ease.  I plan to get another for my drill press.

1) The cast iron table is nice (large and smooth)
5276	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Exactly what it says it is. Only problem when I went to put it into a 4 inch collector it would not fit. The inside diameter on my piece is 3.5 inch diameter. If I cut my section out it would destroy the integrity so I will leave it be. Good and sturdy.
Being machined instead of stamped, the edges of the ruler on this square are squared off, not rounded, which makes for more accurate use.  My old square wasn't square (doing the mark/flip/mark test) but this one is and it's what I use now to square things on my machines.  It's really nice to finally know that the square I'm using is actually 100% totally square, which I can't say about the imported machinist square or the cheap combination square I have.

2774	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	In the last 3 months I've tried 4 different scroll saws, 5 counting this one. All the others were ridiculously difficult to install and change blades. And they all had big holes in the table with a plastic insert with big slots in them making it difficult to make square edged cuts and cutting out small parts. I don't know why they put all those plastic guards around the lower arm.
As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.  I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up  and Milwaukee definetly does.
4562	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very handy Saw dust catcher. Minimizes a lot of Saw dust when cutting. I do not know why it is not included with the Saw in the first place. It is a must have.
1729	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am not a big fan of using an edge guide but there are times when nothing else will work so I bought the Porter Cable guide based on past experience I have had with PC products. I was impressed with the quality of the guide. It is heavy duty and will last many years. I bought it to use with a 1 3/4 PC router which I have 3 of them. Easy to install and all necessary parts were included. I also have a Makita router so I thought I would see if it would fit that one also. Much to my surprise it fit the Makita perfect. Yes I would buy it again but because of the quality of the guide I will never need to buy one again.
Bottom line - great buy.
7173	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It holds stuff, and its inexpensive compared to others.  The belt clip seems to be of good quality.
What a difference!  Now I look forward to the application chore - it's more of a break than a chore now - just a gentle squeeze and go as fast as you can while keeping your bead straight.  I think this is the best application for this tool - lot's of volume and in a location where air hoses are easily available.  The squeeze gun is still probably better for jobs that are less accessible and where precise control is important.
3.  The fences are high and easily adjustable.
Tgis was a well thought out light, and very easy to use with the on/off button placed on the light head. Very happy with this!
Indestructible & you can purchase replacement insert rings IF you need to. These will support any size or weight router including the 3 1/2 hp big boys. All of Rousseau products are high quality!
Anyone that says it is not the best, probably has not tried the others and is not a professional.
4386	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Recieved my guide kit in good order. All the pieces and parts were included in the case. I have only used it once on a hope chest I constructed. Everything seems to fit and work ok. Havent had a lot of experience with this type of routing so I don't have a lot to compare to. The machining of the parts seems fine and what little I have done went very well. So far I am very satisfied with Freud products.
6468	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought a pair of these in 6" and a pair of B&Ms in 12".  These are much higher quality.  I've found dozens of uses.  How did I live without these?
Handheld, they are beasts, but that's true of all 15A (15 Ampere) routers. They weigh about 13 pounds, and using them is almost like weight training. That may be what you need in a production environment, where you'll beat the router to heck, but it's overkill for a home shop. For handheld use a 12A handheld router is plenty. The primary application for a 15A router is panel raising with large bits, an operation that should never be performed hand-held. (The Ampere rating is an indication of the power the router can safely deliver on a continuous basis without burning out. It doesn't describe the power the router normally draws, just the peak power it's capable of. With smaller bits, you'll never need the kind of power that a 15A router can deliver.)

9636	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for wood carving.  Good quality. Will use it on hard wood and soft wood in the near future. happy
If you need to cut 4x4s, this isn't the saw for you. But if you need it to break down sheet goods and cut stuff up to 1-1/2" thick, this one is really handy. So far, I haven't missed my 7-1/4" Makita at all.
Not a better value for the dollar anywhere, but not for the girlymon!
4978	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love the power. I chose this over the variable speed 8 amp sander. After using this one, I know that I made the right decision. This is no finish sander. It makes a tough job easy.
9152	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Don't go with a cheaper version.  This is an excellent and very flexible hose.l

This saw is amazing so quite vibration free it was up and running in minutes.
1- Attach a home-made or after-market base-plate to the saw and adjust that to straight edges & guides.

9317	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to organize small tools in the event of an emergency.  After receiving I discovered it makes an excellent camera bag, if you are a camera junkie like me.

5504	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this 4" to 2 1/2" adapter to be able to attach a shop vac to a new band saw that has a 4" outlet.  This adapter is exactly the same size as the outlet, so it won't go inside or outside of the outlet.  I will probably keep it and duct tape it in place as it I can't seem to find one any different.  I know they exist because I got one with the chip collector on my DeWalt planer.
Comfortable to hold, and the replaceable power cable is a great idea.  Not that I've sawed through mine, but I can see how it could happen - and it's nice knowing that a replacement is just a twist/pull away, if the need ever arises.
Packing and Shipping
  Dust Collector works great.  It will hold the dust from 25-30 #20 biscuits without clogging.  Easy to empty with zipper.
1040	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Replacement lamp for my Thermador range hood. Worked fine.

One of the reason's I bought it was the "Made in USA" description in the "more technical details" link...but when I got it, it said "Manufactured in Mexico." This may not matter to others, but it is better to be accurately informed before you buy...also, a case would be a nice addition for such a nice-looking and powerful tool! Good luck to all!
1154	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works as required.  I was happy I could still buy them.
Also, yes the plastic handle is a bit cheesy for a saw with a blade this good. But at least you don't need a screwdriver and the patience of Job to separate the blade from it.
1362	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just needed one for my range oven but I have to buy the whole box. They are excellent.
5492	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I wasted time trying to get one of these. Nothing fit. I recycled an  empty plastic pill container. The neck fit into the opening on the sander. (If it is a little large the plastic threads can be sanded down) I cut a hole in the bottom with a 1 inch spade drill bit and cut 4 radial cuts with a jigsaw (like a sun burst) The end of the vacuum goes in easily.

Very nice, very substantial, quality built.
7272	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are the best and strongest wood or metal working clamps going.  Super easy to adjust and they stay where you place them.
These saws are: 1. sharp; 2. affordable; 3. easy to use (after a short learning curve).
I made some dados that were wider than the maximum stack, requiring multiple passes to get the width.  Even with these dados, the only visible-to-the-naked-eye marks were the light scoring of the outside blades.

2875	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this saw.  It is a little heavy but I know it is well made, you must get the rip fence make straight cuts so easy.  Buy this saw

5198	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say on something so simple other than: Do not skip on this product. If you get the Forrest blade, get this. My blade is great, but sometimes would get a little vibration thing going. This helped settle things down greatly.
6122	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Durable and simple to change bits on .


2876	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is a little high priced, but it is the only one I found that you can actually adjust the blade parallel to the shoe. It works quite well after adjusting the blade to the shoe, it is almost effortless to make your cut straight. I would highly recommend it if you want to make very straight cuts with a guide.
4080	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well I had this saw for 10 years now and I love it.  The flat alum base doesnt scratch the work and the adjustment works well. I've used this saw on a plywood base like a tablesaw and it preformed well. The electric brake continues to work, it's a nice safety feature.  It is a professional quality saw and I would buy this saw again.
The hardened crosscut teeth, while incredibly sharp, aren't very durable. I think I may have hit a staple in a recycled board, and now about half of the teeth on one side of the kerf are broken off. I'm getting a replacement blade because I like using this saw, and from now on I'll be careful to double check for anything that might break the teeth. Still a great saw, just wish the crosscut side was more durable.

On the other hand, the depth of cut is easily adjustable, and like the rest of the unit, very precise.
These are slightly shorter than the originals, making them easier to install.  I bought the pack of 10, which ought to last the rest of my life.
I just used it to cut an angled notch in a piece of 1x3 and it is still, if not like a razor, at least pretty darn sharp. The fact is I have stopped working on the house to write this review, as there is no way I could let this feeling of wonder pass unrecorded.

Wish I had known they made 10" and 11" inch models (the ... page for this item doesn't crosslink those other models).  There were a few times when I wish I had more leverage and the 10" model is only 2 bucks more.

None. I honestly can't think of any!
3178	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this mobile base as I wanted to be able to move my planner around in my workshop.  I had put one of these together a couple of years ago which made the job easier.  I was able to put the base together in about a half hour.  I purchased the 2x2's at a local store and I made sure that the wood was hard word to make the base strong. The project worked out very well and I can move the planner around easily without too much effort.  Glad I read the reviews ahead of time as I was prepared for some of the issues mentioned in the reviews.  Good product, just pay attention to the directions.
7131	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	They did a great job the first time I used them. They did a nice job on two door panels, using pine. Bob Coble
5107	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my 10inch Bosch Contractor Table based on the reviews here.  I wasn't disappointed.  It cuts like a hot knife through butter.  It was well packaged, went on easily.  And as others have mentioned - it's quiet.  Maximize the horsepower of your machine by having the best cutting tool.  It makes a huge difference.  I found this out.  The cost is worth it.  I strongly recommend this blade.  Most projects start with the cutting - keep it quality right from the start.
The Fein sander is an aggressive machine, and at first you might be surprised at how much material it removes in a short time.  There is an adjustment period when switching to this machine from other ROS, but it is a nice thing to adjust to.  Also, I should say that this is a heavy machine, definitely heavier than other ROS I've used.  But it does a beautiful job.  I've used it on grits from 40 up to 400, and it is easy to control and very well balanced.
8633	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Installed a fire pit in the back yard, needed to cut some pavers and retaining wall blocks.  Put this on the angle grinder, and other reviews say it well... cuts like BUTTER.
Item was packed well and shipped promptly.
update after a few months 2 stars: a dust deputy would have been much better, should have saved up. the bucket tips over very easily so the vacuum sucks up the dust. so i need to strap the ducket to vacuum to prevent that. and the bucket cannot be filled more that 3/4, something extra to worry about. bit disappointed
6292	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've never encounted a tool that worked better or easier right out of the box with no experience required to start producing quality work.

Tool as I am.

5187	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	6" plastic gates are a junk.  They crack, leak, and are not fixable.  You can buy metal ones for not much more $, and they are way better.
6738	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you have a wood working project that needs a quick and easy clamp, this is the one. I built a table a while back and bought a 4 pack of these clamps (two mini and two medium). I had to clamp and release multiple boards and it would have been a beating with a pipe or other twist clamp. This did the job quickly and bites down hard. Easy to release and reset. Wish they made longer bars for these clamps.
The kit includes templates for all of the hinges on each door, up to four hinges.  They are mounted to a steel track in a manner that allows them to be adjusted to match the height of the hinges on the existing door frame.  Once you've determined the height of the hinges on a particular door, you tack the template assembly to the edge of the door and rout out all the hinges at the same time.  No need to locate, mount, and rout each hinge individually.

4802	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I installed a new oak floor in my living room , I did not want to try my luck on using a pro drum sander so I decided to use a belt sander even if it took more time to do, . I read the posts on amazon so I decided to purchase this sander I just tried it on a scrap 2x12 and it worked like a charm, I will not hesitate refinishing all the floors in the house with it. This unit is quiet and smooth, It will cut like the devil so theirs no daydreaming while using this sander  UPDATE  using this sander for a while and here are a few modifications I made because the bag is nothing more then a advertisement flag and this  sander is out to eat the cord,,,I rolled the cord in a tight roll and  tie wrapped it down,then I used a sum pump hose in place of the bag, had to build it up with tape and a hose clamp tapped an extension cord to the hose , This modification made dust free sanding without fear of sanding the cord
If you want a really solid base try using steel RHS instead of the wood, it is rock solid with no rocking at all. I will recommend it to anyone who cannot get a base that was fabricated for their machine, as this base essentially is when you are done with the assembly.
673	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've used the CBconcept 12 volt version of these bulbs in my landscape lighting for 3 years and they've been great, so when I installed some 'puck' lights under my cabinets I figured I'd try these. The fit was fine, hard to install in lights while contorted upside down on the counter, but hey...that's why I do yoga. :) Key thing is, don't touch the bulbs with your bare fingers at any time, or they'll burn out in a week. Either use the plastic they come in as a gripper, or use rubbing alcohol to wipe them off.
7751	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very impressed with this kit. It has 10 pieces including hole saws for 7/8", 1-1/8", 1-3/8", 1-3/4", 2", 2-1/2". The blades are sharp and cut fast.

As good as this light is, I do have only 2 minor complaints about the product's design: one is that the monkey figurine feels tacked on, quite literally. While it certainly is cute, the rigid mounting bracket isn't very good. It can fall off easily when handling the light, making it easy to lose. The other issue is that the USB connector feels loose because it lacks the metal sheathe other USB devices commonly have. This jacket allow them to sit snugly inside the port. Without it, depending on the angle of the gooseneck, the center of gravity may affect the connection with the contacts. The only other thing is that the manual could perhaps be more detailed on total charging time and battery life expectancy. Otherwise, a fine and useful light for home or travel. If taking on the road, the monkey should perhaps stay home to avoid loss.

Having highlighted the bad, there are some good points.  Very little, if any, vibration regardless of the speed setting.  It's quiet.  Very sturdy and stable.  The speed and blade tension levers are functional and very easy to use.  Changing blades is very easy...it takes about 5 seconds.
3733	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well, I got it free with a Delta promotion.........
I did not intend  to use it for jointing, but thought I would test it. It comes with edge  jointing components. I was able to produce tight joints suitable for edge  gluing, not just with the grain, but also against the grain, on the ends!  You can only joint boards no larger than 1".

I ended up sending back the dado set and had it replaced with one with a 15mm bore, i also got a refund for the seven reducers i bought. I tried to fit the entire stack on the arbour and it fitted. I had to remove the inside washer and replace it with the outside washer, the nut goes on the outside of the stack. I have yet to use the stack as i have had some problems with my table saw, i wouldn't be surprised if there was some wobble given that the stack is unsupported on the outside apart from the blade nut. A blade stabalizer might be a good buy, i think i might also purchase a set of Veritas slotted shims which are colour coded.

My only complaint is the packaging.  I had to send back the first set because the bits had come loose in the case and had beaten the living heck out of each other.  Freud could do a better job of packaging their bit sets to ensure their safety.  Overall a great set.

The drill is a bit large to handle at times, but is much smaller than the lightest duty 1/2" size drill.  I can drive a #12 X 3 1/2" wood screw into dense pine and it does not even slow it down!  It is well made, does not leak oil, and will probably last for the rest of my life.

Installation was non-complex, bigger hands than mine might have some grief but that goes without saying when working in tight spaces.  All of the original blade guard hardware must be removed. If you already installed and auxiliary out feed table, you may have to loosen a bolt or two and readjust it when you're done. No big deal.

8080	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Starret enjoys an enviable reputation in the machine tool industry. Their creations are in every machinists tool box. Why not bring such precision to woodworking ? True wood changes with the seasons. But if something is worth doing , it's worth doing right. This little tool will help you to do just that. It will measure very precicely down to 64ths of an inch. The markings are clearly visible. Much nicer than anything you will find at your local home center. The square is dead on accurate. It is guaranteed by Starret to thousanths of an inch. Use it to set up all of your cutting machines. If they are squared up with this everything will fit better. Everything will be more precise. Use it to set your router depth. Use it to mark the distance from your router baseplate to the bit for setting straight edges up. The list goes on and on. I feel that I must say one more thing though. Since this one is only 6 inches long , it is much handier to have around than the 12 inch. It also fits very nicely in your tool bags without falling out or poking you in the arm. Highly recommended.
3931	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This router is one of 4 that I own.  It's only 6 months old, but has quickly become my favorite.  It has plenty of power for anything I've asked of it though I use my 3.5 HP table router for big bits.  I mostly use it with a dovetail jig.  The tried and true twist-the-motor depth adjustment is quick and easy.  It's not too top-heavy and tippy like a plunge router.  The D-Handle with trigger switch looks awkward, but works extremely well in practice.  It's not loaded with bells and whistles, but simply works well.

I suggest you put a towel or rug on the floor when setting the U-tube down, to avoid marring it.  Another thing I learned the hard way was that while installing the U-tube, which is quite heavy, you have to keep an eye on it until the screws are tightened.  While looking down at one of the bolts, the top part of the tube decided to swing down and bonked me pretty good on the forehead.  The tube is very heavy, and I was momentarily stunned by the blow, but it served as another reminder to be careful in the shop.
4917	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I wasn't even in the market for a new jigsaw - my old Craftsman worked fine for me.  Sure it vibrated a little, and sure it was a bit slow cutting and hard to control the speed, and sure the cut would waver a little from top to bottom, but it generally got the job done. Then Bosch came out with the rebate and it got me thinking. I had always had been intrigued with the barrel grip design, and I did think I needed more power, so that incentive was enough to push me over the edge and upgrade.

3936	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This router is great for a first or only router because of its versatility. You can buy a plunge base if you need it, but i don't really care for it too much but it is cheaper than a new diecent router. The dhandle is a great feature it gives you alot more contol than just the two knobs found on most routers. 1 1/2 hp is pleanty of power for most applications. The collet i don't mind but use real wrenches,the ones in the kit are cheap and tend to cut your fingers especially if the bit is in there really tight. The 690 series is the most popular router, many other accesories are avalible, which make it even more versitle. If this is your 1st router of your 50th, you have to have one.

3805	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a couple of jigsaws (including a Bosch barrel grip) and these blades are the best I have used.  I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway, and this particular Bosch blade in particular.  I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material.  The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision.  Though the blade is thin, it is surprisingly sturdy (they don't break too easily).

4936	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just got the jig saw and right away was impressed with how well it cut. I've always had the cheap jig saws...since for a jig saw you only need a machine that moves the blade up and down right?....WRONG! You need a blade guide that stabalizes the cutting edge, you need a powerfull machine behind it to provide a consistant speed stroke, you need a balanced machine to avoid fatique and not have the machine vibrate.  Also, the Bosch blades cut like butter thru the wood.  I was able to make repetative 1/8th cuts in pine without the blade wandering and I was holding the wood on the bench only with my hand..hardly any vibration.

BUT, this holder is actually very long, it is too long,... 3 inches long. That longer 3in length means more of a wobble when the chuck spins the drill bit.  There is more loss of control in precise situations when the bit starts 3 inches out from the chuck. After it arrived I tried to find out how I made that mistake. But there is no mention of the length in the description beside the picture or directly below. Hmmmm.
Edit 02/25/2010 One reason my experience was less favorable than others with earlier-dated reports likely is: Previously the plane was assembled/made in England. Now, as mentioned above, the plane is 'assembled in Mexico from international components'. According to several reports elsewhere, this move resulted in a big drop in quality and consistency compared to the English version.

The drill is a powerhouse for its size and I received a very nice "canvas" tool bag with it. I expected a much larger tool remembering the last 1/2 inch drill I owned (30 years ago) and was pleasantly surprised to see how small this one was - the same size as most 1/4 inch drills.

1: Clamp strength: It's impressive! I have pretty strong hands and it's not easy to squeeze it open with one hand. As other reviewers have said, the further it's open, the less clamping pressure is applied. If I was clamping anything over 2" I'd probably just go with standard clamps. Bottom-line, if you clamp these to your finger tips it's very painful.

12/10: Still going. These are over-the-counter halogen pucklights that I keep on a lot.
While I have given  this compressor a 5 star rating, there are some things for the engineers  (and you!) to think about in the next model:  1. The way the regulator is  mounted it is difficult to make a manifold for two hoses without hanging  those pipes out there where they can get knocked off.  Anyone who has  knocked one off before will know that A) everyone in the neighborhood knows  it right away and B) it puts you down for some expensive time.  And C) when  this happens, it often creates an unwanted projectile.  It took me three  street elbows and an hour of figuring to get the quick disconnects in a  safe place. 2. When you pick the unit up with the handle, the unit tilts a  bit.  This means you have to hold it out away from your body a bit more  than the size of the compressor would promise.  All that horsepower weighs  enough to make this more uncomfortable than need be.  We just bent the  handle with a torch to get on the center of gravity.

A warning to first-time users: dado blades are a pain to install, no matter the brand. To really get the widths set correctly you have to make a test cut, take it all apart, play with shims and do it again. Wide widths on underpowered saws have to be done in stages. You will want to do all of your grooves at one time and not switch back and forth. Dado cutting demands good planning and careful set-up.
Some of the previous reviewers warned about not following the assembly instruction that tells you to cut ? inch off the end of the stationary table.  I followed their advice, did not make any cuts, and the table fit perfectly.
5087	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There simply are no better blades on the market today than the Forrest line.  Attributes: incredibly well-balanced, quiet, clean cutting, long lasting, excellent packaging, quick and professional resharpening service.  I stray to another brand occasionally, lured by some review in some woodworking magazine, only to be disappointed.  After trying some new "whiz bang" blade that a magazine reviewer touts, I can put even an older Forrest blade back on my equipment and it cuts better than the new "Johnny-come-lately."  Sure, the Forrest blades are a little more expensive, but in this instance, you do truly get what you pay for... and more.  By the way, try Forrest's stabilizer, too.  It will even further enhance performance, especially with a thin kerf blade.

4281	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This tool is a time saver, no doubt. The settings stay true and the ease of use make it a joy to operate. I can't compare it to any other tool in its catagory but it is suitably powered for production runs and its accuracy leaves the job with a finish that I like. The dust outlet however gets clogged if there is a large chip ejected since there is a bottle neck at the tool end. May be a shop vac would be better than a static dust bag, thankfully the blade cover opens easily with just a few turns of a thumb screw. A good tool to own at a great price. The five stars are for it never going wrong on a single project.

I'm using these in the construction field, more specifically as an electrical contractor.  I haven't used even half of the sizes YET, but I have used them on drywall, wood and metal.  I needed a very specific size hole cut out for an electrical panel enclosure and didn't have a hydraulic hole punch kit.  So I pulled this kit out, found the size and it cut the hole very well without dulling the teeth.  Having all the sizes may save you money and time from having to go out and spend more buying them individually and waste time driving to get one when your on a job and just need one particular size to finish something simple.

I did without for a year but got a pair of the size 04's last month.  What a relief!  I've used them 6 or 7 times in the last month.  Indispensible especially for tapered or uneven surfaces. Holds things TIGHT to each other or another surface.


Bottom line: These are still THE most versatile, easy-to-modify, repairable, strongest, most useful clamps in the industry. Because you can customize the length by buying cheap black or galvanized pipe at your local stores, you can make the same clamp heads do LARGE or small jobs. Making any single tool perform multiple functions is always an economy. You can always get more pipe without having to buy more clamps!
3438	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this because of the deal and dewalt name.  Turns out the item does not operate at a consistent level as far as screw depth.  You may get one or two perfect then a bunch that are not sunk in the dimple.  Bad product.

All in all this is what I would consider a useful and indestructible tool at a great price.
In conclusion, the Workmate 425 is an amazing tool.  I'm less enthustiastic about the smaller versions, and versions with idendity crises like the WM525, but the 425 and older models that look the same are awesome.  And it's a great tool stand.

B) The overall quality was poor. it would be very easy to strip the screws or break the plastic parts that are user installed. Another two parts were broken before I was finished: (1) the flimsy perforated strap that is intended to keep the two screws tightening in parallel was 95% torn and (2) at one point a spring came flying off from somewhere. All of the lateral springs are both there so somewhere there is an unpaired spring. finally, the three leaves of the table top are not co-planer, so it's not a good spot for a glue up.

Rather than jump through their hoops to pick up my repaired heater, I just left it there because I figured it will save me more problems down the road and I really don't want to deal with their bad service anymore. I bought another company's water heater, installed it myself. Didn't require any contractor to install it and the warranty is good. The new water heater readings are in F, not C.  The Supergreen/SioGreen dial adjusting inlet where you have to manually turn wasn't required, my new water heater just worked. Less headache, more hot water. That's all I wanted, and I got it with another manufacturer.

3473	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've been using the clamp on the left side of the DeWalt 8.5" sliding compound miter saw.  I've been cutting a lot of floor boards (laminate/composite) with it over the past week and the clamp helps keep the stock very steady.  There is a quick-release button that drops the clamping screw down very quickly and this can be done with one hand.  However, loosening it with one hand is more difficult.  You can unscrew the clamp one-handed, but releasing the quick release takes two hands.  On the right hand side, the clamp works for straight cuts, but gets in the way of any cuts with the saw swung to the right (the side that goes to steeper angles).
Option one is a minor inconvenience for experienced craftsmen, and it is the least expensive. The disadvantage is we lose some cutting depth when we attach another baseplate to these small saws. That's usually not a problem unless you are dealing with large timbers such as those used in timber framing or massive slab projects. Then, this saw provides a huge advantage. The extra depth of this 8.5 inch saw means it will still cut deeper than a standard 7.5 inch, even with an accessory base-plate. And if we need the full depth ( a 16th shy of 3 inches) then the ability to use and adjust the factory base-plate is a boon. It's easy to do on this and the 364 too!
4869	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought one to try it; I will be buying more. All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit.  Some have criticized the noise level; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics.  If this is a problem for you, cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.

This saw with this blade, works so good i cant never imagine a 100.00 saw working this good, i rarely use my dewalt track saw for ply anymore, and my poor ridgid is collecting dust as well. if you do alot of wood work, this is a difenite saw to have in your inventory, and if you need a blade for it, the tenryu 5 1/2 silence blade works excellent, but comes in a 36.00, rather pricey, but then again it is a tenryu.

1675	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently bought a PC7518 router and was also surprised that it did not come with a 1/4" collet. (Turns out PC does not recommend using 1/4" shanks with the 7518 because of the high HP....so be careful.) No problem I thought as I have a PC690L-RVS in the shop (approx 8-10 yrs old). Well the collets were NOT interchangeable. The new 7518 1/2" collet would not fit on the 690, and neither the 1/4" or 1/2" from the old 690 would fit on the 7518. After reading the reviews here I took a chance that there was a thread change. I am happy to report that the new 1/4" collet fits perfect on the 7518 and I have routed several projects with my old 1/4" bits. Hope this review helps someone else out too.

2269	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just installed this on my Enlon cabinet saw.  Enlon had the best value award from one of the woodworking magazines back in 1994-1995.  I just followed the installation instructions for older Delta Unisaws that are included.  Like others have said though, don't cut anything off the table (the directons tell you to cut off a half inch or more).  I didn't and it fits perfectly flush with the saw table.  I have a Delta Unifence on my Enlon, but if you have the original Enlon fence still, then you will need to cut some of the table off to clear the back fence rail.  Better yet, upgrade the fence first.  I did need the 2 wood supports (30.125" long in my case) but they didn't need to be 2x2 as the directions state.  I just used some scrap that was maybe 1 x 1.5.  I had to drill 4 holes in the cabinet to install the bolts as described in the directions.  I tilted the saw up and stuck a 2x4 under it so I could reach under to stick one of the bolts through from below.  That was about as tough as it got though.  I finished the job in about 2 hours.  By the way, I had previously installed the Delta Unifence (50") and the mobile base on this saw.  Both fit perfectly.  Enlon dimensions seem to be the same as the Unisaw.  Enon later became known as Star.  Now both are defunct I believe.

Again, most planes need this kind of tuneup as they come out of the box.  The only fault I have with this plane is that the rear adjustment screw has a bit too much free play (a sixteenth of an inch) between the adjustment screw collar and the blade adjustment.

It's great being able to move it around, since I have limited space and lots of power tools.  The only complaint is I find it a little wobbly, but it probably won't be a problem.  And the 94 bucks it cost seems a little high, but I'll someday forget how much it cost, right?  I'm definitely glad I bought it.  It lifts the machine and sets it back down very easily, but won't roll over a deep expansion groove in my concrete floor very well.  But I still like it.  Oh, and the saw's great, too!

If you have the Porter Cable vacuum (any model), remove the hose that came with the vacuum and use the converter directly in the vacuum, attaching the hose that came with the kit to the converter.  This is all friction fit, which means you can't pull the vacuum along with you as you move through your work unless you tie the vacuum hose to the vacuum.  This is easily done with a strap running around the vacuum, fastened with Velcro, and a second strap around the hose, with both straps connected.

4271	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Being a woodworking hobiest making a value judgement on a  product is somewhat difficult so take this review for what it's worth. The set came early and in good condition. I was impressed with the quality of the blades and their high polished look.. As I looked through the instructions I found them a little confusing as they are written in tiny print on a sticker afixed to the case and in multiple languages. The case itself is plastic, stury enough but probably the weakest component and does have a higher potential for breakage. The set comes with spacers when added to the stack, make fine adjustments to the size of cuts. Beyond that the setup is pretty simple and straightforward. I made a couple of test cuts on pine, plywood and maple and the blades cut through each like butter and measured accurately. Can't say anything about blade durability but for my purposes I suspect they will last many years. I reccomend them for novice woodworkers. You professionals and experts will have to make up your own minds.
3889	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this model Hitachi 15" miter saw since 1992, it's the best miter saw on the planet.  If you want deadly accuracy then this is the saw you want, why you ask.  Because the housing holding the swing arm in place holds it on both sides, not just one, no play whatsoever.  There's a little viewing window so you can see the location of the cut you're about to make, not some silly little laser that washes out so you don't know exactly where the cut will be.  The swing arm has and up and down adjustment so you can have the blade start practically at the vertical position.  The 15" blade cuts deeper than any other saw.  I've been in the furniture industry/wood working industry for over 40 years and I've seen every saw and type of saw there is, this one is the only miter saw I use, everything else can't hold a candle to this saw.  Waytogo Hitachi for engineering such a terrific saw!  The reason I'm purchasing another one is because my last saw came with the business I sold.

Dont throw that big one away however you'll still need it for angle cuts on your 2bys. I do so few angle cuts I used it once on the two jobs I did. I am just like everyone else I hate to spend the money on tools I already have. After using this smaller saw, I must say if you do any amount of building this is amust have tool. The weight difference is a big factor in the handling of your saw over the length of your job. Old school you bust your butt with everything, if you don't have to , don't!!! TRy IT bro's, you'll love it . I ain't a contractor I am just a homeowner with a huge honey-do list. So, make it easy on yourself and bother the old lady by spending that money.

I then took the insert out.  I checked to make sure the riving knife was exactly the same width as the cut made in the insert by my saw blade and it was.  I then put my factory insert back in the saw.  I returned all the adjustment screws in the Leecraft insert to their original positions so that they did not stick out beyond the edge of the insert either on the side or the bottom.  I then carefully measured the distance from the edge of the insert to the inside edge of the slot cut by my table saw.  I then set my fence at exactly that distance.  I turned the insert upside down and end-for-end and then pushing the insert forward cut from the back end of the insert to the slot I had previously cut when I raised my saw blade.

I was tired of the batteries being dead all the time.  I like the blade on the left because I am right handed and like to see what I am cutting when I am cutting it.  I think this is a perfect saw for small jobs.  It is very lightweight and small unlike the bohemoth 7 1/2 inch circular saws.  The only possible problem is you can pretty much only cut through 2" stock with the 5 1/2 inch blade.  This is however not a problem to me.  It has great power and feels very sturdy.  If I dropped it I know it would be a problem because it would bend out of alignment, but any circular saw would.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking for a light duty compact circular saw.

Still another reviewer said his saw's sole plate was "flimsy and inaccurate".  I don't understand that comment, unless Porter Cable has used different plates.  The sole plate on my saw is very stiff steel, 1/16" thick - rolled at the edges for strength, and is attached to the saw in four places - it doesn't flex and works exactly as expected.
I have historically used the "wood screws" sold at home centers, etc, which generally have a Phillips head and a fairly thick shank.  The problem is you have to drill the right sized pilot hole or the head strips fairly easily when the going gets tough.

9781	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'm on my second set of these. I'd still be on my first set, but the drill bits are soft and bend easily.

I cannot comment much on the dust collection as I do not have a dust collector adapter to connect to this or my sanders. I get by without it.
Update I bought this April 2006, I like it so much I bought the four foot version #T7404 It is awesome, not just me but those i work with all want to use this twin ladder, having steps on only one side is a huge disadvantage!
Fearing the worst, I checked every single bulb and lo & behold, they all worked just fine.
 Label that's supposed to read "DELTA" on top arm was put on upside-down.....Reads sorta "ATLED" in upside-down. Just one of those minor quality-control oversights......
8206	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These clamps have been around for ever. Any good woodworking shop has a pile of them. Get them in pairs at a minimum and get a variety of sizes you won't be sorry. They last a lifetime and more.

My concerns about 16 ounces not being enough mass to drive large nails were alleviated the first time I used this hammer to demolish and re-frame parts of an exterior wall for window and door installation. I found it comfortable to swing and easy to aim given the decrease in mass. It is perfectly balanced.
Be sure that you use this tool to its super potential.  It's price will be a draw back for many home shops but it is still a deluxe tool built for a craftsman in mind.
Cons
4351	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Plan to spend an extended amount of time tuning this plane and sharpening the blade. I am operating on a very limited budget so I had to go with the cheaper route for my planes. I'll have the plane set up nicely when I'm finished with it, but it is a significant amount of work out of the box. The sole wasn't flat, the mouth wasn't square, the bed wasn't flat, the blade.... basically a butter knife, and it did take a good few hours to make it a decent tool. For a plane of this size, it wasn't a huge effort, but it is an effort and it is time spent tuning rather than time spent working wood.
5243	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works good.
3770	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Received in a perfectly clean, brand new package. Three shims had rust spots the size of dimes. Both .020 shims were cupped as if they just came off a roller. This is Freud quality?
Eventually I tossed the instructions and just put it together how it made sense to me. Once I did that it went a lot easier.
575	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I needed a light for reading my Sony eReader Pocket Edition at night before retiring and couldn't find one bright enough. This certainly does the trick. It clips on the eReader cover snugly without slipping and doesn't make an indentation. The flexible arm is amazing and it provides a powerful light for such a little item. For anyone trying to find a light for their Sony e-Reader, this is the one for you. Believe me - I've tried quite a few before finding this little gem. It is fantastic!
3784	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Milwaukee makes the best hand drills, PERIOD!  It's miles better than others in its range.  It's the only one in this price range with a metal gearbox.  I had a Makita that was made by screwing 2 plastic pieces together, and eventually, the grease seeps thru and discolors the enclosure.  This Milwaukee includes a side handle which is much more helpful than you would imagine.  The drill is front-heavy and has a lot of torque, so you'll be happy you've got it.  It also includes an extra set of brushes (which you will probably never wear out) that are user-changeable.  The keyless chuck can be tightened at least as thoroughly as a keyed one.  The hinged trigger is very nice and allows precise control of the speed.  This drill was designed for industry and being constantly beaten up, I'm sure it will outlast me. I use it every weekend in the wood shop and have never found it lacking in any way. (And I'm picky!) Also, it's got grooves in the top sides for your thumb and index finger so you can get your palm right behind the chuck to push straight towards the work and squeeze the trigger with your pinky and ring fingers.  If you're deciding on whether this is worth the $30 or $40 extra over an equivalent DeWalt or Makita, it is. The only way I'd consider getting a drill other than this one is if you drill nothing but large holes.  If you plan on using it as a screwdriver, forget it. It's too fast by the time you get enough torque up.  You'll twist off and strip screw heads, gaurunteed.  You're best bet is to get a good cordless (DeWalt or Makita here) for that and keep this as your main drill.  I cannot recommend this drill highly enough.
9281	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Looked all over and this was by far the best deal I could find on a real rubber hose for my compressor. It is quite solid feeling, and very flexible. It is plenty long, and seems like it is built to last. If you want a good hose that is not cheap plastic, this is the one I would recommend without hesitation. Very satisfied.
I don't see a lot of point in dwelling on what's good about this router, others have covered that, it is the standard, it is powerful, and it does not mind being run while hanging from the ceiling by its' toes (I'm told that they built it to run well upside down because they wanted to get good market penetration in Australia - but that could just be a rumor).
8903	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product is excellent. It fits my table saw without too much bother, only had to make a Dado insert for it. Care has to be taken as standard blade guard does not fit with the Dado cutter fitted. I will have to make a special guard from Perspex to make it safe to operate.
4283	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the greatest tools I have ever used, and I have used ALOT of tools.  Very easy to use, and so fast you don't even feel like you did work, lol!  If you do any amount of joining, this is well worth getting.  The makita is a great brand and very well made.  I love this thing!!
- I think the flexible portion will fail eventually, it feels like it will wear itself out
8689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	For the price, it's nice.  You do get excellent quality but it's a serious pain to install.  The chippers have to be setup properly and it's trial and error to get exact cuts using washers to fine tune it.  The more expensive set from Freud includes a dial to setup the width -- incredibly easy.  However, for the price, it's great quality.

Really just wanted the EVS motor from the router for my router table. Did not work to well in table as switch works only intermitately in table because of dust. Switch worked fine after blown out w/ compressed air. Milwaukee 5625-20 production router now resides underneath my benchdog router table. Well made router that gets a one staer demotion for faulty switch. Now motor gets used in my fixed base/plunge base 1617 kit when I need variable speed.
4915	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The title says it all. I know my review is a minority opinion with this unit but I was very disappointed. I purchased this sharpener a couple months ago on Amazon. I tried to sharpen my joiner blades for hours with unusable/poor results.
3465	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you are a trim carpenter and you cut/miter crown molding a lot like the way I do, this is a must have. You never have to worry about rolling the trim up or down the fence just right again. Plus, it does a great job holding longer pieces in place on the saw while you are trying to measure and mark them.

7528	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like using these so much a own two of them.  They are very useful.  I also use the orange swivel pegs that help holding things that have different angles.  The swivel pegs come 4 in a pack.  One thing is that they are pretty portable and pretty easy to put together.  You have to had a few part to main frame and thats about it.  They give a list of tools needed and once we guys finally read the directions it goes very quickly.  Just take it for what it is.  If you have a professional carpenter rate it I'm sure they'ed say it sucks but  for the average homeowner,  do it all people I think it's great.

2363	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have to stick my nose in here because something happened that never happened before.  I am not using a skill 77 any more, or even the Porter Cable 743.  In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader  just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has.  The first  guy to review this saw (conceptbydesign) hit the nail on the head when he  said this saw was tough.  There are many well-designed features on this saw  but the best thing is the power and toughness.
These cut fantastic
6541	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this because it is shown in the Incra videos. It's used to hold stock against the moving trolly and into the drill bit. For that it works, though I still haven't mastered the coordination technique to get both jaws to close simultaneously and parallel to one another. Also, I have several other styles of clamps that I believe will work just as well.
5082	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product
I think Amazon.coms direct price is better than this.
The only negative that I can think of is that it requires a 9 volt battery. It could be a little more convenient if it took AA batteries.
As others have reported, the package is rather large and somewhat heavy, partly because of the wood used to crate the unit.  Mine arrived in excellent condition but was missing three flat washers for 3/8" bolts.
8338	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Made in the U.S.A. the most important thing to remember. Bought one for my son and grandson. It is a great hammer, good balance to weight.

UPDATE 3: I got the Incra TS-LS fence system.  It IS possible to install that fence system, and then install the Delta Uniguard Saw Blade Guard.  Basically the brackets for the blade guard mount to bottom of the TS-LS real rail.  It is straightforward and reliable to have them working together,  and I'm glad to have them both on my saw working together.  The Incra TS-LS is a dream fence system for my table saw.

8410	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Listen up.  This is a working man's tool. That's the design.  Mine came a bit dinged, like say metal parts had contacted it. Like say...it was at the bottom of a bin of these same hammers. If you bought this to work, you'll ding it up yourself. I will and I barely work manual labor anymore.  I used to use one of these till I lost it. The balance was perfect and it is in fact one piece of solid steel. So no part can wobble at all.  If I swing any hammer, I pick this if I have choices.

The blades are sharp and they should face down in the case vs up that would help against injury.
3108	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought Skil's little 5 1/2" three years ago. I have NOT used my 7 1/4" since!  This feather weight lets you work all day long without fatique. I have so much more control with this saw, its a miracle.  A  couple of cautions though.  Its kind of hard to find replacement blades for  it.  B&D's Piranha blade is very good, if you can find one in the 5  1/2" size.  Also, its a left hand setup.  The motor hangs off to the  right.  If you rip using a nailed down 3/4" straight edge where the  motor rides above it (most righties do,) the maximum depth of cut is fairly  shallow (about 1")  Other than these two limitations, best buck and a  quarter I've ever spent on a woodworking tool.
1465	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought these to replace the cheap, short lasting bulbs that came with my Malibu pathway outdoor landscape lights from the orange big box home retailer. These bulbs are no only very inexpensive, but very effective in lasting longer than the name bran, if you can call them that. I wish the shipping was a bit cheaper but overall for $5 you can't beat the price!
The DeWalt advertised as half off got my attention.  There's a lot of discussion about the new models being less than the previous versions.  I can tell you that it is very efficient.  It works like a charm.  The speed control is much better on a DeWalt.
Somewhat complained that it is tricky to set adjustable stops to the same length. I cannot see why this would be an issue. You just take a piece of scrap wood of the desired width (within the range allowed by the code) and use it as a spacer to set up stops.  This is by far more accurate way of doing it than any marking or ruler.
209	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Not brite enuf. Clamp is too small and too weak. REturned.
- can turn on 1 or 2 LED's
2249	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	One of the best flashlights available. If you use DeWalt 18 Volt tools this is worth adding to your tool collection. Will easily sit on a flat surface or hang from a pipe and is very adjustable.

2493	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great quality.  Nice addition to my DW788.
Also, the brake bushings on the saw are very soft and the blade runs too long after you let off the trigger. This can make jobs with many short cuts (such as stair stringers) a bit more tedious as you have to wait for the blade to stop before making your next cut. Under most circumstances it's not a problem all, just when making lots of quick cuts in a row.
2510	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this Scroll Saw.  Very quiet and super powerful.  I clamp it to a work table with C Clamps and it never moves.  With the 20" Throat it clears most all of my projects with ease.  Most all of my tools over the last 10 years have all been yellow and have no complaints whatsoever.
Cons:
- relatively long, flexible arm

130	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great for nighttime reading
The only thing I didn't love was the wood handle. It is a little short and then end caps are quite loose. I just bought a 1" oak dowel and made my own end caps. Works like a charm!
And as an additional positive, though I doubt many will encounter the situation, it has so far resisted being chewed by a pair of pigmy goats which like to follow me and browse when I am working outdoors!
8472	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Nice product.  I had to upgrade my table saw to one that I could use this in.  If your planning on doing dado's and the like, you will need to make a zero clearance insert for your table saw, if not, you will get some chipping on the edges of your cut. Other than that, very easy to use, nice compact storage, and with the shims included you can cut to the sizes of most common plywood that is commercially available now.  Definitely a add on to your table saw that will pay for itself just in time savings, let alone not having to putty up something.  I admit that I'm not like a cabinet making company, but I am a serious hobbyist and this works well.
3812	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Does the job.  I think the chisels could be better.  Some of the mortises i've cut were a little ragged.  But, i would buy it again.
244	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	just great
3693	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head, amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.
3797	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought these because the Freud six inch dado stack I bought came with only three 1/16" (.0625) shims.  I needed more shims to increase the range of stacks I could create.  It appeared these would allow me that capability.
9845	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Because they are so readily available, I  have used dozens and dozens of these.  Every single time the sleeve breaks within the first few days of use. It soon falls off and gets lost on the job site.
8268	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I used this blade on a recent roofing job. To cut a groove in a chimney, while installing some flashing. This blade turns brick into a cloud of red dust leaving a very precise and clean cut. I was more than pleased with the results. Two thumbs up on this blade. From my experience it goes through brick like a hungry monster. I do recommend this blade highly. Now get out there and cut some bricks.
8657	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you need a blade that can handle cutting precision cuts cleanly in granite this is the one to buy.

9574	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great service and product was exactly as described.
Concerning the length of the bolts used to hold metal to wood, they are just the right length in the kit I received.  When installed there are only about 2 threads protruding beyond the steel corner braces. Once the nuts are tightened so the braces are tight against the wood frame members, the end of the screw is flush with the end of the nut and there is full thread engagement.

Well after buying all the supplies (extra batt., fuel cells, non-mar tip, and nails) I found this to be a little expensive somewhere around [$], but after using it many times with quick set-up I found this tool very useful. There is no lugging compressors around, by the way, to purchase a framing nailer and a decent compressor you are pretty close in price to this product. The nailer really works well it will drive nails with ease, would definitely recommend for the Do-it-yourselfer!

2841	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I am normally a Craftsman tool man but lost my last Craftsman Circular Saw to a shop fire.  This is my first DeWalt Circular Saw and I am impressed.  It has everything my Craftsman had except a lazer guide.  It is considerably lighter than my Craftsman.  It also has an extra long cord which helps me.  I recommend this DeWalt Circular Saw to anyone needing a good dependable saw and will probably be buying more DeWalt products in the near future.  JJF
Highly reccomended.


6393	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	so yes its a little pricey, but as I described in a post for the 16"  blade, these are amazing.  I bought a couple to try them out on the recommendation of a fellow wood worker and I was blown away with how good a cut they leave. I would recommend it to any one that wants a nice clean straight cut (straight due to little to no warp, can't fix your technique, sry).  Very good blades!

3188	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Just got this one for home and have already used put it to good use.  So  far, I've drilled holes ranging from 0.025" up to 1" and have  loved the ease by which you can make adjustments.  Table height is easy to  set (wish they'd move that locking lever a little away from the shaft so  that big hands can rotate it).  Belts are easy to change around.  Drill  depth is easy to set (although the scale is confusing at first).  Smooth  feed with good drawback.  Nice startup, and a quiet hum.  The thing was  also easy to put together.  The chuck is not the best (not fully  concentric or something, doesn't grab drill bits as tight as it should) and  I will probably replace it at some point.  And like all drill  presses,(listen up Human Interface guys at Delta), this one lacks a place  to handily keep the chuck key!!!  Once out of the box, I immediately  drilled a hole in the plastic cover and affixed a make-shift chuck-key  holder.  Also...the safety key (for the power switch) should have a home  on the device (which it does not).  Regardless....a fine, fine tool, well  worth the money!
3422	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this all the time & couldn't be without it.  Like the adjustable depth set, yes, but use it for much mote than drywall.
I thought the adjustable handle was going to go unused, until the first time I made an adjustment and realized you can really tailor your hand position to the cut.

I did have some misgivings recently when I noticed that there is a set of Board Buddies you can get from Amazon(Tool Crib?) directly and not pay shipping.  For some reason I did not notice the W1104's.  I ordered the G2370's on Amazon but through Grizzly.  I had to pay for shipping(like you I don't like paying shipping), but these Board Buddies are aluminum and are very sturdy.  If you look at the reviews for the W1104's you'll see a review that sorta laments the fact that the W1104's are cast iron.  He states that cast iron is more prone to cracks.  I noticed one other difference from the photo of the W1104's.  They don't have a long(4") eyelet screw.  The G2370 have this screw and it allows more height adjustment for the rollers.  Maybe the W1104's have this but I did not see it in the photo.

3873	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I got these blades to use in a "Rockwell Bladerunner" saw.  They fit nice, cut good, and are a decent price.  They don't seem to be able to handle quite as tight of radius as the blade that came with the Rockwell for scrolling without the piece vibrating.  These blades are a little shorter than the blades that came with the Bladerunner but work fine for my needs.  If you are wanting to cut a thicker piece of wood you might want to get a slightly longer blade.
2858	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration, like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.

3666	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have never had a sander like this before, but when I was refinishing a desk for a lady , I decided to get one. I compared several other units and decided on this one. I love the variable speed and with a course grit belt, it made light work of the 3 coats of paint I had to remove. it is very maneuverable  and the dust catcher works great also.  I used a light grit belt and some light hand sanding  for the polyurethane finish and the lady's words were: "you turned my old desk into a thing of beauty"  .
and puts more stress on your wrist and elbow.  Estwing makes a superb hammer.  Durable, precisely machined

3627	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I purchase my sander, I debated between the 3 x 21 and the 4 x 24.  Looking back, I'm glad I purchased the smaller of the two.  For a much lower price, I got a belt sander that handles all of my rough sanding  needs.  The 7 amp motor is extreemly strong and handles quick material  removal with ease.  I like the swiveling dust bag and the cord on the top  of the handle.  This keeps the bag away from your hands and the cord up off  of the work surface and away from the sanding belt.  Overall, I got even  more for my money that I originally thought.

That doesn't bother me, but if you are sensitive to it, having a different light effect with the shorter bulbs might be something to consider. The solution: change all bulbs at once, as for the price of 1.5 bulb you get 10.

Well, I've had this model now for about five years, and mine has the following issues:

Only complaint is that it some times gets in the way and when it is full it drags.
7523	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Been wanting one like this for years, finally pulled the trigger. Nicely balanced. The handle is a little slick, but I suppose that will change with time.


Assembly was very quick and easy. I added rubber feet to the base of the saw as it will sit on a workbench not on its own stand. Have a small shop, every thing has to be mobile. I also purchased a foot switch as everyone I talked with about scroll saws seems to feel it is a necessary safety feature. With a combination of the rubber feet and a rubber pad, the machine doesn't move at all, even on speed 8. Vibration is very minimal, and luckily the saw is at the perfect heighth when sitting on the bench. The dust blower works adequately, but I am going to rig a vacuum source up somehow. Changing blades is a bit of a challenge at first, but I think with time and practice it will become much easier. I also have rigged a swing arm lamp to use with the saw, old tired eyes ya know, need all the help I can get.
It's funny how you have to rave about a tool that does what it is supposed to do, and do it well. Their is so much junk out there. Did you ever check your level, but putting it on a surface, then turn it around end to end to see if the bubble shows the same reading on the same surface. You will be shocked; 80 percent of them are off. Even the bubble on this Starrett tool is dead on.

I have a lamp that I love but the bulbs were $6. each at Walmart and Lowes and they discontinued them.  I was going to throw out the lamp (that I love) because of the cost and now they weren't available anymore.  I went on Amazon and found them 10 bulbs for $10.  As long as they are available at this price I will be able to keep my lamp.

3251	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've owned one of these for over 20 years.  I love the left sided blade, it's light weight, very easy to handle and will perform about 90% of what a bigger heavier circular saw will do.  I'm almost temped to buy a second one as a backup but my saw shows no signs of failing me.
I use this with LARGE 3" molding-bits for HOURS, and it never chatters, bogs or bakes. I have had to replace the brushes once in four years. (PC PART # N031634) They cost $14 dollars and are available from any real PC tool dealer, though I have seen them cheaper on Ebay.

I was only missing a plastic washer for the fence but I called Benchdog and they shipped one quickly. I have a Hitachi M12VC router attached to it using the pre-drilled holes.
2126	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works great, all metal parts. The only downside is they do not lock in for transportation. I need to keep a bungee cord handy. A clip would be nice to have seeing this is for a portable table saw.

I had hoped to avoid drilling holes into my fence for this installation, but as far as I could tell, I was going to have to do just that. There is a sad lack of installation information on these things. Google couldn't even find any helpful info.  I ended up calling my dad for help and together we figured it all out and no holes were put into my fence at all. (Thank you, Dad).
My 5 year old son will most likely trust it too a few decades from now.

3594	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Before I bought my magnum hole shooter I had gone through several skil and crapsman drills and saws. When I got the milwaukee My tool buying changed forever. No more junk ever! That was many moons ago and it just keeps on going and going. I will never sell my old magnum drill. They have a new one out with even more power and torque and a nice rubber grip which I'll probably buy but I'm still keeping my magnum. It runs as smooth today as it did 15 years ago. I've done everything with it from drilling wood and steel to Mixing concrete. It won't drill concrete but it will sure mix it like no other. It also mixes drywall mud very well. As others have said it is very powerful and it will hurt you if you are not careful. I got thrown off a ladder once when the bit caught and I wasn't going to let go. I thought it was going to rip my hand off. but it didn't . After that I always treated it with more respect. This unit comes with a lifetime warranty . No other manufacturer that I know of stands behind their tools like milwaukee. It's no wonder when you consider their incredible track record.
251	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very bright.
The CRUCIAL FACT is: This thing is an inexpensive improvement to any decent American-style table saw. It helps produce cleaner cuts and promote longer blade-wear, thereby saving you money and improving your quality of work.
9384	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a good quality hose. Reasonably priced.  It suits my need.  I would repurchase if needed.  I'd recommend to others.
5317	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So I buy these for a slightly different reason than they are supposed to be intended for.
4242	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very nice addition to recreate the standard Jet bandsaw into something much more versatile, and price was great.  Amazon shipped really quickly even with Supersaver.  The instructions are generic for all the bandsaws in this stable (wood, metal, meat, Jet, Powermatic, etc.) and some of the instructions do not apply to the Jet.  Luckily Jet tech support is pretty easy to get on the phone.  Don't bother with the blade that comes in the kit--have your own on hand.  I followed Lonnie Bird's recommendations in The Bandsaw Book and have been delighted.
Mine did come with a replacement bulb in the head of the head and the original lasted several years with a lot of use. I did purchase another pair of bulbs as replacements for the flashlight as I use it quite a bit to work around the home. I love that the batteries are rechargeable and the flashlight is bright. I rated it as a 5 star item.
Immediately after doing that, I put a set of these blades on.
6294	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Worth every penny and I saved tons of them when I went Bessey crazy last year (Amazon had huge sales).  I picked up two 48" cabinet door sets, several large ones including 50", 60" and a bunch of additional 24" ones.
3811	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	For starters, no combination of the collars would fit snugly on my drill press; I had to use some pipe clamp to fill in the gap.  This was really surprising and frustrating (there are so MANY included collars, I really thought one would fit!).

5548	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love it. It takes about 2 hours to unpack, arrange the many hardware packets, read the instructions to put together, but it was fun. The quality is great and is solidly built. I mounted my Porter Cable 690 into the many plate holes. It took about 15 minutes tweaking the plate's 8 leveling screws to get the totally flush finish.
9389	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent



- The fences are very nice - they are tall, very sturdy and stable, and adjust/remove with only one wing-bolt.
8385	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love them !!!
This is variable speed, with a dial, so all you do is dial in the speed and pull the trigger switch.  The speed dial is conveniently located at thumb-tip above the trigger.
Functionality is pretty good.  It is very nice to have the heavy battery as its base to set it on ground and bend the flex-neck to face the light into exactly right position.  Not too much range of motion to move light head too far from over base before it falls over, though.  Light and lens is simple cheap-flashlight style, nothing precision or fancy, but it does put out a decently-even spread of light in a circular pattern without dark spots.  No beam pattern adjustability.
Highly recommended.

5627	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I got my Bench Dog router table and I was super excited.  I've heard how great BD is and that's why I decided on their product.  First off when assembling I found that the metal piece that was used to support the router plate was manufactured wrong.  They forgot to insert the bolts that allowed the leveling screws to go into the metal piece.  After calling the company and sending them pictures I finally convinced them to send me a new piece.  After getting this new piece I spent 30 minutes leveling the router plate.  I COULD NOT level it no matter how many times I tried.  I called them after putting a straight edge and I found the plastic (or acrylic) router plate was warped.  After talking to the phone support they thought it was the plastic router plate.  They sent me another one in the mail.  This was covered in dirt as if it was used before.  I could clean it up but even after installing it and spending at least 1 hour trying to level this darn plate it still won't level.  I made a youtube video showing them my problem and how it tilts.  They blame the screws not being level.  Regardless how I adjust the bolts there is no way to get the rock out of my table.  They refuse to help me any more which is REALLY disappointing.  Stay away.  I don't know how one company can give such horrible support and so many defective parts.  I sent them a video even showing them what I did and they still refuse to fix it.  BUYER BEWARE!!!

7778	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have all sorts of hammers in my tool collection, and this one is my favorite all around hammer.  I use if for framing, general construction, deck building, etc.  It is balanced perfectly and there is virtually no vibration through the handle, so your hands and forearms don't fatique as quickly.  Recommend this to anyone looking for one of the best hammers available.
1817	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I haven't used this tool, okay?  I have needed to remove multiple layers of paint from window sills and a garage door before, and am looking to do so soon again for a different house.

8481	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Cut through granite like butter when used with my angle grinder. I would recommend.
5118	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've been using this blade as well as it's thin kerf model for about 3 years now.  I also have a couple of Tenryu Gold Medal blades that I've been using for the same amount of time.  The Forrest rips a bit faster, while the Tenryu cuts quieter and smoother, especially on cross cuts.  Both brands are high quality, but for my most demanding, finest projects, the Tenryu is my go to blade.  An added benefit is that it's a bit cheaper than the Forrest.  If you already have a Forrest Woodworker II or are looking for an excellent table saw blade, I'd seriously consider the Tenryu Gold Medal.  It might just make you set aside the Forrest for those less demanding jobs.
4679	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Didn't quite fit but it is a different brand so kinda my fault
2617	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Love the product from the quality of design and construction, however it's somewhat pricey for it's expected to do. If you have some time you can build a router guide easily (search youtube or other sites) with a combination of scrap wood and parts available at your local hardware store. Have to admit that to some degree this Dewalt guide adds convenience and precision to your work, but then wood working isn't super precise. I know folks who had taken pride of building their own guides but I took the easy route!! Only reason dropped a star is due to the price, but otherwise it's a well machined product. I'm using this on DW618B3 and fits them well. Since this guide doesn't fit the Dewalt router case, for this price you'd think Dewalt should throw in a carry bag.
This vise is very well constructed. The rapid release nut is an absolute must. I went with the 7" instead of bigger for two reasons.

5419	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Since Drill Doctor discontinued the Classic models this is one of the few remaining parts that is available.  They also have a 100 grit wheel and a left handed chuck, but that's it.  They have a trade-up deal to the new models but if your classic model does the job for you -why not just keep it?
2990	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought this light along with their fluorescent lamp (which died after 2 months).  this light works as expected.  Very happy with it.
If your the kind of person who coddles to the very best, and will be using it for your own projects, no matter how many you undertake, and are not dependent on biscuit cutting for a living, then this unit is for you. The only reservation is the height adjustment. Don't misunderstand me. You can get an exact height adjustment with this unit. A perfect setting as a matter of fact. You may spend an extra 20 seconds getting it there. If you cut a 100 different biscuits a day, that 20 seconds could add up.
2754	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It works very well. I use in on the DeWalt 611 compact router, but it fits many other models, and not just DeWalt. The fine adjustment is very helpful in obtaining exact placement of the router bit. A hose adapter is needed for the larger shop vacs, but it fits my small vac.  Dust collection is so-so, getting much of it, but missing too much. Maybe a larger vac would catch more dust.
  I've cut stock from 1/8" to 2" pine to hard maple and it handled them all with easy. Having the VS control on top is great it makes speed changing very easy. Blade changing is fast and easy and requires no tools in most cases I can change blades in under 5 sec. Being able to tilt the table left and right is a big plus I do a lot of cutting with the table set left side down at angles at steep as 45 when I'm making bowls and candy dishes and I have found that the markes for the different angles are right on. The table is dead flat and very smooth making cutting easy. There is little no no vibration with the DW788 in fact I can stand a nickle on edge on the table with the saw running at full speed this really help when your working on the saw for an hour or more at a time.
* Nice accessories. A decent-looking flute bit, 1/4" collet adapter, and a very straightforward/easy-to-use edge guide. No wrench with mine. Didn't need it.
6801	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These tools are well made and straight as can be. I do however have one complaint about them. They lack the ability to adjust the spring tension on the clamping mechanism. For the most part this is not an issue unless, you want to clamp thin plywood or any other thin materials. It will cause some material to buckle under the clamp pressure ( I learned the hard way). Besides that this is a great tool but, without the ability to adjust the clamping pressure it has a few limitations. As far as an edge guide or straight edge it's solid as a rock. Now get out there and clamp away.

These clamps are versatile and sturdy.
When I couldn't get it adjusted satisfactorily I put a straight edge on the insert lengthwise and held it up to the sky sure enough I see daylight at each end.

I have used another popular brand of biscuit joiner and find the Makita top notch.  I like it because it's not overly complicated at all and the chips really fly as opposed to clogging up in the chute.  The fence is substantial, easy to adjust / lock and it's very straight forward to use.  I don't want to have to "refresh my memory" for its use on those few occasions when I need biscuits.  If for some reason  I needed another, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Makita for this tool.

However, once I got it assembled, it was obviously mis-aligned.  The upper and lower guide bearings were off by over an inch - much to far to be usable.  So, I called JET technical service to help me - thinking they would just send me a new one.  The JET technician told me to "knock the pins out with a hammer."  Wha?  The pins are mounted in cast iron with no through holes.  He assures me it will work, so I try.  As you can imagine, all I ended up with was mushroomed pins.  So I call the technical service line again.  The second guy tells me that most of these riser blocks (90% according to him) have this problem, and the instructions were supposed to include how to remove these pins.  He tells me to pull he pins out with pliers.
7162	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A little "pricey" but well worth it!  No other saw blade on the market can compete with Forrest.  It blows Freud away.  Quiet, no vibration, flat & true and your cuts look like they were sanded with 200 grit sandpaper.  And that's just the product.  Before buying this blade I had questions about the kerf width so I called Forrest.  It was after hours I didn't expect an answer, but Mr. Forrest himself answered the phone.  I was blown away that he answers his own phone; try to get the president of Freud on the phone.  He and I spoke for a good 15-20 minutes.  Mr. Forrest personally told me if for any reason I didn't like HIS blade he would buy it back from me no questions asked.  He also told me in all his years in business he has never had to buy back a blade.  It say's a lot when someone stands behind their product like that.  Simply the best... Bar none!
If you are looking for a impact driver to for 3/4 bolts then this is not for you.  If you need a reliable cordless screwdriver with enough strength to get the job done with out snapping the heads off your screws and bolts then this is what you want....
7828	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an absolute classic hammer and for good reason.  Large "sweet spot" makes it easy to drive nails from odd positions.  One piece means it will last forever.  Some don't like the slick handle but I love it, it doesn't get caught in my hammer holder on my belt.
3302	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago.
7833	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great product, but it weighs almost 35 lbs. For me and I think for most people, the small one, which weighs 20 lbs, is more practical.
Excellent blade....
**UPDATE: 03/14/2017***

6312	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table.  You get what you pay for.  No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard.  The fence adjustment is LOUSY.  One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design.  Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other.  The lightweight construction (cheap) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru...be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use.  The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky.  The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.
7576	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Best hammer i ever used!
 You will not get the hammer fatigue nearly as quickly using an Estwing
5227	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	does the job
I don't believe I have ever had two seemingly similar tools like this that were so different in actual use.  This thing is heavy, which is actually a benefit when sanding horizontally.  The tool does the work, you just need to guide it.

The Shop-Vac Universal Tool Adapter 90687 is useful for converting the hose to Shop-Vac.  It is 2 1/2 inch ID on one end with a 1 inch, 1 1/4 inch, 1 1/2 inch, and 2 inch OD on the other (or 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 ID also available in the inlet).  Thus a Shop-Vac hose can plug into the 90687 and the 90687 can plug into the Porter Cable adapter (if the 90687 is cut to its shortest length).  Or the hose in this kit can be plugged directly onto the 1 1/2 inch step of the 90687.  The 90687 cannot be plugged directly into the sander, by the way, but it can be plugged into the 1-inch dust port on the Porter Cable belt sander, although the result is unwieldy.  It can be cut down, however, to work as a transition between the Porter Cable Vacuum standard hose and the Porter Cable belt sander.  This is a vast improvement over the dust collection bag that comes with the sander.
9402	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This little gizmo saves me time when drilling various sized holes.  Well made.
7540	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Seems kind of flimsy, the belts that clamp are made of plastic and seem like they would break if too much force was applied. When opening or closing, it's difficult to get it in position, the metal binds and I have to stop and move each side by hand to get them in position.  I wouldn't buy this again.

7437	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	About 4 months ago I purchased the Bessey 30 piece clamp set and while they are good for clamping down things,ect. they are not made for gluing up large cabinet sides,ect. I was at Menards and purchased 6 of these Jorgensen 50 3/4" pipe clamps because after doing a lot of reading and reviews these might be a couple dollars more than the Chinese knok-offs, but now I know why. (My Chinese knock-offs were sold on ebay---they are junk!)These clamps are surpurb at gluing up stock, ect. After purchasing the 6 at Menards(because they were on sale for 8.99 each), the very next week I purchased six more from Amazon.com at 9.99 each with free shipping and no tax! I now have a total of 12 five ft. clamps and would not trade them for the world! These things are great but I would suggest either making a pad or purchasing the pads tor the insides of your clamps to protect you wood as they will mar up sides of glued lumber with enough pressure.
The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.

The light delivered to me has the smaller footprint (for lithium batteries), though my toolset still is based on NiCd batteries and chargers. That was not a problem as it still fits nicely on the NiCd battery... matter of fact, I think that the bigger NiCd battery probably gives this light a much more stable base than a smaller battery would.  Does make it a bit heavy to carry around though, so this light stays in the shop and does not hit the trail with us.

2856	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this drill about a year ago in anticipation of a yearly construction project I do for a student group. During this project, my drill got banged up, had paint poured on it, and was abused  and dropped from scaffolding, without ever quitting. Its major job was the (seemingly endless) drilling of 1" holes using old, blunt, overused spade bits. Despite the poor condition of the bits attached, my drill never slowed down, and the handle let me power through studs. Where others were getting wrist pain with their cordless drills, and having to change batteries, or re-tighten their keyless chucks, i just kept going. The chuck is  SOLID, and lets you really clamp down on bits, and the metal housing for the drill's gearbox makes this thing practically indestructible. I even used this thing to drive several 3" deck screws and it wasn't that hard to maneuver, (though I don't think i'd want to be working overhead with this drill unless i was really in a pinch)
6655	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this two years ago.  I actually have two of them.  Part of my purchase was based on positive feedback from the postings below.

So, is there a problem with this kit?  I am not certain, but this is the second of these kits I have purchased.  The first kit had a shroud that failed.  That said, it took a long time to do it.  I was looking to see if I could figure out when I bought the first kit, but I think it was 15 or 20 years ago.  There was a life to the shroud.  The plastic turned brittle and soft and it disintegrated into chunks.  At the same time, both the hook and loop pad and the PSA pad disintegrated in the same way, along with the foam pad in the storage case.  All were stored in the metal case that came with the Porter Cable Random Orbit Sander.  I can determine nothing unusual about the environment where the sander was stored:  no chemical fumes and normal variations of temperature 50 to 100 degrees F.  So, unless there is some incompatibility between the plastics of these parts, there is a life to all of them.

Overall, a great set... but with a slightly different grind on the outside blades, you could have a flat-bottomed dado, and that would make this a 5-star set.
The replacement arrived a few days later. Thank you Amazon for shipping the replacement before receiving my return.  This time, my measurement of the spindle TIR was less than 0.0005", so I figured the first one was just a bad apple.  The 1/2" collet that came with the router was no better than the first one, with TIR's measuring up to 0.012".

The adapter is perhaps the most complicated to figure out.  The small end is 1 1/2 inch OD or 1 3/8 inch ID.  The large end is 2 1/4 inch OD and 2 1/16 inch ID.  There are no instructions to tell you how to use this, only how to install the shroud on the sander.

4602	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I guess I am one of the oldest users of the Board Buddies around. I originally mounted them on my old Makita 10" table saw over 20 years ago. As for the installation instructions they were pretty vague and apparently still are. I had to drill holes in the fence and add wood to make the fence thick enough for the installation. Even though the installation is a pain in the ass the safety factor makes them a great investment. I have really pushed the old saw beyond it's intended use and never worried about kickback. They're that good. When adjusted properly the boards being cut simply are held against the table as the wheels rotate and guide the wood in the outward direction eliminating kickback. I will be moving my original pair to my newer Porter Cable table saw.

7773	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	First, I got this at a deep discount, so am writing a review in context of the price that most pay. So lets start by saying that the instructions are crap. They have useless drawings and even have errors in the text. (mislabeled parts-top block vs. front block) Again, I had to giggle since there are only a dozen parts to put together,so it should be a cinch, right? Well, my friend and I were laughing at first and then later we were just plain annoyed at why this should be so difficult. My friend is a process engineer and writes complex instruction manuals for a living. he could not believe that any quality control was asserted during the writing of the manual!

Mine did come with a replacement bulb in the head of the head and the original lasted several years with a lot of use.  I did purchase another pair of bulbs as replacements for the flashlight as I use it quite a bit to work around the home.  I love that the batteries are rechargeable and the flashlight is bright. I rated it as a 5 star item.

I am very happy that this set includes a 3/32" chipper.  Cutting dados to fit 'standard' plywood thicknesses is much easier.  I also like having perfectly sized steel spacers in increments of 0.004".  Much better than using paper or plastic shims.  The first thing I did was to mark the thickness on each shim and chipper with a sharpie. I can be a bit dyslexic at times, so I also marked the 2 outside blades with an L and R.  Makes it much quicker to set up a stack.
3183	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I replaced the bulbs in the Dewalt 18v flexible neck light, I found that there is provision for storing a spare bulb. This 2 pack works well to provide a replacement and store the second bulb.

7362	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Over all I am well pleased with my purchase.
Lights are bright in one direction but one would have to twist the rope to find the direction that will focus the light application.  Maybe more lights would make it brighter or better led's I don't know.
The locating pins on the jig are for setting the jig position when mortising the Jamb.  If you remember that you will not have any trouble using the jig, really very simple.
8173	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my second Incra measuring device.  They are very accurate, but you must have a .5mm mechanical lead pencil.  Some other pens that say they are "ultra fine" are probably still too thick.  Also they are quite thin metal so take care of it to prevent it from being damaged.
It should be noted that the hose and adapter from the original kit still looks and performs great, but I now use them on a belt sander, so things work out.  It is almost as expensive, by the way, to purchase just the shroud from the parts store as to purchase this kit.  It would be great if Amazon started just supplying the shroud, as the price would become reasonable and it is the part that takes all of the abuse.

So just buy it. What are you reading this for?
The cap iron may need a little lapping at the front bottom to fit smoothly against the plane iron.  The blade comes with a serviceable factory edge but I honed mine nonetheless.  Check the blade for flatness and lap the back if necessary.  The bottom of the plane should be checked for flat and the sides for square before you commit to using this on your finer projects.

6712	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'm actually buying a replacement battery (after 4 years of use), but wanted to add a quick comment that this has been a favorite tool of mine. I put together computers, screw network eqpt. into equipment racks and occasionnaly use it to torque wood screws into pine 2x4's and occasional drilling into sheet metal as well as other light tasks. It travels well and has good battery life and surprising torque for a 2.4v device. I'm presuming no one buying this will be delusional enough to think they're goingto drive tapcons into concrete with this thing, but for "light duty" this is a gem. I used to buy craftsman and black&decker, but both are a mere shadow of their old selves, most notoriously, B&D is now simply a marketing firm for lowest bidder import junk tools.

6229	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This is THE recip saw, from the inventors of the tool, look at all the reviews on here. So why have I burnt 2 up in a year, and I'm just a weekend warrior? While it was working, it was sweet: cuts well (a comment about orbital action, I was told by support that it only takes effect with the pressure of being pushed into the cut, but I didn't notice any difference in cutting speed), toolless blade change, toolless shoe adjustment, anti-vibrating thingy, detachable power cord (by the way, this is standard Milwaukee, I have a right angle drill and a grinder from them, makes it easy to replace if you ever cut through it, I wish more tool makers would do this) and it just feels nice in your hands. What I've got now is the blade doesn't move at all and it makes a loud whirrr sound, I think it's the clutch (someone, somewhere told me that it has this to protect the gears, frankly I don't think you could possibly hurt the gears, but on my dime to ship is a clutch cheaper for their service dept. to replace?). Another possible cuplrit is the orbital action, for this reason you might consider the 10amp from Milwaukee which doesn't have this 'feature', one less thing to break.  Since this has happened to me twice (the first time it was right out of the box, so I figured I got a lemon) I came here to shop for a new saw and decided to see if this has happened to anybody else, but I guess not (how could this be? I was only making plunge cuts into solid logs...) Well I'm off to shop for a new saw.

And I want to use a 1/4" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.

This is one of several Freud dado sets.  Less expensive sets than this one use chippers that use two pairs of cutters rather than four, and that may result in less smooth cuts.  The next step up (SD608) uses a device that offers an additional width -- 7/32" -- and uses an adjustable insert to eliminate the need for shims and reduce the amount of shuffling of chippers and that you need to do to change widths.  But unless you need to change widths frequently during each session, this set (SD508) is an excellent choice.  It will definitely give you a good range of widths and clean, accurate cuts.

I actually prefer it to my circular saw for this purpose, as it's easier to follow a measurement straight across. Compared to a regular crosscut saw, I estimate this cuts two or three times faster. The pull cut has a good controllable feel to it. I would be hesitant to use it on something like melamine, but it should work a treat for hard- and softwood lumber, ply, osb, mdf, and things of that nature. The blade is rather flexible, the teeth are exceptionally sharp and the plastic handle feels sturdy enough. Definitely a good value for the price.

I used to use one of these till I lost it. The balance was perfect and it is in fact one piece of solid steel. So no part can wobble at all.  If I swing any hammer, I pick this if I have choices.
Some of the reviews complain about the black grease on the vise. I just put on some disposable latex gloves. They got a little dirty, but saved my hands. It also helps ensure that you don't end up with any metal burrs in your skin.
Just an FYI that the numbering used for the Jorgensen DIY kits does not directly correspond to the size of the pre-made clamps.
But this is a very useful light which can be used in many, many ways.  I think that, because it's so useful, one is tempted to use it just a little bit beyond its ability to balance itself.  With that caveat, highly recommended.

7534	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I really want to like this hammer, but the head is ground such that the head isn't really round, the angles are all clearly rushed, and the leather handle discs are off-kilter. Maybe most of them are up to high quality standards, but the one I got isn't. It's still serviceable, but won't be an heirloom like the old ones are.
9882	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this for my wife, who makes jewelry.  She loved the lamp, but after less than 3 years, the pivot at the bottom of the lower arm broke.  It's not repairable, and I can't find replacement parts.  So now I have to spend another $60-$100 for a more durable lamp.  $20 per year for a lamp seems excessive.

7343	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are my favorite clamps! 3/4 is better than 1/2" because teh 3/4 pipe doesn't bend AND the 3/4" jaws are much better guided on the pipe so is less likely to bow the boards being clamped. The multi-disc pipe gripper works every time and lasts for many years. The Sears style pipe clamp feet tend to slip on the pipe so I have to hold them against the pipe while tightening. I often use a pipe coupling to extend my pipe for the wide boards I clamp.

I use it as an area light, bouncing off light-colored walls to light up an entire room (and it is a little dim for this).  I still carry a flashlight as a backup and I'd recommend the same to anyone using it at night, since you may knock it over, plywood may fall on it, et cetera.  It can be used for task lighting.  I suspect that the other Dewalt 18V flashlight might be better for that, though.

5590	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This router works well in my router table, but it is not very easy to use freehand or with jigs.  For use in the table it requires the accessory adjuster, and the wrench could be both longer, bent at an angle, and somewhat better made.  The power is great, and the variable speed system lends itself to use as a table router.  For hand held use I prefer the Porter Cable 691, which is top quality, has better balance and has available far more accessories than any other router.

Brief overview:

3632	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The bars are a little flimsy. When you are routing close to the edge, it works fine. However when you extend it, not very stable.
 As for doing inside cuts, no problem. One of the other saws I tried had this big clear plastic guard thing over the end of the upper arm and blade clamp. There was no way to get a blade up through a work piece to do inside cuts. With the Dewalt all I have to do is loosen the clamp off of the blade and I can raise the arm a couple inches leaving plenty of room to line a work piece up with the blade then lower the arm and clamp the blade in place. The only thing needed is a small block to hold the arm up while getting the blade through the work piece.
These combination squares are great for taking a measurement in a difficult to get to area. You simply drop it into the area, slide the ruler out until it stops, then lock it into the base with the knob, then bring the square out, and check your measurement. No more having to dive your head under something, while you contort your body to be able to see the measurement.

However, if you think you're going to unpack this from the box and be a pro without having used this style just put the saw back before you get hurt. It takes some practice, you're going to have to get used to the way it cuts. Glad I purchased, should serve well as a versatile tool.

Picked these up to help with the constant relocation of electrical stuff, moving boxes, and similar.
A small table is more useful than I would have thought.  I mean most of the time you're only routing smaller boards, rails, stiles, etc. These sizes are quite manageable on a small table, and I find myself using this little table more and more.

These cut faster (but not fast), and with less effort than other blades, with nice clean edges.. on my cheap skill jig saw!  Turned it into a new tool.  Even handled the bamboo along with subfloor no problem when I had to trim out some HVAC vent work.  no cheap made in china junk here- I could loose myself while looking at the design of how the blades are cut.. good work Bosch!
8094	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is probably the most advanced tool of this kind currently available on the market. The tool which I got in Feb of 2014 is labeled as "The Stair Wizard Pro Line II", it is made by DNB Tools in California (not sure how the name "Wheaton tools" came into play in the tool title) and yes, it is a "made in U.S.A." tool. It is made of a significantly darker wood than shown in the image (likely stained to a darker shade). Design-wise, it is exactly the same tool as LJ-3052 tread layout jig (you can Google its manual to learn how the tool works). It is made of hardwood, which comes both with its advantages and disadvantages. The great advantages are that it would not scratch your new treads and risers and that it is light. The disadvantage is that you have to be careful with this tool because it is easier to break than a metal or a plastic tool. I cannot help saying that we so much got used to plastic and industrial metal that it feels unusual and even slightly weird to work with a tool crafted from fine wood. You don't get anything like this in our "made in China" daily world.

- Router mounting:  The router base is screwed securely to the table, not to a separate plate.  The holes are obviously spaced for a Porter-Cable router...I use an old PC 690 router.  There are a number of different inside diameter metal rings (like overgrown washers) that fit into the circular hole in the table...you pick the ring that best fits the bit that you're using.  The top of the rings, though, is slightly below the surface of the table without any way to adjust them.  That's not much of a problem with a long board, but try cutting an accurate tendon when the height of the table changes around the cutter.

That being said, this is my favorite bit.  I use it almost daily.  Good magnet, holds bits in strong.  I swap tips often, and this is the right amount of strength magnet you would want. not so strong you struggle to get it out.

4982	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Milwaukee Right Angle Drill 3107-6 applies allot of torque to spaces you otherwise would have trouble reaching with a regular drill.  It is ideal for drilling holes between studs for electric, cabling or plumbing. The unit is basically their 7 amp variable speed D handle drill featuring triple gear reduction with a Right Angle Drive (RAD) unit attached that can be set in either low gear at 355rpm or high gear at750rpm.  The D handle drill without the RAD will achieve 500 RPM.  Changing chuck speed from high to low or visa-versa requires removing the chuck, reversing the RAD unit and then replacing the chuck on the other side.  This is fairly easy but it takes about 2-4 minutes and requires a couple of tools that are provided.  The Right Angle Drive (RAD) can be easily swiveled 360 degrees providing versatility to meet any drilling angle.

I have experienced many different types of scroll saws in school settings and home shop settings.  For the money, this is one of the easiest to set up and use I have ever seen.  They give almost no trouble at all and are rather vibration free if the right type of blade is used with the right type of wood.  Experience is the best teacher in this regard.  It is the smoothest running saw I have ever worked with and works well with young wood workers.  There may be equals on the market, but I have seen nothing better for the money.  I would definitely buy one again.

- For cutting short pieces of stock, neither 32-inch table extension is needed.  Otherwise, all you have to do is unscrew a T handle bolt to lift an extension in place, align its height against the saw's bed by eye, and tighten the handle.  Takes about 10 seconds per side.  The excellent extensions have cross bracing to provide multiple points of support for varying lengths of work.  For really long pieces, I also use a separate work stand, not attached to the Trojan.

As a test I would hold the probe against conduit or metal ducting to make sure it is reading properly (needle @ 10, pegged to right), then move the probe connector to be sure that the connection is not intermittent. Also don't leave it on, or put it in a box where it can get turned on, it will chew through a 9V battery in a couple days no problem. A disapointment, even at this price...
5119	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've tried a wide variety of blades on my table saw, and by far this blade cuts the smoothest and easiest of any other blade I've used.  I'm going to upgrade all of my shops cutting blades to Forrest as money permits.  I paid twice as much for this blade as I my last Freud, but the quality of cut is five times better.

3391	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I looked at several competitive products and chose this one.  This is a very good tool.  It is easy to handle as it is light, yet powerful, and the trigger is large.  These features give you good control esp with larger screws.  I have driven up to 3 inch screws with ease.  The nosecone takes some practice to adjust, but once you figure it out, it performs very nicely.  My only complaint is that the instructions provided are kind of sparse and you end up figuring out how to use the tool by yourself.  Not a big issue, however, as the tool is very simple.
Some reviewers didn't detect much improvement with this thing. It's likely they don't know how to detect the improvement, how to measure for it or that their machines just aren't capable of delivering high precision.

982	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Totally unsatisfactory.  The wire connector pins are slightly larger than the fixture would accommodate comfortably and had to be forced in.  the bulbs did not last more than a few months in my outside fixtures.
- Some structural pieces are made of plastic and intended to accept threaded metal bolt.  Strip easily as others have noted.
It can take plenty of abuse but if the abuse is the result of you being careless or forgetful, it may abuse you back eventually. There's enough stories of people getting clobbered by this thing out there that I pretty much use the handle for all but the lightest work with it and I keep my head clear in case of spinout.
I only had one little problem -- and I believe it is either my misunderstanding something or a problem with the Powermatic extension table -- not a problem with this base: The feet that came with the table saw extension table were not tall enough to reach down to the mobile base's angle irons, even when the feet were unscrewed completely from the legs. Seems pretty odd to me, as that means they were probably not tall enough for use without the mobile base, either... But the problem was very easily solved by cutting a piece of scrap wood and laying it down across the mobile base extension's depth, which then added enough height for the feet to make contact.

I don't think its the voltage, however, because I have about the same failure rate on each circuit. The only good thing is these are dirt cheap. The original bulbs that came with the lights went out just as often, so I can't say that these are any better/worse than those. Not sure if they were high quality to start with.

Care was taken to make sure the arbor was correct size.
Another benefit of a stand with tires that stay on the ground: you can then roll the opened stand to a different location.  E.g., #1 - store the stand/saw set-up in a nearby secure location for the duration of a job.  Then when starting work, roll the stand/saw where it's most convenient.  E.g. #2 - if the stand isn't exactly where you want it, roll it there, without folding it up.  Stands like the HTC or Delta 50-155 are unwieldy to move once they are opened, especially if you're alone.

The Mag 77 is the smoothest and comfortable saw among the three.  If this is your first saw beware the torque on start up, it will turn the saw in your hand a little, once you're used to it its not a big deal though.  The weight of the saw will also help keep your cuts straight.
As to the dust bag, the sawdust does tend to plug the chute between the blade and the dust bag. It takes a lot of cuts for it to clog, but if you take the dust bag off and clean the chute, the first time you see shavings coming out the front of the joiner, it is very easy to clean out. If you take the dust bag off and attach a shop vac to the joiner, there is no problems with the chute clogging.

2878	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I researched (too much) be fore buying this saw. Was considering the top ranked Milwaukee also. Ultimately, this saw has better adjust-ability, and is the only saw where you can adjust the shoe plate to parallel with the blade. I do furniture building and need a precise saw. Unlike some models, it has an extra long and square-edged plate for following straight edge guides. I found out that even USA based DeWalt recently switched to making their tools in China. Milwaukee is actually Chinese owned. With its aluminium base, this saw is best for furniture work I think. DeWalt has Nylon and Manganese base plates for more durable use cases.

  (...) These Bessey's are hassle free and reliable. The cheap clamps are made with a square tube the clamp rides along. Consequently they take a great deal of pressure without showing any signs of bending. The limitation to them is that they only have a 1 3/4" throat depth, whereas the Bessey's have 3 1/2".

I have never experienced the bar "bowing" like other clamp bars tend to do.  With a reasonable pricetag, I think these are  some of the better all-around clamps on the market.
Perfect treads & risers, first time, every time.  The only downside I can see is the rubber edge guides, if you're scoring with a utility knife & not marking with a pencil (which gives a more accurate line) it's easy to nick the rubber.  But I get it, with metal edges I could see it getting trapped on a convex stair.  So take the good with the bad, I guess.  Best one I've used by far.

When all is done, the table folds up nice and neat. Folding or unfolding it takes a little getting used to, and you have to watch your fingers so they don't get pinched, but overall its easy once you get the hang of it. As an apartment dweller with limited space for storage, I found the fact that I could easily fold and store the Workmate to be its key feature. And now, even though I don't have a garage, I have an handy table on which to do work other than the dining room table.
4197	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I managed to get it put on by myself with no problems and everything fit well with one exception. The actually riser block didn't sit completely flush with the bottom half of the saw. It still tightened down securely and hasn't shown any rocking yet, but it is something I am going to have to keep an eye on since it rocked quite a bit before tightening the nut down. Other than that all the parts are quality goods and fit on perfectly. The saw is up and running, milling green hardwood logs better than ever even without a motor upgrade.

7567	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Milwaukee ought to be ashamed of itself! That fact that this essential accessory for a circular saw is not included with the saw is bad enough, but then to be gouged $25 (plus shipping) for fifty cent piece of steel is outrageous. Adding injury to insult is the fact this guide is poorly constructed. As others mention, you will need to do some filing to get it to fit the saw. Why is it that the manufacturers of far cheaper saws manage to include a rip guide? That fits smoothly into the saw.

As noted by some other reviewers, this saw makes a lot of dust even with the dust bag attached.  I borrowed a vaccuum adaptor from my hand planer and now attach my shop-vac to the mitre saw.  Still some dust but that is what I expect when I am sawing through wood!
  Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong, unless you hold the side handle. If the bit stops abruptly, this drill could damage your wrist. Even if you are strong, Be carefull.

6209	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This item, for it's price, was a big disappointment. For me the issue was not finding a suitable trashcan. (Found one at my local home improvement warehouse). My issue was the total lack of design consideration as far as vacuum leaks were concerned.  The basic principal of this thing, I guess, was just to drop this thing on a trashcan stick two hoses IN the holes on the lid and just hope all the air leaks would not drop the efficiency of the system to the point that it would still move some dust.

It does seem bright enough for me to read by, so I'll keep it and hope it doesn't have all the problems others have had with the two light model.
Also the reduced shank after the threads allows the top piece to be pulled up extremely tightly without having had to drill a clearance hole through it.

5658	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used this on my saw blades and cutters for about five years now. Not only does it improve the cut, but prevents buildup of pitch and resin on the blade surface. I spray it on the blade surface before and sometimes during use. I don't bother to wipe off any excess, it doesn't affect the cut. This stuff is especially helpful on the small bandsaw blades (3/16), I use for cutting out bandsaw box's, I can definitly tell the difference in the tight radius cuts. I also use it extensively on my Freud thin kerf saw blades, it seems to help the blades run cooler and I get less "burning" in the hardwoods I typically use. This is a real good product and I would recommend it to everyone who values their expensive cutting edges.

The one main drawback, and it isn't terrible with the 16 oz Estwings, is the pinging when striking a nail. It is still there some, but not enough at all to dissuade me from using it often.

I find it to pull on the pages and I find myself adjusting it somewhat regularly as I read. I think this light is best suited for larger, thicker, heavier books.
So far the joiner has performed to my expectations.  The fence has been accurate and easy to adjust, the blade depth is very simple to change and the performance has been excellent.  The dust collection is decent considering the amount of chips this thing produces.
The book light is well-made and has a rugged casing.

The adjustments are all evident and handy to reach.  I made the tool ready for the cut in a snap.  Placed the tool where I wanted the cut and "bam" with ease the cut came out exactly where I wanted it.  I think the price and quality and ease of use makes this a five star winner!

2144	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love it , love it , love it. DeWalt really thought this one through. Form the smooth belt drive to the cam lock table. I can not find fault with this saw. It has absolutely the largest capacity of any SCM saw on the market.  It is the only one with such a huge fence to support your  material. If you  need to bevel cut , just turn the knob , and it slides out of the way. No  one else gives you that option. (If Makita did , I would be more inclined  to go that direction, since their LS1211 is such a sweet saw, even more  refined than the DeWalt.) The cam lock table is a very nice improvement  over a screw knob design. The whole saw is very easy to adjust if it gets  knocked out of whack by careless workers. It is however pretty heavy to lug  around, so I mounted mine on a Trojan Miter saw stand. Now I roll it around  instead. It sets up in less than 2 minutes. If you need the capacity , you  can't go wrong with this saw. If you don't , consider the DW705.

3552	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	No body but no body builds a better saw than the people who invented the thing so long ago. Yeah , other companies make fine tools. But none better than the skill mag 77. Dewalt tried to copy the design , it was a flop. So  they came up with their new hypoid framing saw that doesn't even compare  for durability. Milwaukee makes an even bigger wormdrive with a 15 amp  motor . It's an also ran. Makita made a super duper hypoid gear saw that  stripped gears like they were going out of style. I'll admit that their new  one is a lot better than the first but it's still not a skil. Unless you  live on the east coast , when you drive by a construction site, 9 times out  of 10 you're going to see a worm drive skil saw. There are reasons why  .They are the most durable. They run the smoothest. They are the most  powerful. I conducted a test of several framing saws. I ran all available  wormdrive and hypoid gear saws as well as the Porter Cable blade left 15  amp saw with marathon blades down 16' 2x douglas fir as fast as I could  without tripping a breaker. My partner timed me. The skil was the fastest  by over a second. Then we switced places. Same result. At the time we had  no preference for brand. In fact , we were hoping the new Dewalt would be  the best ripping saw. With its bright yellow color and its 15 amp motor, we  thought it might be. Not! The 13 amp skil blew everything away. I must say  we were impressed. I continue to be to this day. The mag 77 might be heavy  but not overly so. In some instances the weight is an advantage. if you are  cutting close to the ground , tilt the lumber so the saw is going down. It  will glide through with no effort. The length of the saw is also a plus .  When crosscutting sheet goods it is much easier to go all the way across  from one side without changing your position.  The in line design also  makes it easier to follow a straight mark on your material. The depth  markings are a nice feature for a rough reference point. I have a few minor  caveats though . The aluminum shoe isn't as tough as the steel on the older  saw. The cords crack pretty bad just past the strain relief. I don't know  of many power tool cords that don't though. I think my Bosch and Hilti  cords are in tact. If you want a 15 amp motor, a blade brake, a rafter hook  or a lightweight package , this is not your saw. If you want the most  powerful smoothest running most durable workhorse of a saw then look no  further than the skil 77 original or lighter mag 77.

They are well balanced so allow you to run your drill at higher speed (so you can work quickly) without overly taxing the drill spindle bearings. The side access slots to allow you to remove the waste quickly with a screw driver is another nice time-saving feature. Dropping a star as I think not having a 10c hex-key included is silly particularly as there is plenty of space for one in the case.

Saw dust collection works great with a standard shop vac and very little dust accumulates inside the cabinet.  The MDF top is very durable, but easy to drill (if needed) and feather boards attach neatly also.  The fit and finish of the bench, including the top quality plywood panels and door, is almost as nice as a fine piece of furniture :)  Now, to quell a few myths.....The cabinet does not amplify noise, it deadens it.  Your router will not overheat in the cabinet either.  If you're going to run your router for longer periods of time, then it would be probably be a good idea to open the cabinet front door panel ocassionally.  This table would be an awesome addition to your wood shop!

I bought this for the DW745 table saw. The unit IS compatible with the DW745, it says so right on the packaging. BUT it requires some router work for proper safe use with the DW745 type 3. Maybe it worked without modification for the DW745 type 1 or type 2, I have no idea.
Even though O.S.B. is cheaper than dirt at the moment it is against my nature to throw away something that might be used in the future, so I set up a couple of saw horses and proceeded to remove the charred edges of the remaining sheets.  I think I can use this material to rebuild my old chicken coup.  I used a straight edge and marked my cut lines and went to town with this little saw.  It is very easy to cut long straight lines due to the total lack of vibration and the great sight line for a right handed user.  It cuts almost as good as a table saw with a little practice.

If you need to make thin, super accurate cuts, then this isn't the attachment you're looking for. (I'd estimate the width of the two piece blade is 1/8").
2703	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This light is, in general, well made. I'm disappointed with two aspects of it: 1) I'm using it on 9096XRP batteries, and the handle design does not balance well with them, (perhaps it's better with the smaller Lithium batteries), and 2) the elevation of the light can be adjusted from horizontal through vertical by rotating the head at the joint where the head joins the handle, but cannot be angled lower than horizontal at all. The first three times I used it as a work light, I had to find something to block up the back of the battery to get the light aimed low enough to light what I was working on. Why a rotating joint to change the elevation of the beam? Beats me. It seems gimmicky, and it reduces the utility of the light compared to a normal friction joint that would have allowed for simply grabbing the head and setting it to the angle I want - including declined angles.
Highly recomended.  GW
 These have the advantage of holding up to 1500 pounds per pair, which is 500 more than most of the competitors. Yet they are surprisingly light, and store away taking up only 2" of depth.

The good points of this sander have to do with it being very powerful and a random orbit sander.  Powerful is good for smoothing large surfaces quickly.  Quickly is good for me because I hate sanding so much (I own at least seven electric sanders -- I must hate it).  Random orbit is good, frankly, because you never get the surprises that an instant of inattention with a belt sander gets you (I am in awe of those of you who get perfect results every time with a belt sander -- you are better than me).  This machine is nearly as aggressive as my P-C belt sander, and much less likely to carve low spots or dig in an edge.

6854	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Like one of the reviews posted previously, I use the TeleSteps ladder for inspection.  In that regard, it really has no equal; when it's all knocked down it is the smallest possible package in a quality ladder.  When set up, it's a genuinely good 12 and 1/2 foot ladder.  It's very light, sturdy and both well-thought out and made with a high degree of manufacturing quality.
The plastic case has a blade storage compartment that seems to want to keep opening, but this is EXTREMELY minor.  In fact, if it wasn't for that I would have titled this review "6 Stars or better".

It very comfortably fits my 14.4v B&D Firestorm cordless screwdriver. It also works good with  some cordless screw guns in a repetative task such as drywall, or siding.  The large pockets for bits are also very handy. There is room for more than  the standard three that most holsters have. The unique bit guard on the  bottom is very handy in keeping a drill bit out of your leg. Overall, I  highly recommend this drill holster to anyone over all comparable drill  holders.

The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic. Since it plugs into the handle, you can unplug the motor once it's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.

6988	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My house sits on a hilly lot and every time I used the ladder to clean out the gutters or do some painting, I would have to get some scrap lumber or bricks to level my ladder.  This was not only inconvenient, but unsafe as well.  I finally broke down and purchased these levelers and they work great.  They took about 10 minutes to install and are easy to use.  They are also significantly cheaper than the Werner levelers.  I have since installed another pair on my other ladder.  For me these are a must have item and I highly recommend them to anyone who has to use a ladder on uneven ground.
8489	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Like all the other reviews I love this tool.  Bosch just quit too soon.  The tool needs memory, maybe a calculator to divide angles, a laser would be cool, carrying case, a ruler scale along the body, reduce the size and give it extensions.  They could have just done more.
...but this Milwaukee 1/2 drill is simply the best in this category.
The thing I like best about this blade is the way it worked on my  old saw.  I used to have an ancient Craftsman direct-drive saw (where the  blade attaches to the motor directly, not to an arbor).  This kind of saw  seems to be subject to more vibration and run-out than cabinet and  contractor's saws with an arbor.  With this blade and the matching  stiffener I even got good results on the old saw.  It does even nicer cuts  on my new Jet contractor's saw.

6366	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought mine to hold shop-made jigs in place while routing and sawing.  They are very convenient to use.  The jaw has a maximum opening of about 2", but to get a really tight grip, about an 1 1/2" thick or less works best.  I always keep the black release lever on the top handle if I can.  Two of these will hold a jig very tightly.  The rubber pads will not mar your workpiece or slip.
I prefer this to the 7310 and 309.  I have had them last for years with daily use.  This is a great trim router but that is all we use them for.  We have other types of routers for other jobs (all porter cable too, btw)but have about 10 of these with flush bits, bevel bits and 3mm round over bits and they all work great.  The bits don't get changed other than to sharpen them, but I have never had to use pliers on them.  It is cheaper for us to buy a router than to pay someone to take the time to change bits.  I have had more stolen than break.

The only downside is the bulb. An incandescent bulb is an inferior light that quickly drains battery life.

I had read the reviews of this product on Amazon and noticed that a lot of people have problems with fitting this set to their saws. I tried to install the inside blade, all the chippers and the outside blade. There just isn't enough room on the arbour, the only way i could get them to fit was to remove the inside blade washer. The inside blade washer is big, it takes up about 3/8'' on the arbour. Dewalt might have a slimmer inside blade washer on the market. With the entire Dado set on the arbour i tried turning the set by hand and noticed that the inside blade was rubbing against the blade shield. Obviously the inside washer should not be removed, a fairly slim inside washer is a must for this Dado set on a Dewalt DW744. I'll have to spend money on returning the Dado set and swapping it for the set with the 5/8'' bore. I'm sure this is a fine Dado set once it's compatible with your saw, Freud should include a list of compatible saws with the instructions. Colour coding the shims and chippers would be a great idea as well.

Without completing the re-installation, I worked for a few weeks without both.  MUCH nicer and no aggravations!

3713	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm pretty sure everything that should be said has been said about this belt sander.  I worked with the PC "locomotive" belt sander for years and that is a fantastic tool for heavy duty, continuous surface sanding.  However, if you are looking for "medium range" belt sander (not too heavy, not too light) and versatile (can sand large surfaces, but is also capable of fine control for things like sanding the joints of frame and panel doors) this is the sander for you.  I find this model versatile enough for all purposes even to use one handed for scribing panels, trim and moulding on site.  The DeWalt variable speed 3 x 21 is too heavy for one-handed use, and the super light plastic belt sanders made by DeWalt, Makita and Black & Decker are worth avoiding.

At first I was disappointed like so many others that their wasn't even a tube mount on the head to hook up your hoses to. It is really nothing more than a stamped out piece of plastic that will accept your 4" hoses. After going through the duct tape, and band clamps, with less than stellar results, I came to the conclusion (duh) that the coiling action of a 4" hose is the right size to wind it into the opening. Thereby creating a screw the hose in, effect. I also used the 4" Jet wire clamps on the inside, just to make sure it would not gradually slip out. The fit is rather tight, and leaks very little air. No tape or anything else is neccessary. Makes for a clean professional looking fit. Wish they had put that in the instructions to begin with. It seems so obvious now, but who would know then?
8149	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This won't wear out - ever - it's worth the price (which isn't that much).  Please don't mess with Harbor Freight garbage.

The Blade and Bit cleaner works as well as the household cleaners I have been using to clean the pitch from my blades.
BTW -- The setup  instructions mentioned that the saw's mount points lacked screw threads,  and that you had to use the included self-tapping screws with a drop of  motor-oil.  On my saw, however, the threads were already there.  After you  order the supports, you might want to check your table saw and see if there  are pre-threaded mounting holes.  If you don't see threaded mounting holes,  go find some machining/motor oil.

The answer to that conundrum turned out to be simpler than I first thought. I didn't like the idea of throwing several tools in one soft bag, might as well just chuck em in the back of the wagon.  Individual soft bags however is an excellent solution.  I have several small GateMouth tool bags which hold one tool and it's accessories. A simple colored tag tells me what is where without having to wear-out my unzipping skills. Bags can be thrown in (theoretically, cos I'm way too 'anal' for that sort of carry-on!) and seem to nest together without any puzzle-making expertise. These bags get a big YES from me!
This is a good tool.  Cross cutting wide boards is simple and safe.  You start the motor and lower the blade at appropriate distance and push the blade back through the material.  This is much safer than pulling a radial arm blade through the work.

3721	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Before this, I used my dad's 12A Crapsman saw.  This one puts it to shame.  It's lightweight for its power, well balanced and solid as can be.  The kit is nice.  The hard plastic case holds 2 extra blades, the saw and the  wrench.  I like the arbor lock and blade wrench that are included, and the  Makita thin-kerf rip blade that's included is second to none.  My first  impulse was that the Milwaukee equivalent is probably more durable, but  probably not worth the money for someone who's not going to use it daily.  Also, if you've ever watched Norm Abram, this is his saw.  He uses it for  framing, general carpentry and even in his woodworking shop.  This is  probably the best saw for the money.  I do feel the slightest bit guilty  for not buying American (DeWalt, Milwaukee) though.

We don't have other scroll saw experiences to compare with but can say that we have been very pleased with the performance of this machine.  The quick blade release is an absolute must have.

5987	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	UPDATE January 2016 - I successfully created 2 inserts for the Dewalt 7491RS saw to be used with the blade guard and riving knife that came with the saw.  However, due to the horizontal movement of the curved riving knife when the blade height is changed, each insert can only be used for a specific height range.  I made one insert for cutting 2x4's and plywood.  The other insert is for the maximum blade height (I think 3.5 inches).  If anyone wants specifics about the slot length needed for the riving knife on this model saw just post a question or comment.  Unfortunately, you need to cut the slot very close to the back edge of the insert plate in order for the riving knife to lock into place under the saw table.  But with patience and a fine touch you can cut the slot to work without the need to cut the slot through the back end of the plate.  I really like these plates.  The side adjustment screws make it easy to get the plate to fit snug and the top screws let you angle or level the plate as desired.
8348	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I particularly like the lighted end on this sturdy cord. There is nothing in my appliance arsenal I would not trust to this extension cord.
I like the 6" square better than the 4", mostly because I'm slightly fumble fingered and there's more to hold.  There's also a tiny symmetrical 3" that is great for showing off when you pull it out of your pocket.
9191	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have two of these yellow Goodyear #045 air hoses that I bought here on Amazon probably eight years ago and they are both still in service today. These hoses were made in the USA and seem to handle being dragged across the concrete floor in my shop without issue. I normally run about 100-PSI through them continuously and even with all the use these hoses have had, they still don't have any leaks at the fittings or show any signs of splits or bubbles forming in sidewall. I think the price for these hoses was also reasonable and I would definitely buy them again when my old ones do finally wear out.
9460	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this product to work with my DeWalt nail gun and am absolutely pleased with the quality and price of this product. I placed my order a week before Christmas and it arrived in plenty of time. Five stars. This product is easy to roll up and will be in service for a long time.
And last, my shop-built right extension table has a double thickness top (one and a half inches thick).  This guard attaches to the saw at three points.  Two are pre-drilled and tapped holes on the rear of the cast iron top of the unisaw.  The third mount attaches with an "L" bracket to the underside of the extension table way out at the corner farthest from the saw.  With my thicker table, the third mount was 3/4" lower than the other two.  Fortunately, there was enough room on the mount to redrill it.  Had my table been any thicker, I would have had to get more creative.
7957	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Although the "genuine leather handle" of this E16S hammer is more like a slick hard lacquered wood, its quality is unsurpassed. Oddly, this model is about 3/4 of an inch shorter than the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Estwing-E3-16S-16-Ounce-Rip-Hammer/dp/B0000224VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Estwing E3-16S 16-Ounce Rip Hammer</a>&nbsp;which has a nylon handle. Between the two, I prefer the nylon handle, but having a steel tip on the handle's base is helpful for positioning and nudging pieces into place. As others have noted, this is a classic for good reason: time-tested design and simply a beautiful tool to own.
8642	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hammer is just the right size. Feels really nice in the hand and not too heavy at all. I am thinking of buy the next size up for bigger jobs.
I titled 'rating depends on use' - and if you are looking for a block plane simply to knock of edges, or perhaps a small area of end grain, in say softwood - you might rate this a 4-star as others have. But if you are thinking of changing the bevel angle from 25 to say 38 - trying to make a miniature smoother - lots of luck.

Other than that, they are perfect.  Easy installation (the holes are pre-tapped on the new 744 saw), very nice movement (they retract in about 10 seconds if you don't want them in the way).  Makes it dramatically easier to deal with larger boards.  The stock rip fence and miter gauge are totally functional with this in place.
2238	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is one awesome machine!  I upgraded from another brand and what a difference, I should have spent the extra dollars to start with, and highly recommend seriously considering this scroll saw for anybody wanting to get into scrolling, or even for those with any experience at any level.  First and foremost - blade insertion is easy and simple with just a little practice, insert the blade top first and snug the thumb screw, and if you are at 90 degrees with the table the bottom fits right in, tighten both blade screws.  The machine I moved up from had adapters for the blades, and it was a very frustrating procedure when having to poke the blade through a hole, attaching the adapter to the blade, then hooking the adapters.  With the DEWALT all it takes is turning the tension lever to the off position, releasing the top blade screw, poking the blade through the hole, then resetting the top blade, and resetting the tension.  Once you get used to it, it only takes about 5 - 10 seconds to accomplish this.  The machine is HEAVY, the table probably weighs about 50% of the total weight, and when bolted down produces very little vibration.  The instructions for putting it together are very clear, and unless you are into power lifting I recommend getting help to get it out of the box and onto the work surface.  I've been cutting out patterns in both 1/4" and 1/2" wood, and running at a slow speed (real curvy lines) on both thicknesses, and the machine does not bog down at all.  Overall this is one outstanding saw, and well worth the investment.  I've found that working with it is much less frustrating than my old one, and I actually enjoy working on it.
I can't believe 1) Porter-Cable doesn't ship this as standard equipment!! and 2) that I waited SOOO long to buy the thing.

Well worth the purchase.
7159	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These router bits worked just as you would expect.  They are very easy to setup and cut very clean with little to no tear outs on the stile and rail bits.

Note that this comes with threaded ends, no couplings.  You get to pick which ones you want and install them.  I suggest going with a universal female coupling.  Most of my items use industrial fittings, but there is the occasional must-have that uses an automotive fitting.
2.) The new 330 isn't made in the U.S.A., where as the old one is. For the price, it should be made here.
933	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These work great and are very affordable. Tried some LED lights and nowhere near bright enough. These light the kitchen up nicely and last longer than the overpriced ones at the big box stores and less than 1/3 of the price.

The teeth are too agressive for the thin plate.  I get the roughest cuts imaginable even though the blade has plenty of teeth.  When you start the cut the blade vibrates and makes a wide kerf.  When you are cutting the blade does not track directionally at all.
- Very easy to assemble: two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all!
 It is hard to find a blade that will cut plywood, and melamine, and do crosscuts, all excellently,  and do rip cuts good as well. This one does all of them. To see Freuds blade use recommendations chart, click on the blade picture at the top of the ad.

2412	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	At work, we call it "The Best Saw In The World." I am a timberframer and use this saw to cut kerfs at the correct depth. It has also done some duty as a general framing saw and a diamond blade wet saw for cutting stone. It gets dropped a lot too. We have other saws on the job, but this one is always getting used because it is light, powerful, and stays where it is set. The only real flaw to this saw is that the aluminum plate gets bent, compromising the precision this saw is capable of. But that is our fault for being so hard on it.
I have an 8" Grizzly joiner which is what I purchased this Makita unit for. For now I will purchase new (razor sharp) blades from Grizzly at $50 a set once a year or so until someone comes up with something that works with longer blades that is equal to the performance the Veritas Mk II delivers on smaller blades.

Quality build
4871	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am a weekend woodworker who builds tables for sale. I primarily choose walnut and cherry with a natural edge as my species of choice. Up until recently my 4 x 24 inch sander was a porter cable. I use to call it the "beast" becasue it so aggressive. I recently chewed up the power cord with it and decided to treat my self to a new sander. After reading the reviews on Amazon I bought the Makita. Its is truely a remarkable sander. Its balance is terrific and it does not beat you up like my old Porter Cable. It gives great results and I could not be happier. If you are going to buy a "big dog" sander make it a Makita.
quality seems average. i can't speak about reliability as i've only had it a month or so.
3677	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I researched a lot of belt sanders before deciding on this unit.  I checked out various sanders at my local Home Depot and talked with some local contractors. I narrowed down my choice to this or the Porter-Cable.  In the end I decided on the Makita for the following reasons:1.  The Porter-Cable is simply too heavy.  I use this sander in the vertical as well as horizontal positions.  It is heavy enough to be substantial and has a powerful motor, but is still easy enough to use with one hand in many different positions. 2.  The dust collector is in a very unobtrusive location compared to the Porter-Cable, in addition it really works.  There really isn't much dust produced when using this sander. 3.  The flat back allows it to be clamped to a table and used as a parts sander.  The variable speed control really comes in handy here. 4.  Price wasn't a big concern for me, I was going to buy the sander that fit my needs.  For someone who needs a medium duty belt sander that will be used in a variety of job I recommend this one highly!  Some other larger/smaller units may be better at specific jobs, but this one is really a jack of all trades. 5.  The motor is good, not a monster, but powerful and able to sustain heavy sanding for long periods of time without excessive heat.  In addition, the brushes can be easily replaced. 6.  Belt tracking mechanism worked flawlessly.  One person in one of the reviews here complained about belt tracking.  If you adjust the belt carefully it stays on track for a looong time.  Maybe that person had a defective unit, or more likely, a belt that wasn't perfectly square.  There is no way a non square belt will track correctly no matter how much you adjust the tracking screw. Congratulation to Makita on a job well done!
3676	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Was terribly disappointed at first - A clip fell out on the belt's first rotation. After an hour take-apart, the clip was back in place, and I set out to strip old paint off of a window. I was very impressed. This little unit had some claw, but not too much that I wouldn't use it for some pretty fine work. Held it aloft for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, and never felt the weight. Also didn't see any sawdust because it was all in the bag! The plastic case could be stronger, but then there would have to be other compromises, like weight or price. This sander strikes a fantastic balance for the do-it-yourselver.
7081	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great bit set; very clean cuts.  Not sure why the other reviewer said there were poor instructions.  The set came with concise paper instructions, as well as a mini DVD, which contains a video that demonstrates use of the bits.  This is my first use of a set of this type and I had no issues.  The only thing to be aware of is that the panel bit does not have a back cutter; as a result, the panels are going to sit proud to the rails and styles (assuming all are the same thickness), unless you reduce the thickness of the panel.
7454	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have built several cabinets using pocket hole screw technology.

6979	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Exactly as advertised.
I understand that there is now a Bosch that bevels both directions. If you decide that it's important to you to be able to bevel both left and right, I'm sure you would be happy with this choice also, but I have never found it to be complicated to work with only the right bevel capability on this saw. It's simple math.
One reviewer says he had to use a VICE GRIP to adjust.  NO ONE should need a vice grip to adjust their drill!
Recently doing some light-duty sanding on a small dresser and the belt started slipping.  Then stopped.  Opened up the machine and found that the secondary drive pulley (the one that is attached to the drive "wheel") is made of light plastic and had broken (sheared-off) at the "hub" of the pulley.  This is a little 15-cent peice of plastic that is on the critical drive-train.  Seems very foolish of Porter Cable to do this.  My local tool repair guy told me they did this for a while but supposedly they are making it with a metal gear/pulley again.
7804	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have owned the other Aluminum Taper Jig with the Screw On stop, and I recently purchased the Rockler Fiberboard Jig which went in the trash can. Bear in mind I use these for production work, and I make my living as a professional cabinet builder, and although some people are not happy with this one, I LOVE it. If you need to do tapered box fronts as I do, this unit is perfect. The removable and adjustable stop is the best part of this unit. All taper jigs are a pain to adjust, but with a little patience and time, it can be done just right, and this tool does the job. I was considering modifying my first aluminum one to make the stop easily adjustable, and easier to swap to the other side. This one does all of that. For the money, I find this one the best one so far, and if it gets lost, I'm buying another one. Whoever came up with the adjustable and easyily removable stop, my hats off to you! VERY NICE JIG!! Take your time when setting up your tools, the payoff is a finer end product.

I was particularly impressed when I cut a 1 1/4" wide X 1/2" deep dado for an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/INCRA-Miter-Channel-32/dp/B001EYU96G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">INCRA Miter Channel - 32"</a>&nbsp;in a 27" x 36" router table top.  I made the top from a double thickness of 3/4" MDF edged with 3/4" poplar and with 1/16" laminate glued to it.  I checked the surface flatness of the  laminate with a straightedge and feeler gauges before I made the cut and it was flat within 0.010".  The cut with the Freud dado stack produced no chipping of the laminate at all; the edges were sharp and clean.  I want to qualify that a bit because I did take some precautions with these cuts.  I used a zero clearance insert on my table saw, and cut the exact slot width with the cutters I was using.  I also used a sacrificial board clamped against the exit side of the dado to prevent any blow out of the poplar or laminate.  And of course the dado stack was quite sharp, being relatively new.  I also took the precaution of running the first 3/4" wide cut down the center of the slot, checking the edges, and then enlarging the slot in both directions.  After that first cut, I ran a piece of blue tape across the corner of the exit end, for extra insurance.  It all worked and the bottom of the dado was very smooth, with 2 light score marks.  From end to end, the width of the slot varied by 0.004".

4348	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	After producing several slightly misaligned joints, I noticed blade was not parallel to the fence. The manual says to adjust the fence parallel to the base. I checked and it was parallel to the base, but the motor is skewed slightly so that the blade is NOT parallel to the base, and there appears to be no adjustment for that. You can force the joint parallel in softwood, but not if you are joining hardwood.  The problem is compounded when you join two pieces of wood, each with a 1/32" error.  You wind up with a 1/16" offset you have to sand down. Very disappointing.

So while I may not have as much experience as a pro, I have pounded more than enough nails to get a good idea of what I like, and I really like this hammer. While a professional framer might use a heavier hammer, like something in the 22 ounce range, this one is just perfect for me. It's well balanced, drives straight, very comfortable to hold, and as far as I can tell, indestructible.

The fine adjustment really works. The soft start is smoothly soft and the variable speed control works as promised.
I've planed literally thousands of board feet with my two planers. Sharp blades are a joy to work with, and take a lot of frustration out of woodworking. I hope these suggestions are useful. In any case, your blades will eventually wear out, so keep a set of spares on hand. Happy woodworking!
First of all... these reviews include many people complaining about how difficult it is to put the shims on and off... I dunno, I'm a VERY impatient person, but I found the 5 seconds it takes to add/remove a shim worthwhile.

2840	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The downside is that it is quite heavy, though that can be a advantage to keeping the saw stable when starting a cut.  The aluminum base seems very rigid and gives confidence on keeping the cut on course.  Nice hard case with space for a few additional blades though you have to be careful stowing the cord to keep it away from the blade.  Hard case is much better than the bags supplied with my other DeWalt purchases.  Warning - no fence is included - you have to buy the over-priced $20 DW3278 fence separately.

Is it perfect?  No.  The height adjustment is at best, primitive.  I've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections.  The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers, since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut.  My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case, and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens, this kit was great.

Oh - it takes two people to put up the columns if you want to do it safely.  They have some weight to them, even tho they don't look like they would.  Too much weight to manhandle on a ladder (safely).
9126	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	High quality, still going strong after 2 years. I have no doubt it should last a long time.
390	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got this light as a second book light so I didn't have to run to my bedroom to get my reading light. I actually like this one better. It has two stages of light for a bright reading light or a dimmer one. It also has several lights to cover the full page. I use it on my Kindle and it clips well and not as heavy as my other one. Great reading light.

I have no issues at all with this product and shipping was far ahead of the ETA!
Although this is an expensive table, you do get what you pay for, and through use likely come to appreciate the features. The build quality is top tier in all respects. The wood parts appear to be high ply count pre-finished Baltic birch, with all parts perfectly machined. The feet work to dampen vibrations, and there is a cord outlet on the back. The mounting system for the plate allows for a very precise level of adjustment, with an array of set screws around the perimeter of insert to make sure it is exactly flush with the table at all points. This is something that is generally not available on simpler table designs, and rather difficult to incorporate on shop made options. The main table top is quality as well, with excellent fit and finish, with a standard 3/4" miter slot running along the front edge. The insert is set up to accept most popular routers; I have used it with Dewalt and Porter Cable models.
4555	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This blade is perfect for a 10" compound sliding miter saw. I purchased this after I kept having problems of kickback using the miter saw, and the blade hook angle is perfect for keeping the work-piece from lifting up. I am a professional woodworker and this is my first Freud blade. I have always used the Diablo blades from the big box store. The cut on this blade is good, but not great. I have a zero-clearance insert in my saw, but tearout still happens although not as bad. Overall I am very happy with the quality of this blade and will purchase again.

Very light

8690	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great investment at a great price point!  Just as good as the popular brand blades.
When threading holes we end up slamming them from forward to reverse they  still last for years. The drill will run a 1/2" NC Tap though 1" aluminum.

It is American Made and the choice of all framers and carpenters.
1865	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	An absolute must. Easy to connect, allows repititious cuts without slippage, and easy to use.
8780	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I normally only use the fine tooth side. The cuts are extremely clean, and the saw has a very fine kerf. It is also quite sharp.
6037	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	UPDATE: I have cut a slot on the back of this plate so that the riving knife will slide in. It still works just fine with no flexing.
2142	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a very powerful jig saw. It cuts really good. I use it for most work as substitute for my circular saw. I found high quality Bosch T shank blades work great on this saw. The thing I hate is the clunky quick change system. But when I use the saw I forget about this problem. It does blow dust but I don't care about it as long as the saw is great. That'swhy I am giving it only four stars.
794	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Lights super dim.  Had to return.  Output more like a 10W light.
1709	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used it for Marmoleum Click Flooring panels, which are rigid linoleum/cork/HDF panels about 3/8" thick.  Clean cuts, worked fine.
3724	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These are okay and cut cleanly.  I find the Freud's or Foresters cut faster
No, it does not apply clamping pressure to the joint but for simple case construction using pocket-hole screws, it will hold the parts in alignment while the screws are driven, and that is a huge help.
1253	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price

5536	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	this does not fit on the Jet saw, we had to rig it up with dryer hose to be able to hook it up to the dry vac :((  it's not 4" it's 3 3/4" which doesn't fit over the piece on the saw
UPDATE: I have to downgrade my rating.  One of the lights I ordered works great still (we will see for how long) and the other one just stopped working out of nowhere.  We tried replacing the batteries and it just stopped turning on all together.  I tried emailing the Mighty Bright Company since it is warrantied for one year and they don't respond to emails. Terrible customer service and joke of a warranty.  Thank goodness Amazon has world class customer service who helped me out!!! Thanks AMAZON!
2401	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I can do precision work in thicker, harder wood than any scroller I have ever used.  This is a fantastic tool.
3240	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased the bulbs and they work well in my Black & Decker flashlight. I was confused, at first, why the DeWalt bulbs came up in search for B&D bulbs, but by looking through reviews I found others had puchased for B&D as well. The bulbs fit my B&D perfectly and work fine with no issues to date.
7233	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome.  I didn't get screwed on this deal.  If your doing a lot of projects you need to purchase in large quantities.
4874	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the first and only biscuit joiner I have used.  I bought a reconditioned tool and have been using for three years.  It has changed the way I build things.  Makes joining two pieces of wood fast, accurate and simple.  I use for cabinets especially face frames, edge trim, etc.  The tool is easy to set up, accurate and fast cutting.  Would definetly buy again.
(note: I post my reviews because I take them seriously and I take other people's seriously as well. [...]. Thanks :)  ).
Oh, and heavy duty does mean heavy in this case!  You'll want it with all that torque.
3938	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I've been using this attachment for a couple of years now. I recommend it only if you cannot afford a bench top mortiser.
At first, I was confused as to why there were two different arbors. Inside the case, I opened the clear plastic door hoping to find some sort of instruction booklet. What I found was a small plastic pocket size card offering information on recommended drill speeds on the type of material being drilled versus the thickness.
3735	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good general construction.  Weld quality fair.  Instructions OK but error in tools needed not SAE as stated but Metric. Extra parts with kit. It does it's job. I got it for a fantastic price here !!! @ 50% of the local store and faster - Bravo AMAZON !!

I bought this so she can see without keeping a light on.  This product is great for that, as the light is very focused and has two brightness levels.  I will dock it one star though, as it is VERY easily to accidentally turn it on if it is just thrown in a bag.  It should have some sort of switch that makes it more difficult to accidentally activate.

6113	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my Bahco scraper and am impressed with the sharpness, thickness, and heft.
4171	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you do a lot of resaw or as in my case, make a lot of bandsaw box's this is a great addition. As other's have mentioned its a two person job, but the instructions and materials are top notch. I would also reccommend that you add Carter type guides to your saw at the same time. These really help with the resaw aspect and are a must for the small blades used in making bandsaw box's. The included blade wasn't much but I didn't think it would be, so no dissappointment there. The rest of the parts were good quality and everthing fit well. Took about twenty minutes to install and a few more minutes of adjusting. Thanks to the other reviewer for the tip on reinstalling the power cord. With a Timber Wolf 3/4" resaw blade I can now square up larger pieces of "firewood" to use for my bandsaw box's and it also enables me to get away from the 6x6 dimension that was my standard. I would reccommend this add on to anyone wishing to increase the size of material they can work with.
It takes up about as much space as a Radial Arm Saw.  It costs  more than than a RAS.
Anyway, the Shark CORP 21-2030 Chrome-Vanadium Nail Puller is 11 3/4 inches long so there's lot's of leverage, with a uniquely shaped "cat's paw" claw at either end. This design easily slides under the head of sunk in nails or onto the shank of headless ones.
2291	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is quite a fixture for your Dewalt router.  I use mine on the DW-621,  so I use the thinner set of rods and extra set screw knobs that come with  it.  It has a thicker set of rods for the 3hp routers.  You rough-adjust it  by sliding it on the two rods that fix to the base of your router and  locking the set screw knobs.  You can then "fine tune" it with  the center knob and lock the set screw knob on it.  The large picture above  will make these explanations clear to you.
2906	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had the saw with the legs and light for several weeks now.  I got the Mobile Base with it as well in order to move around my shop with ease.  The saw set up easily, and I had it up and running right out of the box.  The Legs took about 45 min to assemble (see my review).  The saw had considerable knocking at high speeds, above 6 (1450).  I found a fix at [...].  It was also the fix DeWalt recommended.  I spent an hour or so making the adjustment.  Also, I filed down the bottom rounded side of the Lid.  See a drawing of the parts that can be downloaded from DeWalt or [...].  Follow the instructions there.  It helps as well.  It now is running with no knocking at 8 (1750).  DeWalt put in a fix for this in 2009, and it is there now, so they say.  My manufacture date was Feb 2008.  I bought the saw,stand,light at Grizzly for considerably less than Amazon had.  I have also added a dust collector ( Seyco at [...]) for $25, and the footswitch from Woodcraft for $18.  I nearly bought an Excalibur, but the price differential was too much to ignore for my use.  I am really satistfied, and learned a lot by disassembling the front end of the saw.  I have hooked the Seyco collector up to my Festool Dust Extractor, footswitch, and saw, so now when I push the footswitch the saw and vacumn come on, or off.  Does a great job.  A great addition to my shop, and a replacement for my old Dremel.
6405	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It's the only glue I use for my woodworking projects. I also used it by the gallon when I was in the custom woodworking business.
2698	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised. Seems to be reasonably good quality (A Festool it ain't). I have used it for aligning mortises on a board. It world perfectly once it was set up properly. I'm happy with it for sure. Using it on my Dewalt 618.
7479	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you find yourself facing a job that requires maximum clamping power, a few (or allot) of these are what you need.  I was faced with this when laminating a 36" x 120" worktop consisting of 2x4's.  These clamps had the guts to pull the worst out of my warped boards.
2795	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Superb circular saw.  This is one of the best DeWalt circular saws made. There is no "safety" on this saw - squeeze the trigger and you are cutting wood. The adjustments on this saw are also precise.
1934	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Item was what I excepted.
  The reason why Incra stated that the fence did not work was because the center plate that mounts the adjusting arm to the fence, sat above the upper surface of the fence. That is easily solved by using a 1/4" shim made of wood, or Masonite etc and simply kerfing out the section where the adjusting arm center plate edge sits proud. That makes a completely flat surface area all across the top of the fence for the board buddy to sit on. I also ordered the Woodstock mounting bracket-plate made for these board buddies. That enables me to be able to remove and reinstall the board buddies with the least amount of effort.
Even after the hell I put them through they still cut square with minimal tearout even though they are so dull and chipped that the wood is burning as it's being cut!
4755	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Knocked off one star because the leveling screws would not reach thru the insert.  I had to re-drill the holes to give them room.  Other than that a perfect fit and am pleased.
6141	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The first one I received was broken on the edge and had to return. The replacement works great now I don't have to worry about breaking the impeller in my dust collector. Keep the big chunks in the trash can and out of of the dust collector.
2882	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased the drill to mix tile thin set and grout. After burning up a 1/2 " Makita and Milkwalkee this drill has held on through hundreds of pounds of mix. Highly recommend.
Far less expensive than a big box home store and last as long as any other Halogen bulbs.
> Storage:  Open up the door, and there's plenty of space for your router, measuring tools, bits, etc
4731	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is simply a great biscuit router that makes any corner or attachment of materials much stronger and tighter for the long road.  So simple to use and once you use it often you will think of projects you wish you had this on.  Like any routing type of tool it is going to make a bunch of sawdust no matter what you do but it is worth it.
1559	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Its a light bulb. Not sure what to say about them. I got a pack with several in it and I'm still using the first one that came so they are lasting a while.

6587	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	1st monster screw gun I have had. Everything else has been battery powered. Never again for batteries. This thing has power. Clutch takes a bit getting use to at first. On zero, this thing does sheet rock  without a blink. Getting ready to use it on sheet metal roof and a steel carport. So far, I would say, its a keeper!

8621	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This blade is great for cutting ceramic, marble, or porcelain tile.  I wanted to buy Dewalt because of the quality of their manufacturing. I have used this on a few different materials and it has performed well. I highly recommend. The price was right.
8359	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	"Yeah it is accurate, but do I need to know a right angle is not an exact 90*? Maybe it is 89.4*."

Overall, I'd recommend these LeeCraft inserts -- get a couple of them and you won't be sorry!


9294	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hose does not get hard in the cold weather like the cheap PVC type.  Stays flexible and is so easy to use.

3512	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	For some reason, makes more noise than my previous one.
This little Kreg jig  has a plastic body, but it's a very high density synthetic and should last  a long time. The kit has everything you need to get started, including  screws, but you'll probably want to get a bag of another 1000 if you plan  on doing more than a few boxes.
The item arrived on time and packaged well.
1114	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very good product
I wholeheartedly and without reservation reccomend this tool.  Go ahead and buy it, you will not be sorry.

3410	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I been doing Sheetrock for years and I wouldn't trade these screwgun for anything, I have used several if not all of the screwguns available and nothing works as good and is riliable like this screwgun. I work 11 to 12 hours a day and these screwgun last about 4 months of heavy and I mean heavy duty use.most screwguns only last about 1 month at most in my hands, and even if the screwgun stops working just replace the carbon brushes and you got a brand new screwgun once again.

1470	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These lights work great and came at a good price!  I'd definitely recommend buying these here as they were much cheaper than buying them at Lowe's.

4316	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Dull blade and not flat. Took me about 2 hours of grinding and sharpening to get this thing to be useful. Maybe I got a bad batch or was just unlucky, but I was not satisfied. Bought an old stanley block plane off craigslist that was rusted all to hell but worked better than this did.
2332	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Really a must have!  Great for both rabbiting and dados up to about 5" from the edge.  the dust port only works for rabbiting but when used works well.  the device would have received five stars if it didn't make the router so unstable when setting down.  After you make your cut the round dust port causes the router to tip over, once almost rolling off the bench.  This would get a solid five stars if they included stabilizing legs.  I'll have to drill and figure something out.
  I don't think the set-up is that bad - although I quickly disconnected Delta's "handy" spring loaded spline wrenches on their fence hold-down bolts.  (I don't know how your supposed to start the bolt on the nut with those things getting in your way - I just keep them handy for final snugging)
5181	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft. The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions.  I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid.  The depth adjustment is also very hard to set, you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust. The dust shield falls off easily. I returned it after one day.
of a 1 man custom cabinet shop and would recommend this set
I read all the reviews and knew what I was getting.  I also knew that it save me the time in making one from scratch.  If you are not able to weld the I strongly suggest that you pony up the extra $60 and buy the Beisimeyer.  There were moments I wish I would have!
8769	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very nice quality.
5451	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	First of all, I didn't buy this for hand use. I have used it a couple of time by hand and I don't know if I would want lug it around all day long. With that said, I mounted it in a table and proceeded to gobble up anything that I put in front of it. It is a monster, period. But that is where it really shines. It has the torque of a diesel engine, smooth as silk an fairly quiet running (for it's size and power). I love the soft start, so if you do use by hand, it doesn't want to jerk when you first start it up. After all it is the one that Marc Summerfield recommended for several years. Although it has gotten a little pricy since I bought mine a couple of years ago.
303	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works well. Can read in the dark. Clip is nice. Doesn't light the entire page though. Needs a wider illumination area.
If you compare this router with others with the same horsepower, you will note that this router has a 12 amp design, vs the 8-10 amps in the other models. This gives this router the extra advantage of being able to drive larger bits or deeper cuts.
2185	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great miter saw.  Lots of capacity and lots of nice features.  The tall sliding fence is great, just make sure to slide it out of the way during bevel cuts.  The supplied blade is fine for general work but youll want to upgrade if you plan on doing any work requiring a quality cut.  This saw is easy to adjust, just read the manual as it tells you how to adjust everything on the saw.  Adjusting it took me all of five minutes and has stayed true ever since.  My only gripes concern the cost of the accessories.  They are ridiculously expensive and should be included considering the price of this saw.  I also recomend purchasing this saw at your local home center as DeWalts packaging jobs leaves a lot to be desired. One piece of cardboard is all that secures this big saw inside the box.  Other than those minor gripes this is the best 12" saw on the market.
9341	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Good idea, but very poor quality for heavier use, such as in the trades. This product held up to less than 2 weeks of work, the replacement also failed in under two weeks. Not the quality that I have come to expect from Dewalt!

Doing a big deck project, the first one has been great so bought the second.
311	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	We bought this to use in the car while reading on road trips. It has good battery life and provides just the right amount of light to a reader while not disturbing the driver. It works well as a small flashlight for looking for items in the car at night if necessary. It hooks on to the book securely and it has multiple led light modes for ease of seeing.

7154	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used many blades over the years yet i am still impressed every time I make a cut with this blade. I live by the rule: "you get what you pay for." You certainly get the best here.
638	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome!  My daughter loves her reading night light.  We use to read her bedtime story books.  We always struggled with other means of night time reading but I just never got around to ordering one of these lights.  Well definitely glad I chose this one.  The design is easy for my 4 year old to use and looks great.  So far we have loved the purchase.
5371	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excelent
5925	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They do cut fairly clean but not so much on the scroll cuts. If you want cut something fast, however, these are an awesome deal at the clearance pricing I found them for. If Bosch labels it "clean" that's what you use when you don't want to do a lot of sanding afterwards. If it's labeled "progressor" it's for making two pieces where there was once only one ASAP.
4425	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product at a great price.  Was just what I needed for the project I was working on.
5851	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When my workers are happy I'm happy... I did 2000 sq ft of hard wood and the guys only had to change the blade once.
4843	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery.  At that point, biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me.  My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use, though, and is still as tight as new.  It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time, and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.
3553	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is great. It is alot lighter that the old 77 but with the same awount of power. This saw will cut threw any wood like butter. I particularly never liked worm drive because they are way to heavy but this  saw is a little lighter and feels good when i use it. It feels more like a  15 amp saw than a 13 but you cant go wrong buying this saw, its been around  for decades and they probly all are still working
4114	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I expected a lot more from the Fein tool, it would be one of the best tools I own but the blades are junk and expensive.
8809	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is extremely sharp, about the sharpest I have ever used. Makes excellent clean cuts.
1463	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	But I'm telling you, the ones that cost 3 bucks apiece at DIY don't last terribly long anyway. We'll see.
5700	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just installed mine. It's a very sturdy product, made very meticulously. Most inserts have four leveling screws, like this one, but the Leecraft insert also has horizontal screws on the back and one side, to make it fit your opening.

1842	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I have other Porter Cable products that work well. The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me. It could have easily had more than an additional 2" of travel with a simple design change. Or you could shorten the beam by 2" and have the same usable travel with a design change. The pins that adapt it to the router are .014" under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025" more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide. Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide, they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes. This is shoddy quality control. Even the screws are an obsolete size which hasn't been used much for more than 25 years. The screw size by the way is #12-24. Most think it is a 5mm, but it is not. I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws. These damned screws if you can find them are over $2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online. That doesn't even consider the cost of shipping and handling. My qualifications are: I have worked in the tool and die trade for 46 years. I have been a supervisor for more than 25 of those years. I have been involved with the design and fabrication of many things that have complexity far beyond this simple edge guide.
2544	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A very sturdy accessory to the DW715 saw. I bought one, and was installing it on the left side of the blade (as this is where I do most of the cuts), and noticed the saw would accommodate one on the right side. So I immediately bought another! Very well constructed, comes with all the necessary parts, and room is allowed on the upright supports through slotted holes to adjust the height to be level with the bed of the saw. Something not discussed in the assembly instructions is the fact that two or more of these could be joined together via threaded holes in the extension rods. This will be extremely useful for supporting crown molding.  A great product!
2471	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  I see now why the pros use Milwaukee.  Smooth.  Easy to operate.  More expensive than the second tier saws, but well worth it.

3929	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've read other reviews regarding this item, and have to agree Delta really got lazy with the kit case for it. Things are jumbled into it with no place for them to be, just piled on top of other components, wherever there's room. The tool itself is what I expected, does the job, and fits my drill press fine. For a shop with not a lot of available space, versatility is a must, and this is a reasonable alternative to a bench top mortising machine.
You can't open the saw cabinet once this is installed.  Being that this is made by Delta, you'd think they would have noticed that problem and prevented it.

Because of this deficiency, items clamped down with these clamps tend to slip and come lose. This is especially true if you don't have the strongest grip to begin with.

This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light.  My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast. I am unable to make a run to the outhouse and back without the flashlight going dead (or at least very dim).  And I don't stay seated long.  I end up turning it off while seated.

7423	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It comes in three packages, fence, stand, & top. Plan on it taking a little long for the build. I took my time and it was close to 2 hours without mounting the router. I could build another one in half that time or less now. The directions are not the best but I just about built the whole thing using the picture in the Chinese-English instructions. The only problem I have with it is how you mount your router to the plate. Kreg gives you a template but that's it. Is this better than a bunch of rings with holes? It's up for you to decide. I guess it will be a stronger mount once you finish the retrofit. I'm thinking about buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kreg-PRS3000-Precision-Router-Table-Lift/dp/B002YIG578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kreg PRS3000 Precision Router Table Lift</a>&nbsp;or Woodpecker lift to help ease the pain of mounting the router perfect. Hope I have some money left over for lumber! The stand is beefy and heavier than I expected, nice. I'm glad I purchased a wheel kit for it. It should make moving it in my small space less of a chore. I put a square on the fence and it is very, very good. Not having cut a single piece of wood or have yet to mount the router, I'll say it is a good table for the money, ***** stars. One thing they should add is an on/off button for the router.

Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.

Any pipefitter worth his salt has a set of Ridgid wrenches in his tool bucket. Every one of us has tried a cheaper wrench only to find that they won't grip right, or the teeth or jaw springs wear out too quickly. I've seen one pipefitter vet use a cheap wrench only to have it's grip slip on him, and the wrench handle caught him in the forehead! He sent that wrench on it's final voyage off of the sixth floor, and to this day it still lays at the bottom of that retention pond! He said that he knew better, and bought himself a Ridgid the next day. That was about seven years ago, and he still has, and uses that wrench.

517	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Update: I purchased this light in January of 2012 and has been very pleased with it. After about 6 months I noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.

 I looked at some overseas, and the Ryobi model, and decided to spring for the Porter Cable. The metal base, and fine adjust feature, and metal housing, set it apart. This is a professional level piece of equipment. Should give you many years of trouble free performance.
6394	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very nice blade for the radial arm.  Initial jump in is lower and more easily controlled than the prior blade (basic Ryobi blade) and so far the crosscuts in solid red oak board and birch ply have been very smooth and splinter-free.  Ripping in red oak was also smooth although I got just a touch of burning...probably due to me feeding to conservatively.  The blade runs smooth and quiet for the most part; occasionally I get some high pitch shriek but I haven't pinned down whether it is material or thickness...whatever the case it is a lot better than my prior blades so I call it tolerable.  I may try a blade stiffener in the future if it doesn't give up too much depth of cut.
The first thing I built with the cutters was a set of wood racks out of 2 X 4's.  Basically I used the cutters to shave slots 3/4" deep into the 1.5" thick 2x4.  I made some pretty aggressive cuts b/c I was in a hurry.  I was happy with the finished product especially with the deep shaving I was doing.
Someone else mentioned the lock-on button being recessed too much. While I agree it could protrude a little more, it does function.  If it sticks out too far, you could accidentally pop it on and surprise yourself.  But the button is too small for its recess and sits off to a side.  Plenty of room for dust  to get in.  Again, it was surprising to see this lack of tolerance on a Bosch router.
8150	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great hammer. I've been using it for 9 months as an electrician apprentice. I don't use it everyday or super often, but when your linemans pliers aren't enough you need a hammer. I may eventually size up to a 20 Oz or 24 Oz hammer at some point. 16oz is a good all around size though. I've used this hammer to hammer nails and also for things it wasn't designed for.

It is rare that you can narrow a tool choice down to yeah this, and boo that. If I had to chose just one, and I did, it would be the Makita. More power, greater speed range, least amount of overall head height in the greatest range of applications, and that lifetime LED light to constantly shine the way. They call it the new Eluminate line of tools. I know that if I get in a situation of needing the 55-degree angle, I will wish I had the Milwaukee. Additionally, I know I have a hankering for the Porter Cable air driven at those times when I have air. For the price, I might wind up with one of those also. The Dewalt, is an inexpensive drill that I know I would be cussing at, every time I needed to reverse out a screw, since it doesn't have reversing capabilities, and it doesn't have variable speed, so it will strip out the screw heads as well. Enough said: I like the first three very much. I have learned that if you go for a little more on the price, you often get a tool that is a lot more in the long run. Hope this was helpful.

As others point out, it will be necessary to shim from the dips in the back wall, and in places where the floor drops away. Only then can you tighten those last screws that connect all cabinets to the studs. Your goal is to create a level (and square) surface for the countertop to solidly rest on. Use a long straightedge/level to continually check as you emplace each unit. (See Fixmycabinet.com)

I had a little clip-on light on my laptop computer screen that I had purchased at the local grocery store stationery section. It was better than nothing, but the light was very low, and the light did not extend across my keyboard leaving me to squint and guess when looking for keys on the sides.  The Mighty Bright arrived today, and I was excited to try it.  Wow!  My keyboard now has good light all across it, and the light even extends down over my touch pad.  I like the fact that it uses AAA batteries, as they are easy to find practically anywhere, unlike the little round batteries.  I will be looking to see how long the light will work.  The push button on/off switch allows you to use either one or both of the lights.  I'm happy to find that even with only one light on, I can still see the whole keyboard very clearly, and gives more than sufficient light which should extend the battery life.  The goose-neck is longer than other lights, and flexes into any position one could want.  I love this light!

I will use this on my Triton router table after I hard wire this in. I tried to remove the switch from the back plate  and I broke the switch it wasn't Woodstock's fault so I ordered just the switch and used their wires so it wasn't a total lose.

  I picked one up to use for my dado blade and have a new one on standby for the next dado setting. The problem is that unless you have several of these, one for every possible dado setting, you're not going to be able to use them for dadoing every possible size. That is where the factory dado insert comes in. Sometimes you don't care about worrying that the wood piece can dive into the saw, or that your work piece is so small that you need a closer platform to support it. Take kerfing out large plywood sheets for cabinet sides for example. When you are doing smaller projects needing dados, having the Leecraft is great.

One thing: When ripping down 12" or wider solid hardwood, make sure if you are using the Bosch saw that you drop the riving knife down below the table, or it will bind. Even though there was binding, the Bosch saw never stalled as far as blade rotation. The reason there was binding is due to the fact that this Forrest blade has a smaller kerf size/blade thickness than the riving knife of the Bosch saw.

Second, you can go with the Wood River or the higher end Stanley Sweetheart block planes. From the reviews I read on the Wood River planes, the knuckle cap has a tendency to pop off during use. In the case of the Stanley Sweetheart's, I've read where people stripped out the screw in the knuckle cap because the cap is made of aluminum and just doesn't have the durability it needs to stand up to repeated use.

In order to align the mounting holes the middle plank has to be reversed in relation to the logo on it.  When assembled thusly you can't raise the narrowest plank......and you can't attach the narrowest plank in any manner at all.

For your basic furniture construction this device is simply amazing.  Attach the jig to one face to be joined, run the special drill bit (included) down one or both fixed metal ferules, unclamp and use the Kreg screws to attach the two parts.  I can now build furniture, test for fit in the shop, take it apart, apply finish and rebuild on site.
8837	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After screwing and gluing my trim boards in place on a cabinet adjustment to fit a new fridge, I realized I had an 1/8th inch difference between one side and the other. A friend suggested a Japanese pull saw, and Amazon had this for a very reasonable price. In two days, I set my lines and pulled the blade to cut an exact and smooth line across the oak trim boards (1" by 5") and the backing support pieces glued behind them. The waste material was paper thin, and came off without chipping. Be careful! The saw blade is very sharp! I found the long handle a great asset in lining the blade straight across the cut line. Highly recommend!
I am not sure this is worth the extra cost compared to a Workmate 225.

However, within 4-5 months of their installation in my yard, all 5 of the lights began to dim. By the end of the 5th month, every single one of them was dead.

640	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Its about time someone designed a book light that you can recharge. Not only is it very functional, its adorable. This 9 inch light clips onto your book, kindle, or sheet music, and gives you hours of surprisingly bright light. When it starts to die on you, pull the stem out of the clip, and plug it into your USB charge port on your computer. Wait a little, then its recharged. (I don't let mine discharge all the way. That way I can depend on it, if I'm away from the computer when it runs out of power.) The problem with these clip on book lights that I always had, is that I fall asleep when I read.  The light would stay on for a few hours, wasting the batteries. Then, I couldn't find the right round batteries for the light, or never put them in, etc. So this light will pay for itself, in batteries saved alone. Plus, you get a blue monkey, so there's that too.

  ultimately, a more accurate device would probably be a  dial type scale, which gains huge accuracy from gearing.  The digital aspect can easily be incorporated into such after the reading is had.
The negative hook of the LU91 is its one weak point, although it was designed that way to perform a safty action. Negative hook angles are utilized in order to keep the back of the blade from lifing the workpiece and thereby endangering the operator. However, if the saw is aligned properly and the workpiece is held decently tight (or, better yet, clamped), lift is just not a big deal. I have never had a workpiece lift in a miter saw, with any blade. The negative hook of the LU91, its safty factor notwithstanding, tends to fling sawdust straight back, UNDER the dust port, thereby building up a lot of dust on the saw. Even the best dust port would be unable to deal with this artifact.

The top is bigger,  The power switch has two sockets - one for the router and a second for a shop-vac.  It has a cast aluminum router plate that's adjustable so it's level with the table surface.  Putting it politely, it blows this out of the water in every single dimension.  And since they're roughly the same price, I see absolutely no reason to purchase this instead of the Bosch..

That being said, Titebond II is a glue I turn to for a lot of things. I have used it for craft as well as wood; especially in making padded upholstered display panels. (smear onto plywood, lay 1/2 to 1" closed cell foam over it, put another piece of luan and a few carefully spaced concrete blocks to dry overnight...) It will adhere the foam to the backer board, to then be covered. I have also glued upholstery fabrics to the top of said foam with it, leave about 4" unglued of the foam around the edge, then tuck fabric into place, glue, recover and reweight for the night; and it will turn out well.

The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to.

Critically speaking, their is a tiny ridge that is made when you look down into the groove at the bottom, but it is so small, that you have to scratch it up to a moving blade, or should I say multiple blades. It does not result in any edge imperfections whatsoever. At first notice, I was relieved to see a perfectly smooth cut. After using it multiple times, and looking too deeply, I noticed the tiniest ridges. I believe these ridges are a result of having to move the board across the blade, and all it takes is the slightest movement as to the heighth of the board, to cause it to get closer to the blade, and thereby giving you the tiniest ridge midstream. Even with that, their isn't anything less than a perfect seam along the outside edge, without having to do any sanding, filing, chiseling etc. It is perfect right off of the blade.
Just my opinion but if you want to shoot foundations ETC. spend a bit more $$ & get something usable.

Installing flooring, a moisture meter allows you know exactly when your wood planks have acclimated to the moisture in your home. There are many rules of thumb for this ranging from a few weeks to months, but this is unnecessary (and sometimes quite absurd) if your planks arrive at the correct moisture level to begin with.

After reading the reviews at amazon.com, I bought the Makita and taking the advice of one reviewer purchased 4" x 24" sanding belts to fit the 3" x 24" machine. The advice seemed sound and the belts cost less than the DeWalt, with much more working, sanding surface.

All in all it is an excellent tool.  I would buy it again and strongly recommend the sander to others.
If you need a really heavy duty hose, this is it.  But for general use, get something much lighter
Note: when joining two pieces of wood with pocket hole screws, it pulls them in really tight, so you need to make sure the ends are SQUARE, else the screws will pull the joint crooked. You may want to investigate the technology before purchasing screws. There are several different screw types depending on the types of wood being joined. Soft, hard, or ply woods. I love the technology, since I have purchased the full kit and several added clamps.

We have used the lift to install HVAC duct, lift roofing materials, sheating, 11/8" floor decking, and basicialy anything heavy that we can get to stay on the lift safely and without exceeding the maximum capacity. We have even put a sheet of plywood on it as a lifting deck and used it to lift large rolls of insulation into attics. I'm not sure Telpro would endorse these uses, but since a lot of the users are DIY or generals I thought I would share my experiences using it for almost every phase of construction. Every time I have to lift anything  on a job I consider the possibility of using the Telpro.
8497	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After researching and shopping around for a dado set, I finally decided on the Freud SD208. Bear in mind, for the last 30 plus years, my personal set was a Craftsman Kromedge 8" 'Satin Edge' dado set, which wasn't all that bad. While the chippers were carbide, the 2 main blades were not. I could still cut plywood, but solid wood looked more like I was cutting my dados with a torch! Our shop had a nice 10" Freud set, but I've retired and no longer have access to it

3758	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this set because I noticed a little bit of wobble in my blade as I shut down the machine even though the blade is tight against the arbor.  I had some doubt as to how much effect stabilizer would have on the blades performance.  My package noted that these were two sets.  I gave the other one to a woodworking buddy.  I am completely satisfied and impressed with this stabilizer. It completely eliminated the blade wobble at start up and shut down of my saw.  I had one thing that abolutely puzzled me.  I installed the stabilizer on the outside of the blade on my right tilt saw.  There should have been no change in the blade placement.  My zero clearance insert would not go over the blade.  It rubbed probably a 1/64th of an inch or so.  I lowered the blade all the way down, put in the insert and powered up my saw.  I then raised the blade.  It cut the expected 1/64th of an inch or so and I let it run a minute to clear out the insert.  I was amazed at how well the stabilizer worked.  No more wobble.  I own a Delta contractor saw with cast iron extensions and tons of add ons.  I am completely sold on this product.  I am certain that my old arbor flange was slightly warped, although I never noticed it.  I highly recommend this product and it is so inexpensive.

In terms of ergonomics, the thick pins are held in place in a molded plastic finger grip about the size of a quarter.  It takes a considerable amount of pressure and gripping force on the little plastic grip to pierce drywall or wood with the thick pins.  This almost always results in sore fingers after taking just a few readings.  A better design would have encased the pins in a long hand grip instead of a tiny finger grip.
Unlike some of the earlier reviews, I experienced absolutely no problem with the lineup of the holes for the table/bevel control - saw assembly was complete under 5 minutes, with the stand taking about 30 minutes (but I stopped for coffee once).

That said, this is my primary "go to" hammer and is a constant companion on my tool belt. I do have a 22 oz Estwing framer that I used for primarily demolishing, but 99% of the time, the 16 oz is on my side with my other tools.
4445	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I held off buying a plane for a long time. How foolish! This little plane has saved me lots of sandpaper, and it's really fun to use. I shaved the high spots off of some old drawers that I had to install some slides on, and took some layers of paint off the edges of some old cabinet doors. The old paint was really tough to get off the bottom of the plane, since I didn't have any solvent. I finally tried spraying a little carburetor cleaner on it and it came off pretty easily.
The upper arm can be raised to make it easier to insert the top part of the blade into your project for inside cuts. I cut a piece of wood to hold the arm  up when I do this. Yes, Dewalt has been informed of this oversight and may put something on the arm next time to hold it up.
8764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These tools don't come cheap. That is because they are the World Class best. Lay out a compound angle such as an octagonal wood tabletop and you'll see the critical difference between this and a lesser tool (which there are no shortage of). Shipping was prompt and reasonable.
8488	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	To those of us, who are new to the molding world, in addition to accurately determining the angle in degrees to a tenth of a degree on anything you need a measurement on, it has this cool built in crown molding feature. First you determine the spring angle, (which is the angle the crown molding sits on the wall). With the tool in place you press the button, it memorizes the spring angle which is shown in degrees, and the letters SPR appear. Then place the tool on the corner where the molding is to be installed, it displays the corner angle in degrees, press the button again, the letters CNR appear. Simply press the button once again, and it automatically calculates the Mitre Angle to set your Mitre saw, and by pressing the button once again, it gives you the bevel angle to set saw to as well. Lay your molding flat on your COMPOUND mitre saw and cut perfect moldings every time. If your saw has dead on accurate gauge settings according to the scales, then all you have to do is dial it in, and cut away, if not this Bosch unit will give you the ability to set your saw accurately as well.  Another reason why this tool is so important, is that a lot of walls are not really set at a true 90 degrees, so a detent setting on your saw, at the common crown molding setting, is not always the proper angle.
3813	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	OK, I have owned this saw since 1988 and it recently was stolen so I replaced it with a new one. I'm sorry but the new one  just a  copy of the original 60 degree bevel saw that it replaced. My old saw built thousands of sets of stairs - especially winders where you need that 60 degree capability. This new saw is the same, same model, same AMP's etc but as I am using it I am telling myself its just not right, OK it weighs the same  but it just does not have the torque and smoothness of my original saw. A glance at the ID plate tells me all I need to know " Made in China"  I am not knocking China in fact their manufacturing has made leaps and bounds over the US but there is still something not correct about this saw, It also cuts at an angle with the scale set to zero, If I could return it I would.

The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart. I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work. It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way.

Blade change is a cinch.  Can be done with one hand, no tools, in about 3 seconds (with your other hand holding the unplugged saw, obviously).  I routinely use the blade "mounted backwards" whenever I need different clearance - a great feature.  Adjustable shoe is awesome, and could not be easier to set.  Variable speed via trigger, with top speed set by dial.  Again, as intuitive as possible.
2260	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As it comes, it is a very boring and weak light.  Yes, it can help you under the sink, etc., but it will not impress anyone or light up anything in a normal lighting situation.

I would prefer they changed to top gauge so that it would hook the top of the door but the one they have does work.
8124	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I am giving this only two stars because it does not include a 2.5-inch saw, as advertised. That was the one I needed, but I thought I might as well get the set. I arrived on the job at a remote location with the new set, only to find I didn't have the saw I needed. I checked the web description before setting out, but didn't check the set itself :(
1st, the table casting was rough, so I filed the burrs smooth.
The sealed bearings are smooth and accurate, so bits run true and stay sharper longer.

I thought it might use batteries up but the LED uses so little power they last a long time. It is good to have the two levels of light too for in the dark the low level is plenty.
2280	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Overall this is a nice product, but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling. You don't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws. Fortunately, I heeded that warning from other reviewers. I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table. Don't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton, and it was packed well. Probably mishandling at the factory. After seeing this and the maximum 1/64" thickness of the lamination, I plan on banding the sides with hardwood. It won't be long before I add my own dents. I agree with other reviewers. The instructions are horrible.  The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time. Correct them Delta!  It does work and save me space when folded down. The brackets are nice and heavy. I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination.

Porter Cable has been found to be the best router out there by numerous other magazine editors and

2432	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My husband put one of them in and it is working great. Thanks
  These screws have a very sharp tip on them, and the shaft thickness is thin as well. Consequently you do not need to pre-drill unless you are using them close to an edge of a soft wood. In that condition the thin edge can bulge a little.
EDIT: I forgot to add...When I cut the wood for all of my mobile bases I cut them long so I could put a 1/2 lap joint where feet get installed.  These joints were glued before installing the feet and I feel like this makes for a stronger frame.  It may be overkill but really happy with the results.

I am more than impressed, it took half the time for this job because of the set up & clean up time.  The tool works remarkably well.  However, i did read through the manual and other reviews, noting that it is important to depress the contact tip fully before pulling the trigger.

4266	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I chose this model based on the Amazon reviews and previous experience with a makita random orbital palm sander.  The other reviews do a great job listing the details, pros and cons.
  Overall I highly recommend the buddies. They add to the safety and precision of making table saw cuts, and could be used on router tables with a compatible fence. The heavy castings, and industrial grade rubber should give you years of use.

  In terms of getting a straight aim, Bosch put a V groove on the leading edge. If you were making a completely through cut, then the splintering inserts are a good thing to have. But when I tried to see where my cut would stop, it was buried under the insert, and couldn't see my mark. So I guessed. The net result is an inaccurate cut. When I took the insert off, I could make the cut, and come to an exact mark.

Needless to say, I'm VERY disappointed.
6548	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these to use in assembling parts for behives. They are samll enough to use for hobby and model work. But they are strong. Easy to adjust and clean. My only gripe is that the pads fall off, and can get lost -- as has happened to me.
9184	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a top quality hose. Just like a business would have. Replaces my skinny hose that was to short.
After realizing it was a goner, I took the entire thing apart except for flex arm itself.  There are no broken solder joints or other obvious problems.  I loved the light enough to order a replacement, we'll see how long it lasts.  I am hoping this one was just a 'lemon'.  For now, I will leave my 5 star rating.
138	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great but wish it ran off of AA batteries.

7996	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had an ms 2000 and the 2000x extension wing now for over three years. It has been very helpful on my jobs. It really makes for a smooth running cut station . I hate site built contraptions to elevate your saw and for  material support. The ms 2000 is a very nice piece of equipment. It sets up  in less than a minute. With or without the 2000x it offers solid material  support for varied lengths with the ladder type slide out wings. With the  2000x it is outstanding even with heavy framing lumber.  Many other stands  only offer support for long stock with their rollers so far away from the  saw. If you have a five foot or under cutoff , it falls to the ground where  it might suffer damage. This stand is also the easiest I've seen to set up  and break down. I sometimes work on sites where ther are several stands  from many companies. It's so much faster it's not even funny. I know  one  carpenter who was planning on getting the rousseau stand. Two guys  struggled for two minutes to get their rousseau folded up in front of us. I  said watch this. I folded mine up in a fraction of the time , by myself and  had it in the trailer before they were done. Needless to say he bought a  Trojan. One outstanding benefit is the height. It is much taller than the  other available stands. I like my work to be up high where I can see it  without bending over. After years of use mine developed a little play in  the lock mechanism. It was very easy to fix. Trojan can supply a new lock  rod or you can disassemble it and drill a new hole for any one of the  cotter pins . This makes the rod longer and tightens up the whole stand.  The designer has since improved the locking mechanism to make it more rigid  and resistant to wear. When I got my new Makita LS 1212 I considered  getting a different stand. Nothing really compared very well so I bought  another Trojan. I'm happy I did!
Once I got the metal pieces bolted in place, I again test-fitted the stationary table top piece to make the final mark for cutting off the edge so that I had clearance for the fence slide. After making this cut (allowing for about an 1/8th inch fence clearance), I assembled the stationary top in place, aligned it and checked for flatness and tightened the bolts.

7186	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was just browsing this evening and check back periodically to make sure this belt is still available (I tend to stockpile some supplies).  I just read down through the reviews and thought I should chime in after having used this rig in the field professionally now for five or six years.  I believe I'm still on my first one, though it really is due to be replaced soon.  I have added a side bag which holds my tape, a good number of putty knives, a chisel, a couple small pry bars, a 7" speed square, and a gob of 16's sinkers.  One of the pouches from this rig generally has 8's sinkers and a few other oddball things while the other is loaded with a few screwdrivers, a couple utility knives, pencils, chalk, pencil sharpeners, nail sets, junk.  I noticed one comment that the plastic clip may not be durable enough.  I did indeed break one, but only in the midst of a tantrum when I threw my fully-loaded belt onto concrete.  It had been clipped and unclipped a few thousand times by then.  I've never had a problem since.  Another fellow commented that the bags tend to slide forward when stooping over.  That's true, however I have overcome this by putting the included tape pouch back in between the main pouches as shown in the photo above.  I don't use the tape pouch, but it makes a very effective spacer.  What I really like about this belt as opposed to framers' rigs is the fact that these pouches don't hang so low.  For me, most framers' rigs smack against my thighs all day and really irritate me.  I find this rig to be more comfortable, plenty functional for framing, great for all-purpose use, incredibly durable, and dirt-cheap.  You really can't go wrong with it.
9257	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Replacement battery works just as well as original.
In my review of the saw I state that the original blade is good for a starter blade. This one DEFINITELY takes it to the next level and beyond.  No tear out AT ALL, either ripping or cross cutting.  SMOOTH finish.  NO SAW MARKS!!!  And it's fairly quick at ripping too.  I was concerned about buying another blade designed primarily for cross cutting, and Freud doesn't rate this blade as the best for ripping either, but my results so far have been excellent.

5705	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice hose, way better than the one that came with my Ridgid vacuum.

4521	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Eeeeh!!! Nothing wrong with the product. Just make sure you can justify needing this for your application. Only use it once in a while.

2531	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I opened the box and set this up yesterday.  It was packed about the best I have ever seen any tool packed for shipment. Assembly consisted of installing the table, with two hex-head machine screws, and adjust it slightly side-to-side to center the blade in the hole. The ends of the blade clamp screws were already centered and perfectly flat, so I didn't have to file off any burrs.  When a blade was installed, I only had to adjust the table tilt a bit to get the blade perpendicular and it was already perpendicular front-to-back.  Then I set about to cut 23 rings out of 5/32-thick laminated boards I am using to make a bowl. The saw is quiet, nearly vibration-free, and efficient, and being able to raise the upper arm is a real help when inserting the blade through a tiny hole in the workpiece. Blade tensioning is easy with the tensioning lever right in front of the upper arm.  No information about durability yet, but this saw was perfect right out of the box.
Secondly, the indicator sleeve could use hash marks at the 45-degree points, which would let you adjust to the nearest 128th of an inch, and interpolate to the 256th of an inch.  Again the guy who works for me can make the change.
  Overall the blade runs fairly quietly and cuts cleanly.  I do get some light tooth marks in hardwoods but they clean up easily.
It was a different story when I sawed through the same 2x4 with the 2 1/2". After drilling the core remained captured within the saw. I took a medium size screwdriver and used it as a lever to gradually free the wood core using the Speed- Slot feature. I worked each side until it came free. Having used Milwaukee hole saws in the past, it was a big deal to sometimes free the cores without this feature.
I know that some claim that the biscuits aren't for alignment but that's nonsense.... since the initially-compressed biscuits expand to fill the slot, then by definition they WILL align the parts.  Or, misalign them if the slots are a little off.  Plate joining seems like a faster alternative to mortise and tenons when the full goodness isn't needed, but this Dewalt isn't a precision instrument.
makes hardwoork easy and fast.

They're made in America (when American made hammers are difficult to find in 2017) and it shows spectacularaly in the products, especially when compared to other brands which are mostly Chinese junk these days. I have owned 6 or 7 Estwings of this type over the years and the quality has either stayed the same or gotten better. My father has probably 15 Eastwings, and I've used pretty much every make and model of hammer you are likely to encounter, so I know a little about the consistiency of the quality.

I've seen guys fiddle around and make their own inserts, but I don't want to waste my shop time (limited) making saw parts, so I plopped down the cash for these boys, and I'm really glad I did.  I made one into a zero-clearance insert, which has greatly decreased the already unlikely probability that my Forrest Woodworker II blade is going to produce tearout on the back side of whatever I'm cutting.  I made the other one into a dado insert, which is also zero-clearance for 3/4" dadoes... It makes your dadoes clean and crisp on the edges.  Plus, if you cut a narrower dado, you can use the same insert, it'll just have a little clearance.

My Bucket Boss junior (smaller) size was a great bag, and for a larger bag I've owned several different manufacturers.  However, I wanted to consolidate my tools and went looking for a larger Bucket Boss.  I am thrilled to have found this one.  This bag is sturdy, with great outside pockets and a lot of inside pockets too.  I jam my tools in there standing up... on the wall of the bag... like a needle nose, screwdriver, and chisel, and the bag has not ripped nor torn.  The handles are a big padded to make carrying it easier too.  Every other bag I've had has had some drawback - one thing that made it suboptimal.  This bag truly has it all and I hope they are still making them in 20 years which is how long I think it'll be before I need to replace it.  The ONLY 1 thing I'd recommend is that they rivet some small metal "feet" onto the bottom of the bag, to rise it about a quarter or half inch off the ground, so that if you set it down on wet or dirty ground, the bottom won't get wet.  PS - it's large enough to hold basically every tool I need for a household job, including a 16V drill and case of drill bits.

Just can't do it because every other framing hammer out there is a downgrade from this model.  My 40 year old Estwing did a lot of work this summer and is still going strong,  This hammer has been through it all.

The hose is twice as long, very flexable and the couplings "thread" on to the hose so no more falling off. Great solution to a frustating problem. As for other reviews stating problems with the size of the couplings I did not experience that. All of the attachments I have worked well with the new hose.

Ok, I've had this base plate for about two years. Actually, it's my second one. I called Rousseau and told them that I think the crown is too high and I think I'm going to have trouble. They told me to route the opening a little lower so that the edges are are a little recessed and then the crown would be parallel to the table or a bit above and it's supposed to work great. They even sent out another plate that less of a crown.

You can just use cauls from soft wood, (like pine 2x4 material) that compresses and conforms to any hardwood being clamped. That trick works GREAT on dovetails or finger joints, and you don't have to make complex cauls! The compress-ability of soft wood automatically applies pressure evenly, so there is no advantage to fancy "parallel' clamps.

The  great thing about these clamps is that they go on and come off in a second,  so you can hold wood down, do what you have to do, then turn the wood,  re-clamp, turn again, etc.  Also, unlike the "vise-style" clamps,  they do not damage wood.
9178	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not really much to say about a product like this, but it seems to be of good quality. There was a small ridge going down a few feet of the outside of the hose, but does not affect the function of the hose, it's just that I can feel it when I pickup the hose.

The ONLY time these blades have ever given me any trouble is that on some grades of very hard and dense woods, if you don't keep the stock moving through the saw fairly quickly, you'll get some burn.  When I anticipate this, I can usually eliminate it by setting the fence just slightly wide on exit.  Slightly, like a few thousandths of an inch.

I suppose if you already own several hole saws, this kit may be too expensive. If you experienced a burglary like I did, and need to replace what you have lost, then this is the answer.
  After that experience, I broke out the hold down that originally came with the saw. Since it is a circa 1950's Sears, the hold down wasn't in the best of shape. It was the kind that sits at the back of the table. I didn't like the arm sticking up, and having to pass through the thin slit of the freshly cut wood. What if I was using a thin kerf blade? I decided instead to take the advice of a professional, and concentrate on not letting the back side of the piece of wood lift up on the fence. With a push stick that has a long tail I was able to do that. I recognize that this is just one more angle priority I have to remember when pushing stock through. Then I got the board buddies.
2113	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	first of this thing is all Plastic!!! second thing is balnce is weird and hard to get used to  but the saw hook is a plus the main reason i rated this saw bad was it got droped off a plank that was no higher than five feet and craked in two and it wasn't even a week old so i geuss i will stay with a mag for now one star for the hook

I built a house with the model 369, dropped it from the rafters onto a concrete slab three times; never bothered the operational abilities. Now, I'm building a large wooden boat and wanted to treat myself to a new saw that had more options; like adjusting the blade depth and angle. I located both the same old model and Model 364K on amazon. Model 364K costs about forty dollars more, but what a difference in the power to cut through wood, ease of changing blades, and of adjusting the bevel angle and depth of cut. I also like the heavier duty electric cord. If the saw lasts for ten years, I'll be very satisfied.

You can spend more, but the Stanley has all the necessary  features- a decent blade, an adjustible throat and solid steel and brass  parts. With a little tuning (a half hour's work with some sandpaper and a  sheet of plate glass) it'll cut as well as the fancy $250 planes. For most  woodworkers it's probably the only hand plane they'll ever need.

5897	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my B&D Piraa trim saw. Wished they were a tad longer but they are so sharp, they will cut your finger off just by looking at them. Good for carving turkeys or butchering deer.
The problem is that the fence itself is about 1-1/4" too long for the spacing between the rails. I measured my table and it is just shy of 14" (13-3/4"). The fence, therefore, is built for a table that is 15".
I find that hole saws accumulate a lot of sawdust which gets caught within the sharp, hook style blades. Instead of relying on sheer force, it's best to stop each third of the way and clean the chips out from the saw. I didn't use the hammer feature on the drill when doing any of the tests but I suspect it would come in handy if cutting through steel.
2395	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you aren't aware of it DeWalt originally produced this 3 legged stand.

They informed me that after NUMEROUS complaints they were going back to ther ORIGINAL style stand. The current stand ia a quality built heavy and solid
8118	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Door slab replacements are a big part of my business.  I have used the original version of this tool for many years.  Admittedly it was somewhat difficult to set up which is why I only used it when I had multiple slabs to install, like door upgrades in condo's or townhouses.  It served me well, however it had become loose and some of the components were worn to a point where I constantly had to check and/or readjust it. Also, parts just weren't available anymore.  This prompted me to purchase PC's updated version.  I can't tell you enough how sweet this tool is compared to what I went through to use the old one.  It takes less than 10 minutes to set up and in the way it's designed it holds all of the adjustments well.  It adapts quickly if I'm retrofitting multiple slabs with different hinge spacing and positions. Using it to relocate hinge mortises on the jambs or taking existing locations and spacing then transferring the locations to a slab or visa versa is the best part.  I had the benefit of working with the old tool first so I had an understanding of the concept and process and what the final result should be.  This why I say that once you've used this tool for a little while and get the "feel" of it, especially if this is your first time with a gauge such as this, you can't help but be pleased. I recommend purchasing part #86018 (3 1/2") jamb gauges from Porter Cable Servicenet.  I bought the one size, since it's the most common hinge, but I use it for all of the other sizes. If you end up buying the 59381 you'll understand why when you read about the jamb gauge's function in the instruction manual.  I hope this helps.  Lots of luck.
  So if you are contemplating getting the Kreg jig assembly, it comes highly recommended. If you are thinking about buying the screws, I recommend you getting the coarse and fine screws in the 1 1/4" format, since they are useful for joining 3/4" wood. Additionally you should get the screw kit with a variety of different length screws for those times when you are dealing with different stock thickness.
Other similar lights like this one are only $9.00.

Now, I read some reviews here and elsewhere that claim Board Buddies "get in the way" of push sticks. That's true to an extent, but for rip-cuts on long or wide boards, that is a non issue. In fact, the way I use these, push sticks are unnecessary. I put the front roller well in front of the blade, and the back roller one inch behind the blade. I view that area between the rollers as a "no hand zone!" I NEVER put my finger beyond the first roller. That gives me a HUGE margin of safety while maintaining positive downward pressure on boards. When I get to the last few inches of a board, I walk around the back of the saw and PULL the board through to finish the cut. That means I do not need an extravagantly large out-feed table to work alone safely.

6083	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great product for the price. It certainly does not cut down on all the dust entering the shop vac, but it definitely removes probably about 60%-70%.

No dust in the air and when chips start exiting the planer the shop vac is full.

Some tips: 1. Don't pitch them in your toolbox or truck bed. These are precision tools and though they are quite strong, they are easily damaged. Use the blade guards that come with them. 2. Don't try to "muscle" them through a board. The old adage of "let the tool do the work" has never been truer. 3. Don't place the blade edge anywhere you don't want a mark left. I think I mentioned that they're very, very, very sharp.
The hold-down clamps are great.  I bought an extra one.

I have one question however... since, in the past I had a custom miter throat plate already made for me... how the HECK do you prep one of these for use in 45 degree miter position?? My unisaw won't crank that low... I would have to butcher the thing since it's sitting at the top of the blade around an inch above the deck height on my unisaw! I'm too freaked out to 'force it down' - worried about reprisal by my blade grabbing...
The fence is about 1/32" out of parallel to the blade, even after adjusting the fence with the two set screws as far as they will go.  This one is going back.  I will try another because the tool is very easy to use, and the price is right.  I hope this isn't a common theme with these joiners...

Thank you, Amazon, for making buying so easy.
  So in conclusion, get some Leecraft inserts, and make sure you have both the standard and dado inserts from the factory. Each has its own purpose. Overall, highly recommended.
Since she didn't have a side table light at camp she used it kind of as a regular lamp, too. It wasn't very bright but just enough for what she needed. It was also better than her flashlight at times because she could clip it to herself and be hands-free. A multi-tasker!
You don't fully appreciate the brilliance of the Workmate until you read about it and it's inventor in the book "The Workbench Book" by Scott Landis.  It sounds silly, but it is truly a riveting story of a young English guy living in an apartment, who needed a workbench, and then persisted when everyone turned him down, to create one of the best selling, most unique, long-lived tools ever.  It's genius!  And you'll see pictures of many of the various versions of the Workmate that have existed.  The first few prototypes are a riot.

Even more poorly done - what I would call a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW: there is absolutely no way to level the 2700XL to your table saw.  After I was done fighting with the nylon mounts I was horrified to find that the 2700XL table sat a good 1/16" below my saw bed.  Try moving the fence across and "clank!"  Its a "no go."  What's worse - apparently not anticipating this, Rousseau incorporates exactly ZERO ways to adjust the height of the table or saw to correct for it.  I was able to get around this eventually by unscrewing the 2700XL table and inserting washers underneath.  Again, I can easily think of several ways to prevent this - for example, mounting the table on adjustable thumbscrews.  Makes you wonder what they are paying their engineers for (?!?)

When you understand all that you can see; though incredibly simple, this device functions on several levels, all cooperating with basic principles of physics.
4844	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought one of these awhile back.  I've used it on numerous projects without any problem.  The motor will strain a bit if you really move into the cut too fast.  Otherwise, the machine is repeatable with a nice fence.  The adjustments for angle, size and depth are easy to manipulate and STAY there once set.
from amazon this is a steal. If you are somewhat handy and a DIY guy (GAL), this is a great tool to have if you are doing any remodeling or as in my case needed to add a bigger opening to fit a slightly larger cook top. The granite guys wanted $150 to do the job.
 If your make a living, or you just do your own household repairs you can't go wrong with this saw. I still have the original model 77 that I bought for $100.00 new back in 1978 in Tuscon AZ. At one of the early big box stores.

1549	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for under cabinet lighting.  So far, everythign is good for the past couple months.  Made sure to use a tissue when handling to keep oils off the lamps.  About the same brightness as the orignals.

3428	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just added this clamp to my new Dewalt DW718 sliding miter saw.  This saw did come with one clamp but I decided that I better have another one for the other side of my material I would be cutting for safety measures. It would have been nice if Dewalt would have included this clamp instead of the one that came with the DW718 but I am sure to keep costs down we are lucky to even get one material hold down clamp. This DW7082 clamp is way better than the one that comes with the saw and is more heavy duty with a quick take-up button that saves a lot of time screwing the threaded rod to tighten the clamp. It would be nice to have both clamps like this one but I can't justify buying another DW7082 clamp seeing as now I have one for each side of the blade. This DW7082 material hold down clamp will now become my primary clamp though and the one that came with the saw will only be used when I think two clamps are really necessary.
Like they do during the day.

8669	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Had this unit for about three years with very light use - occasional tire inflation.  As a previous writer indicated, the gauges got stuck, the pressure release valve froze, it wouldn't start and turned out to be uneconomical to repair.  Basically, as other reviewers on other sites stated...its a piece of junk - Stay away
7689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good
6493	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works just as good as my larger sized ones.
It attaches securely to the side of the saw but the head is TOO HEAVY for the goose neck. It is a very poor design, which is not something that I'd expected from a Dewalt product.  The head and goose neck lower automatically, which is a bad thing. The only way to keep it over the work area is to straddle it over the center bar so that it rests on the other side, making any adjustment almost impossible.  However then it vibrates from the motion of the saw, making it very distracting and difficult to work with.
6367	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like these much better than the spring clamps we all use. It exerts more pressure with an easier release than a spring clamp of similar size. Just squeeze to lock it and it stays put. I used a couple the other day to hold a straight edge for routing dado's. I cut 3/4 x 1/2 deep runs with no slippage from the clamps. When I was done with each one I just squeezed the release and went on to the next . Lickety split. Nice idea !
5279	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I received this and went to put it on my bandsaw's dust collection port...  Turns out it requires another adapter (see "POWERTEC 70148 Dust Control Flex Cuff with Hose Clamps").  Once I got this adapter it worked great.
5283	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	standard stiffener, less vibration but with the quality of the new saws and blades I don't know how neccesary a stiffener is anymore.  Dont forget you loose some blade height with this on...

Now here's the kicker. I am forced to buy a replacement motor from Jet. I wanted to buy a Baldor or Leeson motor. Even a Dayton would be better AND cheaper. But no. Electric motors follow national specifications published by NEMA. NEMA specifies the dimensional characteristics of the mounting plate, shaft diameter, and distance from the mounting plate to the center of the shaft. All critical for a given application, but not with Jet. This motor has all NEMA 56 specs EXCEPT the shaft diameter.
As an added bonus, I have noticed that this directs much more of the sawdust to below the table while compared to the original insert.
1289	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product, priced right! These bulbs last much longer than any I've previously owned. They arrive meticulously packaged: each bulb is inside its own small plastic bag, in its own box, and finally shrink-wrapped in a group of 10 boxes! The build quality of the bulb is noticeably "heftier" than the previous bulbs I was using. Very happy with this product and will DEFINITELY reorder!

Great saw, R.C.
4773	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have used this plate joiner for several months now and i absolutely love it. I have not had to adjust anything from the factory settings. It just works.
8877	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had my 2700xl for a few months now. I must say ," Bravo Rousseau." I formerly had the trojan tablesaw stand for my old Makita 2708. I almost got another one for my new makita 2703. I'm glad I didn't.  Don't get me wrong, the trojans are very nice . I love the hand truck  design. It's very portable. Regardless, I decided on the 2700 xl. The fit  and finish are superior. It provides a wider and deeper platform for more  stability. The construction is heavier. The fence is both larger and more  refined. The side board is actual formica top and bottom, not thin melamine  on only one side ,like on the Trojan. Probably the most important difference  is that the saw is not mounted permanently in the stand. If you buy the  trojan you are stuck with the whole contraption all the time. Not good if  you just want to make a few quick cuts on small material. With the Rousseau  you have the option of using the saw alone or in the stand. I highly  recommend the 2700xl. ( or the 2700 if you have a different saw ) It makes  ripping large sheet goods a breeze. Even if you are alone. It extends the  rip capacity to 28 inches . If you require more, extentions are available.  The fence is very sturdy just like the rest of the unit. It is very  accurate, easy to adjust and very smooth. If you are concerned about the  saw moving around or being loose because of not being permanently mounted,  don't be. Rousseau's engineers devised a very simple yet sturdy and fully  adjustable temporary mounting system. Pop the saw in and it doesn't budge.  Pop it back out just like that. It doesn't get any better than this. I also  bought the outfeed table. With it even long stock is a snap. No dancing  around the spinning blade to complete cuts from the back side. It supports  4x8 sheet goods very well. The whole thing is well engineered and well  built. Buy one, it could save your back, or maybe even your fingers. I wish  everything was as useful as my Rousseau.
It's built well, works well, and it's priced right.  What more do you need?
My conscience told me over and over to install a splitter so I bought the 78-431.

2936	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought the dewalt drill for Christmas and wanted to get a flashlight that uses same battery.  My husband was very pleased with his gift.
5731	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Purchases as a Christmas present for my husband but the old router/table that I purchased it to replaced broke, ironically enough, on the same exact day that the "gift" arrived!  Needless to say, I gave it to him early!  He loved it.  His new PC Router works great with it and he's happy to have 2x the table room that he had on the old router table... I like the fact that the shop-vac can be hooked up to it to collect the dust (I past the time away cleaning up the messes he makes!) :)  Loved the free shipping and since it isn't available in the Rockler stores (only online), the price was great!
7588	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I enjoy the Milwaukee Rip fence and use it when required. It is durable and functioned well. My only wish is that it was included with the saw purchase. I would not have minded paying a bit more to have had the fence included with the saw
As a musician who absolutely cannot risk any injury to my hands, I find this method with these devices gives me a HUGE margin of safety, and a greater sense of confidence for rip-cuts.
Perhaps the chief benefit of these screws is that you don't need pilot holes, since the self drilling point does that job perfectly.
9100	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
As I said I am a remodeling contractor. Most of my tools are the black and yellow, Dewalt. I would rather count how many of their tools that I do NOT have than count what I do have of theirs. I like Dewalt a lot and I have invested deeply in their tools. In general they are very good but a few of their tools I use constantly have some very glaring issues, but In general they are very good.
7227	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	On the money walk up to the miter box no tape,  no pencil, no problem, set the guide cut the wood, good to go. Do that fifty times a day and you saved $30.00 easy. If your making raised panel doors you have 200 parts or more on 40 doors, boom you saved $80.00 and they have to be dead on to be perfect. There is no other way.

3715	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this sander and tried it on a group of pine butt jointed boards.  It is too unstable.  It tends to tip at the slightest opportunity towards the motor side.  Even a slight pressure on the back causes a gash in your work.  I spent more time removing scrapes and gashes than smoothing my work.  Very frustrating.  I am going to try a different brand as the others seemed to be more stable in the store and didn't tip so easily.
5353	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	doesn't fit needs a coupling
Another great  feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth,  the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near  the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it's hard to  control.  Also, the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it's  easy and safe to grab.  Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream.  The  markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand.  On some saws the  shoe is thin and "bendy" or too narrow.  This one is almost perfect.
4759	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	these are my favorite blades I have come across so far.  I am a 20 year cabinet installer veteran and I go through my fair share of saw blades.  These blades are great for general cutting of hardwoods, melamine, and plywood's.  They are not to aggressive as to tear out delicate veneers but aggressive enough to cut hardwood with out any trouble.  bet all all around blade in my opinion.
4709	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wish they made a blade with a standard kerf. I prefer the stiffness of the thicker blade. it allows for a smoother and slightly more accurate cut. This blade is better than the standard blade that came with my DeWalt Miter Saw. It's also better than a DeWalt I purchased with more teeth.
1129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Super buy for the money and they work great.

The tool can be very versatile, and is limited by your imagination and ability to make a custom jig.  But as for out of the box, it does what it says and well, but don't expect to sharpen every piece of steel in your house with it without a lot of extra effort, unless you have extreme confidence in your hand, in which case you might not need this machine.
Height and length adjustments are easy and firm.

In short. I'm happy...now. I was not at all happy throughout what should have been an easy assembly process. I hope it was an isolated incident. If it was, then I'd recommend the table (buy a switch, too). But if this is par for Bench Dog's course, well, you might as well save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere. As for me, I have to dock them a couple stars, because it was really carelessly prepped and packaged.
6072	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Other reviews indicate a design flaw requiring adding a piece to direct the input away from the output. I'm sure this might help. Especially in the case of  very fine drywall dust. But for coffee chaff or regular sawdust or ground coffee it seems unnecessary.
By having extras on hand I just send them out for sharpening once in a while. I sharpen my own jointer blades usually, but I find it a lot easier to send out planer blades, especially if I have a saw blade or two needing sharpening as well.
  Loud, very noisy loud.
1725	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	An amazing tool.  Versatile, high-powered, highly effective.  Have had 2 of them over the course of 40 years.  For any size job this is a must-have tool


2057	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	In a sense this is the most straightforward of routers.  It has five running speeds - 10,000, 13,000, 16,000, 19,000 and 21,000 rpm.  It has a straightforward design reminiscent of the 690, and it has enough power to turn the hardest wood into sawdust.  In fact, it has more horsepower (but less torque) than many shapers.  Despite the soft-start feature there is a definite jerk when you start it up - this is a big machine.  Too big for most home hobbyist needs, as a matter of fact.
5403	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I needed these for some cabinets I was building out of birch ply. They really match pretty well except with really dark patches on the birch. You do have to shorten them to fit into the hole depending on your screw depth. I have a large bench sander and I just put the end that goes towards the screw up against the spinning sanding disk and ground off what was needed. And you only need a small dab of wood glue in the hole. If you use to much you will make a big mess.

788	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Product is as described and so far so good, no problems with install; pins are sturdy. Bulbs seem to be of a better quality than what is offered at the local hardware big box stores. Huge bang for your buck, good value, bulbs have not blown out and will probably last longer than the expensive bulbs that were previously purchased at local hardware store. Will definitely purchase this again in the future when needed. September 2014-Ok had to update my review, Bulb completely blew out and shattered particles everywhere, will not buy this product again and will be discarding the remainder of the unused bulbs for safety reasons  (NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES). This bulb was used in a bathroom light fixture, will be going back to buying the box store brand, since past experience has shown that it is safer to use because it did not explode when it burnt out. Furthermore after reading various materials on exploding bulbs, we are planning to entirely replace the current bathroom fixture that utilize the halogen bulb with one that does not. On a positive note, we were very grateful that no one was physically seriously injured because had they had been standing directly at the vanity at the time the bulb exploded, it probably would have been a totally different story!
These work fine, easy to buy them here, but you are buying them because you have to not because you want to - you already have the flashlight - so who cares?  They only seem to break when the light is dropped, and not even then most of the time.
3223	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	What a pain in the butt to put together. Also, be aware that it will only go down to 16 inches in  width because of the rear lift wheel. I bought it for a jet jointer and as most jointers go they are very narrow bases, so this cant be made tight. Its strong but just a pain to assemble. I'm not sure if Id buy another UPDATE actually after getting it all together,it does require some patience, it really is a pretty good stand. The size as far as my jointer goes worked out well and the few inches extra width I think helped stabilize it better. Don't try to get it too tight, the bolt heads stick out and you lose some size. But actually I kinda like it and would probably get another

Not only did this cut through wood with no effort, but the hole saws in this kit can also cut through thin mild steel with no problem. And after all this cutting, the hole saws used look none the worse for wear. The way they're designed, its easy to get the wood plug out also. Made in USA  BUT the metal used to manufacture these may be from other countries.

6230	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've owned this saw for 3 years, during which it has seen occasional use for countless projects.  Most recently, I used it during the demolition phase of a deck remodeling project, and it was indispensable.  I particularly appreciate the fact that all controls are easy to operate while wearing heavy work gloves.  Beyond that, I don't have much to add to the many other positive reviews on this site.  Highly recommended.  So, why only 4 stars?  On my unit, the shoe release lever plate broke after about a year of relatively light use.  This is the metal piece that turns the retainer bar when you adjust the shoe.  It still works if I am really careful when I move the adjustment lever, but if not, the lever slips and fails to lock and/or release the shoe.  Looking at the broken piece, it seems like it's a little on the flimsy side for a tool that is otherwise built so well.  Hopefully, Milwaukee will take notice and improve this part.  I'll update this review when I eventually get around to ordering a replacement.
Scroll sawing is absolutely fun on this machine. After I finished the installation, I tested the saw, then immediately started a project, just to have an excuse to use my new saw.

5688	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For the price, this is the best router table available. Well built, sturdy, and I expect to get a lifetime of use out of it. No room for a full-size table, and I need something a little portable. This works well. Would like to see a better mounting plate. This one is OK, but it's really the weak point of the table. I'll use this one until it dies and then have one fabricated out of metal. Haviong said that, I don't expect this mounting plate to futz out on me any time soon. I'm a hard core DIY-er with investment properties, so this doesn't see daily use, but when I do use it I'm making a whole house worth of mouldings and railings. The instructions could be a little more clear and be fully prepared to have several dozen extra nuts and bolts left over. Other than that this is a great router table, better than many of the plastic models out there. The fit and finish on this is top notch. Buy it and don't look back.


I personally forget how to close the unit up for storage and have to refer back to the instruction sheet--a senior moment.

Batteries have lasted forever - haven't replaced them once yet.  The clip is very solid.  The only minor complaint might be that the base might be too light to simply set it on a desk and be able to move the light very far off a center point over the base.  But if they made it heavier it would be cumbersome when attached to a book which is how most people would use this.  Great product!

Nonetheless, they do a great job of drawing the cabinet frames completely tight, while allowing you to make slight adjustments towards and away from the wall, so that the alignment is perfect...and then allow you to drill and insert trim-head screws to keep that perfect alignment.

3675	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I wanted a belt sander for quickly removing a lot of wood, but I also wanted it to be light enough to use vertically or overhead if necessary.  Belt changes are easy and it is not too noisy.  The dust port does clog easily unless you connect it to a shop vac.  I would get the fixed speed version of this sander for a few dollars less since most only use a belt sander for aggressive sanding.

Good price and free shipping from Amazon.

I could never have done it alone and even with the help of two other people at my disposle, which I didn't have, wouldn't have been as convenient as using this wonderful invention. With the ressesed cans for lighting in the basement I just cranked up a 4 by 8 by 1/2 inch thick sheet tight to the cans and used a rotozip with a bit designed to ride along the outside edge of the can or outlet box, and buzzed the wholes out then cranked the rock up the last inch and screwed it up tight.

UPDATE:  After several months of use, the collets are now fitting both routers. The threads must have needed to be broken in. I use the 1/4" bits often with no issues. But I do prefer 1/2" bits whenever possible.

I mostly use hardwoods, and thickness's up to 1" so blade selection and speed are going to be critical items. So far I probably have spent 10-15 hours just practicing, using differant woods, blades, speeds, feed rate, etc., and taking a few notes to help later on. I am very happy with the results so far. Have made two sets of decorative hinges out of mesquite and am very pleased with the small kerf I was able to achieve and how well they fit and function. They took a bit of time to produce, but I know that will change as I become more practiced and comfortable with the machine's ability and of course my own.
8860	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Be careful, it is sharp.  Works well, handles wood with ease and well worth the price.  Recommend for those who know how to use this type of tool.
7468	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I expected, for a great price.
I definitely like the screwdriver, but it would be nice if it had just a little more power.  For this reason, I'd give it four stars in an ideal world, but compared to the other power screwdrivers in the market I'll give it five.  Being that it is for home use, I expect it to last quite some time.

Overall I cannot say enough good things about this saw.  Its relatively light, very accurate, powerful, and feels like it will outlast me.  Buy one yourself and you won't be sorry!
These stellar results were repeated time after time on all the cabinet back panels and side panels.  I realize that this dado set was right out of the box and therefore the blades and chippers were probably the sharpest they will ever be, but if the exceptional results I got on this project is any predictor of how this dado set will perform over time then I know that I made a very good purchase and the money was well spent.

On the flip side, this light's reflection will not blind you when under the car working. It puts out just the amount of light needed, and the swivel head helps direct things nicely. Looks like some reviewers got the spare bulbs with theirs, and some did not... we were on the 'did not' side of things, but that is OK. Already have a couple spares order and sitting in my shopping cart waiting for me to checkout.
As nearly always, the dust extraction nozzle was broken in transit.  Packaging secures only the bottom of the machine--not well at that--and nothing protects the top.  However, Makita covers the damage under warranty and Acme Tools (authorized repairer) fixed it in two weeks.  My thinking when I purchased the sander was to handle it this way.  The quality of the sander is worth the inconvenience of warranty repair and it makes no sense to return it for exchange given and 80/20 chance the replacement would suffer the same breakage.
8156	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just awesome. Love it.

Also, Porter Cable needs to offer a better warranty.  The fact that they only offer a 1 year warranty concerns me.  To me, it means that they are not confident in their product.  Milwaukee on the other hand, offers a LIFETIME warranty.
* The weight is perfect in my opinion. I wouldn't use it to trim laminate but it's very easy to control freehand and highly stable. You want a tool to be the right weight, not as light as possible and this one feels just right. I also felt very little vibration.
Given the price of these I am tempted to find sockets to replace the florescent in my grow bed.
3199	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Being a rank beginner to woodworking but not to power tools, I purchased this miter saw as a starting point to my woodworking hobby.  I needed it to construct the window seat frame in our new log home.  After 10 cuts on 2x4's, the switch shorted out on the saw.  I contacted Bosch and found a tool supply store who could do the warranty work - simply replacing the defective switch.  After 4 weeks, they finally received the switch from Bosch and I was back in business.  They stopped carrying Bosch tools because of the delays in getting parts and orders from Bosch.  If I had ordered a Makita or Hitachi saw, I would have been repaired in less than a week.  I'm glad I bought the saw but it was a toss-up between the other 2 and $$$ was a factor.

I purchased this item because I really needed to make my dust collector two-stage. It was getting immediately clogged by both my planer and jointer's large chips. I wasn't willing or able to shell out money for a larger unit, and material costs and time to build my own would've added up to more than this item.

2504	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm a new home-owner, and was in the market for a drill.  I realize that cordless drills are significantly more convenient than corded, but that comes at a price, both monetary and performance.  This drill is fantastic!  It has a ridiculous amount of power, and feels great in the hand.
3526	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought the drill to suplement the use of my light duty Milwaukee cordless. The quality is about on par with the others in the same price range. The plastic isn't what it used to be when they were made in the US. I think mine is made in Mexico or China. I have some of the older US made Milwaukee tools and those are very smooth and durable. The new plastic feels a little thiner. I don't feel that I'm going to break it but it's still not as nice as they used to be.
  Then I looked at the Jorgensen's. They have their Cabinet Master Parallel steel line, which is aimed at competing with the Bessey K-Clamps. They have a wider face on them, so you can lay a clamp on its side, and get a longer clamping surface. With the Bessey's that is possible, albeit a slightly narrower surface. Myself, I choose to use a couple of inch thick straight oak piece as a wedge, giving me all the clamping surface I need.

5036	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	An excellent blade.  I did not believe the claims of "gluable" and "joiner" quality cuts, but it's true.  I think it's a combination of the thin curf and the blade quality, but it feels like I've  added another horse or two to my saw motor.  I also bought the stabilizer  right off.  The blade is obviously more expensive, but the quality of the  cut is so good it's hard to even compare the WWII with standard  blades.
7655	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Using this mostly for electrical work.  For anything bigger I would recommend a little more weight - 23 oz is a favorite.  This one is great for what it is and for electrical it's a very good hammer!

I love the size, weight and balance of this saw, and it doesn't seem to lack for power either.  It does seem loud for it's size and power.  High quality carbide-toothed blades are difficult to impossible to find for this saw, which is a pity because I would love to get more use out of it than I do now.  For cutting laminate and composite materials cleanly, there's just no getting around using a high tooth count carbide tipped blade, which as far as I am aware, is not an option for this saw.

LATEST DISCOVERY: I didn't realize why the clip worked so very well. It's because it has small, soft rubber pads inside the mouth of the clip, which ensure even better grip without so much pressure. It clips onto various places on my laptop or sits with the tiniest footprint on its stable base (because of the battery weight), right up against the keyboard.

5484	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop. The owner had three routers - all M12's.  This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router. In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines. After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking. On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.  I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.  The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.  Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.  If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
5760	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just used this kit for the first time. I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue (specially made for melamine) The set up time was 15 minutes, so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order. This glue kit, using the glue roller did a nice job. It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly. The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container. You can easily see the flow, so guesstimating is pretty easy.

Note: it comes with 2 small rectangular bars, about 10-12" long but I couldn't find reference to them in the manual. Of course I played with the unit and router to get familiar. I remember reading about having the adjustable outfeed part of the fence, but this fence is a long one-piece. Ahaa, that's when I realized those aluminum bars can slip between the fence and the MDF facing in slots. Bingo. The bars are rectangular to provide two choices for the outside offset space.

4309	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this saw mid-December.  It arrived within a week and the saw looked great.  Very little assembly required.  The rails were damaged, looked like a forklift had driven over them and flattened one end.  Called Amazon and they said they'd ship new rails from the Jet factory within 7-10 working days.  That was more than a month ago.  So, I can crosscut, but no fence yet.  The saw deserves 5 stars; poor parts replacement drops it to 4 stars.  Fit and finish are excellent; quality is obvious with every part of the saw.  I would buy again in a heartbeat, but probably from a local dealer so I can pick it up myself.

Anti-vibration.  I don't know the technical nuances of how Milwaukee cancels out the vibration, but this saw is the smoothest (from an operator's standpoint) saw I've ever used.  Any recip saw can truly rattle your fillings when it binds, but fortunately this Milwaukee has anti-vibration and a clutch, that genuinely minimizes feedback to the operator.
6365	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this one after I saw a fellow at a local lumber yard with one. He was sold on it. The Amazon price is the best I found, too.
  One review made mention of the end caps or lips on the level. I found a very small build up of paint on one end. Once the unit is put through the zero setup procedure, this build up should not come into play. A piece of sand paper on a flat work bench to "lap" the end would fix it. Agreed, this would "blemish" the looks of the paint, but it would make it true from one end to the other. I for one, could not send the tool back because of this.
So, I changed my ways. I bought this sander for finishing work, and let me tell you: it's awesome. It's ergonomic and almost completely vibration-free. It's pretty quiet... and it still packs quite a punch. It takes cheap sheet paper, too, so you're not bleeding money as quickly as you would with sanding discs. The only caveats to keep in mind is that it doesn't come with dust extraction; and in part because of no forced airflow, it gets warm after a while.
2388	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are a lot of tools I buy that are not Porter-Cable, but I have always been happy with their routers so all my routers are Porter-Cable. The trim router is definitely not a great choice for everything, but is great for smaller stuff as it can be handled with one hand and is quick to get the work done. The set-up is not as precise but is fast and easy to use, such as round overs on trim. If you need a bigger router for heavier and more precise work I use the 690LR and it is also a great router.
8836	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I do a lot of furniture restoration, and amateur woodworking.  I have wanted one of these saws for quite some time and finally searched for one on Amazon.  The price was very good, and since making the purchase, I have had numerous opportunities to use it.  I have been very pleased.  The saw has a course tooth side and a fine tooth side.  I generally use the finer teeth since it is easier to pull the saw, and you get a finer cut.  The blade is replaceable, but even after a lot of use, I haven't noticed any difference in the speed of the cutting.  Just a good saw.
2118	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So I was a bit hesitant to purchase this because I don't have the exact models the description says it works for.  I have the 7346sp, which is the sander and polisher.  I got it to fit after loosening up the adjustment screw all the way, and used a little brute force to get it on.  I have a Rigid shop vac, and the hose or supplied adapters didn't fit.  Went to the store and got the nipple looking adapter for $10 and it fit.  Dont order the adapter online.  It cost 2-3xs the price at the store.

C) It might hold 550 pounds of dead weight (as advertised on the box) but the mechanism will never apply that much pressure through the vise. The bench dogs can only hold a modest amount of pressure before they come flying out.
1828	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this sander as a replacement for the same model that I purchased about 30 years ago. The old one still works after constant use making furniture, toys and other projects. Most of my work now is making toys and puzzles for Grandchildren and craft fairs so it gets quite a bit of use. The best features of the tool are that it DOES take a 1/4 sheet of sandpaper. It is comfortable to use for prolonged periods of time. It can be used to round sharp edges and get into difficult spots as well as the normal flat surfaces. The true orbit speed leaves a satin smooth surface without swirl marks on soft or hard wood. The old sander is now vibrating more than it should so I plan on having it reconditioned and the rubber posts replaced. I'll be happy to keep the old friend as a spare! I would definite advise anyone looking to purchase a finishing sander to look no further than the Speed-Bloc You won't be disappointed.
Given this kind of horrible quality control, I cannot be sure that the rest of the saw is made properly.  The guide rails and the fence are two things I can visually inspect. But how about the motor, the trunnions, and the gear assemblies inside?

452	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As  most people seem to agree, this is a really bright little light, but what I really like about it is that the clamp on it opens wide, and grips well. I used it as a light on my drill press, and it is perfect. I can clamp it in several different areas, and it holds. It is also long enough that the flex-neck lets me aim it at any angle I need it. It is better than I expected it to be!

7316	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	definitely go to Kreg's website and download their plan for an in-built cabinet with slide-out router bit drawers.  Their dimensions are spot on and it's a great weekend project.  Otherwise the fence dust collector alone will only capture 20-30% of the dust from what I can tell.  You need to box this thing in.  It's easy (and kinda fun) to do though.  The table itself is built like a tank.  The fence is in many pieces as is the table, so give yourself a few hours to get it all buttoned up.  You'll love this thing.  Lots of room to work with and very versatile.

2204	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have had this saw for over a year now, but I only used very briefly until about 3 months ago. I had a major remodeling project done in the house and I used saw heavily on cutting Brazilian cherry floor planks, walnut for the trim, and some moldings. I never used other miter saw or sliding compound miter saw before this one. So my review is solely based on using this saw. When I bought it, I wanted the best based on my own research on the subject. So here is my findings from the use of saw and hope it will give you what you looking for in a tool review.

The spacers and shims aren't marked as such, but a few moments' thought solved the problem. The only real problem with this item is that the instructions are tiny to the point of being unreadable. A separate instruction sheet would be very helpful.
3.  The length is great as it allows me to get anywhere I want to in my shop without having to move the compressor.  The bright color makes it easy to spot and is a great safety feature!!  Dark hoses tend to blend in and are easy to trip over.

I found I could clip mine directly on my Kindle cover and read lying flat in bed if I so desired. When I turned on my side, the light moved with the Kindle, so the reading was uninterrupted.  It has two little lights and you can choose to use one or both depending on how much light you need.  Good buy!

I haven't tried this set but expect similar results. Only differences will be my ability to create deeper dados and of course more draw on the motor upon power up and use.

cons: none
I trimmed about 25 of the remaining sheets of O.S.B. for use on future projects cutting about 16 foot on each sheet, 4 foot on both ends and the 8 foot long top edge.  This saw gave me great results.  It also does a great job on 2x lumber for cross cutting and ripping.  It is small and light weight and it will make a professional out of the average user in a hurry.

I don't find it any noisier than my other router. In fact I believe that it is quieter with the exception of a high frequency tone at the higher speeds than my other router, (Craftsman 1 1/2 HP). I highly recommend the FREUD FT2000 for table mounting and heay duty work.
I was disappointed on the purchase of this item.
PS. Respect your purchase get a mobile cart. At 300lbs. you and your saw will both appreciate it. Room or no room.
I could not find this information anywhere in the description.  I took a chance and it works very well.  I bought this primarly to move the blade slightly to the right so I would not have to disassemble my saw to move the entire assemly to the right.  This was required to mount the blade guard.

They're easy to stow and move around and they cover a lot of bases with little fuss. There are more stable platforms that you can buy. Or you can build them using this workbench.

But I had a project to do some asphalt cutting on my driveway, where I calculated a requirement for a nearly 3" depth of cut, and hence went looking for an affordable circular saw in this size range.


  I guess I am getting wordy. Bessey's rock. They are stronger, (heard a crunching sound when I tightened one up against the edge of some fresh glued melamine, so go gently) heavier duty, precise (unless you over tighten and temporarily warp the bar, which causes a miniscule off angle. I know I am getting critical here.) And they look cool sitting on the rack.
** 2  hand sander
5509	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I looked at this router and bought a Makita.  The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.  I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.  If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
Straight-edges require that the base-plate or "shoe" must track parallel to the guide. Although all manufacturers know this, few have addressed the issue of adjustment in their designs.

4581	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this when cutting sheet stock.  The Board Buddies not only hold the stock down against the table, they draw the stock to the rip fence.  Helps a lot.
This saw runs smooth and quiet, no user fatigue after  hours of use.  The adjustable shoe is real handy, another feature new to me  after the Makita.  If this tool lasts as well as it runs, you'll never need  another recip saw.  I don't see how they could come out with a better tool,  unless it would run itself on voice command while you sat back and watched!  Maybe next Millenium.
7165	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This one is my third Forrest Blade.  I have one on both my portable and bench table saws.  This one is on a Makita L1013 Sliding Miter Saw and, like the others, it cuts so smooth that planing is not required.  I have purchased cheaper and more expensive blades, but none equal this in performance.
9014	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good

So... there's my opinion.  I consistently rate this as the worst purchase I ever made as far as tools go.  Save yourself some money and buy the profiles separately.  All by themselves, they're usable.  Attached to the aggressive sander, they last about 3 minutes before you're burning rubber.

5960	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good bye tear out!

One gripe:I found that 2 of the mounting bracket holes were a bit off which created a gap between the miter slot and the table. No matter how much I tweaked the other bolts I could not eliminate the gap as the directions tell you.  I ended up drilling out the holes slightly bigger and that took care of it.
4) Honed the blade, but that is a requirement for all planes.
2) The case is heavy and very sturdy. It holds all 12 saws, 3 drill bits, one conversion card, and one card.

3142	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works fine/quick cut/blade lasts what else can i say of it,um well it sure is a purdy blade
1.  Even with all the profiles there will be some times that they don't fit but by rotating the sander I generally get it to fit pretty close. I never have worn through a pad and gotten a black mark and do some pretty aggressive sanding (makes up for poor cutting).  So I haven't had that problem.  If you want to save a little money and get more variety on sand paper try this.  I use regular sandpaper and spray the back with a 3M adhesive (#77).  That will stay tacky for about 30 minutes so don't do to much.  They stay on the profile fine and I am currently using some #50 to rough sand the trough for New Yankee Workship marble roll.
5812	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good quality product, cuts very clean with very little chip-out in plywood.

5133	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this DC about three months ago from Amazon (great deal with no tax, no shipping - 3 day FedEx!, and $25 off). Assembly was easy and fast, taking a little over a half an hour. The instructions where acceptable, but putting it together is straightforward anyway. I used thread locker on the nuts/bolts which is a good idea for stationary machines. I rewired mine for 230V operation which is wise if you have the voltage in your shop. The rewire was very easy and quickly done. The five foot hose that is included is of very high quality, but unfortunately too short for most applications. The machine really moves a lot of air, and you must take care not to suck up large pieces of wood. Small pieces of thin wood doesn't seem to be an issue, but still should be avoided. When using the DC to vacuum up the floor after a day's work, use extreme care not to draw metal parts or anything other than wood shavings/dust/chips. The noise level isn't unbearable but I still wear muffs especially when using it in conjunction with another tool. I only use one port and hook it up to one machine at a time, so I can't rate its ability to draw dust and chips from two machines simultaneously - though I suspect it would be fine. The bag still leaches some dust into the air, so either wear a lightweight respirator or have an air cleaner in your shop. All in all I am pleased with my purchase and my shop is much cleaner now. I would rate this 4.5 stars, but always round down in these cases.


3629	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This thing is too big to work with and awkward to hold.  The profile holders come off the machine during use and the adhesive paper doesn't hold to them well.  The H&L paper work well on the triangle foot, but you can get something easier to user for a lot less money.  All in all you need something smaller, lighter and with (wire or other) clambs to hold the paper.
Assembly is a snap - the only thing you have to assemble is put in a few screws to attach the table as well as the front guard - that took me all of 4 minutes to put that together.
1206	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Work great and product accurate
6023	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It is a great product. FIts perfectly, including allowances for height adjustment, and works just like it should. I wish I had done this years earlier. I suggest also buying the RIPPER for grip, and between the two of them, you can do 1/8 of inch strips easily and safely.
4583	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This cuts through wood like butter and is accurate. Only draw back is that it will tear out every other hole causing me to spend a lot of time cleaning up the slots. Other then that, it works as it should.
The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life, unlike the the itty-bittys, which I found went through batteries like crazy. Of course, the LED "bulbs" don't burn out like the itty-bitty blubs (and the XtraFlex2 doesn't heat up from its bulbs, either). The XtraFlex2's integrated battery pack is also great; no getting tangled up in a cord while you're in bed.
Once I had this handy little workmate I kept (and still do) finding more and more uses for it.  I build a lot of birdhouses, birdfeeders and do some picture framing.  I use this little adjustable table all the time.  I also do a lot of art work which calls for the use of ceramic tiles, wood, gourds, sticks (I make and carve canes), and the list goes on.

16 oz is a good weight for most things. I had my original from school, and that 16 oz helped frame a house, chisel, trim work and much more.  Yes, regardless what you read, this hammer will drive 16 D and 20D nails, it just takes more whacks to sink them than it would with a framing hammer.

  Since the adjusting screws are now the contact point for the base, you are now given a lot more freedom in routing the opening. For one, you don't have to rout up to the edge all the way around. You can rout to just one depth, and for example create 45 degree angle corner shelves under the plate, thereby creating greater overall stability of the greater table.
1067	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	appears to be a quality product.....my experience with rope lighting quality comes with the length of time you use it and whether or not sections start to fail. These are the first LED rope lights I have purchased and from what I can see there is not an option to cut the length shorter so this might be something to consider with your application when deciding between standard and LED rope lighting. These also have fuses in the plug head....not sure if this will give it a longer life or not...guess you will have to stock some fuses just in case the go out.

I knocked off one star because after a couple months of use, one of the clear plastic lenses that covers the LED fell off. The light still worked so I super glued the clear lens to the rest of it. It may have been due to steam from cooking but honestly, we don't do that kind of cooking that often. It's now been months since I glued it and it has stayed attached and the other lens never fell off.
6189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These clamps seem a bit flimsy and lightweight, but was surprised how tightly they hold the angle clamp to the workbench. Pleased so far.
Having the ability to lift the upper arm is a great benefit. It would be nice if it were engineered to stay in place by itself rather than requiring you to hold it while moving your work piece. Not a real issue, but it is a minor inconvenience.

The long reach is super; saves always dragging the vacuum unit, just for an extra foot of reach.  Note: The claw attachment works great, and it fits just fine. (I think I read someone complain about it not fitting.)  This attachment, on first try, feels like it won't fit--but it does.  It's a snug fit, that's all.  This hose replaced a heavily used, taped up with duct tap, falling apart hose on my old Craftsman vac.  When my neighbor saw the new hose, she said, "Oh, you got a new vac?"  Actually, I bought the vac in 1976!  It's been hiding in the corner, looking like junk, neglected for years.  This new hose resurrected it!

7969	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	First I need to preface this review with the admission that I am an absolute incompetent (klutz) when it comes to tools and to making things.  Yet, despite it all, I have a barn, storage shed (two of these) and garage that are just packed with various implements that I have picked up over the years; from stores on a whim and at auctions. I have absolutely no clue as to what many of these tools are used for...I just like having them around for some reason.  Secondly, you could search the land far and wide to find an individual more incompetent in handling tools, building things and fixing things.  Now, that being said....
I used maple for the frame, and it's remarkably bouncy once locked down. I'm okay with a little bit of movement to sacrifice for a mobile base, but this is a little more than I'm okay with.
3640	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Powerful, relatively light weight and Porter Cable quality....Enough said.
4648	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this for my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw.  As it is supposed to, the negative hook angle on the teeth seems to push the wood down onto the lower table instead of trying to pick it up like more aggressive blades.  The edge it leaves is fantastic.  I've cut red oak, walnut and hard maple on it and the end/miter grain is glue ready and glass-smooth.  I have recommended this blade to other woodworkers.
4768	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I sanded my heavily damaged wood floors in my 800 square foot house. My only complaint was the dust extraction system would often clog up. It would require either a good vacuuming or removing 4 screws and cleaning the inside. If I had an air compressor this wouldn't have been an issue.
3399	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent clamp. Sturdy and well built.  With all the emphasis in the reviews on the "wobble" I really expected it to be looser than it is once seated. It moves just a little bit, maybe 1/8th of an inch if that, and like the reviews say once tightened down its rock solid.  This clamp is bigger than I'd imagined and really seems well made. I don't feel like I got taken, the price is high but I'm happy with what I received for my money (No I don't work for DeWalt).  Buy this clamp it's worth having.
So in summary, it works after some setup and tuning. It is not the greatest option for making mortises, but for the price, and not having to buy a dedicated machine it does work.
4556	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you have Board buddies this is a great accessory.  The track allows you to move the Buddies without remounting them on different areas of your fence.  It saves alot of time.  I attached a 1" x 3" x 3' piece of pine on the side of my fence and then mounted the track on top of that.  I didn't really see a way to mount the track directly on the fence.  I can't say enough about this product.  It is a must have.
Also, the clip/battery assembly is huge - i wish it was more low profile.
3327	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a really nice lite and it really helps to see what you are doing. I think that it should come with the saw for what the saw cost. Not sure if I`d buy again.
Fourth, the keyway in the hold-down cap was so badly done that I had to take a drill and a file to it in order to enlarge it enough so that the screw head could pass through it.  Until I did that, it was possible to remove the blade for sharpening ONLY by removing the screw completely.

4074	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product. Works great. Spent the money and get this excellent blade set up. Won't be disappointed.
9868	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I gotta say that this torpedo level is a nice size, has a lot of features and looks great.  However, one critical component is lacking...they filled the vials with too much liquid making the bubble so small it's nearly impossible to get an accurate measurement.  I picked up a 9" Swanson torpedo at the same time (just in case) and it's a much easier-to-read level, just like my Stabilas.  The Checkpoint is going back.

The WM 425 unit is fairly easy to set up, though the instructions can be a bit cryptic. It comes mostly assembled, but for the table tops. One problem I had was that the two screw mechanisms were out of alignment, and I found it wasn't really easy to adjust them. Another thing that I found difficult to do was use the included "wrench" tool to secure the bolts - the included wrench is made of plastic and shaped like a wing nut, and though I think I'm a fairly strong guy I found it took a lot of energy to get a nice tight fit using that tool. I switched to using a socket wrench which made the process easier and faster. But it all worked out, and after a half an hour I had this thing together without too much hassle.

Rectangular Bars in fact ARE more rigid ...until you apply high pressure. Aluminum is not nearly as strong as steel, so thin aluminum bars flex, which skews the clamping heads and therefore negates the so-called advantage of parallel clamping heads. Therefore, if you need high clamping pressure to pull large panels together, these are a better deal.

Sure it may fit inside your air cleaner, but the filter pockets are about 3" shorter than original/authentic filter.  And in the world of filters that is what you are paying for is that filter element material.  Mine arrived with manufactures labels obviously removed (label adhesive and remnants of paper backing was still present on the side frames) because the seller did not want you to see that this is not a real Delta product and did not want you to see its true origin.
I am disappointed in the pressure foot. While it is large enough, the design is flawed. When you lower the pressure foot on your work piece and tighten the thumb screw, it continues to lower the foot, increasing the pressure on the work piece, making it too tight to move it easily or accurately. If you lift it off a little and then tighten it, there in little to no pressure on the project, even though tightening it does continue to lower it.  Also, the foot is prone to lateral movement. In order to avoid this I have to tighten it so much that my wife can't loosen it and it makes it difficult for me as well. Not practical nor helpful

Porter-Cable should be ashamed for their unwillingness expend any R&D on the 7518 and 7519. Nowadays, every router has a self-extracting collet, but these are the only routers I know that don't have a locking spindle and therefore require two wrenches for bit change. (PC's latest 2 1/4 horse router has an auto-locking collet, so how primitive is one that doesn't lock at all?) I'd also blast their cheapness for not including a 1/4" collet. The location of the power switch on top of the motor housing can be awkward, since you have to remove one hand from the handles to cycle power.

Having these clamps in a few different sizes is beneficial as well. Small ones are more frequently used, and don't get in the way. The 33 1/2" is great when you need to hold larger projects together, and you can't effectively use two smaller ones to substitute. Additionally the macro clamps give you deeper jaws for a farther reach, enabling you to use them for securing work, to your radial arm saw table for example. They are fast enough to be used for almost any application. Sometimes I use them to secure work when sanding with a power sander. A couple squeezes and they are on, and one squeeze and they pop off.

They look very similar to the malibu and FEIT bulbs, but have a lens over the top that the others do not have. I thought this might be good, as maybe improved protection from the elements would extend their life. Upon installation they fit the fixtures fine and lit up brightly, as expected. That was the good news. The bad news is that they all failed within a month of installation, some within a few days. They simply burned out, as evidenced by the clear glass going to a frosted look. By contrast, the Malibu and FEIT bulbs would last for months and months before needing replacement (normally due to one of the posts corroding away). I will continue my hunt for a cost effective replacement bulb, but I won't be buying this one again, regardless of the price. Don't be lured in by the low cost. They're just horrible bulbs.

6500	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	We all love parallel-type clamps (K-body, in my case), but they are fragile and can be outmatched in rare situations.  At that time, nothing -- and I mean absolutely nothing -- can match the 72xx series I-beam bar clamps.  I've been using these somewhat infrequently over the last 22 years and, while they are not as all-around useful as the parallels, they can come to the rescue on super-stubborn situations, usually involving existing structures or supertight multi-dado glue-ups or, lets admit it, a complex, super-strong design which has gone wrong and is curing fast!  Whaling away at these situations would be futile and throwing on more parallels takes away your control: Just set up a couple of pulling cauls and clamp each end with a 72xx series clamp.  I've also used them to pull tough 4-1/2" tropical hardwood flooring into place (unruly and cruel ultra-dense woods).  Nothing else offers 1,500 lbs of clamp pressure -- no better than half as much, in fact (750 lbs on a K-body or Jorgensen or Gross Stabil parallel, which risks damaging them and would cause a frightening flex to their bars, taking away their parallel attribute at anything above 200 lbs).  I only need these 72xx clamps less than 1% of the time, but that has been enough to make me very, very glad to own a set, the same way I feel about spare tires.
My contention is that neither of those improvements is worth the extra cost. Here's why:
6253	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased this tool and am very pleased with the performance that it offers. Blade changes are very easy and fast due to the Milwaukee's patented chuck design (just turn the knob and pull out the blade), but be careful, if you have been cutting for a while that chuck will get very hot and it WILL burn your finger tips. I used this tool to cut through 1" diameter solid steel railings and it cut through like a hot knife through butter. This tool is far better engineered than it's competitors and the Milwaukee blades seem to hold up better also. Spend a few extra bucks on the Milwaukee and you won't regret it.

5136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A very fine blade as others have noted.  I have used mine for about a year and noticed a few chipped teeth (my fault, since I frequently resaw old lumber).  I looked up the Forrest site, printed out a work order and sent the blade in for sharpening.  I used U.S.P.S. Priority Mail ($11.70) since I wanted quick turnaround.  Blade was received by Forrest two days later.  I waited around for a couple weeks and then Forrest calls me up to get the "security code" from the back of my card - which I provided.  I asked when the blade would be shipped back.  They stated either that day or the next.  NOT.  I received the blade a week later and the shipping label indicated they had not shipped until 3 days after I spoke with them.  Turn around was 3 weeks.
The yellow rubber pads at the end of the jaws have a smooth finish, so you may not always have a good grip, and they are kind of small, which limits what you can do.  Another factor is that the depth of the clamp is only about 1.25, so it does not have a lot of reach.  You can usually increase the surface area by placing a suitable object between the jaws, but there is a limit to what can be achieved.

3937	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I'm in the market for a new drill press--and thought I'd toss in this mortising attachment for good measure. The product description lists five Delta drill presses that work with the Delta 17-924 mortising attachment. None of those models is currently available for sale through Amazon. The reviews indicate that the product works with other drill presses too, but how is one to know? Looks like Delta needs to do a little updating here. (One star for "nice try.")

If you're willing to pay the premium, Forrest is another fine company for blades.  Not having to deal with shims was the biggest selling point for me, well worth the cost of admission.

4070	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product is solid in construction and installs in a flash. It also fits in the C7BMR (7 1/4" with electric brake).
After 6.5 years of use the first one started to take some effort to make a cut, and upon checking, I could see that it needed sharpening.
Includes ferrules and fittings
You can pay a little more and get the same kind of saw with a fancy handle. Plastic works just fine for me.

I assembled the unit using the poorly written instructions. I have come to expect poorly written instructions from Jet, but I was able to decipher them and get all the screws in the correct places.
Just beware, rotary buffers can burn finishes -- use your head!
And thats not all. The slide to adjust the edge position sticks badly and does not move smoothly. The minute adjustment is a joke since the overall slide binds so badly.
I Love the cutting capacity of the slider and the tall fence is great, just remember to slide it out of the way on miter cuts. I also like the 15 amp motor, plenty of power. Slides smoothly.
3527	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	One saw for everything - Skil worm; accurate, powerful and heavy.  For trimming?  Damn straight.  Aim down, and just like the inertia of a Cadillac, it goes smooth and straight.
7212	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	very nice clamps, I would deduct a star for putting the clamping(part you twist) piece on the end of the pipe instead of on the sliding portion. but its shown that way in the pic so its my fault. strong and reliable tho
877	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect. Fit the light bar without effort. All lamps worked. I think they cost about 10% of what I otherwise found them.
One other hint, if you are having trouble getting a vacuum adapter to seal up properly because the male side is just a little too small for the female side, wrap layers of wide blue masking tape around the male side, adding layers until the fit is tight.  This is a surprisingly long-term fix, by the way.  Another hint is to dedicate adapters to each specific purpose and leave them with the machine, not the vacuum.  Life becomes easier when you don't have to search for a specific adapter that has fallen somewhere.

3601	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great saw, love it but I should have bought the compound version. I can't cut 4x4's at beveled angles with out flipping it over. As far as miter cuts this thing is dead on, perfect cuts every time.
9393	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	It's a nice bag but no support for the bottom. I used to use it at work but not no more. If they make the bottom ridged it would be a 5 star.

6001	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not used yet, but the quality is good and I expect it to perform as described.
Regarding the Xtension, the thing I used to really have trouble with was changing bits. The M12V does not use two wrenches to loosen the collet. There's one wrench and a little sliding mechanism that you push in to lock one nut while you turn the other. But the mechanics of using one hand to push this latch while trying to pull/push hard with the other wrench to loosen the collet is awkward and sometimes ends with a wrench inadvertently flying. When mounted in a table, it was a bit easier in that I didn't have to secure the router itself, but it was awkward trying to work under the table. I found myself going way out of my way to plan my work to minimize bit changes, to a degree that led to paralysis by analysis. The Xtreme Xtension solves that because you install the Xtension and all of your bits are secured via a little allen screw, which you can tighten from above the table. Install a separate switch and you'll never have to monkey around under the table again.

5764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is for sure one of the best small router table packages on the market.  The cabinet is heavy constructed laminated lumber and the top appears to be phenolic.  I have it coupled to a PC 7518 with Bench Dog's nickel plated adjustable insert and there is no deflection.  The fence works very well and is easily adjusting - you can couple it to a dust collection system fairly easily.  Rubber feet secure it well enough so that it doesn't move with large stock.  The edge mounted track works well with miter gauges.  No complaints here.  Amazon has very competitive prices on Bench Dog gear.
Unfortunately, unless you purchase the shop vacuum kit and plan to use the Mr. Nozzle accessories, you're on your own.  It is nearly impossible to figure out which adapters will adapt a Mr. Nozzle hose to another type of vacuum or accessories.  Added to that, there do not appear to be any full line distributors of the Mr. Nozzle products, so even if you were to figure out which adapters you need, you wouldn't be able to purchase them in one place.

5132	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I was unsure as to which model dust collector to get.  They all have the same price in their category, similar specs.  Only the paint color and motor seem to be different between models.  Ultimately what sold me on this one, was the Delta brand name and the 5 micron bag.  Upon delivery (free to my door) setup was a bit involved but nothing a big kid wouldn't enjoy putting together in an evening.  Peformance is good, not as powerful as I expected, but I'm using a second stage dust collection separator.  I do recommned that as it keeps the main dust collector bag clean of large debris.  Also it benefits if you suck up bolts or pieces of wood.  There is no protection to the fan blades on the DC.  So having a second stage could save you from repairs later.
Still, for the price, it sure beats clamping stuff to my computer desk. I think if B&D made a higher quality version that was rock solid and had much smoother action all around, they'd be surprised how much people would be willing to pay for it.
Be prepared for some dust and clean the dust catcher regularly during work (if you are working inside).

3894	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I installed this blade on my radial arm saw. I sighted along the blade as it came to a slow stop, to be sure it was mounted true, with no wobble. I had to loosen the nut, turn the blade slightly, and retighten a few times to get it perfect. Without a blade stabilizer, or not bothering to check the trueness of the spin, no blade will perform properly. I never have to do this with the table saw, just the radial arm saw. Once trued up, it cut like butter, and the surface was really like glass.
Update on 6/25/10:  Now that I've used this router table for a couple years, I still love it.  But, I managed to misplace the two plastic rods that are used to move the left side of the router fence out for special work.  I contacted Kreg to buy some new ones.  Maybe I am cynical, but I was surprised to have them tell me that they would be happy to send me a new set at no charge.  We talked for a few additional minutes and I got some tips on using my router table.  Friends, if you don't have a jointer but find you need one, this table's for you!  Use those plastic rods to move the left fence forward, put in a long straight-cutting bit, align the left fence with the bit, and you've got a jointer.  Works great.  I jointed about 150 linear feet of 8/4 oak and edge-glued it with perfect results.  I may still buy a jointer, but that purchase has gone down in priority.  Thank you, Kreg, for wonderful customer service and product support.

3197	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I received the Bosch 3915 today, and of course had to test it out.  First of all, I was impressed with the overall quality of the saw and was very impressed by its weight.  It's heavy, and I have yet to find a really easy way to pick it up and move it around.  I'm assuming that it's meant to be mounted on a bench or stand, as opposed to being moved around from place to place.  I was also impressed with the manual, since it seems to be written in English and for the most part explains things very clearly.  Often, manuals that come with tools made in other countries suffer in their translation.  I did experience one situation that was not explained well in the manual, however.  I tried cutting a dado by using the depth stop feature, which in itself is easy to adjust.  The problem I encountered in making a dado is this:  When the piece of wood is placed on the table and pushed against the fence, the blade does not make a uniformly deep cut all the way through the piece because of the curvature of the blade.  I assume that there are two solutions to this problem.  One would be to turn the piece around and make the same cuts from the opposite side.  Another wouuld be to put a second piece of wood against the fence and then put the piece in which you want the dado in front of that piece.  Either of these methods is rather inconvenient, but maybe I'm missing something.  If anyone has a solution, please let me know.

3215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Easy installation and perfect fit for the Dewalt Scroll Saw.  I did replace the bulb with an LED for less heat and better quality lighting.

  One more thing to note is that these mount freely anywhere along the top surface of your fence. The best position is one immediately before your blade, and the other immediately after it. For some reason I was imagining that they projected directly over the blade, and therefore were only good for stock that was wide enough to meet with the buddy. NOT. By placing them in front and behind the blade, you can adjust them for anything from small to large stock.

Mine arrived all wobbly from bad shipping-packing, so the switch did not stay on without careful wiggling to get it exactly into the "right" spot.  Also, the lens cover was falling off, and I felt it might strip the threads if I tried to screw it on too tightly.  I returned it for replacement.

9637	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this on a Porter Cable 4.5" sander without the guard for carving. This is not for boys and studious types. If you have no experience with power tools you better pass on this as it requires a stout pair of hands and small increments of cutting. You can easily chop off something of your anatomy if you are not careful. I don't know if using the guard would be any safer. It does cut like hell though but I settled on using about 1/8" sideways cuts which did not scare me to death if otherwise. Hard bracing the forward hand onto the bench while arcing the cutting with the other hand works just fine. Both hands on the grinder is a must and the work must be clamped to the bench or it will fly through the nearest window. You must use a full face shield as the chips are aimed right at your eyes. I really like these things but they do scare the hell out of me. The diameter of the tool was 4 inches but I noticed that the wood stores have the 3 inch models with a different name, (Squire)
One handed cranking is achieved by a perforated teflon belt that engages on toothed cogs much like a caterpillar track. One of the handles has a "clutch" that locks until the mechanism encounters resistance, at which point it slips.

It would be ideal for small projects or as a high-quality child's hammer.  I purchased this to include in an EMERGENCY TOOL KIT, and it is ideal for that application.  It is small, so it fits in a small tool bag and it is high-quality, so I know I can depend on it in a pinch.  You're not going to frame a house with this one, but if you're looking for an exceptionally durable, extremely strong and well-made small hammer, this is it.

In short, if you're thinking about a recip saw, don't drive yourself crazy with all kinds of research.  Just go to the guys who invented the whole thing, and still do it better than anyone else and buy the saw.  The first time you use it, you'll say what I did.

This can't be any more appropriate than with this combination square.

On the USA Product:  This is frustrating to say the least.  It says Milwaukee WI in large letters everywhere; and, all the info you can get on line would leave you believing that you are getting a good American made tool..... even the price is high enough to be USA made.

This is a really great table extension and I'm very happy with it. It converts my TS300 into a professional level saw. The extension also doesn't get in the way of using my Bench Dog router extension.

I took my time and didn't rush, and measured twice before drilling or cutting anything.
UPDATE: Several months later after I wrote this review, we decided to give this saw one more chance and ordered a FOURTH one.

1809	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had a PC 340 for over ten years. I have used the 340 often and never felt I needed anything more for he limited amount of time I used a palm sander. Recently I began using the sander to sand Christmas ornaments. I found it perfect for the task, my R.O.S. was too aggressive. After getting bored with the frequency of changing between 150 and 220 grit paper I decided to buy a second sander. My initial plan was to buy another PC palm sander, currently the PC 380. As I researched online I noticed the overwhelming positive reviews of the PC 330. I decided to try it. I figured I could compare it to my 340 and If I did not feel it was worth the extra cost I could always take it back. I of course did not return the 330, I am considering buying a second one. The quality of the tool is obvious when you pick it up. Using the 330 Speed-Bloc in an enclosed garage is a substantially improved experience, if only for the comparably quiet operation. The weight of the sander aids in the ease of operation as well. I have found that less pressure is required to get an ornament properly sanded, less time as well. Other than the added cost, which appears well justified, I can find nothing to complain about, I have had no difficulty changing paper. I have just applied pressure with my fingers to the clamps, I have not used the provided tool yet. My only quandary  is justifying the purchase of a second 330 while my old 340 is still operational.

I trimmed about 9 inches off of the upper pipe to get the Uniguard to fit with an acceptable overhang for my table placement.  As you can see from other reviews installation can be a bit exciting, especially if you are trying to do it yourself.  It's actually fairly simple, but the weight of the main body of the guard is enough to make things awkward.  The Merlin splitter won't work with the Uniguard in place, but the supplied splitter is quite good, and nearly as easy to switch out.

8828	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This Dado set cuts like a dream. I'm doing mostly Baltic Birch ply, grooves for shelves, rabbets and half laps on an 80's radial arm saw. The measurement is easy to calculate with the super-simple graphic diagram printed with the kit (needs to laminated or something). But as with anything, cut on a test piece to get your width. I've had lumber variations all over the place, so only trust your rule and a good set of calipers.
3884	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased these after the recomendation of others to buy the Delta blades for my jointer. Upon recieving them I opened the package to inspect them prior to installing them. They where sharp and "visually looked" nice, but when I got my calipers out and started checking the individual blades I found that they where not parallel or straight. When I measured along the 5/8 side of the knive I found the edge to vary .02" from the ends to the middle. To me this is unacceptable and not worth the $69 I paid for them. Luckily Amazon made the return process easy.

Regarding all the comments about the drive belt slipping, IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO THAT, you morons!!  Oops, did I say that out loud?  Anyway, the belt WILL NOT BREAK from this slipping.  The original Workmates didn't have that feature, which made the user crank both handles, everytime, ALL the time.  The SLIPPING plastic belt is there to speed up the process by homing both sides of the vise jaws against the workpiece, so you THEN can TIGHTEN both vise screws USING TWO HANDS.  It's a speed and convenience feature, not a way to torque both sides with one handle.  All of the people who complained about the poor instructions were coincidentally the same people who did a likewise poor job of reading them, I guess.  Certainly, it can't be any fault of theirs the darn thing doesn't work exactly as they misconceive it should!

3888	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As others have said, this is THE MITER SAW for high-end professional trim work when cutting crown molding and tall base board trim. I purchased mine back in the mid-1980's for professional trim work. I added the Hitachi 100 tooth carbide blade for smooth cuts and I am contemplating trying the Freud 15" blade next time my old Hitachi 15" needs a sharpening, based on the high quality of Freud blades. I have zero complaints with the Hitachi blade, just thought the Freud may be better. Any advice would be helpful. As far as the saw goes, I also have the same complaint with the blade brake wearing out after a while, but after all these years it still functions. This saw is relatively light compared to some Makita 10" miter saws, and considering the blade size and motor needed to turn that blade. I purpose-built a plywood stand with 5' hinged extensions using door hinges. I can just knock out the hinge pin when I need to move it. The long extensions help to hold up long trim boards. Like another reviewer said, you will need to mount a taller board to act as a fence for the widest crown molding. There are four holes in the fixed aluminum fence for you to run screws through to hold your new wood fence in place. Just screw one board all the way across and then just make two cuts at 45 degrees both ways and you now have a zero clearance fence, enabling you to just line up your mark on the work piece with the edge of your add-on fence for perfect cuts every time. Saves time.

Then it was a simple matter of taking some black 3/8" weather stripping and applying it to the out side of the trashcan just under the rolled lip at the top. This provided a pretty good seal.

The higher rpm ability of the Makita cuts my finish sanding time in half.  Due to its lightweight, sanding time is only limited by the durability of the sand paper.  Only time I stop is to change the sheet, which takes only a matter of seconds with the pre-cut  paper and clamping system.  The agronomical design fits comfortably in the palm of my hand.

Seeing how repetitive rips of thin strips is one of the most dangerous cuts we can make of a table saw, i consider these a valuable addition.

They come of the fence in five seconds each.

Titebond II or III are the best of these in my opinion. I've been a woodworker for about 30 years. There are other brands of wood glue (Elmers, etc) which are close, but the small difference in price is nothing compared to the cost of the wood or the hours I put into a project.  Interestingly enough, common yellow glue is as strong as this stuff is, but I'm willing to spend a bit more for the water resistance.  You never know when something will get wet.

7390	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been using mine for over 2 years now. This was a major upgrade over my Craftsman table top model. If you are reading this you are like me, and use the router as much (or possibly more) than the table saw. Absolutely a must have if you are a serious woodworker. If you can swing the cost, I recommend the router lift (I will rate that seperately). I bought mine at a local tool show with all the bells and whistles (table, casters, lift, on/off switch, and a few other free-bees). I also added a dedicated router to it so I don't have to swap it out (hey, it was a Christmas present to myself!). Real easy to enclose the stand as there are holes every inch or two. The fence is great, there is nothing that I would change. I compared this side by side with the similar WoodPecker router table, and this one won out. Great investment. I can not believe I waited as long as I did to buy this. Two thumbs up on this one.

When my rework was complete the system works very well. 99% of the dust is trapped in the can making dumping the collector bag a very rare event. The vacuum efficiency is very good. To the point that if all my blast gates are closed it will actually start to collapse the sides of the steel can. Not a big deal but it might be a little worrisome if the dust collector and can are in the other room and you start to hear noises like a depth charge starting to implode.
The dust collector can be removed. It appears it can only function if one were routing on edge. I guess it would give more control but would take much longer adjusting than just using a bit with a bearing.

I've been using "Board Buddies" in one configuration or another for probably 12+ years.  I  wouldn't be without them. They hold the work solidly down and against the  rip fence.  If I'm ripping a board -- vertually any size -- I can remove my  hands from the board and walk away while the saw continues to run and the  blade is in the kerf of the board and the board *will not move*.

The router's base will allow for 3 3/8" bit diameters. Most of  the other 3 hp models will only handle 2 1/2" diameter bits. This is  good if you want a router to use on a table to run panel bits or large  moulding bits.

7422	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like aluminum pipe wrenches because of their light weight.  I have a whole collection of Rigid aluminum wrenches for various applications.  The job is always easier with the right tools.  I use this one for working in  sink cabinets where space is tight, but I still need the leverage a  10" handle provides.  I suppose there is not a great deal of weight  difference between this wrench and a cast iron one, but the aluminum will  never rust.  This is more a problem if you are working around corrosives  like liquid fertilizer, but old habits (buying aluminum) die hard, so it  was a natural for me to buy this wrench.
3)  The only weakness I found was the bevel angle markings.  The tool was true from the factory but the markings are a bit hard to zero in on.  That being said, I can't say that I had any angle issues with my finished pieces but it just takes a little getting used to setting it.
If you look at the Amazon sales rank, the Freud outsells the Forrest 4 to 1. Of course anything that is less money, sells more quantity, but I just can't get beyond the "perfect" performance of the Freud. How do you improve on that?

My laptop doesn't even have a regular dvd drive anymore let alone a drive for a mini dvd, and the video's are not available on freud's website (I've checked). All my dvd players are so old that they no longer work.  I ended up ripping the dvd to a mp4 file using my old computer circa 1999.  I had to return my first set to amazon due to a defective proprietary wrench that is needed to disassemble the stile bit.  This wrench is essentially a flat piece of metal with two metal tabs bent down on the end of it.  It's very low quality and the tabs can be easily bent.

I could go on for hours, like I did in my earlier review, but their is one thing I wanted to mention here. Although I love my top handle, if I was going to do it over again, I would buy the barrel grip. Why? Because the mechanics of steering a perfectly straight course, are easier to do with your hand around the body rather than perched on top of it. The barrel grip enables you to do one handed cutting with more stability. I am talking on a very fine level. I noticed Norm Abrams on the New Yankee Workshop uses the barrel grip as well.

Bench Dog should really give purchasers the option to choose their plate rather than forcing those with obscure routers to spend an additional $60 on a new plate, not to mention the cost of odd-sized drill bits and what not. Or maybe Freud should be slapped around a bit for making such a wacky router. I dunno... Another nice thing would be an exterior on/off switch like the Bosch tables have. Oh and lastly, they should sell an optional stand to make this a stationary table. As of right now, I need to make yet another 4x4 little table thing to put it on...

I finally decided to give these bulbs a chance since a pack of 10 is the same price as single similar bulb at my local store.  Wow.  I regret not trying these earlier.  They work great and seem to last just as long.  Keep in mind, such lighting gets abused as heavy items (e.g., stacks of dishes) are placed in the cabinets.

I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop, I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever, but it works well.
The thing is, a new blade doesn't stay "new" for that long, particularly if you are planing a lot, and are planing hard woods. So--after years and years of planing--here are a few things I have learned for keeping your blades sharp.

The second reason is while my shop vacum picks up everything, the inside of the box  gets filled with sawdust quickly, so have anything in there absent. While working the bench is steady, does not chatter, and solid. I find this table to be worth it. I am not a patient man, but Amazon won my admiration with the speed of delivery.

I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders. They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published (presumably figuring that a lot of kids, little and big, were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed...). The leftovers were sold at half price, a real bargain. I bought one, tried it out, loved it, and went back to buy several more for use as gifts (and spares).
I think it has to do with the spotty qc on chinese made tools.  I returned it.  It cost more, but I ordered a makita dp4000 since I liked my previous makita 1/2 drill so well.  Haven't received it yet.

The quick-grip handi-clamp clamps are very easy and fast to set up (and remove). They have a decent hold however they the hold is not as strong as the C-clamps that you need to ratchet. It is important for me that the clamps don't move in case I accidentally bump into them and they do not. However if I want to I can move them slightly without releasing the clamp. By comparison C-clamps do not move at all without releasing the tension.
Good router table is also a must.

9284	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It has already been said in most of the reviews on this product, but it bears repeating.  Just pop in a bit and the spring mechanism locks in. pull back on the collar and it ejects.  So simple it is genius.  There are many other rapid load chucks available by other makers but for some reason they have all chosen to use a mechanism that usually requires two hands to operate and is not only more complicated in design, but not as efficient.  I have several of these made by just as many manufacturers, mostly because they are often packaged with a set of 1/4 inch shank bit sets, but the DeWALT is the only one I use everyday most of the others I own are still in the original case and mostly unused.
If all you do is cut moulding and flooring than you don't need this kind of square.  But if tiny little gaps and adjustments frustrate your sense of perfection, then take a look at products like this square or its brothers and sisters.  Starret makes heirloom quality tools that will remain every bit as accurate until the solar system goes defunct.
3858	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	So there are a lot of hot and cold reviews. This thing has been around for a long time and it has always been seen as decent, but not great. A dedicated mortiser is always better but this gets the job done. The main bit is the yoke that attaches to the drill press. Not much to it and it works. The fence is a bit fiddly to set up but it works. The machining of the screws could be better on everything. The lock screw for the chisel is not great but again, it works. I think the big issue is that the chisels are not top quality and have burrs on them from the factory. To me a factory grind on a tool is never acceptable so I always assume some sharpening will need to be done. You need a conical diamond stone and a flat sharpening stone of some kind to properly sharpen the chisels. Once you give them a good edge this tool works very well. The mortise sill requires some cleanup by hand but it does get the job done.

The Dewalt unit, fills a niche, but is a very good example of getting what you pay for. If it were not for the no reversing, and no variable speed capabilities, and for making the paddle switch so long, that gets in the way, even when you don't want it to, makes the unit, strictly for those who are price conscious first, and tool conscious later.

Havent used this drill yet but am looking forward to putting it to work.  I bought it because I only had cordless drills, aside from a great, rugged Milwaukee Hammer drill, was also confident because of great reviews from others, It is very solid and I like the quick change cord.  I expect to have this drill for years

Ordered 10 and only 3 lasted more than a few days. Buy USA, Japanese or European  bulbs only, or you will pay much more for your "bargain bulbs" per hour of light than more expensive ones cost. Never pays to go cheap on halogen bulbs.
Again the plate that supports the sanding belt wore through and I sent off for a new plate. While waiting, I am using the second machine. At this point I have purchased 9 boxes of sanding belts (that is 90 belts.). I am very satisfied with this machine and will add further edits as time goes by.
3667	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have only used this sander once since it came. It came on time and well packaged. WOW! It makes short work of a heavy job. I have a wooden platform area in my house that has some water damage and I need to refinish it before I sell my house. It took me a long time (over an hour) and many sheets of sand paper to remove a little patch of damage with my finish sander. My finish sander finally died and I was reluctant to spend the money on a Porter Cable sander but I did the research and finally decided it would be very worthwhile. I could've used this sander SO many times in the past and instead, I grueled over jobs with a finish sander that was not capable of doing what I wanted it to do. I am a female and I am the handy man in my house. I wanted a powerful belt sander that is competent enough to do the jobs I need it to do around my house. I love it, it appears to be VERY well made and it sounds SO good when it is running, like my circular saw. Changing the belt is super easy, just move the lever (that's made of metal btw, not plastic like other belt sanders) and put on a new belt. Alignment is easy too, just turn the knob while it is running and it aligns perfectly. What people are saying about the variable speed dial is true, it is out of reach when in use but this does not bother me, I don't think I'll need to adjust it while in use (I usually know what to adjust it to before I start sanding) and if I do want to change the speed I'll do it when it isn't running. I recommend this Porter Cable sander to professionals and to do it yourselfers.

Once you get used to the awesome power, it's impossible to go back.  The best thing about a right angle drill is that when using an auger bit or similar, the drill doesn't rip your wrist off when it catches.  You can use your whole body to control the drill, which makes for much less tiring work (e.g., when mixing drywall mud).  I appreciate using this drill over its bigger brothers because it is much, much lighter.  The right angle attachment comes off as well so that you can use it as a regular d-handle drill.  The right angle attachment is relatively easy to take off, and it can be switched around to adjust for speed (low and high).  The head swivels, and my version came with the quik-lok cord.  I also appreciated that this drill is made (mostly, at least) in the USA.  The five year warranty is nice, but like with most other Milwaukee tools, I don't expect to use it.
PROS
I would not recommend this product.
One minor complaint is the flimsy plain paper, stapled owner's manual. The information contained in the manual is ok but it's printed on a few plain paper stapled pages. If you have to later refer to the exploded parts diagram for a part number you'll need to store your manual safely. I'd prefer a manual that has a plastic laminate cover so the first time it gets dirt on it - it's not unreadable.
I bought my last Paslode cordless battery in 2006 and it is still good.  The secret to NiCad batteries is to exercise them.  If not used, most of these batteries will run down in about 75 days.  Therefore, I keep a calendar to remind me when to recharge them.  If there is any voltage left, I drain and then fully recharge.
The ribbed baseplate acts like a "mending-plate" when installed under a table, which helps rigidity near the base, but make sure you reinforce the areas around the plate since it is heavy and develops terrifying torque.
- uses 3 (THREE) AAA batteries which makes the base a little heavy

5171	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I tried this with my Fein Multimaster fmm 250q and couldn't get it to fit. Don't know if it requires an adaptor or what the problem is; the center bolt is simply too long, and the sanding head flops and spins around.
3200	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'm told this saw has been discontinued. I saw Bosch's new 4410 at a woodworking show and it's one really nice saw, with more features than this (notably the handle, which swivels to wherever your hand feels more comfortable) and it's rumored to have better dust collection. It's also well over five hundred bucks. This one cost me $354 and I'm very happy with it, thank you very much. Yes, even with a shop vac hooked up, it throws sawdust. I'll build a hood. Yes, it only bevels one way. I can flip the board. It's got a nice, solid precision feel to it and it makes sharp clean cuts. It was calibrated right out of the box. It's great for cutting long stock, makes perfect 45's, and it'll slice through a 4x4 and a 2x10. That's what I need. Maybe someday I'll upgrade but this saw is going to serve me just fine for years.
Neither of the ladders I am using the jacks with are Werner brand but they both have 12" rung spacing.

I don't use claw hammers much - not much call in automotive work - but the quality looks very high. My dad has an Estwing from when I was a kid and it still looks new. This one looks to be of the same quality so I expect it'll way outlast me. :)
In any case, brass is a better material for guides than steel, because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide.  Once, near a day's end of routing doors for hinges, my template's locking ring came loose, allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit, and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut.  Since the guide and ring were brass, no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred.  Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring, the bit or router could have been damaged.  Try "brass router template" via Goggle - and buy a kit made of solid brass, in a decent case, for less money than this set.  Also check out the Woodstock International H3134 Brass Bushing set at Amazon.
4113	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept, and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws, the cost, life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.

7426	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	When I first saw this in a local woodworking store, I thought it was a pretty nice table for the money.  Not the ultimate router table, perhaps, but pretty nice.  Not cheap, by any means, but not quite as expensive as some, either.  Certainly a step up from the "benchtop wonder" I had been struggling with these past years.  That was in the store.  Then I ordered one for myself.

4207	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great Dado blade.  The instructions to set the cutting width are easy to read, understand and the blade is easy to configure.  I purchased this for my R4510 Ridgid 10" table saw because it recommends a max Dado blade of 6".  It works great on the saw, the cuts feed a little slower than a normal blade, but that is to be expected.  I have since changed all my blades to Freud/Diablo from the factory stuff, and what a noticeable difference.  The quality is there, and if your using an "underpowered" table saw, this is a great option for you.

4819	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Having made several of these myself for about a 1/4 of the price, I was extremely skeptical at paying the price and getting something better.  However, the adjustments to bring this consistently level with the table top are almost worth the extra.  Having a small piece of wood jam against the lip where this meets the table because it is not perfectly aligned is at best frustrating and potentially dangerous.  This aligns quickly and easily and lasts.  It could be cheaper!
4352	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is not the best quality but was fixable in about an hour.  First the front adjustment bolt weld was pretty shabby. Lots of flashing.  Filed down.  Then the japaning spilled into the front opening.  Had to make a jig and file throat and blade bed smooth and true. The base was warped  (cupped in the center)  Took a while but sandpaper took care of that.  Blade dull, sharpened.  One thing I can't fix is the two and 1/2 turns of play in the adjustment mechanism.  I'll have to get used to that. It actually looks like it is designed that way.  Doesn't much matter but shows a design that could use some improvement..  All told this is not what Stanley used to make but it has the basic design that makes it worth the twenty bucks or so after it is tuned up.  Would I buy again?  sure. for twenty bucks it is serviceable.

Detachable cord.  Only Milwaukee figured out the ways people use a reciprocating saw--constant, demanding ROUGH use.  These saws are most typically used in demolition work.  In this environment you run the saw relentlessly and go through some blades.  When you want to change one, in a hurry, nothing on earth is handier than being able to simply unclick the power cord and do a blade change.  Believe me, you wouldn't want to change a blade on this beast without it being unplugged.

I don't know whether these lights will work indoors in a dry place any better, but they certainly are a waste of money for landscape lighting. Meanwhile, my built-in LED spotlight and traditional halogen bulbs on the same circuit have remained perfectly lit. Avoid these.
Quality of cut is excellent - as has been my experience with my other Freud blades  The Fusion is fantastic.  But the case is really an embarrassment.  Freud would be better off sending these in a cardboard box individually wrapped in oil paper.  The provided case has a good, very stiff foam filler in the top half, but the bottom which holds the blades is hollow, blow-molded plastic - thinner than that plastic Santa on your lawn.  The weight of the blade set just crushes that plastic and lets the blades move around.  They need to add a foam filler under that hollow plastic.  Why couldn't they use another piece of that top foam filler in the bottom as reinforcement?  Even if they did, though, the case itself is pretty ugly and cheap looking.  I anticipated this thanks to other reviews and am using a plywood / hardboard storage unit for the blades and chippers, and throwing away the case.

What would cause this? My guess is that the unit that contains the lever was not the original part in the my box. Everything else was taped and sealed as if it was new.

There are plenty of diy videos out there that tell how you can get the same result out of a bucket and some pvc parts, but this was well worth the price in my humble opinion and I would highly recommend it.

6194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Used the Milwaukee AX blade to cut up a tree trunk that was from 10 inches to 16 inches in diameter.  Numerous cross cuts were made to allow for small wood sections that would easily fit into a compostable bin.  The 16 inch section of the tree trunk was trimmed down parallel to the trunk to a smaller diameter using this blade that would allow an easy follow up cross cut.  All cuts were made with a single blade out of the package of five, and the used blade still cuts like new.  In addition the blade withstood various edge impacts while cutting wood in excess of 12 inches in diameter without bending or any deformation.  All in all an excellent product.

2812	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this saw about 6 years ago. After 6 years on the farm it works just as good as the day I bought it. It has cut many 2x4s and lots of rough lumber. I used it to build 3 building in the farm. The lumber was all rough cut and wet.

A couple of days ago I noticed that one of the bulbs was out and replaced it with the 2nd bulb from the replacement pack I bought a year ago.  In doing so I noticed that the bulb next to it was also out so I ordered this 10 pack from Amazon.  10 bulbs for $10 or $1 a piece versus $4 a piece at Home Depot!
I'm not a fan of the current jaws fitted to Workmates. They are fabricated from laminated (almost butcher-blocked) bamboo. It makes for an attractive and durable jaw but it is flexible (and my centerboard was warped out of the box) and thus not as all-round useful as the older super-dense laminated chipboard jaws (or the original high-quality plywood jaws that are a thing of ancient history). There was a brief period when Workmates had plastic jaws too. I digress.
In most instances, this is not an issue. But when it is, it's a fairly annoying design flaw.

3506	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	For most of my life Milwaukee tools (starting with my Dad's Sawz-All) were worth paying more for because of quality made in the USA. After too much time spent searching (Milwaukee/Amazon does not appear comfortable disclosing the location of manufacture in the product description, so you have to search the reviews to get the facts), this drill as well as every other Milwaukee product I looked at are made in China. It is not worth it to me to pay twice the price if it is not made in the USA/local. I can get a perfectly serviceable Dewalt for half the price. I am bummed to not be paying the price of my new drill into our economy!
for trades guys, this is a great blade to have. It will probably pay for itself on the first use. A pro probably can get 10-12 sinks, cook tops cut out with this tool, so it will be a no-brainier to have it. My next DIY with this is to cut some pavers for a outside project.

This blade is a pleasure to use every time - I would purchase again in a minute, and make sure that the table and fence are accurately aligned. A well-tuned saw is a safe and happy saw. The people who know say, "Ahhh, you got a Forrest!," and that's all they have to say. If you own a saw, you should own this blade. Hands down, the best blade that you can get. Sharp, beautiful, cuts with remarkable ease! Don't worry about the cost - it's a solid investment that will repay itself many times over with great satisfaction. I would purchase again, and likely will grab a second when I send the blade back for its first resharpening. Owning this blade is a badge of honor - enjoy every moment of using it!

- The included saw blade is mediocre.  It's great for chopping 2x4s or something, but it's not appropriate for "pretty" lumber.
These "pocket hole" screws seem to have a much thinner shank and deeper threads (at least on the coarse ones) so they screw in much easier.  Plus the square (Robertson?) drive is much better that Phillips for holding on and not stripping.
-  Concerned that the Trojan-supplied wheel caps might come off, I installed cotter pins.  Probably not necessary, but now the wheels are securely held on.



4058	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this saw because I was building a 600 sq ft deck and really needed something that would work well. What a great investment this was. I can't begin to tell you how many pieces of wood we had to cut and the saw did it with ease. I am extremely happy with the results and very happy that I followed the reviews of others before I purchased the saw. Even after completing the deck, I still don't even have to change the blade. I also purchased the reciprocating saw from DeWalt which also worked great. You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny, especially when you don't have tax or delivery.
1156	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works as well as can be expected. LCD or Xenon has longer life.
5644	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Quality Bench at a reasonable price. I've been using this table for 8 weeks now and there is not much about it I don't like. It functions perfectly and the front door makes easy access to the router. The only short coming is that it does not have an outer power switch (but most tables in this price range don't)

Having a parallel and square base-plate makes blades last longer, cut smoother and allows a cheap homemade cutting guide to work as well as any expensive aluminum track. Obviously, these types of circ-saws do not have the dust collection capability of expensive Teutonic tools. Here, I must assume that if you are considering this type of saw, you will be working outside or don't need the dust collection features of $600 to $2400 dollar track saw systems.
Installation is basically a case of removing the entire upper and lower guide mechanisms from the saw.  No small feat, but doable,  The upper guides fit neatly on the round post (there is a different set available it you have the old hex posts).  The lower disassembly is a bit more complicated as you are removing both the guide set and the adjusters.  Putting the new bearing set in was something of a trip, since the bolts are definitely not easy to turn.  By all means, get a hex driver set for your socket wrench, you will need them.

440	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this light every night to do my Kindle reading.  It is very bright, and features two bulbs, each of which can be lit on its own, or you can use both (like me).  This really does the job.  I highly recommend it to e-book readers.
1887	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
2540	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Fit pretty well, kinda finicky set-up.
The instructions also say to keep the stand bolts a bit loose until you set the saw on it.  I found this to be wise.  It lets the parts all settle in prior to tightening and made for a rock solid platform with no wiggle.
I would recommend this well put together tool for some one who is not going to use pocket holes for the majority of there projects but wants a great tool for a great price that is easy to use.  You may find yourself putting in more screws than you need just because they are so easy to install.  If you are going to use pocket hole joints a lot then you might possible want to step up to the Kreg with more options.  But for me this thing is wonderful.
staples vs. nails--don't really have any comment.  but this tool works well.  We laid australian cyprus--which is a hard soft wood, harder than red oak.
For this price it's expected to spend some time getting it in working shape, and afterwads it does perform ok, but leaves me wishing it had a better blade (especially since you'd commonly use this low-angle plane on end grain).
Overall, it seems well made and fits my Delta drill press perfectly. It seems pretty stout and while the carrying case doesn't fit well, it does hold everything. You just have to disassemble almost everything first.

4030	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	great tool!


Lots of fun trying to tilt the saw up and maneuver this hokey setup. Bottom line, does not work well on the dws780

Performance:  I immediately noticed the motor takes longer to spin to full speed than other saws. It takes almost twice as long as my Dewalt.  When cutting, it's obvious the Dewalt has more power, despite both motors being rated at 15A, 3800 RPM.

The BAD:
It has worked flawlessly on everything from positioning slats in a headboard (OK, I could have used mortise-and-tenon joints, but there were a LOT of slats) to attaching edging to plywood, to table-top glue-ups.  The only biscuit failure I've had was when I tried to use it to attach the aprons to the legs on a children's play table.  Some places NEED better joinery!

Many idiots have my sander and it has taken a few falls, but still works with no unusual noises  and i like the hook and loop, but if you don't you can simply un  screw the pad and put on an adhesive backed pad. You don't realize how  useful the varible speed is unless you sand in tight quarters or alot of  refinshing. Also the hard dust cup is great better then the stupid bags or  little dust boxes. I would by this over the bosch or makita any day




The collet is accurately made & the lock is SOLID, so bits stay put, don't wander, flex or slip.

One of the replaced parts were those unfortunate plastic clips that control the motion of the legs.  Mine all broke after at least 20 years of use; the replacements were REALLY tight, so I sprayed some Boeshield T9 paraffin based dry lubricant on them.  Now the action is much smoother and I trust this will help them last better than without it.
Jun 2011 Update:
This GoodYear hose is the best I have used and Amazon's price is unbeatable.  The hose is rated at 250psi, is built of very high grade materials, is abrasion resistant, and oil resistant.  Best of all the hose remains very flexible even in colder weather.  (Goodyear typically tests their hoses at 4 times the rated working pressure so this hose will most likely handle more pressure than your compressor will.)

2679	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	First I want to direct you to go read impartial reviews of the most popular circular saws done by a large crew of framers at [...] , this is a very helpfull site. My review is as follows : I bought this saw new to replace my old beater, and I must say it has excellent power and is built very solid, great quality, it effortlessly cuts through everything I have used it on. BUT it's one big problem which is so annoying that I am unwilling to use it anymore, and will sell it because of, is that it seems designed to direct it's stream of sawdust directly at your face. It blasts chips and dust at your face and under your chin and down your shirt collar. Every time I use this saw I end up leaning out of the way in the most akward positions just to avoid this. I have used many circular saws and never had this problem, sure you will always get dusty but nothing like with this one. I hate this saw for this reason alone. Keep in mind that this saw is a "blade on the right side of the motor" unit and it might be better for left handed users as far as the dust in the face problem. I must admit I have not heard this problem mentioned by anyone else in any reviews so maybe I'm crazy, but I know can't make another cut with this thing. I will be replacing it with a Porter Cable 743-K(Blade on left) saw, which was the top pick at [...] and is the lightest available. Good luck.

I was annoyed to find out that Home Depot sold the chandelier BUT not the bulbs for the light. I was also annoyed that the lights were not included. BUT that's my fault for not having read all the specs on the box before making the purchase. Anyway, after going to LOWE'S and finding only 3 of the 5 bulbs I needed, I decided to go to my favorite shopping place...AMAZON.COM and lo and behold I found the bulbs for a fraction of the cost I paid for them at LOWE'S. I paid $7.00 a bulb at LOWE'S or something like that and paid only $1.88 a bulb here at AMAZON. I bought 10 bulbs as to not have to worry about replacement.

I wanted to use a nice big 3" bit and my 2 1/4 HP routers might have done it, but this guy takes it and is so smooth its like hes not even straining.  rounded over the edge of the table top like it was nothing.  and the 5 speed selector with speeds listed is great.  its always guess work or math to try and find the speed of the router to match the bit, now just pick the RPM you want and go.  Very nice router.

UPDATE:  I've been using this machine for five months now and couldn't be happier.  I added the light and the easy lifter, both worth the expense.  I do a lot of intricate work, and inserting the blades for inside cuts is very easy, and quick.  I've had no problems whatsoever with the machine and have no problem recommending it.  The only drawback to the machine is the lack of dust collection/control.  There are third parties that have devices that you can install, I just keep my vacuum close by.

One of my first cuts was a dovetail joint in the scrap cedar.  I've done dovetails a variety of ways, including by hand with chisel and gents saw and if you've ever tried that you know it can take a while.  With the DW788, cutting a perfect pin side of the dovetail in the cedar took less than two minutes.

5318	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This splice is normally used to connect two hose sections. But I used it to connect to a dust filter. I cut it in half, glued the two pieces in place, connected up a hose to each place and clamped them.. The dust filter connections are are set up to have the hose pushed in and are held in place by the ribs in the host. This works fine for normal hose, but not for extra-flexible hose. So this was how I fixed it when I changed hose types.

I bought it based on positive reviews and a reputation for durability. I put it in a Woodpeckers table and have been impressed with it in that capacity, but even before I dropped it in the table the impression I had was of quality construction. It is heavy and its weight and power give it wonderful control when wielding larger bits. I'll update this if it doesn't live up to its price, but so far, it looks like there's a reason it is so highly recommended.

On the negative (and its a significant point) I found I could not safely utilize the wider settings on this dado. When I installed the components required for a 3/4" dado I found I couldn't even get a full turn of the arbor nut when tightening up everything.  ...and that still leaves one chipper in the box.  So, using this set for wider dados will require me to make two separate passes at different settings. (Seems like it kind of defeats the purpose of a dado, doesn't it?)

It is a genuine pleasure to operate this Makita, compared to my old Craftsman 3x21 which I had received as a gift years ago. I spent as much time adjusting the belt tracking on the Craftsman as I did sanding, but since I used it infrequently, I just put up with the excessive noise and generally less than stellar performance. After using the 9403 for 2+years, I shake my head everytime I use it, wondering why I waited so long to replace my old one. I find myself pulling this sander out and using it more often. Long cords are always a big plus for me, often eliminating the need for extension cords in the shop. I just can't find anything negative to say about this machine yet.
Having explained that, I think that is why some people do not like these as much as I do. I understand that pro carpenters are necessarily rushed since time = money, so they loathe anything that interrupts their workflow. Although I find these intuitive to adjust in seconds, anyone unfamiliar with them might find adjustments to be "fussy" or complicated.
1806	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Was as expected
4250	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've used several dado blades before including dial-adjust and stackable sets of different qualities. They all somewhat do the job but not quite I would like them to be. I've been using Systi-Matic blades, and they are very good. But I just could not justify for their $250 dado set or Forrest?s. So I decided to try one of the popular names in the business ? Freud. When the blades arrived in the plastic case, it caught my attention with its weight. None of those I used come close to how much this set weighs. The box is well packed with thick foam in the lid for placing blade during change, each of the eight blades is separated by a plastic spacer when stacked in the case and a set of steel shims. Only suggestion I have is to put marking on shims since there is no way I can tell which is what except the two thickest ones. Yesterday, I had a chance to use this set the first time on my newly purchased DeWalt DW746 table saw to make a piece for helping straighten the floor plank and make grooves in some the inlay pieces I am doing for the master bedroom. I was very much impressed how these blades performed compared to my past experience. Very, very smooth bottom and clean cut (no tear out) all the way and the blades are so sharp that with 1-3/4 hp motor I only need to hold down the piece and push effortlessly. I used walnut and Brizilian cherry by the way. The blade run-out is minimum that I even had a hard time taking them off the arbor if the blade was just off the 90-degree from arbor a little bit. This was my first experience with Freud blade, but I won?t hesitate to use other blades from Freud. It is a keeper for sure.

I have my Vaughn 16 oz curved claw woodie with the original handle, a 20 oz framer (generic) for it's weight and an assortment of 16 oz claws (cheap) as loaners/dirt job hammers.  If you're a beginner or can't pound a nail in get an estwing 16 oz or 12 oz claw/rip to learn.  I consider a curved claw safer for newbees least they punch themselves in the cheek!

Installation is fast and easy. The instructions could be a little better, but the diagram is adequate so putting these together is intuitive. Each part has only ONE obvious connection, so you can't put it together wrong. It took about three minutes for each one including adjustment. You just screw on the rollers and tighten their nuts, screw in the adjustment knob, attach the base to your fence with T-nuts, slide in the body and lock in place.

I am a little confused about the other reviews talking about the machine dumping dust on your feet.  Mine has a swiveling plastic nozzle that I direct to the side when I cut without the vac. It seems to work fine.  Have they changed this design lately?
The different size and color inserts are good, and it works OK as drilled.  My rating is low due to the lack of concerned help and general attitude of the manufacturer.
3043	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good deal.
I have had mine for over 5 years now and it is still going strong!
 Built like a tank and as much power as you could ever need this drill definately delivers.  The only variable will be your choice of bits, I have to place my vote on the Milwaukee self feed bits as they cut very fast and will last a long time between sharpening.  So if you have some branch circuits to run or some plumbing to install go get this drill and some self feed bits.  It will make the job go much easier.

I am amazed at how accurate the mortises are and beautifully cut with the porter cable 5/8 radius cutter and bearing guide which you have to purchase individually as the kit come with the bit and guide for the 1/4 radius hinge.
On the plus side, wm425 folds easily and is easy to store - it doesn't take up much space in my garage. If you can live with its shortcomings and are very careful when tightening the clamp its a handy tool.

Assembly required (not necessarily a plus), but instructions are complete, extra/spare nuts, bolts, set screws. The instructions are concise, so plan on 1-2 hours of patient reading, cross referencing parts to location diagrams, and you too will have a fine table in the end.
I do think the table is pricey but it is an absolute delight to use and is very heavy duty. I was going to build my own custom table at first until I saw the potential to build 'around' this table. My whole table is enclosed with doors in the front and a mini dust collector vacuum installed inside all connected to the switch, which I mounted on the right side in the plywood. I paint matched the plywood to the blue, for aesthetics. With casters on the bottom making it easy to move around, I had room underneath the bottom horizontal braces to build a small shelf out of plywood to hold scrap wood, bits, etc.

There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this "old school" power tool...I suspect it will run forever.  Powerful, smooth, not heavy, balanced...did I mention I love it?  I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event.  He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year.  The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee's management.  If this drill is too "old school"...then I must be too old school myself.  This is a tremendous drill.  Get one before they are all gone.  You will love it!


My beloved makita 6303 suffered a mishap (my bad) and so I bought the milwaukee but it makes unnerving sounds and some vibration.  A sort of clacking sound, sounds like gears.  I even compared side by side with the contractors new one just to make sure I wasn't imagining it.  Nope, sounded terrible.
A battery powered trim saw might be a smart choice if you will use the tool often; e.g., weekly.  Otherwise, this saw, over the long haul, will be MUCH less costly because it will never need battery, or tool, replacement.  Every battery-operated tool manufacturer periodically changes/improves their battery design.  Next generation batteries probably won't fit your [old] tool and/or will be a different voltage.  So, when the batteries die, and they all will, you'll have to replace the two batteries - and they are expensive.  Or, "your" batteries will no be longer available, so you'll have to buy a new saw.
However, after I received my DeWalt flexible floodhlight, I found on Amazon a black aluminum LED flashlight ("3 Watt Cree LED 3 AA Tactical Flashlight 180 Lumen Long Throwing Tight Spot yet wide moon light Torch, 7224bk") which uses 3 AA batteries and produces 180-200 lumens of light. A typical flashlight with an incondescant bulb will normally be WELL under 20 lumins, including the DeWalt flexible floodlight. At close objects it has a very small, bright center beam, but a very broad overspill beam allowing the user to view things not in the main beam very well. For illuminating distant objects, the small center beam gets broader with the distance from the object. It will illuminate objects 400-500 ft. away. I purchased the LED flashlight on Amazon and consider it to be one of the best flashlights I've owned. The way that LED flashlights have improved (compared to incondescant bulbs) is amazing. I use 3 re-chargeable AA batteries in mine. They get 3-5 hours per charge. In about 6 months I've only had to recharge it one time, and it gets lots of use. Unlike incondescant bulbs, the LED should VERY rarely, if ever, need to be replaced.

These have very good balance and weight for swinging and driving large nails with the least amount of effort and swings per nail!!!  You can pull any nail that you get in the claw.  You can break the end of the claw or chip it.  This can be done only with improper use or extreme abuse.

- MAKE SURE your joints along the 2" sides of the 2x4 are smooth and without offsets.  I had a 2x4 that wasn't cut perfectly true (from the factory) and the system kept hanging up on this when lowering it.  It was only jutting out 1/16" too - nothing of concern when I built it.  Next time I build the columns or before I use these again I'm going to run a belt sander along the edge to true it.

The Dewalt DW160 3/8" drill has an oversized paddle switch, according to the manufacturer. Reviews were pretty emphatic about false start problems while changing bits. Also it does not have variable speed, nor does it reverse.

6778	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After becoming dissatisfied with the lack of blade control using Delta's blade guides, I tried "cool blocks".  Unfortunately, after they wore just a little, the blade wandered so much it was too difficult to accurately cut on a line.  The Carter rollers keep the blade from twisting, and as a result, cutting on a line, straight or curved, is significanly easier.  So, once the roller bearings are adjusted, they perform as advertised.  (I haven't tried 1/8" blades, where one reviewer said they don't work.)  I've had this product for several years, but I recall that it took at least 30 minutes to get all the rollers properly adjusted.  With experience that would likely go faster.  Since I mostly use the same blade, set-up time isn't important to me.

The set I've used for many years is 1997, American Tools.
3269	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are very few skil tools that capture my attention. Most are consumer grade like Black and Decker or Craftsman. The wormdrive saws and this trim  saw are the exception. They represent the best of the industry. You may  laugh at this little saw but it is a wonderful tool. It has full ball  bearing construction. It is a professional tool that cuts beautifully.  Glides through wood like a fish through water. I bought mine used at a pawn  shop but it runs like a top after 6 years of  use. You wouldn't believe it  but it spanks Porter Cables saw boss any day of the week. Although it has a  smaller motor ,6.5 amps Vs. 9 amps ,it cuts circles around the PC. The PC  never feels like it's really going to take off in the cut. It cuts O.K. but  it never glides through like this little skilsaw. I wish you could run them  side by side so you could feel the difference. It's incredible. I thought  it might be an isolated case but I tried several sawboss saws and they were  all the same. New blades old blades pine , plywood or oak it doesn't matter  This saw really goes to town. It's perfect for trim or framing. The only  thing I can say bad about it , is you can't cut a 45 on 2x lumber with it.  Other than that , it's flawless. Highly recommended!

 I like Jorgensen clamps, I have several sets of their bar clamps, and their lighter standard clamps as well. All in all, the Bessey's are made out of more steel, and are more heavy duty. The Jorgensen's you have a third bracket-clip that enables you to convert it into a spreader, and acts as a support, to prevent it from tipping, when using the clamp for a far smaller piece of material than the clamp was designed for. A great idea, but the Bessey's can easily solve the tilting problem, with a small piece of stock to support them. Better yet, having the proper size clamp eliminates the problem altogether. Pertaining to the spreader capacity, that is great, but I do have several of the Tru-Grip quick clamps, which have the spreader capability, which I rarely if ever have to use.

The top arm swings back to give you room to thread the blade and set things up. The bad thing is that it is not spring loaded. The material holder came down on my finger nail by accident because of this.

So I backtracked further to see how I got snookered. Looking at the product picture, it does not appear to be particularly long. But pictures can be deceptive.  The reviews were good. Don't think anyone mentioned or complained about the length. If they did I missed it.  How was I supposed to know it was 3 inches long?? Finally, I  checked the dimensions buried in the description: 5.8 x 2.9 x 1.3 inches. What does that mean to you? To me, that's unclear. Nothing about this item is 6in long, 3in wide etc..  5.8x2.9x1.2inches seems to be the  dimension of the shrink wrap cardboard the loader is encased in. That is not a fair description in my book. Reported this to Amazon Customer Support.

So, how do you know if your work surface is flat? Put a straight edge or level on its edge spanning the length of your work surface that the work will occupy. If the work is 60 inches long, your straight edge must be at least that long. Then look under it to see if you see any air space. If yes, your surface is not flat and you will need to flatten it if you expect flush joints.

Extra care is needed when drilling the holes for the brackets. My aluminum ladder had some ridges that made it difficult to put the drill bit right were I wanted. I recommend c-clamping the bracket in place, carefully mark the hole locations, and then use a smaller drill bit to create a pilot hole. Line up the bracket on the pilot holes and you can then make corrections once the larger hole is drilled. It also makes drilling the large hole easier when you can use the pilot hole as a guide. Took some extra effort, but all-in-all, I'm pleased.
But the guy who keeps dropping it on his foot needs to stay out of the garage before he hurts someone.  It's a physical impossiblity for this product to fall down with the extension feet properly extended, which is sure not difficult to figure out.  Rotate them outward until they stop!  Get real!  Not to mention anther comment, "I was dissapointed because the top in the picture looks like some sort metal and mine was wood?"  You're a WHAT enthusiast?

1941	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits , which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit , you can't go wrong with this one.

That can be really pricey getting a decent quality to hold up for an entire shop. I'd recommend getting regular elbows locally if you don't want to use boatload of duck tape
Tip: Use a clutched drill with a ratchet set attachment to put the bolts in. It's a real time-saver. I did a couple bolts with the plastic tool included and then busted out my subcompact. Big difference.
I would purchase this product again.
I think when you figure in the hardwood for the frame (1.5"x1.5"), and the very soft steel brackets with open ends on every corner, you might come to the realization that this isn't as great a bargain as it first appears.

This saw gets setup when framing to cut door and window jacks, studs, etc, and I have also used it many times for trim work.  One of the best features on this saw is the window in the housing that lets you see the exact blade position. Very easy to change this when it gets scratched up, just make your own out of a piece of plexi-glass. Anyway, 15 years, one switch,other than that no problems.

I have a small home repair business, so I use power tools all of the time.  After I graduated to the cheap drills, I tried a Makita.  It was fine, and handled well, but died after only a couple of years.  That soured me on the brand.  So the next drill I bought was this Dewalt.

I have purchased several of these for tools I own that are weird sizes - e.g., a large Grizzly Band-saw, a large router table, and a Grizzly spindle sander.  I like the design as it's simple and sturdy, as long as you use 2" aluminum square stock and not wood. I first tried one of these bases with the wood they recommend and it's worthless, far too flimsy for anything but a light tool.  I bought 2" x 1/4" wall square aluminum stock and have had excellent results.  Needless to say aluminum costs more than wood, but it's worth it and with it, these are great bases.

Don't cheap out and get the Sears version.  This tool uses a different technology and it's accuracy is amazing.  Also, the Sears version can not be calibrated.  I often check my MD Smart Levels against the contractors and always find that they are dead on.  These things take a beating and if the level itself gets damaged you can easily replace the aluminum box level with a identical replacement making the tool virtually new again.  The only comparable product is the Stabila, which costs twice as much.  Don't listen to the reviewer who suggests that the $69 model is the same.  The Sears model isn't accurate enough for ADA compliance verification.
Con: The on/off button, after a few months of use, requires me to push down rather forcefully for it to work.  I hope it does not break.  I payed ~12.

The saw height adjustment is a large black knob in front of the saw's handle, and since it is solid and solidly mounted, it can be used as a second handle when the saw is in use. The knob adjusts a clamp bolt that slides through a curved slot in a very heavy piece of metal, and the whole adjustment is not only quick and easy, but also solid-feeling and stable. There is a pointer, like on a table saw, telling you the depth of cut, and the pointer can be 'zeroed' for accuracy.

Sadly, Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset, angle, and other optional bases for the 310. If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock, but they are getting harder to find. The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has. These bases are available for the 7310, but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer. Again, go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases. If you don't need them, get the 310 and you'll be set for life. You'll be glad you did.

8077	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A popular competitor makes one comparable that is 34 inches high. This one is 30 or 31 depending if you leave the upper half of the top on. A comfortable work height is 34 inches. The advantage to these storehorse 10008-1's is that you can easily remove the upper half of the top cap, and neatly and snugly fit a 2x4 into the top of it, to bring it up to 34 inches. You could also make two small holes in each side of the black top cupping the two by's and add a couple of short decking screws to give it all the more stability. I have seen the competitors model at 34 inches of plastic, and unfortunately it is all chewed up due to saw blades running into it. This Storehorse, has the advantage of the 2x4 that you supply being the sacrificial, and easily replaceable work surface. You could use a 2x6, and shorten it to the exact height that you need. That is nice when you are using it to support and outfeed plank for example on your table saw.

5759	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this product before purchasing it but I decided to order it to put me over the "free shipping" cut-off amount.  I have not been disappointed.  The various heads allow you to put the glue where you want it very efficiently.  The dowel hole heads and pinpoint applicator have been great.  Also the roller head is very efficient for large glue-ups as the glue is distributed evenly and results in very minimal squeeze out.  The only thing you have to stay on top of is cleaning the heads as soon as you complete the assembly of your project.  It is not a big deal and nothing more than running them under some warm water for a few minutes.  You're then ready to go for the next project. I keep it in a convenient spot on my workbench and would recommend it, especially if you are looking avoid to paying shipping charges.
7909	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am assuming that people who bought the replacement blade, already own the saw.  If you don't own the saw, let me say this is a great product.  It keeps a beautiful straight cut on product up to about 6".  Wider stock is more problematic, but still possible.  If you live in an apartment complex and don't want to disturb your neighbors with a table saw, this is a very good option.  While the cuts are somewhat better and the blades last longer with the Japanese saws, if you are used to the stiffer Western style saws, it is too easy to destroy a $40 blade, and so now I'm using the Shark saws.
8432	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just used these blades for the first time yesterday. I've never used a dado set before so i was nervous and didn't know what to do.

If you attempt this, I recommend buying the hardwood. It will help. Read the instructions all the way through twice. (Reading them aloud to yourself might help. I was constantly re-reading as I went and referring to legends on previous pages to make sure I had it right and I still made a few boo-boos.) Cut the boards as directed. Then lay out the pieces using the boards and the metal connectors under your saw and mark where you'll be drilling with a pencil. Then drill the holes, using a drillpress if possible. It will really help. Use a friend's or ask a shop to drill the holes for a small fee. If your holes are even a little off the pieces won't fit. Once you've got the bolts through the holes and tightened you're almost done. Good luck.
Convienence of a cordless nailer.
6975	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this nailer from Amazon to lay 3/4" hardwood flooring in several rooms in my house. I have since fired about 5000 staples through it without any problems whatsoever. This stapler is very well designed ergonomically and mechanically. The mallet is big and somewhat massive in weight but there is a purpose in that. It takes very little effort and just a slight tap to drive a staple because it is pneumatic. So if a board lays nice and straight, then a slight tap will suffice, but if you have a somewhat uncooperative piece of flooring, then you will appreciate the heft of the mallet because it will cause the most finicky of boards to come together and lay tightly. The handle is long and fits well in your hand. Consequently your not bent over as much. My first floor laid was oak and I've started my second which is brazillian cherry. This wood is extremely heavy and dense. This stapler does not care how hard the wood is, it just works and flawlessly at that. After all isn't that what you want from a tool, flawless performance!
know what I mean.  Not that I've ever had that happen.  Ha!
  Initially I installed this stiffner on a Sears Radial Arm saw because I was getting a good deal of wobble with it. Oddly enough, when I tried mounting a blade, then testing the trueness, only to loosen the nut, spin the blade slightly to a new seat, then retighten, and after a few tries, I hit it right, and the wobble disappeared. So whenever I replace a blade on that saw, I tweak it until it is right. Oddly enough, it runs so true when I do that, that I moved the Forrest over to the table saw.
Oh one other slight gripe. The foot pedal has a tendency to stay flipped up when you lower the tool back to the ground.. You can adjust the tightness from rattling around to almost completely locked, and it seemed like the mechanism could have used some kind of spring return here..

This hose wears well,  resists abrasion, and doesn't kink.  It appears at first glance to have an  interntal wire for reinforcement, but the appearance is just a hollow ridge  shape that coils the length of the hose and allows the hose to flex.  The  "coil" design and heavy plastic construction allow it to be  sturdy yet remain flexible.  This design means that the interior of the  hose is not smooth -- the inverse shape of the ridge is mirrored on the  interior.  I thought this might make the hose clog easily but that is  definitely not the case.

Other than those two caveats, it's a great compressor.  Not too loud, and it will power a framing nailer, no problem (yesterday, I installed 100 fence pickets in a couple of hours, six nails per picket in rapid succession, and it had no problem keeping up).

I know it should always be, but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades, but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.

What I ended up doing is cutting an old piece of 1-5/8" I.D. radiator hose, which slips over the saw's fitting, and the fitting on the bag.  Works fine, good tight fit, but I shouldn't have to "MacGyver" a DeWalt Universal Dust Bag to fit a popular DeWalt saw.  Again, physical connection shortcomings aside, this is a very cheaply made bag.  Very thin material, and half the size of the DeWalt bag on my DW705.  Very surprised that DeWalt was willing to put their name on this.

It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills.  Don't try this with the 0234-6 (or be very careful).  The power can rip the skin off your hands.  And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.

I highly recommend the kit for tradesmen and home workshop.

  After six months of use, I have repaired this machine quite easily with parts purchase from Tool Parts, Inc (Internet source). Delivery was about ten days and since I used the machine daily decided to purchase a second belt sander. I selected the Makita 9924db again. A drive belt had broken from heavy use and a sanding plate wore through. All were very easily replace using a screwdriver. The brushes are still original (easy to inspect and access with a screwdriver) and both machines are going strong.
Nice item to have on your saw.  I don't think I can live without after using.  You just need to have strong mechanical aptitude to figure out the special installation method and special parts, when required.  Still not changing rating.  Great item, but very hard to install on my saw.

7052	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I never buy cheap tools and always suggest the same to others. This is a professional grade tool. I was in the electrical trades and am now "out of the field" but we always would ask each other for advice when we had our own projects to do at home (plumbers would ask electricians for advice, electricians would ask carpenters, etc.). I've seen this brand on the job in actual use more than any other manufacturer. Keep in mind, it's a flooring "stapler" as opposed to a flooring "nailer". I've found that staplers are recommended for most types of hardwood floors - but it's also a personal preference and is debatable by some. I used this to put down 500+ sq ft of pre-finished 3/4" thick hardwood floors. I purchased the kit which included the pre-finished flooring plate and plastic-faced mallet (you never should use a metal-faced hammer with these tools). The mallet is very high-quality and had nice heft. The pre-finished flooring plate was made of a durable plastic compound and had rollers built into it. This was designed as to not scratch pre-finished floors. The rollers also allowed you to establish a slide, smack and slide rhythm to be created without the need to lift and re-position the tool. It was well worth the investment as I considered renting it at first. But $40 a day adds up quick and I envisioned the "Mrs." would love the floor and would plan another project sometime down the road (I was right...). The tool worked great. No misfires and for those that blame the tool for an occasional tongue-split...They're wrong. Knots and a weak or overly dried portion of the tongue will happen from time to time. Partially-driven staples are usually the result of a less than firm smack of the mallet on the actuator. It requires a firm but not full-blown smack. After a few feet a mechanically-inclined person will get the hang of it. You should also test the regulator pressure on a few scrap pieces of flooring as it varies with the type of floor you're laying. I believe I had mine set at 90 lbs. An absolutely great tool. Before you start the project, run to a home improvement store to obtain the proper quick-connect fitting for the air hose you're using (you don't need a "special adapter" as I've seen someone refer to it as - you need the correct fitting (this isn't a problem  for most owners of an air compressor and many likely have one on-hand). And also make sure you have knee pads. Much of the measuring, cutting, sorting and dry-fitting required when laying a floor results in a lot of kneeling.

One problem is that they have a tendency to pull frames out of square, and or put a bow in your glue ups if you're not careful - which is really not a problem of the clamp itself, but the flexing of the pipe.  Do not buy these clamps in the 1/2" variety for any length over 4 feet.
4) The instructions are almost illegible. It reads like they were typed up from napkin scribbles by a non native English speaker. The author clearly did not actually build the product.

That's what reading them felt like. At one point I struggled to undo a step because the next sentence described something else I had to do first.

2656	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Easy to assemble, however, one bit of advice before installing your DEWALT scroll saw. Loosen all of the top bolts after bolting the stand to the floor. The Scroll Saw is a very tight fit, and it wouldn't fit in the stand as assembled. I had to loosen all of the top bolts (many) and jiggle that heavy saw around before the saw would fit in the stand. This is not a negative, but it would have been nice is Dewalt had included that in the directions. They do insist that you bolt it down to the floor before you put the saw in place. If you don't do that, it is likely that heavy saw will tip over. Once assembled, bolted to the floor, and the scroll saw installed, it's a solid fit, with no concern about tipping the stand and saw over.
2533	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This scroll saw is amazing. I love it. Very low vibration, easy blade changes, tilting upper arm. I wish it came with a light though. I ended up zip tying a LED light to the arm and that is working fine.
  I prefer the e-blades for occasional undercutting of door jambs. They have a greater depth of cut. It is worth  mentioning that although I have used a multimaster for undercutting door jambs and even door bottoms, I only did this in emergency situations when I didn't have a  jamb cutting saw on the job. A power driven jamb cutting saw is way faster, much easier and the replacement blades are cheap. I feel that Fein is wrong to promote the multimaster as a professional level tool for this purpose because its rate of cut is not comparable to circular jamb saws.
Though the router worked great, I had two problems: 1) its base was still too wide to ride on the narrow edge of my cabinet and allow the 3/8" roundover bit to do its job, and 2) the cutter hole in the bottom of the base of the PC 7310 is too small (1.204" diameter) to allow installation of my 1.260" diameter 3/8" roundover bit. Also, the plastic base provided by PC is not particularly flat, as noted by other reviewers, but that was not critical for my application.  Since the router baseplate is relatively easy to unscrew, I solved all of these issues by fabricating a new aluminum baseplate for the router with a narrow width on one side as needed for my application, and a larger hole as required for my larger cutters...and I made this baseplate flat.
Now if they offered that centrifugal-on laser cutting guide in the blade bushing it would be perfect.

3951	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this dado set on the recommendations of my brother, who is a professional finish carpenter and cabinet maker. He only uses Freud blades. I had previously had another brand that was fine for ripping dadoes but destroyed any wood during crosscut dadoes. The set arrived last saturday and I dropped what I was doing and had to try it out. I spent two hours "playing " with the set, cut dado's in melamine, birch plywood, oak plywood, solid maple and oak, mdo and mdfb. Man, this is a great little set. Though smaller than the set my brother uses (same set my Dad used for years), it suits my so called "underpowered" saw. Every dado was as clean as anyone could hope to accomplish, even on crosscuts. The tearout was so minimal, it's not worth talking about. The channel is clean and flat, every bit as nice as any dado I ever cut with a router. No burning and the feed rate is consistant with what I would use for crosscutting veneer plywood. After recieving the set, I recieved my latest copy of "American Woodworker", they had just done a review of dado sets and the SD206/208 was rated "Best Buy".  For those of us that do this for fun, this is definitly a "Best Buy".

1923	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	What can one say about a wood biscuit? The Porter-Cable tool to use them is outstanding and very efficient. Sometimes a biscuit is a little bit oversize and has to be tapped into the cut-out. Stand back because glue will spurt everywhere if you happen to tap it too hard. The biscuit process is very good for joining boards to create a large surface but other joining methods such as special router cuts may be best for fine furniture. I have built common furniture with them and used them in areas that have shearing stress. They have held well and have not failed.
Works great
  You do not want to use this blade if there is any chance of hitting a nail or screw because it will be ruined. I use the HSS blades where I might hit metal. However it is easy to snap the brittle and equally expensive HSS blades and there are many applications where the flexibility  of this blade works for you. I am confident that this is the finest blade currently available to saw through paint stuck tracks in old style double hung windows. I do a lot of this type of work and nothing else available works as well. The HSS blades will snap if you get even a little careless trying to do this operation. I have been able to unstick more than 25 window units per blade and I estimate that it takes about a third of the time that it takes to do this operation in the old way. Furthermore, you will be able to dismantle the unit without breaking the stops, the parting beads, the sash or the glass. This blade has increased my production by a factor of 3 or more in old window repair and restoration. That typically amounts to twelve units a day rather than four.
When you have a GOOD hammer, (like this one) made of GOOD steel, it is easy to sharpen one claw to a point to set nails too. That precludes the need for carrying a separate nail-set in most cases. I'm a fan of any tool that does several jobs well since that lightens my load and is one less small thing to remember, search-for or lose.

7633	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The shipping box that it came in was in bad shape. Like other reviews, my wm425 was missing a part - one of the plastic frame guards. The wm425 is sturdy and stable although it does have some shortcomings. The three wood table tops are too thin (5/8) cheap plywood and mine were warped. They should be at least 3/4 inch plywood. The nylon belt drive and plastic hubs slip and the belt skips often which wears out the belt and drive hubs. When tightening the crank assembly to hold wood pieces for work the front sliding clamp table top tends to move up off of its side supports - its really a bad design. The plastic spacers that are bolted to the three wood  tables are poorly designed - they wear easily and have too much up/down play. The right angle side support which is welded to the frame is too thin and mine was not level - it was warped and required bending to get the table top surfaces flat.
1.) The old 330 has a metal housing, where as this one is plastic. Granted, on a cold day the plastic is probably more friendly, but I like the feel of the metal housing better.
I had a 3x21 Craftsman belt sander, and was trying to use that to sand cabinet doors flat (building new cabinets with oak slab doors).  I was struggling to flatten the panels, having a difficult time keeping belts tracking properly, and the old sander smelled like it was on fire most of the time.

3595	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great drill! Unquestionably Milwaukee makes the best, most durable, and comparably powerful drill motor on the market. The gear housing is metal, not plastic. The pistol grip is thick plastic, and very comfortable for larger hands. ( Its a pretty good stretch to hold this drill with your hand high on the housing while trying to drill a hole and toggle the trigger ). Speaking of the trigger, it is very sensitive & accurate, again seems to be of a better quality than most. The Quick-Loc cord is a nice feature, but really should be of the twist lock variety, particularly for working at heights. The replacement cords seem pricey at first; however, when you figure on taking the housing apart to access the set screws . . . as you normally would, it is well worth the price, particularly if on the job. What more can you say about a drill, this one is powerful, well made, should last a very long time (even under heavy use)and will drill holes with any bit you can fit in the chuck. The side handle is  must with all the torque this drill has, and the threads are coarse enough that they usually don't clog with dust alone, dirt will do it though. The only drawback to this drill is its weight, which is good and bad. It is good, because of all the reasons listed above, but if you use this drill all day, you can really feel its heft ( I have the 75th Anniversary model,which is even heavier). One other comment, for 1/2" drill motors the keyed chuck makes all the difference, keyless chucks just don't hold the bits tight enough, especially when drilling in tough materials. I doubt very seriously, you can buy a better drill than this one.
8643	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love these one piece designs. This feels solid in the hand and very swift. This isn't necessarily a hammer for a beginner but more the professional.

7882	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this work table instead of just going with a couple of sawhorses because I thought it would be a more versatile device to have around, and I must say that so far I've been very happy with that decision. I was split between this one, the WM 425, and the smaller, less expensive WM 225. I decided to go with the 425 because for an extra $20, it comes with an extra board for a wider working surface, and it has the option to fold the clamping side of the table at a 90 degree angle for vertical clamping - this can be quite handy when you want to clamp a very wide piece of wood (say a sheet of plywood). In my own projects, I found the extra table space to be quite handy, though I haven't used the vertical clamping feature yet. To be fair, any ol' piece of wood could add table space to the 225, so that one might be a better value. And the 225 is smaller and lighter, which is likely an asset for apartment dwellers or those with limited storage space or need for this slightly more complicated version of the Workmate.

What's great - Heavy duty fence, clear view of the cut point from the left hand side of the saw, notch to position power cord so it is out of the way on rips, clear and precise depth and angle adjustment, unbelievably smooth and powerful motor.
I really like the D-Handle. Control is excellent and the the trigger control is right where it should be. The power cord is attached to the handle which makes it convenient to disconnect and safely change bits.
I really wish I could return the blade at this point and try the 100 tooth crosscut blade from Diablo.

2562	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm new to scroll sawing and went with the Delta 40-694 when I heard that it was essentially the same saw as the DeWalt 788. Yes, they undoubtedly share many of the same part, but the Delta is longer and cannot be bolted down in the rear of the stand (single bolt hole) and still secure the more important front (two bolts). That said, I was still able to use it, because the front base fits perfectly into the front of the stand. A couple of 5/16" bolts snugged it up and it was mission accomplished. Now the wait is for my books to come in. The stand is a little tall and I find that I'm using a bar stool to compensate for the height of the stand (I'm 6'1"). For the Delta, in general, I would recommend a different tool stand.
9652	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The 2 larger bits were bent so bad they could not be used.  The box they came in was not damaged, so this is either a manufacturing defect or the bits were bent before mailing.  Needless to say, I am not happy.
8557	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my husbands new grinder, I didn't have a clue about it, but I do know that it worked really great for cutting through cement. It would have been nice to have a bigger circumference but I suppose that is why he has the other tools I have gotten him. He loved it and that is what matters to me.
4675	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am very pleased with this plate joiner. Seems to be built very well. Right out of the box I was able to use for applying wood edge to countertop blanks. Nice feel, very good accuracy, easy to use. First day of use, very happy with this purchase.
439	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've had the XtraFlex2 a bit shy of two years.  It definitely provides good light to read from the Kindle in a variety of lighting situations.  A great improvement from the 'flashlight under the covers' we used so often as kids.  Cons:  after a while the neck tends to waver and roam to its own tune.  Also the prongs that hold the battery cover in place have broken off.  It's easy enough to use tape to hold it together but a bit tedious when its time to install new batteries.  Pros:  price;  two levels of bright light;  practical and not obtrusive.
Sometimes it gets hung up snapping on/off the battery.
DIMENSIONS:

In the "box": the outer blades, chippers, shims, and a case/rack which holds it all quite well. (Note, most other sets in this price range don't come with shims.)  Freud includes instructions which are pretty straightforward, but again you should run scrap because every bit of wood is different -- not to mention that humidity can affect the thickness of your stock.
The blade is very sharp so you have to be care taking it on and off the saw arbor.
3220	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This Bosch Slider is an absolute delight to work with. I used to have a craftsman miter saw and this one is so superior it makes the craftsman tool look like a toy. The supplied blade is smooth and precise. The overal product is very well executed and the performance is solid. Everything is perfectly aligned and the miter angles are as accurate as you can get. This tool is a real pleasure to work with and way cheaper than the equivalent Makita or Hitachi models. A real winner in my eyes.
2499	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've completed a bunch of projects using my new Milwaukee 6390-21 saw.  I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Milwaukee-Rip-Fence-Kit-Model-49-22-4146/dp/B000022473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146</a>.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.  Every time I start a new job, I look forward to opening that big red box and taking out this really fine instrument.

5166	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	See what I did there? Its a reducer, it works as it should. Nice thick plastic that should last forever if taken care of properly. I clamped one of those adjustable slinky-looking tubes to the bottom of my table saw and this reducer actually friction fit perfectly in the other end of the tube. Now the reducer sits perfectly out the side of my table saw for easy attaching/removing of the main duct collection hose I switch between various tools. A great purchase if you require its services.
9796	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wanted something with a higher upgrade than what I was using and see in the Box Stores. I paid a few dollars more and have tested it out for the last couple of days. It doesn't leak when putting my nail gun down - this is a plus. Not sure if this is made in America, but appears to have the local stamp on the coupler. You will not be sorry in buying this product. I looked long and hard before buying this simple item. Hope this helps.
I'm beginning to think that the Freud anti-kickback "feature" is nothing but a dangerous sales gimmick.  And I definitely won't be buying any more Freud blades in the near future.  This one's going back to where I got it, too.
faster to use and very useful in every works need to hold
1263	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So far the ones I have used are all still working in my landscape lights after almost 2 months.  The trick is to use a paper towel or something else to hold them when you install them.  Your fingers will leave oil on the lamps and cause them to burn out very very quickly.  Awesome price for these since one bulb will cost a few dollars from the home improvement store.
 I like Jorgensen clamps, I have several sets of their bar clamps, and their lighter standard clamps as well. All in all, the Bessey's are made out of more steel, and are more heavy duty. The Jorgensen?s you have a third bracket-clip that enables you to convert it into a spreader, and acts as a support, to prevent it from tipping, when using the clamp for a far smaller piece of material than the clamp was designed for. A great idea, but the Bessey's can easily solve the tilting problem, with a small piece of stock to support them. Better yet, having the proper size clamp eliminates the problem altogether. Pertaining to the spreader capacity, that is great, but I do have several of the Tru-Grip quick clamps, which have the spreader capability, which I rarely if ever have to use.
6163	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle.  It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate  clamping handles to tighten separately.  Their large surface area provides  solid alignment, even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for  larger tasks (e.g., over one foot per side).
I can't imagine making a rip cut with out these.  I can live with the lesser quality because the stellar safety performance  offsets it.
8237	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a fantastic little tool that any woodworker should own.
8325	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Nope, no good. This item may be discontinued and what's still available may be the dregs of this line.  It's increasingly hard to find.  And Coleman Cable now has a line called American Contractor that, as far as I can tell, is just a new marketing strategy for Polar/Solar cords.  May be try one of those.  Anyway, that's my speculation.  My cord came with the wires twisted and visibly deforming the insulating jacket.  Other polar/solar cables I've seen do not look like this.

Takes 3 AAA batteries so it is a bit heavy for a paperback book.  Also great to keep one clipped to a visor or head rest in the car.  Solid construction and the flexible metal goose neck holds its position pretty well.
4877	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this saw at a woodworking show a couple years ago and have been thrilled with its performance ever since.  I previously owned an inexpensive Black and Decker which had poor balance, a top handle, and tended to vibrate terribly.  I have also used DeWalt and Milwaukee jigsaws, and I still maintain that Bosch is the best.  I happen to prefer the barrel grip.  With this saw I can make super smooth, nearly tear-out free cuts in almost any material as long as I use the proper blade and blade speed.  The sheer lack of vibration alone makes this saw worth its weight in gold when you are trying to make an intricate cut in thin material!!!  I highly recommend this product.

2991	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I avoided buying an electric sander for a long time, but when my projects got bigger and more serious, it could be put off no longer. This is the little guy I ended up with, and boy does it do a nice job! I have three or four grit levels I go through so the hook and loop makes that a snap. Even running 60 grit, I don't see any swirl marks and after the 220 step, the wood is really nice and smooth.

3492	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this drill several years ago.  It's corded drill of course and is very powerful.  It comes with a side handle which should be used because the drill is powerful enough to injure you if the drill should stick and twist.  As I recall there was a choice of keyed chuck or a non keyed chuck.  Mine has a keyed chuck and a drill this powerful should have a keyed chuck.  When I got mine they were still made in the US and mine is really a quality tool.  Unfortunately now they are made in China and I can't speak to the comparison between the older US made drills and the current Chinese made ones.
This is a good saw.

I have their routers, circular saws (older versions), biscuit joiner, nail guns and a lot more. I bought this sander a few months after they came out. It is  the worst tool ever made. They need a better design for holding the profiles. I have used it 3 times and it sanded good as long as the profile didn't fall out. I have decided to use the profiles without the vibrator. I hope someone will come up with a manual type profile sander that you can grasp easier than the little profiles. I wish I would have given it back to the manufacturer, but I have had it too long. I would not reccomend this to anyone unless you want to use the profiles manually.

I'm not a professional and I don't use this was all the time.  I'm a regular family handyman who gets ideas from reading woodworking books and magazines.  And I don't know how I managed to get along without this saw now that I have one.  If you're a weekend do it yourselfer like me, this saw is like owning a BMW instead of a scooter.

The tracking  system really holds the sander belt in place.  I placed the belt on the  sander, held it upside-down, running the sander until the belt no longer  shifted left or right.  Then I began sanding, and for the whole time I  worked, the belt did not move from center at all.  Because the housing is  made of metal, even if the belt DID move, it would not damage the sander,  as it would on machines with plastic bodies.

Or, if they were completely doing them by hand with an adze, yet somehow selling them under $100 and NOT from overseas. Answer, this little guy. Pop him on an angle grinder and watch him go. Works great, HOWEVER...this sucker is dangerous. Make sure you're wearing a full face shield and a guarded grinder and take it slow. One odd angle or errant cut and it'll hop out of your piece. After 30 minutes or so of using it you'll become more confident and capable, but do not take this guy for granted. He'll save you a ton of time and give you a dremel on steroids, or wreck a bunch of wood and you if not careful.

I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders. They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published (presumably figuring that a lot of kids, little and big, were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed...).

I wish it was a bit more powerful and that the first mode were more like a night light just to walk around at night and find your book.
The fine adjustment dial (which was the main reason I bought this fence) is a bit of a joke.  There is a graduated ring (0..9) but no way to lock the ring to the knob - bump it once during series of a "precision cuts" and you can kiss your zero point goodbye.  Maybe if it was a bit more of a friction fit... but mines pretty easy to move.  3 options 1) Live with it and be careful not to bump it.  2) tape the knob down once you decide where "zero" should be.  3) superglue.

My first project  was cutting up a bunch of rebar to use spiking railroad ties down.  Over  100 cuts (with a Lenox blade) and I wasn't tired and neither was the saw.

Second--sharpen often. The duller a blade is, the faster it wears--both on itself, on the planer, and on your nerves as you try to force a piece of wood through an increasingly noisy planer. Sharpening often also reduces nicks and tear-outs.

I tried the. 60- tooth version of the blade I had when I found it on sale, but sold it, since there was little difference. Still a decent blade, but nothing special. And otherwise, DeWalt's recommendation of no more than a 5 degree hook angle ruled out most contenders.

The Makita had unstoppable power, but that is not what I need. I'm a woodworker, and I use this to break down sheet goods and cut hardwood to rough size.

1853	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this sander since 1976.  Back then, it was made by Rockwell.  Porter Cable bought out their tool division several years ago.  They know a timeless design when they see one and this sander needed no improvement.  This is a heavy, heavy duty orbital sander.  It uses its own weight to do the job.  Using half sheets of sand paper, it cheaper to operate over the long run over having to buy round sheets that come 4 or 6 to a pack and can be pricey.

4236	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I first started doing fine wood working about 4 years ago, I bought a dado set for about $50.  Well, as you can imagine, you get what you pay for.  I had to have a filing shop match the cutters up so I could get close to square cuts.  When it was time to move up, I purchased this product and have been extremely pleased with it.  I decided to give this set a try as I had purchased a Freud 60 tooth blade and it worked wonderfully, with no chipping on plywood or any of the solid woods I used.


I'm updating the above, i went to my local Dewalt service centre and the technican told me that i'd have to buy seven 30mm to 15mm reducers or send the Dado set back which would cost me nearly as much in postage as the seven reducers. I bought the reducers, this still leaves the issue of the shims being unsupported on the arbour shaft because of their 30mm bores. I'll probably have to buy a set of shims with 15mm bores which will cost me more money. He said that Dewalt don't have a slim inside blade washer so i'll have to get it reduced in thickness in a machine shop if i want to get the full stack on the arbour. I'll have to turn the outside blade washer around so that the 30mm protrusion is on the outside against the lock nut. Sounds simple enough doesn't it!

I then move the dial one turn in the opposite direction without regard to backlash. The third pic shows this new touch off and the one that's on center. It's really hard to tell but I don't think backlash would be an issue at all. Having said that, it's always best to adjust in the same direction.

It is up to you to determine which model will work best for you but for me, the 500X does all I need until they improve the model that sharpens spade bits.
By far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router. This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers (the guys in my shop own two or three each), but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large. It is not made for mass market consumers (Home Depot/Lowes don't carry it), and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router. The 7310 trimmer, however, is but a shadow of the 310. Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you'll see what I mean. The 310 is truly a fine machine. At $100, the 7310 is not a great value. At $159, the 310 is worth every penny. Spend more now and you'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best. More importantly, your work will show the wisdom of your choice.

3255	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I got this saw to replace my 18v DeWalt 5-3/8" cordless trim saw, which is underpowered and can't handle much more than thin plywood and short cuts on 2x4s. The Skil saw completely blows it away in terms of power. I did like the fit and feel of the DeWalt better, but that was probably due more to the fact that it was cordless than anything else. The Skil saw is a terrific alternative to bulkier and heavier 7-1/4" circular saws. I almost never need to cut wood that thick except on my table saw anyway. I have a feeling my 7-1/4" circular saw is going to collect a lot of dust now that I have added this smaller Skil saw to my shop.

5593	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very good hose overall. We use it most commonly with an older Sears large wet/dry shop vac. It is a far more practical hose than those provided with most vacuums; it has a far better combination of flexibility, length and resistance to crush (including under vacuum load) than the other OEM or replacement hoses available from Sears and several other manufactures. Be aware though that it has a smaller hose diameter than typical 2-1/2 vac hoses and that it does not come with an adapter to directly fit the female intake ports on 2-1/2" hose vacuums. You will probably need at least a male to male adapter.

4370	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had my Delta planer for quite awhile now. In its lifetime it has had hundreds of board feet of hard and soft wood passed thru its portels. Much of this wood has been some of the hardest stuff on the planet. Mesquite, Quebracho, Vera, Mistol and white Oak just to name a few. I am on the first edge of my second set of knives. As in all planers, knife adjustment is critical, and with these knives it is as simple as tying your shoelace. Knives are sharp enough to shave with out of the pkg, and the locater holes make alignment a snap. Getting four cutting edges for this price makes the whole package a five star unit. I've had my problems with some Delta products, but this isn't one of them. Love the planer and love these knives. Highly recommend.

I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders. They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published (presumably figuring that a lot of kids, little and big, were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed...).

2588	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It went together easily, it is solid and it fits the scroll saw footprint just right. The narrow back with only one leg makes it easier to maneuver around it in my small work area.

Great tool for the money, for a DIY'er or pro.  You could get away without using it, but why would you want to.
On the minus side, the guide block does narrow the throat of the saw about an inch, and (at least the 3/4 hp 14OS) is underpowered for resawing so I am not convinced that the extra 6 inches cutting capacity is all that useful.  also,getting that big bolt tightened inside the frame is tough, you can't use an adjustable wrench.


7648	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A little tricky to put together, but once up it's good to go. The bottom legs fold in or out depending on the height you want to work at.
So, don't be cheap. Be proactive and replace those blades. You spent a lot of money on the machine, so keep it working well. Same goes for bandsaw blades (same basic experience), saw blades, etc. It is an expensive hobby for some and a business expense that can't be circumvented for others.
These are tough little clamps that you will find new uses for whenever you're in the shop.  Get several - you don't want to end up "one clamp short of a set-up."

In closing--this tool works great. It is a bear to use. You must use scaffolding. It is slow. Expect about three weeks of all day work to get your old house scraped and ready to prime. Buy lots of discs, about 10 for an average size house. Use only the 24 grit as the discs wear out and you need all the cutting power you can get. But beware as a new 24 grit disc cuts viciously and leaves severe swirl marks. But after about 10 minutes of use it wears down to a manageable level.

2488	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this flashlight a lot while I am working.  It is great to use when I am working on plumbing and have to look into a tight space or while inside of a bathroom or kitchen cabinet  This is a nice accessory to use with your 18VDC Dewalt tool. You just snap it onto the Dewalt battery that now acts as a solid heavy base and you can twist the flashlight head to aim it at your work I recently used it under a sink to aim at the pipes as I did some plumbing with both hands free.  I like how it stays where you set it and the beam doesn't move around while you are working.  It sits solidly in place and frees up your hands.
7566	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Uhhhh.... I'm confused. This gigantic jalopy is supposed to be compatible with my saw, yet it doesn't fit anywhere in the case. Not to mention when you tighten down the knob the thing gets cocked at a crazy angle . Would never have bought it if I knew these things. And what are all these nuts for? I imagine this thing won't get much use with having to drag it around separate from the saw. These things are already useless gimmicks and this ones got issues thanks for nothing
9961	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product!!!!!
5916	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very nice insert. I had read some issues with certain DeWalt models, and sure enough, with my blade all the way UP, the area where the cloth dust shroud attaches to the frame pushes up the throat plate. It would have been nice if Leecraft would have routed just a bit further, but given that they did rout partway, I suspect this is only an issue with some DeWalt saws. Anyway, it was easy to rout a bit more relief into the underside, so no saw setting causes the plate to move.
I do like the soft start and constant RPM features.

Another note: the beam cutter does a good job carving out the arc for braces.  This can be done freehand, or following a scribed line.  This is particularly useful on large braces that are too cumbersome to guide through a band saw.  Again, the "rip chain"  file angle does wonders to speed up the process.

I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them, again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over, in my case, to the right.  Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!
3592	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This drill is the best in it's class. No other matches its power for its size and weight. As others have said, watch out for its torque. Used it with a 3" Holesaw .......it fetched up and put my arm through some drywall. Built to last with easily replaceable brushes ........ a lifetime tool.
2524	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It works fine as a guide. Once you understand the fine adjustment it works ok also.
2500	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a very nice, high-quality extension.  It is wider, and has a flat top on the support (opposed to the curved bar on most miter-saw extensions).  In addition, it is longer than the extensions you typically receive with a 10" miter saw.  The screws to secure it are self-tapping, which is explained in the instructions, so be prepared for that.  I use it with the DW703.  The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that if you want support on both sides, you need to purchase 2 of the DW7080's.  This gets a bit pricey, considering many saws come with extensions included.  A partial solution to this is to purchase the DW703K, which includes one extension for the same price as the DW703.  Overall, however, the combination of a DeWalt saw and these extensions are well worth the price.
  The other camp feels that for security purposes, gluing and screwing is the way to go. In the book, "Building Kitchen Cabinets" by Udo Schmidt (an excellent book by the way) the author states, "The expense of a pocket hole-drilling jig will easily be repaid in the time you save assembling face frames.

Ive finally compromised in removing my pawls, and only installing one wheel in the back of the blade.

I held the 8-amp model in a store the other day, this is quite a bit shorter and therefore less stress on your wrist when drilling horizontal. NOTE: the box of my current-version 234-6 states it's max rpm is 950, so the many debates here about RPM being too low for wood may be less relevant now.

5849	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought the RT150 table to house my Porter-Cable 890 series router.  The table package arrived in excellent shape from Amazon.  Bench Dog packed everything in the box very securely with thick styrofoam around all edges to keep the table pieces from getting damaged in shipping by the UPS goons who seem to mangle everything they touch.  There were no missing parts and, if anything, there were a few extra (which Bench Dog warns you about so you won't worry about it).  The assembly instructions were very good, although it really would have been helpful to have full-size illustrations for each of the screws -- there are many different screws/bolts that look very similar, and the appearance and height differences are subtle for many of them.  That issue aside, the instructions were very clear and easy to follow.  All of the parts were machined perfectly, and everything fit together exactly as it was supposed to fit.
Next is the Bosch with a slightly weaker motor at 3.8 amps, and doesn't have the speed range of the Makita, even though it is at the same price. Nice overall tool though.

2676	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had this saw about a month now and I am very impressed. This is one powerful, tough, saw. As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse.  I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite.  I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years. I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left, but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed, and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side, because the blade on left is meant for left handers.
This price is about 1/2 of what I found at other sites.
There are not as many 8-1/4" blade available as there are the more common 7-1/2" blades. Indeed, none of the stores I visited carry 8-1/4" at all. You might find that you have to do all blade purchases online. Of course, if you don't mind the inaccurate (and reduced) depth of cut, you can install 7-1/2" blades on this saw in a pinch.

I'm giving it a 5 star because It works great.  The 5-quarter decking that I am using is not perfectly straight but this tool is able to get it perfectly straight.  You also need to use this tool with some kind of 1/4 inch spacer to put between the boards to keep the gaps even.  There are other ways to make deck boards straight without spending $50 but this product will save you time and is very easy to use and the tool will probably last forever.

9705	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this due to redoing my back deck. The old deck had rotted over the years from lack of maintenance from the previous owner. My dad came down to help with the deck but he managed to hurt himself while we were ripping up the old deck. So I had to reinstall the new decking myself. I was not aware that this could be done by one person till I was looking around amazon and stumbled onto the BoWrench. I ordered it and got it the next day due to free amazon prime NDA shipping which worked out great since I needed it quickly to finish the deck. And let me tell you this tool is awesome. It is as easy as putting it on a joist and tighting it up against the flooring you are putting in. It allows you to have the extra hand to install decking yourself.

9610	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does what it's suppose to do and that is it makes it easier to screw in screws, especially when you're screwing into wood. The magnetic benefit is simple but makes screwing so much easier, especially when you are prone to dropping your screws. When you are working in limited work space it's much easier to be able to put a screw onto the bit and then put the screw onto your work area instead of having to use two hands to hold the screw onto the bit until you have a bit into your work piece. Being able to simply pull out your bit out of this drive and replace it with another without having to remove the whole drive out of your drill constantly is another benefit. I'm constantly misplacing mine so I made sure I have extra on hand. Happy screwing!

9130	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this nailer back in August and have used it for various applications around the house.  The main reasoning for the purchase was for a basement finishing job but it was a stockade fencing job that it came in most handy.  This fence was situated in an area that made it very difficult to maneuver and since I was by myself it was that much harder.  Without this gun I would never have been able to hold the stockades to the posts and at the same time apply a fastener; I would have gone crazy trying. This gun made a grueling task into, well...perhaps an achievable and generally acceptable task (I JUST COULDN'T SAY IT WAS FUN).  The gun has always fired when expected with one exception.  This was when I inverted it.  When the gun is inverted it sometimes will misfire.  Other than that this is one well thought out tool.  The advantage of not dragging around a hose and compressor is really important to me, especially on small single man projects.  This gun's only limits are in heavy production (home building) environments.  I think that building homes would be a bit taxing for it and pneumatic nailers would be better suited; though I am sure it would be handy in many home building scenarios also.  This Gun is perfect for: Home extensions, remodeling, decking and fencing.
9091	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Pros:
I used these blades to cut vinyl siding. I had over 100 feet of siding that needed to be cut into bundles of 16" for trash pick up. That means that I made 80 cuts with it, through a medium quality siding. It cut through like butter.

Like any precision measuring device you have to be careful handing it so you don't knock it out of adjustment once you have it set up.  I could only find one video on youtube and some of the information given was not accurate regarding flipping the jig etc.  Just follow the porter cable instructions and it is foolproof.  They explain the right and left hinge door when viewed from the barrel side and how to position the door on its side, with top of right hinge door to left.  If you imagine facing the hanging doors and the barrel pins are visible, then the right hand door will be rotated to the left and placed on its side and the hinge jig place on that edge with the edge of the jig held tightly against the door and nail in position.
8236	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought it because I need to make very precision angled lines.  This seems to be the best method, although it is only 6",  so it's better  for smaller work.  It is dead-on accurate, and I actually use it to check the accuracy of other adjustable bevels and protractors.
3. Furthermore, two screws were missing, and I could not fully affix the metal track until the manufacturer sent the screws (yeah, I could have gone to Lowe's and procured what I needed, but it was the principle of the matter).

I've known from previous shops I've worked at that these Milton fittings last much, MUCH longer - many years in some cases!

On the inner rim I added a thin sealing foam strip so it now seals much better to the bucket.

The guide only works with the plunge base but that isn't a problem for me because the plunge base is more stable in my opinion. You should attach a wooden fence to the guide too to get more accurate results and so you don't mar the piece you are routing. My only complaint is that I now need to find and purchase a hose and/or adapter that fits this guide and my shop vac.

- The dustbag does not stay on. I solved this problem by wrapping some tape around the dust port a few times.
8883	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just received the Starrett 6" and immediately ordered the 12. First I tried to rejuvenate an old one that belonged to my father. After a half hour of scrubbing, de-rusting, and fine polishing, I thought I had a twelve. I checked the depth accuracy, and it was right on. Then I checked it as a square. Although the end to end was correct, the center of the ruler had been accidentally ground. So if I tried to square up a 4" high table saw blade for example, it would be off. That was all I needed. I went to the computer and ordered the 12 as well. You can't afford to screw around with the device that all other tools are measured by. A cut only off 1 degree creates a 91-degree edge. When gluing and clamping that edge, it bows or skews your project. Then when you try to mate that up to a square project, it doesn't fit. Save yourself a lot of heartache, time, and money, get a starrett combination square.

Since long straight rip-cuts are the forte of circ-saws, that's a crucial oversight!
2214	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I love Dewalt, but somebody skimped on the design of this thing.  I originally bought it because it flexes and wraps and it's portable.  Really, that's all the pros of this light.  The biggest con is that the bulb that is used for this light made me feel like I'm back in the 90's with the one crappy bulb that's like 10 lumens which is probably why its also on the cheaper end, but nowadays, just get the led types and brighter of course.
9428	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good addition to the drill set. So far, holding up well.
378	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Throws lots of light and the flex neck helps you position in a way to distribute the light into both pages, so you're not constantly adjusting it.  The light stays put too which is important.
I've also used the beaded face frame attachment with this table.  Amazing device and a huge time saver if you plan on building 100+ lineal feet of beaded cabinets.  It's extremely easy to install and takes just a few minutes and tries to get the adjustments spot on.  That will get easier with use.

5480	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect


  No hold-down clamp.
8920	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Nice set and an interesting 2 sided chipper wing.  Does not cut perfectly square corners as the item description may allude, but it is very close.
2128	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These work great. I don't know why others complain about them being low or sagging. They are fully adjustable and you can set them even with your table top. They are so simple I don't know how anyone could have trouble figuring this out. My only complaint is they crowd the storage area on the side of your DW744 just a bit (where you keep the spare blade and wrenches). Not a big deal though.


Once in awhile, I cut something that I need to turn over to finish the cut.  On those occasions, it would be nice if the saw was a 12", but for 90 percent of the work most people are going to ask it to do, it will do just fine.  If I was in construction business, I probably would have bought a 12" saw.
The only reason I didn't give this five stars is the slight 'crowning' of the plate at the center. I'd rather the plate be perfectly flat. It's how they designed this plate and I'm sure some people like it as a heavier router would pull it down to flat.
8450	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	works well... be sure to "dry" fit your pieces to ensure your dado is wide enough
All in all, it's something that should have just come with the saw; but, because it doesn't, you should add this if you ever cut sizable stock on your saw.  Much easier to deal with and safer cuts.
9722	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It's perfect, I had a coupler that was leaking - this was a great replacement. Release is very smooth and easy.
2379	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	bought to work on my car in a dark garage. The battery base hardly gets the lamp on it's feet unless you have a long irregular surface. there's one spot on my engine (over the fuse box) where it can stand.
Third, the chisels do not drill perfectly square holes. The auger bits are just a hair bigger than the chisels. So, you end up with a circle with square corners. This effect is more pronounced the bigger the chisel/bit.

7065	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It's a Ridgid pipe wrench.  Great for turning round pipe and Rods.  I prefer a strap wrench for delicate work.  This is less abusive than Channellocks when you have the option.

3854	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Did a great job, happy with them
7853	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	A very nice plane once I filed down the mouth to make the opening big enough for the blade to protrude far enough to work.  If you are not mechanically inclined then do not purchase this plane.  I am kind of disappointed that Stanley would sell an item that needed modification to make it serviceable. I have always been impressed with my Stanly tools in the past.  Hope this is not a foreboding sign of thing to come.
I must also add that the Freud SD606 6-Inch Dial-A-Width Dado is pricey. However, the quality, accuracy and ease of use and setup offsets its cost.
1944	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have been using the 330 for 15 years Yes the same one all this time. I borrowed a new Dewalt random orbit sander to repair the handrails and posts on an old deck. It took less than 15 minutes to return to my old 330 to finish the job. For shier cutting, power and sanding ability nothing I have used in over 30 years of carpentry can match the Porter Cable 330 palm sander when a palm sander is the tool of choice. On the downside the Sticky pad for this sander does not hold up well. The glue on paper tends to tear the pad when removing. I purchased a new pad when I started this rail and post job and a week later I trashed it. For this reason I buy the pads in multiples from Amazon. Hook and loop paper might be a better choice but the H&L paper in 4x4 sheets is not readily available.

1689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Not much to say, well made for the most part, all metal where it should be. My PC690 fits well. The depth adjustment rod is a little sticky. I think it has some burrs on it. I will pull it off and clean it up for easier use. I should have bought this in a kit with fixed base and router together.

So, in summary...be cautious when using this saw...but BUY AND USE THIS SAW! This is probably the best $20 I've ever spent on a woodworking tool.

played around and made a number of cuts with them.
4059	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold, feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.

I guess now that they fixed the one bolt from coming loose, now the motor takes the vibration and its bolts come loose. :)

4718	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great little addition for any table saw (I purchased the green wheels for my shaper as well) - you'll probably need the track for it.  Holds down, pulls towards the fence, and prevents kick-back all in one!  Well worth it!
7022	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These are great toggle clamps.  The only reason I gave them a 4 stars is because one of the toggle clamps I received is a little difficult to toggle.  Even lubricants don't make that much difference in how well this one toggle moves back and forth.  Other than that, these are good, well-priced toggle clamps.
The only problem I have had was the need to replace battery pack once or twice ( amazon carries them&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Milwaukee-48-11-0100/dp/B00008Z9YJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Milwaukee 48-11-0100 </a>&nbsp;), but that is acceptable in the course of over a decade of use.

2716	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	What can you say about a stand?  It went together easily enough and accomodates my 788 just fine. The legs have a lip on them to allow the stand to be anchored into the floor, however I was not about to ramset a scroll saw into my concrete shop floor. Or, maybe those holes are for wheels, hmmmmm. If you need a stand for your saw, get it.

4902	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Fits like OEM...which wears out quick.
5837	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I got this to tighten my 6" ducting onto a filter. It was worthless. It would never screw tighter due to the end being warped so I removed it and used pliers to make it flat again and the same thing happened once it got to the same spot. I went to the local hydro store and got much higher quality ones for about the same price. I'll definitely not be buying another one of these.
I basically threw away the instructions after reading through it once to get the basic idea of how the parts fit together. I then assembled the stationary subassembly part of the table and test fitted it to my saw. I then marked the 4 holes to be drilled and where I would need to add a horizontal brace along the lower part of the table saw stand. This brace I made out of a 2x4.

What else can I say....
8931	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have used this set up for the past 5 years for carpentry and it was pretty good.
3691	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Always wanted a Porter Cable belt sander.  My old Ryobi lasted years but I know it was not a great machine.  I got this perhaps 5 years ago but as I am not working regularly as a carpenter anymore, and the machine was used for one small job and then hardly at all for 5 years.

Save your old batteries for running this thing.
It is a very sturdy table.  The hardware may be intimidating, but assembly was pretty easy. I installed the table by myself using a few clamps and a 2 x 4 for support while installing the hinge.

The bag is the perfect size for my needs and is padded, so when I put the boules in the car, I do not beat up the car.  It has a logo on the side, but not so large that I am advertising some tool company in a case where I do not have tools in it.  I love the bag so much I am going to get some more for other uses.

8453	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Took me a little bit to figure out the spacing requirements and placement of the spacers, but after that it was smooth sailing. I wish they would diagram the placement a little better that way you know exactly where to position things.
Now about the Five stars rating for the product itself. This is a really great router table. I gave this review four stars, because Kreg was partly at fault for the damage mine received. If they had designed their packaging better, the damage probably wouldn't have happened. The padding in the box was a piece of styrofoam 1/4" thick and some corrugated cardboard. MDF is not that sturdy. It needs at least 2" of foam padding.

4645	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The quality of the cut is fantastic, especially on the large MDF base and crown molding I install with 12 miter saw.  In addition the coating on the blade is excellent and has has not rusted despite being left on the job site for weeks at a time.  The blade is also very stable and allows accurate compound miter cuts.

867	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the second set of bulbs I've bought from these folks and they are great.  I'm not going to say they last as long as the "name brand" bulbs - fact is, they probably don't.  However, they have more than adequate durability (I'm not changing them every other month) so even if they only last half as long - with the price differential, they're a real steal.

6090	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does a good job of dropping sawdust out of the vacuum hose before it hits the shop vac, making the filter last longer. I vacuum a lot of dust which quickly clogs the filter otherwise. Note that this makes the unit more cumbersome. The lid stays on if the vac is on, easily falls off the standard five gallon bucket otherwise. I am going to add some bungee ties to keep the lid on the vacuum is off. The price is excellent, delivery speed excellent as well. I recommend if you have space and the need.
442	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What can I say, this does the job just great. Firm light holder with a long arm so I can position it anywhere and it stays. Clip is strong and have had no problems on paperbacks or hardbacks. Light is BRIGHT, almost too bright. I always keep just one light on since I read in bed while husband is asleep. I like that the batteries are standard and I don't have to go hunt for those expensive watch batteries for replacements.

Previous versions of this model had problems overheating the batteries and as you are probably aware, heat and batteries isn't a good combo and one that you'll sometimes get with "frys"; some units reportedly caught on fire and suffered a complete meltdown.  However, this was a rare occasion and most cases of overheating just led to a very expensive and curiously short-lived battery[streetprices around $40-$50 per batt].
9387	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This is not a quality product. The fittings are mis-threaded, which makes it impossible to put couplers on this hose. Goes back to Amazon.

938	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For the price, very happy.
The cons.  Dulls quicky on hard concrete or mortar. However it can be sharpened with a grinding wheel making sure not to overheat the cutting edges as this will destroy the hardness of the tool steel.  I had to sharpen this tool at least 5 times during my work.
5655	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have gone through a couple of these doing tile work, they are great for cleaning up grout and mortar and last a reasonable amount of time.  I did recently buy a Bosch carbide bit much like the Fein but slightly different shape that I prefer over this one though.  The Bosch 'tear drop shape' is much better at getting into corners with and seems to last just as long.
465	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great as a book light. But it is useful for more than just that. For just about any small lighting situation. For example keyboard/laptop. Don't let the size fool you, it is plenty bright; was surprised when I first started using it. Like a small led flashlight, but with a base, clip and flexible neck.  Will buy a few more.
The soft-start feature is very nice.  When you flip the power switch, it takes a moment to ramp-up, then the motor reaches its full speed with an impressive sound.  There is practically no  vibration from the motor.  The speed controls are very easy to read and easy to reach, and make it simple to adjust for the diameter of the router bit you're using.  The height adjustment is easy and locks down securely -- once the router is set for the correct height, it doesn't move until you want it to.  The wrenches that come with the router are solid tools used for loosening the collet.  The router only comes with a 1/2" collett; if you want to use 1/4" bits, you'll have to buy an after-market 1/4" collett.  The motor can be easily removed from the handles if necessary.  The router was perfectly tuned when I bought it, with no runout at all, and it has stayed that way ever since, even after many many hours of heavy routing.
8292	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Hi. I really love this product because I can create different drawing/precision marking for just about anything my mind can get into. I was surprised to see that it was made in USA, so I was extremely proud of that! Everything's a bonus! And, the T-bar can be taken off if need be, but can be stored for future use. I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who needs precise measurements (in 1/2 increments; also, a 0.5-mm pencil is recommended. Anything larger than that will not work!). GREAT PRODUCT! SPEEDY AND PROMPT DELIVERY! A++++++++++!!! :D

2430	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works fine - as expected, for my Dewalt 14.4 snake light. I didn't do any comparison testing, but it seems to me about the same brightness as the original bulb - at least I didn't notice a big difference on first couple uses. Not much else to say until I see its longevity.
5262	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Delivered on time and in good shape.  Item is heavy for it's size.  Rip cuts have almost no kerf marks. Light touch with 220 grit will easily take care of marks.  Plan to purchase  another for my radial arm saw.
Yes, it is made of decent quality materials and seems like a good deal for the price.  In hingsight, I with I would have spent a little more on a better table.
4060	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good sharp blades and they stay sharp even using in hardwood.
6200	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had a Makita for 13 years that wasn't too bad, but it finally died of bad bearings.  The repair cost was within $10 of replacement so I started shopping.

7191	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The actual VIX brand bits are the only ones you need.  Everything else is junk. Great price.
For guided cuts, it does not matter which side of the saw the blade is on. Since I am right-handed, I prefer left-bladed saws. Even when using a guide or track, having the blade where most users can SEE THE BLADE is a good idea. Other than that, I can't complain much about anything on this or the 364.
This results in large tolerance stack ups when coping (cross cutting) and similar ops.
5271	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Bought and installed these when setting up dust collection in my woodshop.  Huge problem with these is that they trap sawdust and particles in the slot that the gate travels in.  The only way to clean out the slot is to remove the hose connected to it and use some type of wire to scrape out the debris.  I am considering cutting off the bottom of these so that the debris will fall out of the bottom and use tape to "re-close" them when in use.
Sure, it doesn't have a PTFE coating, but wiping down a blade from time to time with a bit of solvent to clean off pitch is no big task.  And Freud's carbide tips are beefy and sharp.  I don't anticipate any problems, having had good luck in the past with their Diablo 7.25" circular saw blades.
- Stamped metal frame with sharp edges.  Like others, I wouldn't consider putting 500 pounds on this
Lastly, this machine runs so quietly, compared to the others, you hardly know it's on.
The dust bag is good for me. It will fill up after several hours of sanding. I only use it outdoors so any extra dust just blows away.
My insert was damaged; it appeared to have been dropped. One of the tabs on the end was mashed and partially broken off. I didn't see it before I opened the package and the broken tab wasn't in the sealed package. I presume it happened before it was placed in the package.

The only drawback is that the extension is either in place or removed. There is no provision for storing the extension within the base of the DW716, nor can the length of the extension be adjusted.

To sum it up, this light gets top marks on the overall design, the clamp, the base, the neck, the soft and sure light switch, the lighting in either light mode and its general very low profile.
- uses 3 (THREE) AAA batteries
The Makita 9227C comes with a hook and loop 7" backing pad, and an included centering spline. Their are nice polishing wool bonnets that work with the hook and loop pad. Their are also hook and loop lambswool polishing pads that are close napped, and make for a very tight clean edge. Great for getting into those otherwise inaccessable areas. With woodwork, you may be polishing a 3 inch apron for example, right up against the underside of the table top. That requires a hook and loop backing pad, with a tight nap hook and loop pad.

The addition of the higher speed [400rpm] lacking on Milwaukee's less expensive model actually makes this stick driver capable of being a stick drill[a goal to which many stick drivers secretly aspire], but only for those with either a great deal of patience and time yet perfect for that decorative solid brass hinge on that music box you've been promising your ______ since _______.
5280	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This does the job, but I had to purchase a Powertec flex connector to connect it (it's the same id/od as the dust hood). The combined price is about $4.00 more than a fitting that combines the two that is sold by another company.
2467	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got this to put 1/8" round overs on larger table tops. Works like a porter cable, great. It has plenty of power to run any smaller 1/4" shank bits.

Another plus is that it will lay flat on it's side (the drive belt side) meaning you could build a jig to hold it in place and use the belt in a vertical, stationary position, if that makes sense.
There are only two minor things that I wasn't happy about:
7413	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	High uniformity and finish on these as expected.  I got tired of going to the store to buy 50 packs for every project, so I'm probably set for a while with this box.  I make a lot of stuff out of cedar with these.

1. Arbor Nut Size - The arbor nut wrench size can not be larger than 1 3/16" (30 mm).  The set includes a 7/8" wrench.  If your arbor nut uses a wrench other than 7/8" (22 mm), you will need to use a wrench other than the one that comes in the Dial-A-Width.
5347	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased four of the gates to use on my collection system.  They are very easy to use and install. The only thing that I wish that they had was a stop built into them to keep them open when in use in the vertical position.  I had purchased a competitor's gate to finish the system that had this stop in them and it really helps to be able to mount the gate vertically and not horizontally to help keep it open. All in all, it is a great item and recommend it's use to anyone.
6898	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The bag is a sexy one as i have been approached by people wanting it. Very wide when opened. Highly recommended for all individuals regardless of job -- mechanics,electricians,carpenters,joiners,masons,Vets and more. The material is highly durable for all tools. I love this bag. You can't go wrong with GateMouth. Place your order right now.
I have had good results with Freud blades and have sd508 and sd206 blades. Do not know personally about this set.
This model has been the favorite of craftsmen for many years.
4928	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This tool is great for what its made for: power planer and jointer blades.  However you will note a lot of people use it to sharpen a lot of things, and this is the beauty and the curse of the machine.  Well, "curse" might not be the exact word, but you're looking at a significant time investment to be able to use this machine to sharpen your tools, at which point it will prove a practically invaluable asset towards easily restored hand tools.  If you get it set up this well you might even use a lower quality chisel to chop a nail in a pinch because it is in fact that easy to fix chips etc.  The issue is that you CANNOT use regular hone guides with this tool, alone.  Within minutes you will make a flat spot in the brass wheel, essentially destroying the guide.  And, the wheel WILL skid, no matter what, and you will end up with a conical wheel, because the inside covers less ground than the outside.  I was able to use mine for one very large chip in a plane blade, and that was it.  But it was worth the sacrifice to me.
Surprise,, this is a blade Id recommend and NOT just for the price. Put it in my suitcase and use in in Colombia to cut Brazilian Walnut (Chanu), among other woods and it has preformed MUCH BETTER than expected.  FIVE months and still going strong.  Dont know how many feet I've cut but much of the time the blade is at FULL height on my table saw.  So far, no burning and about the same quality as my Freud. The blade has no vibration with the table saw.
3517	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Crown stops do their job, work well.  It doesn't seem like you can use them for anything more than 5" or so, may be something to check out before you buy them.  But for what I used them for, works good, tightens down into place on Dewalt saw nicely.
* The only real negative is that it is not as obvious how much material you are removing when there is no sawdust collecting on the surface. So you have to pay a bit more attention to what you are doing.
5931	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	fit perfect in my dewalt . recommended

6429	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These clamps work flawlessly to hold cabinets together when building the runs.  Works much better than typical speed clamps.  Well worth the investment.
2421	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This became a very good light once I replaced the bulb with a LED version. The original bulbs are too sensitive to rough handling.

469	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This light is nice and bright It's sturdy and flexible and gives off a lot of light. Great for kids and adults.

It has a long flexible neck that seems to be very durable and holds its position.
3508	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I  bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it. I started showing it off to other technicians in my field. But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way. It's almost like this machine is synonymous with "drill".

  Makita also had the standard rubber backing pad with the hex nut for the center, so you can use the standard bolt on cutting wheels, and be able to use the tie on bonnets on top of it.
5906	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are exceptional quality blades from Bosch that will surprise you. I purchased these for my new Bosch jig saw and together they make quite a impression. Whether or not you have a Bosch saw I would recommend the blades, they are the best on the market in my opinion.
The plans call for the rails to be made of 1 1/2" wood. The stronger the species of wood (oak is strong), the sturdier the base. I used 1 1/2" x 1/8" square steel stock. The steel fit great, and I believe the weight limit will be determined solely by the wheels and swivel caster. I made this base for an old 350# cast table saw, and it moves just fine. For the price, this is the ticket!
166	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I read in bed with my kids before they sleep, so I have these clipped onto their bunk bed rail. The brightness is perfect and the batteries seem to last forever. I bought them as gifts for my whole family. Better light than a lamp because you can point it right at the book.
Cons:
9698	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Milton, as far as I have found, is the only company still manufacturing top quality products.  This quick coupler falls into the same category, i.e. Number One coupler available.  I certainly recommend it for your shop.

6182	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use these in an arboretum to prune limbs and cut roots for stump removal. Do not use blades that have been in the dirt to prune plants you are keeping. Using these blades for cutting roots will shorten their life/sharpness. Using a sawzall is safer than a chainsaw in many situations.

3771	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The Freud shim set is precise, and is anodized with a dark material to prevent corrosion.  There are four .004, two .008 two .012 and two .020 shims in the package. They seem flat and true.  The only problem I have  with this set is that they all look the same.  Can you tell the difference  between .008 and .012? I can.... with a micrometer. If you don't have one,  you will have trouble telling the shims apart. There are some other sets  that use color coding. These might be easier for some people to use. I like  the fact that there are extra shims of each thickness (particularly the  .004), since they could be damaged easily.
2592	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product was just what I was looking for and at a great price. Great people/ company to deal with.
6335	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	nice
The light beam has plenty of brightness for my purposes, and overall the quality seems good. The grip is the same plastic clamshell that all my other DeWalt tools use, so it's plenty sturdy for a light.

2377	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I agree with Robertster. There is too much play in the micro-adjust feature of this edge guide. I use it with a DW618 router. I really like the router but I am disappointed in this guide. In addition, I am having a little trouble finding what the increments on the micro-adjust represent.  I guess I can hack my way through a project with this guide but if I was a Pro, I would be annoyed. This guide feels like it was designed as an after-thought

Many hobbyists have inexpensive contractor-style saws. SOME of these saws ARE capable of precision with enough tweaking, but this thing cannot fix a two-hundred dollar "home-center" table saw. If your saw fits into a car or costs less than $300, then any improvement will be negligible.

I suppose I will press on with the table.  And I imagine it will be just as nice as it seemed in the store.

7001	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So I'm using this toggle clamp as a hold down for my custom made tablesaw miter fence. I tried the Harbor Freight knock off of this and it didn't perform as well. The metal is thinner on the HF version which allows the clamp arm to move side to side in full clamped position , which could cause inaccuracy in the cut. With this MSI product the steel is thicker and it holds steady when clamped. No side to side or lateral flex in the arm on this one.

Understand its not as large as the more expensive units but it cuts very well.  Very little vibration and easy to install the blades and set the tension of the blade.  The only issue I have is the hold down.  This could be better.  I only got the saw not the stand, I never purchase these types of stands, they do not make sense to me.  Build a nice small cabinet for your unit and but draws in it for all the parts you will need.  These is a better use of space than an open stand.  I also always put my cabinets for my tools on wheels, thus easy to move around.  The light, I would recommend getting a magnifier with a light than getting the light for the unit.

Added Comment....I found a second hole on my saw base.  It wasn't indicated in the instructions, but looked like it could help the situation.  This hole needed a special size hex head screw (I found at home Depot) it did the trick.  I now have my extension mounted solidly, and functional.  I still won't change my rating or previous comments, because DeWalt failed in its' instruction and their support help.

Update 1/4/2016
8079	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just received the Starrett 6" and immediately ordered the 12. First I tried to rejuvenate an old one that belonged to my father. After a half hour of scrubbing, de-rusting, and fine polishing, I thought I had a twelve. I checked the depth accuracy, and it was right on. Then I checked it as a square. Although the end to end was correct, the center of the ruler had been accidentally ground. So if I tried to square up a 4" high table saw blade for example, it would be off. That was all I needed. I went to the computer and ordered the 12 as well. You can't afford to screw around with the device that all other tools are measured by. A cut only off 1 degree creates a 91-degree edge. When gluing and clamping that edge, it bows or skews your project. Then when you try to mate that up to a square project, it doesn't fit. Save yourself a lot of heartache, time, and money, get a starrett combination square.

If you want heavier duty than this, you're almost certainly going to sacrifice flexibility and light weight  - and therefore useability.  You don't want to fight a stiff armored air hose with your finish nailer as you try to get up into a tight corner.
The fine adjustment dial itself - there's ZERO documentation on how much it moves the fence per turn.  Just a bit of fiddling around it LOOKS LIKE 1 full turn is about 1/16. The operative word is "ABOUT" - it's not 1/16.  I'm not even certain it's repeatable. So if you back off 2 turns, then try to get back to a previous settng by going forward 2 turns... the backlash in the screw will probably throw you off a good bit (I haven't tested this yet).

8687	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased my Estwing 20 oz. Vinyl Grip Rip Claw Hammer from a certain Blue store recently. Although it costs more than other hammers, the Estwing is superior due to its simple one-piece design. During a long day of installing wood siding with this hammer recently, I appreciated its flawless weight distribution and rigidity. The grip is of excellent design and proves comfortable day after day on the job-site. After a redesign from previous generations (which I have occationally used), the new grip material is softer, thereby reducing vibration noticably over previous models.
9660	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this device to change my bits quickly and easily when I am working.  I really like the one handed operation of it.  My old impact had the quick change adapter as part of it but it was really awkward when trying to change bits with one hand.  Had to hold the drill with one hand while pulling the collar with the other and pull the collar again to put the new bit in.  Not this one.  I can easily push the collar in and the bit pops right out and push the new bit in without having to move the collar.  There was some confusion about what the item looked like because there were different pictures.  I guess one was an older version.  The one I received had the black metal top

5711	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Likes: Good quality. Easy to assemble. Perfectly packaged. Easy to move. Nice storage area under router. Dust collection works well (I have it connected to a Fein Turbo II Dust Extractor). Came with two rods that can be installed behind split fence to join the edges of boards. I use my Dewalt DW618 and it fits just fine. Have not yet put a router lift in. Not sure if I will. It really isn't that big of a deal to change bits or adjust the depth of the router. Fence is straight and can be set up for near zero clearance. Quality materials. The miter gauge slot is an added bonus.
Saws of this caliber should cost much more.  I can also assure everyone that the handle problem is no longer a problem.  I have one warning though.  This saw is an extremely sharp professional tool and not for any type of play or monkey business.  Make sure that this saw is put away around children.
8684	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I first started doing remodeling work, I just picked up a cheap fiberglass hammer at home depot.  Later, after getting more into it I upgraded to an Estwing 20 oz hammer and let me tell you what a world of a difference it was.  This hammer is balanced beautifully, the grip is comfortable and absorbs a good amount of shock, and the appearance of the hammer is very nice as well.  My dad owns an Estwing hammer he had for many years and it still functions like new.  Now, after driving many thousands of nails, my hammer is also still going strong.  Many manufactures such as Kobalt, Bostich, Craftsman and various others have tried to copy the Estwing design and let me tell you, Estwing is still my favorite by far.  If you are looking for an all-steel framing hammer, there is no other hammer on the market that I have seen or used that I like better - at any price.  As long as you don't abuse it, it should last a lifetime.  I liked it so much that I began purchasing several other models, and have recommended them friends and family.  As long as their quality does not change for the worse in the future, Eswing can expect more purchases from me.  Highly recommended.

If you are looking for accessories, I will say the stand is okay and the optional scroll saw light leaves a lot to be desired - read my separate reviews on each.

4726	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The LU91R012 is a very good all around trim blade for all soft and hard wood trim. It works especially well with sliding miter saws.

4447	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Like Hangtree, I have a rigid bandsaw and couldn't find a fence anywhere.  This fence fits with only one modification.  The rigid table is about one inch too narrow.  I drilled one hole on the fence itself, now it fits great.  The resaw guide is a bit too far back as well, but I don't do much resaw anyways.  This fence is very sturdy and will make rigid and jet saw owners real happy.

I exchanged the first broken and corroded set, and it was replaced with another - same thing. Both cases were broken (no shipping damage, just broken cases), both sets of shims corroded. I called Freud to see if they would be improving the product as there are similar complaints from other customers about this product, they said no, "sometimes that's just how it is". So it sounds like they'll continue to be sold with the same poor quality storage case. See attached photos, compare to the Dewalt Dado set case (also available on Amazon for less) which is rugged and the blades lock in.

7653	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Lenox Tools has the best product for hole saws.  This will last a lifetime.  I do not know why they call this an electricians kit because it has sizes up to 4 inches which is good for the majority of plumbing needs.  High quality! Great price.  Well worth it! You may have to eventually replace a saw blade if you use it on metal or tile, but for wood they do not get dull. Lenox has engineered this for useability.  Easy change out and plug removal.  This is what the professionals use at almost twice the cost.

I don't believe you're going to find a better blade out there in this price range. Well worth the money!!
3685	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This was the second ever Jet tool I bought about two years ago. It had been serving my home shop very well. I have not had any problem with it whats-so-ever. It always starts when I need it. I had couple of times the dust was up to the neck and this thing was still going. It is pretty powerful for its size and that class of dust colloectors as I understand. I made my own 5 micron bag and plan on making a bigger lower bag or add a "window" to it. My shop is 10'X12' and this thing does not take much of room. So it's recommended if you have a small shop and don't run more than one tool at a time.
I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project.

3887	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I loved it. Great product.
Additional info: This light replaces an excellent, but quite bulky light I've used on my laptop keyboard, SE FL89020L 20 LED Silver Lamp Light, for $9.17 on Prime. I'll find other uses for the FL89020L, including duty holding down a tent flap in a gale.

4540	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent tool. I have already used it to build a semi enclosed (Custom) cabinet with glued up top for my sons TKD studio. Everyone is happy with the final product and I am happy with the plate joiner. I can see myself using this tool on a regular basis.
Bottom line, I cannot imagine a higher quality work tool and I know you will be happy with this choice. I would go further and say that my experience with Bosch would lead me to look at Bosch first for any corded power tool. (For cordless, see my reviews on Porter-Cable, which I also highly recommend.)
8729	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This works great.  Glad I finally bought one


2443	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this stand as part of a Dewalt package (saw, stand and light) deal from Grizzly.  It's a little tricky getting it together since the saw base has to line up with the holes in the stand.  You need to leave bolts loose until you get everything lined up and then you can tighten them down.  The three leg design guarantees it will not rock even if your floor is uneven.  To make it more useful I made a shelf for the bottom support to store blades and supplies.
Great for headers and post. It performs great and has alot of power, use the recomended

- The handle being perpendicular to the blade and shifted towards center makes it not only more ergonomic, but also you can cut with either hand.
5990	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The nice thing about the Bessey Tradesmen's is that they are heavier duty than the competition, in the medium duty class, and you don't have to take out a second mortgage to afford a set of them. The locking mechanism works without any hassles, and the grip is strong. All in all a nice piece of equipment. A major competitor sells this model for less money, but it is also a lighter weight clamp. I like them all. Bessey makes great stuff, you can't go wrong with these. They are a great general-purpose clamp. Highly recommended.
One thing I don't like about this tool is the "clattering" sound it makes while running.  I have run this machine quite a bit and never had a problem, but it has sounded like a loose bearing from the time it was new.  The fence could use some improvement, but that is easy to work around.

9034	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this kit several months ago, based on the excellent customer reviews.  The reason for the purchase was (and is) I had several expensive speciality interior doors to install and I wanted to get things right the first time.  This is versus my normal practice of having to do many things twice.  I installed the kit per the instructions, started boring and within 3 minutes (or less) the bore bit sheared at the connection to the chank.  I did not torque it and the pressure was moderate to light.  Based on the others feedback, I suspect mine had a manufacturing flaw (not to sweet on a 300$ item).  Now I get to waste my time trying to return it or get a replacement bit.  Needless to say, I am disappointed hence my 1 star ....
The first thing I had to do was reassemble the outer plates to change the setup from a right-tilt, to a left-tilt configuration.  Before making dado cuts the user must consult the manual and determine the appropriate type and number of chippers to install between the outer plates.  A little color coding or some stenciled part numbers on the components would simplify the process, but if a person can read, they should be able to figure this out.
9758	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works well
5081	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This stays on my Powermatic 66 for about 95% of the time.  It does everything well.  It is not the perfect rip blade or perfect cross cut blade and certainly not the perfect plywood blade BUT I strongly believe it to be - BY FAR - the best all around blade I have ever used.  It does all of those tasks better than some other brands' job specific blades.  This baby is a workhorse and my advice is to buy iy - don't even think twice about the price.
If you're looking for a medium weight hammer that can handle most residential jobs and that will last as long as you do, this is not a bad choice.
Now I feel better, the product is what I wanted and expected but remains a step down from the 20 year old model I have, but still hands down better than all the competition.
1567	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I waited for a while before I wrote the review - had the lights installed in the kitchen fixtures now for a couple of months.  With teenagers in the house, our lights are on a lot - AND on/off a lot!  These have outlasted the ones that came from the fixture manufacturer.  Great price, great quality - yes, I'd buy them again if and or when I need more!
It makes a horrendous racket when you cut the kerf. It will sound like you're trying to saw through a bunch of tin cans. Don't assume your saw is coming apart.

- where the on/off switch is located (on the light head itself) and because it is turned on by pushing it in, it is VERY EASY to turn it on accidentally.  As I was packing it into my luggage, I accidentaly turned it on and again when removing it from my luggage.  I had visions of it being bumped during the flight and finding out the light had been on for many hours without my knowledge.  I suppose I could take the batteries out every time I pack it, but don't really like that additional step.  Even when just moving it from one spot to another in my own house, I had to learn how to hold it to not cause it to come on (one time it did and was directly in my eyes -- I saw spots for a while!).

4941	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this dewalt bisquit joiner to replace the old Porter Cable model (which was (is) the worse tool I've ever purchased).  This DeWalt is the exact opposite.  Simple to operate and produces quick and effective slots for the bisquits.  The only detractor I could mention is the dust collection system is prone to clogging due to a small chute between the blade chamber and the collection bag.  Additionally, I've had some trouble getting precise orientation of the slots when using the angle fence.  Otherwise this is one of my favorite tools.  Ranks even higher than my routers.  I'd buy it again in a second.
895	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price.  Had a hard time finding replacement bulbs for an under counter light that I have.  These fit perfect,  light output matches the other bulbs in the fixture.  Have held up so far.
As an aside, This kind of thing is getting more common in the last year, not getting what I ordered. Some orders are hundreds of dollars and have always been fine, but in the last couple of months I have received wrong parts that the dealer clearly knew was not what was advertised.

We live in Colorado at 7500 feet and of course the gun is Dead ON Arrival - no fault to the gun.

After purchasing a set, I now understand. The mini bar clamp is an important tool for just about any task. It's quick-grip feature is great, but I find its quick-release just as vital in moving projects along. The Irwin brand is a solid performer, and I intend to buy more of them.

It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.

8295	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I did a project a while back in which I was cutting some compound angles.  I made do with the clear plastic protractor I had in the shop and it turned out fine but I was thinking there has to be something better than this.  I have one good potractor type device but it's not made for what I was doing so I started looking for something better.  I'm somewhat embarrased to say I was completely unfamiliar with Infra though I've been a "shop guy" for most of my 65 years.  Anyway this tool popped up on Amazon.  I liked what I say and read and ordered it (along with an Incra rule set).  While I have not done a project in which I've had to use this protractor since I got it, I did go back and duplicate what I did on the previous project on paper and scrap wood and it is a fine tool.  I was marking angles along the side of a board and the bar for want of a better word along the bottom puts the protractor right where it needs to be to measure the angles and it's really easy to line up the index marks on the protractor with the point I marked on the board.  All the angles and fractions are clearly marked and the slots cut in the protractor make it easy to mark just where I want to with the included 0.5 mm mechanical pencil.  Like the other Incra tools, it's made from thin stainless steel to make for more accurate marking with no parallex error.  As a result you don't want to just throw this in you tool box with the hammers and pipe wrenches.  It's a precision tool.  I actually made a little wooden box with the protractor and other Incra tools fitted in it.  The tool is US made and that's important to me.

Not near as robust as the guide that come with Bosch routers, but it won't fit the Dewalt 621 plunge router which is perhaps the best plunge router on the street.

I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve. It hardly even needed sanding. I run my saw about mid speed with these. Once they start biting, it's silky smooth. Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk. Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that. I'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades. The handsaw stays in the closet much more. With the blades I used to "try" to use, the cutting line was always covered in sawdust. Impossible to work that way. These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line, the way its supposed to be.

3158	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I "thought" this was made in the USA as it says on the label, but the booklet says it was printed in mexico.  The blade is cheap and says made in china.  From the look of it the casting has rough edges ground down on a grinder and poorly applied labels. If this was made in the USA then the poor quality control of China is rubbing off on US manufacturing.  Or else it was made by former UAW people from Detroit and Dearborn.  The blades advertised next to the item do not fit. Its not a 10mm arbor.  It is a 1/2 inch arbor.  And you have to attach the blade with the writing facing the inside as this is for a left hander.  Or else the saw blade will turn the wrong way. The $29 Chinese saw from sears seems better constructed.  In about six months harbor Freight will be selling these under their name for $39.

I was never able to use a belt sander before without earplugs. This one runs at only 84 Db. It's the quietest on the market. It's also the smoothest I've used. I've used all of the 4x24 sanders and the Makita just seems to do more work faster. Maybe it's the fact that it has the highest speed of any , maybe it's the high tech , powerful motor ,the efficient drive train. Whatever it is , it kicks butt . The dust collection system is also top notch. For small jobs and fine work , I prefer my Bosch 1274 dvs. It's much lighter ,compact and easy to control. For extended use or heavy sanding though , you cannot beat this tool.

I don't know if it is just the orbital model, or all the new Milwaukee sawzalls, but these things drop like flies on our site.  We do remodelling projects with a small crew, and the Sawzalls and Skilsaws get the most use.  At least the Skilsaws are still as good as they used to be (though I switched to the Bosch version).  I'm thinking I need a Porter Cable or Bosch reciprocating saw to replace my burned out Milwaukee.

This adjustable work stand is not only good for the professional (hey, I have seen them use them in ways I will never understand), but it is wonderful for the hobbyist.  It is easy to store, not taking up much room and once you actually read the directions (something I am pretty bad about not doing), the working of the thing is a snap.

There is a plastic belt with notches that connects two toothed wheels on the back of the vise cranks, so, supposedly, you can turn only one crank and the other will turn by itself.

Bottom line, if you want a quality, durable chiseling bit for tile removal and similar tasks, this is the about the best out there.  Again, if you are using a lighter duty chipping hammer like the DEWALT D25213K, this is the widest you will want to go.  A 2" wide bit needs to be paired with a medium or heavy duty chipping hammer.

2) With a mill file I worked the mouth so that the blade would sit down properly and protrude below the sole. This meant removing a bump and some material where the blade rests just back of the opening. The blade, because it is thin, still flexes a bit when clamped and rises up, so there is still a little work I need to do. About 30 minutes of effort...so far. I think this is the most important modification I've had to do.

- A little too lightweight for my likings
The dust collection works  okay; I have a small hose adapted to my shop dust collector, but it does  take some getting used to, dragging a hose around with your tool.  The  construction of the fixture is very heavy-duty; it should last a long time  with continuous use.

Less than .0005" runout at the arbor, blade within .0005" of the miter slot. My old, dull, Freud blades are cutting way better than these new blades.

If you want steel guides, the Milwaukee's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case, and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C's.  Unfortunately, the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigs
Well, I've had this saw now for 8 years. It is still as good as new with typical woodworking and homeowner use. Even though it is "only" a 13 A saw, it is very hard to find something that slows it down at all. I have just sold this to my brother, for two reasons:

I've had this saw for about 25 years and have used a variety of different blades including the "hollow-ground" versions which were my "best" blades.  They haven't been cutting well for some time and recently started burning so I knew it was time for replacement.  I had no idea where to turn so I spent some reading reviews on Amazon.  After stumbling on these Freud blades, I decided to give them a try based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews from other users and the fact they didn't cost a fortune.  I ordered three different thin-kerf designs including the combo, glue-line rip and negative rake miter.  So far I've only used the rip and the combo blade but am completely impressed.  They are much quieter than my old blades and leave a beautiful, clean cut.  They also glide through the material easily without leaving any discoloration.  I wish I found these years ago!!  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.

Since I use this router for woodworking and it spins faster than conventional larger routers, I wanted to make sure that the bits that I use could safely withstand the higher rpms.  I contacted Freud and they strictly advised me not to use their woodworking bits in it.  A Milwaukee company representative also told me not to use their bits.  People at the local Bosch service branch said that their bits would be safe to use.  When I contacted the Whiteside Machine company, a plant manager took the time to correspond with me and make some bit selection suggestions.  The Whiteside bits are not only safe at higher rpms, but Fine Woodworking magazine rated them as the best in a recent test and Norm Abram (New Yankee Workshop) recommends them too.  So I've been using Whiteside bits and have been impressed with their sturdy construction (very substantially built) and quality of cut.

I spent a lot of time researching scroll saw's before purchasing the Dewalt. It will not be used everyday, but hopefully will be used a lot for a long time. So I wanted a machine that would last a long time and I believe the Dewalt will do the job for me.
I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality here.  I was a DeWalt fan until this, reading the reviews of difficulty, getting one that is not adjustable, and testing it at the local "home" stores and finding the same thing.

3469	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had bought the Porter Cable 4" Whisper Series about a year ago. I previously used a 3x21" Sears. Did the job, but this PC is in a whole different category. Some of the more important features: Positive tracking-when you set the belt adjusting knob, the belt stays adjusted. Some belt sanders creep on you, and require frequent resetting. Annoying to say the least. Also the belt change feature is nice. A simple lever you pull out, then push back in. Quiet-you do not have to wear ear protection to use this. Hearing protection is always a good idea though. It is heavy, but to me this is an advantage. You don't have to push down on the unit, in order to get the job done. To those who mention that you have to keep an eye on the machine, because it can take away too much material too fast, that is because they are using a coarser grit than is required for the task. Finer grades give you more flexibility, and removal is more gradual and even. A belt sander is not designed to replace a finish sander.

Both the outside of this adapter and the outside of the tablesaw port are 4".  In other words it is a male to male connection.  I could not find a female version.
For someone like me who doesn't hammer for long stretches of time the all steel estwings are the way to go.  You will never have to buy another one or fool with replacing handles.  That being said I know pros at habitat for humanity who hammer all day long on framing jobs and they all use wooden handled hammers because it deadens the shock to the elbow.  Most of them use Vaughan California Framers / Blue Max which really are nice hammers, but all wood handled tools I've had seem to need a replacement handle after a while.  After replacement its just never as good as it was new.  I'll stick with the eternal swamp hammer and its kin.

One last item is about aligning the mortising chisel and fence.

After two years, I now use biscuits for everything and am putting the Freud to heavy use. It is an increasingly annoying resident of my shop; as of today I am in the market for a better-designed joiner.
We clipped it onto the headrest post so that the light would be right between the two rear seats (in a 2001 Saab convertible with black interior).  The kids really enjoyed reading their respective books, and never complained about needing more light.  We ordered another, so that they can each have one to themselves.  The two-level brightness is a nice feature (probably works well with a non-backlit e-reader), and the goose-neck is soft enough to bend with fingers, but firm enough to stay where you want it.  Well built, and uses common batteries.

3293	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't decide between a table saw and a miter saw.  I think I made the right decision by going with the Bosch B3915.  It is a very high quality tool.  At first I was concerned when the saw arrived because the packaging was very minimal for such a heavy item.  Parts of the saw were poking through the box.  Bosch really needs to rethink how they package their tools for shipping.  Fortunately, there was no damage.  After unpacking the saw I tested the settings.  Two of the settings were off, but only by a millimeter or two.  It only took me about 30 minutes to correctly adjust the saw.  It is just a matter of loosening and adjusting some bolts.  However, it can take several tries to get it just right.  The documentation was excellent and made the start up very easy.  Once, you are familiar with the saw I imagine it would only take a few minutes to make adjustments.  Bosch claims the saw comes adjusted, but it was clearly off when it left the factory.

Cons
2788	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had this saw for many years.  Started with a Craftsman single speed in '91. Advanced to variable speed Craftsman, bought a third Craftsman.  Then got serious about scrolling.  (Wish I hadn't bought so many Craftsman) Really wanted the RBI Hawk but just couldn't justify the expense.  When I saw this saw at Rockler, I tried it and was quite impressed.  Purchased it and have not been sorry.  Scrolling got better, sales went up so I could afford the RBI Hawk.  But I was so used to the DeWalt I found myself going back to it. The learning curve on the Hawk was a little more than I had time for.  The Hawk now sits idly by while I scroll happily on the DeWalt.  I have not had any of the problems indicated by the negative comments of this saw. I have to laugh at myself, as the very expensive Hawk just sits and watches the DeWalt happily hum along and work its arm off.  I don't think I even attached the hold down foot as I find it visually difficult to scroll with it on.  None of my saws have the hold down foot on them . I think anyone can get a bum saw, and it looks like DeWalt had some issues with farming their product out to a "cheaper" manufacturing plant.  Guess they got what they paid for, but I have been happy with this saw and must have gotten it before they chose to manufacture it elsewhere. I use a 6" piece of 2X4 to hold the arm up and now I see there is a device out there to attach to the arm to hold it up, but the 2X4 works great for me.

The hose is 1 1/4 inch OD, with the intake fitting at 1 inch ID, so that it fits snuggly on all Porter Cable random-orbit sanders.  The hose outlet is 1 1/2 inch ID.  Both the hose inlet and outlet thread (in reverse) onto the hose, so it is easy to remove them to clean out the hose, to shorten the hose, or to make other adjustments.  The hose length is about 128 inches, without stretching, including inlet and outlet.  The small diameter of the hose makes it much more convenient to use with a hand-held sander than the larger size hoses of any of the various brands of shop vacuums, and, since it is only carrying dust, it works better as the air is moving faster.

My main priorities for a replacement set were; 1) good carbide, 2) good clean cut and flat bottom, and 3) price that won't break the bank. Obviously that last point eliminated the 10" sets, and even if you could find a decent price on a 10" set, chances are you're going to sacrifice on the carbide and/or cut. As far as my intended use, since retiring I now just make cabinets, bookcases, and woodwork for family, friends and fun. So my budget was under $150.
6916	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I haven't compared this to a lot of bags but I find it heavy and uncomfortable to want to carry those few things on a daily level ( I end up using a side bag instead) and it's a bit small to have a as a go-to bag for projects outside of the shop. The pockets are also too small to be helpful. I have stabbed under my fingernails a few times looking for bits, screws, pens and the like.
Another drawback of the product: the pins are not sharp at all comparing to the Surveymaster's. In test, the pins couldn't penetrate into some plywood area under the roof, and hence couldn't get any readings.

The router's downfalls are that it doesn't lend itself to  be conveneint to use on a router table. The plunge lock lever needs to be  pushed and held all the time while you are adjusting the depth.

1) First of all, the profiles never REALLY fit what you're sanding, so there's always a point early-on during the sanding where the aggressive action of the sander wears right through the sandpaper and you start leaving black rubber streaks on your material (the profile is now rubbing the wood directly).

3.) The new 330 is rated at 14,000 RPM, where as the old one is 15,000. This probably makes the brushes and bearings last longer, although the brushes don't seem to be the same quality as on the older unit. Either way, the extra 1,000 RPM helped a lot when trying to avoid swirl marks with a course grit. The 340 is also 14,000 RPM, but 1/2 the price.

4480	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	My complaint is not with the blade. It is a good blade for the money, but the Teflon ( DuPont or not ) hinders my rating. I was all set to buy this blade and called down to my local sharpening shop, who also sells Frued products. The guys there ( who have a  good reputation locally ) said not to bother with a Teflon coated blade. He recommended the Frued LU91M010 ( the same blade w/o the red Teflon coating ). He said that frquently he notices that alot of carpenters have sanded the  Teflon off around the arbor to keep it from slipping, and that uneven wear in the red Teflon is evidence of friction ( either because the blade is not true or the coating is not absolutely uniform) . Could be the saw he said, but not on as many as he has sharpened. The obvious side effect of of the uneven wear in the coating, is that likely that red coating is stuck to your trim & moldings. I was disappointed because I have come to appreciate Teflon coated router bits, but the pros usually know. I still bought Frued, it just isn't red.

9417	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have built a number of decks over the years for homes I have owned.  All of them have had real wood top deck boards.  Regardless of treated pine, cedar, the deck boards all had some amount of twisting, bowing, uneven edges, etc.  This year I needed to "re-deck" our old deck - 30' x 20' - that I built 20 years ago.  The CCA treated joists and posts were still in good condition, so I only needed to remove the old decking boards and install new ones.  We of course looked at many composite boards, but the only ones we liked the looks of were five times as expensive as real wood.  So, we chose the standard 5/4" x 6" real wood treated pine from Men-A-Rds.  I recalled from past projects the struggles I had in getting real wood to line up, and decided I might try this tool.  I looked for a few weeks on ebay but a used one never was listed.  So I purchased this new one from Amazon.  What a great use of my money!!!!  Because I was using real wood, most of which was still wet / heavy with preservative, I wanted to install my boards tight up against each other with no gap as they will shrink a little over time and give me a nice 1/8" - 1/4" gap once they dry out and shrink.  Once you get the hang of how to use it, regarding exactly where to place on joist to get tightest fit in locked position, you will love it too.  In my case, because this was a re-decking, and my deck is up 10+ high off of ground, I kept the existing old deck boards in place so I could stand on them, and only removed one or two old boards at a time, and replaced with new boards one or two at a time.  In some cases, where there was not quite enough space between and old board and new one to drop tool down onto joist, I used the old board as a support and then used tool to pry between old and new boards.  In most cases I was able to use one hand to "lock" the tool into place, in other cases once I put pressure on it I sometimes had to hold with one hand or a leg before I got my first screw in.  Regardless - it worked like a charm.  This is much better than other tools where you have to hold in place with pressure 100% of time, or pound some wedge device onto joist.  If you are thinking you might need or want this - don't hesitate - buy it.  I also purchased the inexpensive orange "jig-a-deck" plastic guide and that tool enabled me to easily and quickly get my screws lined up, so that they all look nice and straight and even.

Went with one of these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6JE7DA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00) and had to pop the outermost rivet to get it to fit over the 5" output as they are the same size and then sealed it up with Foil Duct tape.

To those saying "if it looks the same and it fits, I can't tell the difference, so what"?  Would you say the same thing about an obviously fraudulent water filter that you use to treat your drinking water?  Nope, so why do the same for a filter that is supposed to remove the ultra fine dust from the air in your shop and protect your lungs?

3509	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Typical of Dewalt accessories, this item is grossly over-priced. It is made of thin metal and I never got a sense of precision when I installed this on my Dewalt 12" compound miter saw.

8952	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought my Rousseau 2700 saw stand nearly twenty years ago.  I am a professional cabinet installer and use this product with my 8 1/4" Makita bench saw.  It has been used five days a week, 50 weeks a year for nearly 20 years.  It looks awful, there is virtually no paint left on it, the table board and the out feed table are full of knicks, dings, and oops cuts. In addition to use as a saw, it gets used as a workbench, utility horse, mitre saw stand, and lunch table. Through out all the years of job site use, and sometimes abuse, it is still very acurate and holds it's square as well as the day it was new!  In my thirty six years in the cabinet trade I've had many tools come and go.  None of them can even hold a candle to the quality and durability of this saw stand.  This product deserves fifty stars!  Thanks Rouseau, you are the best.

Since I hadn't lived Stateside for a while, I wasn't sure if I could get them anywhere.  Amazon had the best price so I ordered.

2288	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Delta 50-302 Outfeed Table is just the right size if your space is limited and you need portability. I also like the fact that when putting my saw in it's stored position, this unit folds down. There is nothing to remove. The adjustable leg comes in handy on my uneven floor.  In seconds, I can have this table opened and adjusted to flatness.

3939	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I almost sent this thing back, since it didn't fit correctly on my Craftsman 15" drill press.  Once I did some necessary modifications, however, (a couple of washers as spacers, mounting it a little lower on the quill collar, etc.) I was able to get it to work and decided to keep it anyway.  Most of all, I like the versatility this kit adds to my old drill press. I figured I needed a dedicated mortiser clogging up my little shop as much as I need a (square) hole in my head!
Note also that the bulb glass is not frosted-- not that it matters if they don't light. $10 wasted.
583	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this light because many reviewers were remarking about the brightness of the light.  Even the name says "Mighty Bright".  The light is not that bright.  The small size also demands that you mount it higher above the reading material as the "footprint" of the light is too small otherwise. I suppose it would work in a pinch if your were out in a tent somewhere and wanted to read a little but for long term home use it is pretty much unacceptable IMO.
Came with a professional looking case.
The book light is well-made and has a rugged casing.
I can say without any reservations that this saw should be in every woodworkers tool box.  If you don't have one buy it now because it is the best deal on this site.

This item is no substitute for a benchtop mortiser, but a good plunge router or a drill/chisel is!  A benchtop mortiser is supposed to save you time and give you better quality.  I'd argue that the time spent setting this thing up (and taking it back down), could be better spent either building a jig for router cut mortises or cutting them "manually" using a drill and chisel.  The quality of the cuts it makes is so-so, meaning you have to tune them by hand anyway.  So, on both the convenience and quality front it falls short.
382	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The unit feels very sturdy, and the picture is exactly the product you receive. The plastic clip seems likely to hold up nicely and stand up to the load of being clipped and un-clipped a LOT.  The neck is finely jointed black metal, and it bends easily, but the weight of the light head can't bend it.  The neck feels like it will stand up just fine to lots of bending.  The light is fairly white to my eye.  If there is a bluish tinge, it is very slight.  And it's plenty bright enough for reading a book it is clipped to.
1274	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The pins seem to not make proper contact in my under counter puck lamps, but that was easily solved by putting a kink in the pins with a pair of needle nose pliers.

9124	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	OK
Adjustment is uncomplicated, although you have to do without the Delta's dial adjusters.  But basically all you do is loosen the socket screws for the bearings and set them up correctly relative to the blade.  You may have to adjust the upper wheel angle a bit as well, but in essence it is exactly what you did before (although you will now need two allen wrenches to change a blade).  Once finished I ran some wood through and was suitably impressed.  Properly set, the blade moves not at all, and the quality of the cut is excellent.  Time after time.

4604	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'd give them 6 stars except that the part that wear out is the wheel and if I could just buy the wheels that would be perfect!  They work great in a one person shop.  great for cutting plywood or other large items that really want a couple of hands.  I don't use them all the time, but when you want a really nice cut on something, and NOT telegraph the times you re-position your hands while pushing the work thru, these do help out.


3400	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708, the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars.  Sturdy construction, particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece, but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides, removing for steep beveling, etc).

8696	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are dozens of ways to cut materials with varying degrees of success. If you already use the standard ones, especially a sawzall with a full set of blades you might feel you have your bases covered.  But this Diamond cutting rim attached to a small angle grinder like the DEWALT D28402K makes life so much easier.  I purchased one for a bathroom renovation and steam room project and needed something that would cut everything from cement board to concrete to wire mesh. This blade exceeded all my expectations.  The cuts are straight and true and it eats through everything like a hot knife through butter. I found myself reaching for it to make quick cuts in sometimes cramped places and in seconds the job was done.  It did some cuts that would have been impossible using anything else.  If you're a DIYer you might not have considered owning a small angle grinder or a diamond saw blade in the past.  But once you've used one like this Dewalt, you'll be very happy you added it to your tool arsenal.

3258	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight (model PCL-180FL). After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working.  Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder.  Fortunately, the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight. None the less, before buying this bulb, make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight.  The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights (e.g. PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb(Porter Cable part number #90534275).

2859	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've owned this circular saw for over a year now.  It is heavy.  I think most of the people who complained about the saw kicking tried to hold it with one hand.  It has not kicked on me once when held correctly.  Unless you bench 250, you want to use both handles all the time.  Did I mention that the saw is heavy?  Also, it is unlikely that the blade is bent.  The blade never touches the ground because of the blade guard.  When you are sawing, you can look down and see if the blade wobbles.  The electric brake is not a safety feature.  When you release the trigger, the blade still spins for 2-3 seconds.  According to the instructions, the electronic brake is meant for certain precise cuts where you want to stop the blade from spinning without removing the saw from the cut.  In retrospect, I think maybe a lighter circular saw without the electronic brake feature would have been a better buy.
882	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a G8 base, short halogen bulb. Measure your old bulb if you're not sure this is what you need. The color is a little warmer (yellower) than the bulb I replaced and just slightly dimmer. The difference is so slight that it doesn't bother me in the least. I have two lighted display cases side by side and it's hardly noticeable. If you are a perfectionist or obsessive about these things and have a number of these bulbs in use, say for under counter lighting, replace them all. These bulbs are very reasonably priced and have a good life expectancy.

I usually run most of my tools at a minimum pressure of 80 PSI, but there are a few of the that need 100 PSI. This hose handles those pressures well, so it should easily handle lower pressure jobs.

Porter-cable has a no-frills less expensive model.  After using this one though I don't think I'd ever consider using the cheaper model.  This one is so easy to adjust into position I couldn't imagine the cheaper one would be better.
I routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12 radius roundovers on long beams and such, and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress. I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits.  The button is not very well placed, however, and I seem to hit it occasionally during use.  No damage has resulted, but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool.  Also, the power switch is not placed well, as it is a two-handed operation to shut the machine off.

  Again, I can't speak for all woodworkers, pro or amateur, but the thought of a board or a piece thereof traveling well in excess of a hundred miles an hour through my shop is not comforting, ESPECIALLY when I'm in the direct line of fire!  The BBs with restricted rotation REDUCES the likelihood [there are few guaranties in life] of becoming a human dartboard or "that one-eyed, armed, legged, woodworker in Bay 16".

9158	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had my Paslode for about a year and a half now. I have to say,"I'm pleased." It's great for small jobs. If I know I'just  building a few walls or something else that's only going to take a few  minutes I go straight for the orange case and get this baby out. Why ? It  has plenty of power to sink nails in new lumber. You might have a little  trouble every now and then in old dry studs but you can always finish  beating the nail in with a hammer. It doesn't happen very often. The time  saved in not lugging a compressor and hoses around is priceless. They  designed it so that it won't dry fire when you are out of nails which I  wish everyone did.  One thing I don't like is you can't bump fire the  thing. You have to have the nose safety engaged and then pull the trigger.  Then for safety you have to let off the trigger and place the nose again  and pull the trigger. At least it's impossible to double fire. Another  thing is that it doesn't hold much more than one clip of nails so you have  to reload often. For these reasons I don't use it for anything that's going  to take more than an hour. If I have a lot of nailing  to do I want to be  able to hold the trigger and bump fire the nails. It's so much faster. It's  not as safe but much more productive. For remodels and pick up work ,this  gun is great. For framing a house this is not the right tool. You need a  pneumatic nailer and lots of hose. When mine decides to quit or it walks  off a job site I will definitely replace it. It's just too handy to be with  out.
UPDATE 08/07/14: Based on feedback from another user, I purchased an LED-based replacement head for this light... and it made a huge difference in output.

Even wedged a blade tight in my rookie ignorance of cutting underneath the larger branches, but pried it loose after much finagaling and the blade did not bend or break. I learned a lesson in cutting without damaging saw or blade, which is a big plus. And that olive wood is tough and heavy but the blade did not hesitate even on the trunk sized branches. I've trimmed smaller trees and took out damaging roots in the past with different blades but none have held up like this Ax blade. This was a big job, the largest tree I've worked on.

Having said that, I do all of my own home repair/renovation work and at one point or another I have built everything from furniture to room additions to a 24' by 40' pole barn.  I have owned this hammer for a long time - at least 6-8 years, and although the metal has tarnished to a dark grey it is still in as good of shape as the day I bought it.  The face has remained very flat and true and the handle grip is holding up just fine.  I love the balance of this hammer and the weight is just right for jobs like framing where power is more important than finesse.
7756	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This product has a lot going for it:  1) ease of changing out hole bits; 2) cuts right through all but thick steel; 3) it comes with a variety of sizes of hole saws; 4) the case is rugged and convenient.
Take a look at Porter Cable's return policy... there's practically no risk in buying this tool!  You're going to have the standard against which other routers are measured!
The quality of the  uniguard is first rate.  The large tube you see in the picture is heavy  gauge steel.  The only improvement I might suggest is making the blade  guard (the pieces directly over the blade) were a little wider.  I like the  guard to be centered over the blade, but in this position, you can't fully  tilt the blade without hitting the inside of the guard.  All that means is  that you have to shift the guard to the right an inch or two when you tilt  the blade.  Not a big deal.  The tray on the big black bar is handy, but  could stand to be an inch or two deeper and wider.
Still, if it protects your blade at all, it's worth having... if nothing else, for the extra peace of mind.
I clip it to my headboard, about 1 inch thick, it holds on there well.  Two light levels from the switch (press once low, again high, again off).  Flexi boom arm stays put once I put it where I want it.
I'm very happy with this purchase!

I ran hundreds of feet of hose and bought all kinds of blast gates and attachments for everything I could think of. It works but only for one tool at a time. I guess I'm trying to do too much with it. It will run all day without a complaint. I bought a remote start for it though . I think it's a good thing to have. If you have a small shop you can't beat this unit. It has a little more power than some of the others in this price range.
Color: Mine is a medium solid blue gray color. I was a bit uneasy about what color it might be, as it's made of recycled material and who knows what might come out of the melting pot. Someone else said they didn't care, as it wasn't a fashion accessory. True, but at the same time it's something you're going to see every time you use your saw, and I wouldn't have put up with something that blatantly made me cringe. And yes, I'm particular about how my tools look. Anyway, this color is fine and doesn't call attention to itself.

3308	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The Delta Universal Mobile Base works as well as I expected, and in the long run it should be a very worthwhile investment.  At 22' x 24', my basement shop is spacious compared to the spaces I used to have to work in, but it is still not large enough to have dedicated space for all machines.  Only my table saw, drill press, and bandsaw get that.  This base was purchased for my 6" Delta jointer, which is pretty heavy to slide across the floor otherwise.  The base allows me to position the jointer exactly where I have the open space and where I can reach it with my dust collector.  Really, the the only complaint I have is that of the 18 carriage bolts it came with, 10 of them were 1/16" too short, which wouldn't allow the nuts to even start threading on.  So I went to the hardware store to buy REAL 2" long carriage bolts, only to find out that they were 1/16" short too.  Fortunately, I found this out while in the store, so I bought the next size longer, which was 2-1/2".  Now they stick out too far and need to be trimmed.  If the base would have just come with 2-1/4" long carriage bolts (if they exist) in the first place, I could have saved a trip to the store.  This was a minor annoyance, but Delta really should just fix the problem.  I would buy more of these if I needed them, but everything else is either going to stay fixed or already has wheels.

On the positive note, the dust collection work much better than some other saws I've owned, and I like the supplied hold-down clamp.

My two main uses:
4056	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have owned this for about 9 years now and have had no issues.  Plenty of power, fairly good balance and "feel", the base is wide enough to be stable, brake is good and depth adjustment is pretty good.  Prior to this I have owned (and still do) a Black & Decker Sawcat and Super Sawcat.  For my money and hundreds of hours on the job, the Super Sawcat was THE perfect circ saw.  GREAT balance, plenty of power and good brake- also VERY wide baseplate- and LIGHT!  Still have it and it's no longer in production as far as I know.  Lots of pros in New England were using that in the 80's.  Black & Decker sold out to DeWalt.  I run finish blades on that puppy.  I use this DW364 for framing and reno work.  It's really pretty good but just does not have the balance that the Super Sawcat has.

Only reason for taking off one star was that the product came damaged the first time. All the blades were fine but the red plastic case was cracked and had pieces missing. There were no pieces missing in the box so I assume it happened somewhere at or before getting to the Amazon warehouse. Amazon got me another one and I exchanged it out with no hassle.

They are well constructed of heavy duty metal that precludes even the slightest amount of "give" when in use.  The only shortfall (literally) is the size of the mounting slots. These stops attach to the sides of the saw with large wing-nuts (provided). The mounting slots could be another inch in length to allow for slightly larger crown moldings, but then how many times do we deal with six inch moldings?
I come to a company like Porter Cable not for bare-minimum engineering but for robust "lifetime" engineering.  Having a tool fail on the job is no good; I don't care what the warantee is like (in this case...past warantee).

But since  this charger can crank out the tunes makes it that much better. It plays  off of DeWalt batteries so you don't have to worry about extension cords.  You can also hook up a Discman to it.

Repeatability with this sharpener is terrible. You will never get the same bevel angle twice, you're lucky if you can get a consistent bevel across the blade length once. All the adjustment mechanisms are primitive without any stops or detents or feature that would allow someone to quickly set it to achieve the same bevel angle more than once.

more evenly distributed than a wood handled hammer, where the weight is concentrated in the head itself
With the extension leg, short outside corner angles are easy to locate. At first, I wasn't sure I would need the extension but now I'm glad I have it. I have even used this tool for conduit bending when working with goofy angled runs. Really does eliminate time consuming trial cuts and bends.

Having noted that, I find that these work especially well on my Ridgid 2410 and 2412 saws.

1167	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am revising my prior review of "Durable and long lasting at a great price."  The price is great; so great that other bulbs cannot compete in price.  However, my last batch of these bulbs did not last as long as one would/should expect.  My application is 12 volt landscape lighting, using 80-90 percent of the transformer wattage.  Some 12-packs of these bulbs seem to last longer than others and I can only attribute this to slight differences in manufacturing runs.  My last batch lasted roughly four months; previous batches have lasted six months.  This seems to be a cyclical issue, i.e. sometimes they last awhile and sometimes the don't.  But, for the price and as many fixtures as I have running all night, these are the only reasonable cost choice.  There are so many variables in various applications, so they may last longer in your situation.

8525	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works as you'd expect.  the good thing about buying at amazon is it's availability and better price.  I've used for ceramic tile.  it's long lasting too.
You won't find a better one for the price and is far better than the ones offered from Rockler or Wood Craft.
6495	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This came in super handy.  I fabricated a extension wing for my Delta table saw.  This insert was very easy to adapt in to my saw.  I have a less common router, and this made it very easy for my to be able to use it.  I did however drill out one of the holes, so I could us a ratchet screw driver with a nut driver bit so I could have a makeshift router lift.
and puts more stress on your wrist and elbow.  Estwing makes a superb hammer.  Durable, precisely machined
I agree with another reviewer that said the tool should have a locking mechinism to hold the desired angle.  However, since the angle is clearly displayed on the LED readout, it's not difficult to adjust the tool to whatever angle you want if it changes.

Once cured, the strength of this glue is consistently stronger than the wood around it.  I have had good luck with letting it dry and scraping the squeeze-out away with a sharp chisel and/or a flexible putty knife.  After sanding I have had no problems with splotchiness in finishes.
I have two routers, both constantly attached to these plates. The old older one has been attached, and hanging, since 2001. It measures identically to the new one. I'm happy. It would, however, be nice if a simple ring with a 1/2" hole was included for centering the router. After the router was mounted a bit could be raised through it making it into a zero-clearance ring...

Look, I don't know why, but these bulbs simply fail to light up in a regular kitchen fixture. CBConcept also sells them on another popular "auction" site, but they don't work.

4476	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	A couple red flags with this product.  One, some folks have received a fence that does not fit their 14 inch Jet band saw.  That was not a problem for me, the fence I received fit the saw very well.  The second problem however may be more widespread and may not manifest until you've had the fence for a while (as noted in other reviews).  The problem is with the locking mechanism.  I noticed after installing the fence that it would not lock at all.  When you take a good look at the mechanism you see an oblong fitting that rotates, like a cam, to put pressure on the locking tab.  Problem is that in my fence the "cam" was not nearly large enough to exert much pressure at all.  Apparently, based on other reviews, there is a plastic tab that is glued to the cam or perhaps to the tab that provides the necessary pressure to compress the tab against the railing.  Unfortunately for me I did not install my fence until about 35 days after I received it and the return window had expired.  Amazon, as usual, was awesome and they have agree to provide a full refund and return shipping.  So I dodged a bullet and my advice is to avoid this fence altogether.  The Jet band saw, on the other hand, has been great so far but that is based on limited use.
This clamp has potential for being used for jobs that require very light clamping pressure, but you will get more bang for your buck by purchasing metal spring clamps.

The locking mechanism works without any hassles, and the grip is strong. All in all a nice piece of equipment. A major competitor sells this model for less money, but it is also a lighter weight clamp. I like them all. Bessey makes great stuff, you can't go wrong with these. They are a great general purpose clamp. Highly recommended.

7205	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a well made set of hole saws.  I have used them for a variety of wooden doors, piping runs inside walls, and one metal door.  In all cases the saws performed well.  I am not sure how well they would hold up to extended use on metal, however for my moderate useage on wood, and limited use on metal they have seemed to hold their edge quite well.  I originally bought a single lenox hole saw in a large diameter and had a cheap set of small diameter saws.  I picked up this set from amazon on some special and will never use the cheap ones again, even for small diameter holes.  I would have saved myself significant time and furstration if I had just purchased the "good" set at the regular price rather than trying to save a few dollars by buying cheaper versions of the small diameter saws.

3870	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These blades cut great.  Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet, etc.  Only downside, and maybe it's just with my Festool jigsaw, when ran at high speeds (cutting) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you've ever heard.  I can't even explain the sound but if you don't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead.  You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head!  And again, maybe it's just my saw or my ears but it's painful.  If I am only making a 5" cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs.  It's that bad.  Other than that the blades cut great!
I recently replaced about 15 sheets of 4 x 9 siding on my house, and I used this tool to dig out the nails holding the siding on.  My other cat paw was too big and wouldn't dig in to the nail heads.

Cons: Verticle adjustment pins don't have much travel. Does not have a lockdown knob.

Fighting with the nylon mounts - Rather than attach to your table saw in any stable fashion it is designed so that your  saw rests on nylon ring mounts.  These are extremely frustrating to get set up properly for a tight fit.  As you screw in the bolts (from underneath the table) the rings invariably move throwing you out of square.  Right off the top of my head I can think of a half dozen ways this could have been done better.  Poorly done.
For those who are beginners my best advice is get this saw and when you are learning use spiral blades and go slowly and stop when you start to go off line.  I find if I do a little and stop, relax, then do some more and repeat, I get better results.  I hope this helps folks.

I have used roughly 20 of the 40 grit belts so far and only had to adjust the tracking only three times during heavy use.  As far as the bag unit provided I have not tried it as my wife had bought a small shop vac years ago that had the right size hose to attach to the exhaust port for instant dust removal. I did have the dust collection unit plug up once but I did use a large shop vac to blow air backwards through the sander and it cleaned out the plug instantly.  Overall I'm very pleased I bought this sander.
The clamp threads were clean and well formed. They screwed onto the ends of the pipes with ease and will also easily spin if you aren't paying attention when you do your clamping.
However like I said earlier.  This is a heck of a tool.  It makes for speedy face frame joints and handles my  inch plywood joints very easily.

As a guy who occasionally repairs routers (and other tools) for friends, I can tell you this is a well-designed, high-quality tool, reminiscent of the "old days" when all American tool manufacturers built heavy-duty stuff for years of use.

7976	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	First, I must mention that the Workmate I'm writing about is not new -- it is the Workmate 400 model.  My wife won it in a contest nearly 25 years ago; when we got married, she gave it to me.
7530	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Like many reviewers, I once owned the original Workmate. I loved it, and eventually gave it to my son. I ordered this one with trepidation, knowing that Black and Decker has not made a quality product for several decades. This bench arrived slightly bent, even though the shipping box did not appear damaged. Several parts fell out of the box when it was opened. These were parts that were supposed to be attached at the factory. The assembly instructions were confusing, and nearly useless. The concept of the Workmate has always appealed to me. The execution of that concept in this current product is pathetic. I cannot recommend the WM 425 in any way. Additional observations after a month of use: This workbench is truly a joke. It is so poorly made that I am constantly fiddling with it to get it to work right. As far as I am concerned, it is a disposable item, and that's exactly how I intend to treat it. As soon as I finish the current auto re-upholstery project that I am using it for, I'm going to set it out at the curb for pick-up by the local scrap metal hauler. Might as well re-cycle the steel into something more useful.

Another reviewer said his saw's sole plate was "out of parallel with the saw blade 3/64" over the length of the plate.  Mine is also off, but only by 1/64"; which hasn't been an issue when using a straightedge to guide the saw.  If it were, some judiciously placed thin washers in the adjusting mechanism would bring that to zero.

as a side note: my dad actually has this same exact drill, but with a keyless chuck, and though the keyless chuck is also made of metal and well designed, i've found that the keyed chuck simply provides better performance, and is worth the hassle of carrying a key around

It comes with only the 1/2" collet so if you have 1/4" you can get that collet for about $15.00.  I mounted this to a Kreg table using the Kreg phenolic insert.  Definitely will upgrade to the aluminum auto lift base soon as I expect the weight of this router to bow the phenolic after a time.  This Router will easily turn 3" panel bits and the adjustable speed controls make it easy to meet bit specs.  The only thing I did not like was the thumb screw style clamp on the base.  Really PC?  Never heard of a cam lock?  If anything will have to be replaced with use it will be the thumb screw.  This router was everything I heard it was both from other owners and online reviews.

The seller promptly replaced it (with another one shipped in an envelope).  The rope light came with some mounting clips, but not enough of them to hold this securely.

Installed with 3M double-sided auto body tape for a strong tight mounting to a smooth concrete floor (suggest cleaning floor with lacquer thinner, MEK or something like "Goof-Off" first for good adhesion).  Makes shop clean-up a breeze.
4214	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I usually agree with Tim Allen's "more power" philosophy and had to think a while before choosing an 8-1/2" saw over the 10" models. I am happy with my decision.
He told me that DeWalt specifies a tolerance of + / - ONE-thousandth inch in blade-to-shoe parallelism.

39	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product, quick service!!
5282	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I see no benefit whatever.  It does reduce the depth of cut from whatever your saw allows (3"+) to 2.5 inches.  For cutting hardwood with minimal burning, Forrest recommends setting the blade as high as possible. The stiffener limits it to 2.5" cut.
Negative - Very little here.

4940	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got this to save me money on my Dewalt planer blades. Set up is straight forward and easy. I have used it now for 2 yrs and it works great. Pull it out and set it up and you can have your planer blades sharp in 15 to 20 minutes. That's alot better than spending $50.00 a pop on blades. I have already paid for this with resharpening the 5 blades I had purchased before getting this. Great tool, it does kinda make a mess though.
2. Flimsy bolt together construction. Fix, I welded mine.
1706	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got a P-C 505 sander?  Eventually you'll need one of these as the foam between the mounting plate and the Stickit fabric will deteriorate and turn to dust.  The only real issue is the packaging.  It is a heat formed plastic over top of a cardboard display sheet.  Take care when peeling the plastic off the pad lest you bend the pad's thin aluminum backing plate.  Other than that, replacement is simple: Unscrew the 4 screws, remove and toss the old pad, put the new one in place and put the 4 screws back, and you're back in business.

YES, THIS IS AS GOOD A PUMP JACK AS YOU WILL FIND THAT USES WOOD SUPPORTS.  If you want something more solid QualCraft has a system that uses aluminum posts and is made to use every day for years without replacing the supports.  That system is absolutely excellent also if used properly.

I found the saw very easy to set up and use.  So far I have used it to cut some molding as well as some pine boards.  Great results and no complaints.
The dust bag is  designed well.  You can swivel it in any direction to get it out of the way  while you're sanding, and it holds the dust without spilling until you're  ready to empty it out.  Also, it does a fair job collecting the dust, but  you should never expect any dust-bag system to be perfect.

very satisfied with the purchase.
394	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I originally purchased this to read books, manuals, etc but ended up using it to do work around the house, inside my computer case and in hard to reach places where a bit of light is needed.
336	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Pretty crappy light. Doesn't light up enough of the page to be useful...and def NOT "mighty bright". Flimsy, broke even before I had a chance to try and use it. Save your money! Look elsewhere! I only gave it 2 stars because there was almost immediate shipping.
I have a Dewalt DW744 contractor's table saw.  I have an after market Shark Guard (http://www.thesharkguard.com/index.htm ), with riving knife, anti-kickback pawls, and safety guard which I love.  My only hesitation with buying this was whether or not I could use my Shark Guard Riving knife et. al. with this insert.
1885	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I only needed a few for a small project but they seem to have worked fine. No complaints. And I like that they come in a little bottle instead of a baggy like other brands.
If added accuratecy is what you are looking for, then the Carter bandsaw guides will help acheive a consistent product. Well worth the investment.!
2960	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use the battery off my drill and that made it a great purchase for me.  The light has a swivel head and works great.
I've put this up against 8/4 African mahogany, 5/4 Jatoba, 5/4 hard maple and 6/4 red oak and it cut through all like butter leaving a satin smooth finish on the ends.  I will never consider another blade for my miter saw!
For step 25, I was unable to position the blade guard in a way that the blade cleared both the splitter and the blade guard when the blade is set to 45 degrees.  The solution is given in step 26, which I didn't notice at first.
I decided to upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  The previous reasons I gave for the 4 star rating turned out to be a one time adjustment.  The table has been invaluable for minor production work of moldings and simple profiles.  I would like to see Kreg increase the neck of the 2.5" dust port, even 1/2" longer would make installing suction hose considerably easier.  If you plan on using a 3.5" raised panel bit, you're going to get a lot of vibration if you attempt to make the cut in two passes.  The table is sturdy, but no shaper.  Making raised panel doors, plan on 3 passes with your last pass being 1/8" cut or less to reduce annoying fuzz.  Over all, I'm extremely pleased with the ease of use and durability of this router table.

The saw may get hot at times of extreme use but thats why I wear work gloves!

2652	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This little sander is a wonderful tool. You can get glass smooth finishes relatively quckly with the right discs. I won't go back to plain orbital sanders. they're too slow and leave too many swirl marks on your work.  Incidently , I find myself reaching for my Porter Cable R.O. sander more  often , because it has less vibration, and causes less numbness in my  hands.

1945	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I own quite a few sanders, and in my opinion this is one of the best, although not _the best_.
This saw is great! It saws through white oak and maple dowels like a hot knife through butter. The blade is flexible enough to trim right at the surface without marring the surface. The problems some others have had with the quality of the handle seem to have been addressed because I have no complaints about it. (Yes, a nice hardwood handle would be nicer than this...but we're woodworkers, right? Make one.)

UP DATE: SECOND ONE SLIPPING ALSO WILL NOT HOLD. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY

The single screw mounting I thought might be a limitation, but the design of my machine uses that single screw and a plate upon which the router sets. Together the router is very firmly secured.
972	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I realize these are cheap and one shouldn't have high expectations, but I ordered a 50W bulb and did not get a 50W bulb.  I have a row of these in a light fixture. I have no way to measure the output light (or lumens as they call it) and in my fixture these are more like 35W not 50W and seem to be yellower than Feit, GE or Phillips bulbs.

Lastly, I have to agree with other reviewers about the uselessness of the dust bag.  I tried turning it it every direction possible, but nothing helped.  It doesn't collect much dust regardless if I make chop cuts or sliding cuts.  And, yes, I do slide the blade from front to back as explained in the manual.  So, overall, I would give the saw 4 1/2 stars, but since that's not possible I gave it the four stars because of the lock-off switch, the dust bag, and the dado situation.
7908	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The perfect hammer, what more can i say? looks good, performs good, indestructable and makes for great gifts for people
Then, inspired by what I had found, I opened up the box for the Kreg precision miter I had also purchased.  Yes, parts.  Not as bad as the fence, mind you, but still, too many un-assembled parts.

8070	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised at how well the unit was constructed and thoughtful design.  The unit assembles with male and female joints allowing easy transportation.  The wheels are large and smooth enough to roll over most debris on a sheet rock job.  The frame that holds the sheet rock is spring loaded to allows slight movement.  Thisallows you to adjust the sheet rock around interferences.  The triangular wheel base collapses so that you can roll in through doorways and such which is very convenient.  You just need to remember to extend the wheels when you're back to lifting sheetrock.

I have read many reviews of palm sanders in which the user complains that they have trouble with them when sanding drywall. Palm sanders are defiantly not made for sanding drywall. You would not use a hacksaw for cutting lumber, would you? If you insist on using this type of tool for sanding drywall then expect it to clog and possibly burn up. Use the proper tool for the proper job.

I'd say this ought to be bundled with the planer - which is a  great planer by the way - this tool produces *volumes* of chips!  some form of dust or chip collection is a requirement, packaging it separately is just a form of gouging.

152	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This has two LEDs, but the coverage is so good that I usually switch on just one. You don't have to reposition it for every page. Possibly too bright for totally dark rooms, but not enough light for an unlit room during the day, if there are windows. If there is any little light in the room at night, it's fine. Probably about the same amount of light as those key ring LED lights, but more evenly lit, and covers a larger area.

The bottom line to all of this is, know your hose ID and OD dimensions as well as the actual dimensions of the Mr Nozzle kit parts but be aware that you may have to do some "jury-rigging" to get everything to fit. However, I want to reemphasize that the hose itself is made of excellent material and is top-notch in quality.

But-  I am a fan of these particular blades. I am a general Contractor, yet, I also build a lot of exotic hardwood specialty items and I am very hard on my blades....I have had the the most expensive blades on the market for the past 15 years and for the price these can't be beat. These turn every one of my table saws into the effective and precision machines that they were meant to be!  I get the cut of a glue-line blade without the cost or dragging.

3483	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had a body shop for twenty years. Spent more time behind a polisher than would be believed if I stated it. Polishers for automotive use were all 2400 RPM. It was either on or off, and no variable speed. When trying to feather in an area, I used to feather the switch on and off intermittently. This polisher by Makita takes it to the next level. The moment I took it out of the box and plugged it in, it was preset at one on the speed dial. I squeezed the trigger, and it crawled around so slow I couldn't believe it. Then when setting it at a higher number it gave you variable speed on the trigger. That way you had the option of adjusting by the trigger, any speed up to the preset number. Additionally, you could press in the lock on, and it would remain at a constant speed. In plain words, every option was considered, well thought out, and integrated into the tool. Leave it to Makita to make another dead on accurate tool. Add to that the built in smart electronics, which gives you just the right amount of power to keep it running at the preset speed, even when it encounters more resistance. That keeps the speed constant.

This is a stunning blade and I couldn't find anything better through all of my research. $100 for a saw blade may seem like a big investment, but because I plan to send it back to be resharpened many times, the price will be amortized over time, and will end up costing the same or less than other blades, and through lots of cutting already, it's the BEST!

I have a couple of old wobble blades and a Wards set that  between them can't hold a trott-line, so I don't know what I'll use them  for now.  The Forrest Dado King is the only one I'll ever use again!
4784	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The price was good (for a DeWalt product) and the shipping was relatively fast.  I mean, you have to pay for quality and DeWalt makes some high quality tools for sure that not only last a very long time, but hold their value in terms of trading or selling in the future.  The joiner works well and is pretty close to being 100% accurate.  It's a good tool and I'm glad I have in my shop!
My two main uses:

My only small nit with these lights is the switch can sometimes be hard to turn on. I found that a dab of Di-Electric Grease every couple years on the switch easily fixes that.

Probably saved my behind without me even knowing it, but you have to negotiate your particular set up.
6689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have to say, this is one of the best screwdrivers I've gotten yet. In fact, i bought it used, and the battery is still in great shape. It has lots of power, and it lasts forever in one battery charge. Great for doing round the house jobs, as it fits in almost any tool-belt or box. The best part is how it can be straight OR folded. This allows for easier access for hard to reach areas.
In my table the M12V has been a real champ.  I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.  The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.  With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).

CONCLUSION:


Since I wrote this review, I have never received a response from this company. I've concluded I have no use for a company that doesn't respond to a customer's legitimate request. I won't be purchasing any of their products in the future.

Don't even consider the cheap copies, they don't come close to the acuracy  and quality of this square. The head is cast and ground with relefs in the  channel, and the blade is machined, not stamped. The rule is laser etched  and then matt finished to reduce glare. The differences are far more than  cosmetic. The slide works smoothly and locks securely. All of the edges are  perfectly flat and smooth. I know this seems like a lot to spend for a  combination square, but the $10 ones I have tried just don't work.  They  don't lock square reliably, and the blades are allways rough and warped  slightly. If you want something even fancier, get the version with three  heads.

I recently assembled a bookshelf built from sheet goods, and this clamp worked very well for holding the shelf to the side of the case while I drove pocket-hole screws in place.  One big advantage this clamp has is that it can clamp both a right-angle AND a T-joint such as a shelf on the interior (as opposed to the ends) of the cabinet.

As for serious sanding - say, when stripping finishes or surfacing rough lumber - I just went with a handheld 3 x 21" belt sander; it's a beast, but it's fast, quiet, and gentle on my joints. I suspect that a belt + sheet sander combo makes much more sense than trying to use a random orbit sander for everything - and getting RSI.
2522	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great saw! It has all the features needed for every type of construction, demolition and home use. I have used most of the major competitive brands and I have to say that this saw out performs all of the others. If you are buying a replacement or if you are a first time buyer you will be very satisfied choosing this model Milwaukee.

This is one of those tools that once you own it you ask yourself how you ever got any accuracy without it. As far as power, accuracy, and adjustments it was rock solid engineering right out of the box. I use this tool mostly for cabinet construction and fine furniture work.

The manual suggests that if you have a 30" Unifence and table extension, you can cut 12" from the large tube.  I suggest that you refrain from doing this until you find your saw too bulky with the Uniguard installed.  The extra 12" on the tube may come in handy if you want to have a work piece that is more than 52" to the right of the blade.

4822	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a powerful workhorse made for professionals. The dust bag catches most sawdust. You can attach a vacuum instead and catch even more. This unit is not a disposable homeowner tool, it is made to last and it can be repair. The most likely repair issue will be a need for new motor brushes, which is an easy maintenance item requiring no disassembly. I've used this for hours at a time, and it is definitely up to the challenge. This has a heavy duty electrical motor, so make sure that if you need an extension cord you use a heavy duty cord and one no longer than necessary. Longer and lighter cords cause premature wear on the motor.

Given the custom-ability, versatility and durability, this style of pipe clamp would still be a bargain if they cost as much as the more expensive Bessey clamps. At roughly HALF the price of fancy-clamps, they are a super bargain. Your great-great grandchildren could inherit these and they would still be useful. I actually inherited some of these from my father, and they still work perfectly.
4689	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used only a few different blades. I would say this is the best one so far. The freud diablo and dewalt blades I have bought do not come close. This blade cuts through brazillian redwood very easily. Most other softwoods and softer hard woods do not even slow it down. I am using the blade on a Hitachi C10FSH, sliding compound miter saw. How long it stays sharp has yet to be seen but I am sure it will perform well.

Watch the size when you order these.  These are bigger than some.  For some projects you may want a smaller clamp.
The middle jaw has only two holes in each side. You should attach the plastic blocks following diagram 4. The numbers written on the top of the middle jaw should face you when you attach it to the metal frame. You should insert the plastic blocks to the wider part of the 4th cutout from the back in the metal frame and then slide the middle jaw all the way to the back until it will touch the rear jaw. Then tighten the bolts to keep the middle jaw in place.

5834	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It doesn't make any sense really, but these blades cut way faster, and with less deflection on the cut, when compared to the "clean cut" Bosch blades for wood. These are very aggressive, they practically cut so fast it scares me and I think maybe the wood will be torn to little shreds but when Iook at the wood it's really clean after the cut, no saw marks at all. These blades are the only Bosch blades I've tried so far that give a vertical cut with a zero degree pitch and very close to zero degree vertical cut even with curved cuts on 3/4 plywood. Somehow they also turn very easily too despite being a wider blade, they make turns very easily in the wood without any friction and without much deflection. I haven't tried these without the splinter guard on my Bosch saw so I don't know how clean the cut would be without that, more testing is needed. So far this is the most accurate Bosch blade I've tried and I tried 4 other ones.

3541	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great tool.
4076	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	excellent product. It cut much better then freud's lower end stacked dado i had. Well worth the upgrade. Luckily I was able to return the other. It is smooth, sharp and makes nice flat edges and bottoms.
Anyway, I ended up paying $100 more for a brand new unit after receiving and returning the junk reconditioned one.  Take note the brand new units come with a large pre-finished flooring foot, 1/2", 5/8" and 3/4" (white) base plates, two allen wrenches and users manual.  Of course, if you know what you're doing (carefully), you don't necessarily need the pre-finished foot, but it does serve a very useful purpose(s) if you like it. It's wider and has rollers on the bottom that assist in the "slide-n-smack" shuffle.  But more importantly, the pre-finished floor foot works against the tongue of the board to distribute the force over a much larger surface area vs. a much smaller area of pre-finished edge if you don't use the pre-finished foot.  Bottom-line is the foot helps eliminate damaging the pre-finished edge when you smack too hard closing aggressive board gaps.  I tested this by smacking really hard with the pre-finished foot and I noticed no damage to the pre-finished edge.  Had I done this without the pre-finished foot, I'm almost certain it would have damaged the red oak I'm working with.  Factory-reconditioned units (at least the one sent to me) do not include the pre-finished foot, so figure at least another $50 for this accessory if you don't buy brand new.  Really I'm not sure you save much buying recon vs. new.  Considering you might be appalled at the condition of the factory-reconditioned unit like the one sent to me.  So why take any chances and risk wasting time--for what, to save $50?
And: they are very, very sharp (keep bandages with them - even though you've been warned - you'll have to find out for yourself).
I guess my only complaint/suggestion would be for Pony to either make another model for smaller frames, or extend the size range down just a bit.
This kit is all about quality. No plastics are used with any of the working parts. Even though the case is mainly plastic, Lenox used through-bolts and nuts to affix a metal nameplate. Nothing jogs out of place because of the thoughtful interior design.

Oh well, they knew a good thing when they saw it.
Hex keys are provided for fasteners and set screws, all you will need is a 7/16 wrench or socket.



Now, just a tip for plastic cutting. You need to play with the various speeds on the Fein tool. There is a "sweet spot" where it cuts like butter. It is fast enough to cut, but does not melt the material.

2965	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	While my old 12" planer is used a lot, it keeps on ticking. I've been thru many of these blades and they last pretty good. I just wish they made them where I could re-sharpen them.
I've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years, I can say this is by far the best I've ever used!
First, this is a heavy-duty clamp that costs a lot of money. It should be durable enough to be DROPPED 36" to a shop floor without becoming useless. Even most electronic devices (iPhone, etc...) can be dropped from that height without breaking. Second, I understand a one-year warranty on my saw, it is going to wear out, but  a heavy-duty clamp? Warranty it for life.
None at all! You owe it to yourself to get one of these dual lamp beauties. Maybe get two so you'll have a spare or if there's a power outtage!

UPDATE..Jan. 05...Ruined the 1/4 inch guide, when the stop collar vibrated loose, allowing the guide to move. Also messed up the bit. I have used this guide set a couple of times and haven't had this problem before. I found a new guide and stop collar at my local woodworker store, not very expensive. I have always hand tightend my stop collar but will use a pair of pliers from now on. Shouldn't have to but can't risk this happening again. Very scary and could have been very hazardous.

I haven't used this new Speed Bloc yet other than to turn it on. I called Porter Cable a couple of days before I ordered it and asked where it was being made. The gentleman told me some are made off shore and some are still manufactured in the USA. The one I received does not mention anything about being made in the USA. Kind of sad. Hopefully it will last a long time and that this is still a 5 star product.
3665	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This Porter Cable sander is a proven tool.  I have used mine on many projects, and it has performed very well.
to be fair, when the tool was running, it performed pretty well; had adequate power, tracked well and dust bag worked adequately.  Speaking of which, Amazon shipped this WITHOUT the dust bag.  It was advertised WITH bag, so I contacted them.  It took some complaining but they sent me one.  I've seen this before with discount vendors; they "strip" accessories out of the box.  I'm not saying THEY did that, but someone did.  The box was sealed, had no dust bag and they initially did not want to send me one.

2069	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The router is heavy, powerful, and solid.  If you need this kind of power, you are probably going to use it is a table mounted situation anyway, so the weight really isn't such a problem.  This router should have all the power you will ever want.
Plane Irons - Fabulous.  Using the Highland jig in the Makita tooling is just the ticket.  Flattening the back of the iron is easy too.
I then took out the factory insert; reinstalled the Leecraft insert and adjusted to level and proper fit.  I took out the insert and reinstalled my riving knife.  I lowered the blade below the table and reinstalled the Leecaft insert.  The riving knife and blade came up through the insert and were positioned perfectly.  I have made quite a few cuts with this arrangement since and I am very satisfied with the results.  I am glad I bought this and would recommend it to others.

However, this is my second time coming back for replacements.  I had about 3 left and felt it was time to order more for using this year.  Discussing the quality I did have one or two bad lights but overall these bulbs have lasted a long, long time.  Like another reviewer stated you can barely get 2 of these individual lights at a local retailer for the same price and over the past year these have gone down in price, fantastic.  Overall I'm very pleased with this product and this seller and would recommend this product.  For the price, it's truly an amazing value for a great product.
7651	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These go together relatively quickly.  We have used them on numerous projects, we have the 225, and x2 425's.  They come in very hand and are extremely versatile.  The rear board comes off or can be re-located to meet your needs, the feet fold under and there are shorter feet in each corner with then replace the folded feet.  A small roll pin holds on the handles.  As long as you don't need to remove them a simple hammer and the included plastic "wrench" is all you will need to assembly the tables.  The edges (facing each other) are grooved).  The idea is to help hold material.  Another vertical groove is included to allow you to put in a round object and fit in the vertical groove (about 1/4" deep).  With a couple quick lever release/catches this will fold flat.  While this is mostly just stamped steel with some plastic guides and the ??bamboo?? top its a very nice quality work bench.  One thing I will mention with this is the second 425 I purchased had a slightly chipped wood work surface on one of the 3 pieces.  Not a big deal, but wanted to mention it.

3) They suggest using a drill press to make sure the holes are perfectly aligned. They weren't kidding. The holes need to be perfect or you'll be spending a long time making them work. I of course have a drill press. Doesn't everyone? It's next to my planer and joiner. [sarcasm] Anyone who has a press probably also has a swank table saw that doesn't need you to provide it's own base.
Of course had to buy cabinet lift to go along with this installation method, but that was worth the money as well.

We used it in a decorative recessed wall panel in our new japanese bath so we snipped off the end and hard wired it in so it worked with a wall switch. We used 4 setting timer switches and this light uses so little electric that it stayed on low as a night light even when turned off, an interesting feature of using a timer switch with these lights, that won't be the case if you use a regular wall on off switch though. Looks great behind my shoji screen light effect casting a nice white light through the rice paper into the bathroom, made for a beautiful night light. Very good quality rope light and it was here really fast. I highly recommend this excellent product!

If you were in a hurry, it could be put together twice as fast.  All of the components were of excellent quality and the fit of the pieces was meticulously crafted.  I had been wieghing the decision to build my cabinet from scratch or buy this one -- I am very glad that I chose to buy this one!
5733	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great little table. It comes in a relatively small box and requires assembling.

4156	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I got this chop saw about a year or so ago.  It works great with good power to go through thick 2" and 3" stainless pipe and tube I have cut with it.  I would suggest finding the 2414b model as being able to "rock" the saw helps to cut through tough steel.  It seems like when you cut steel with a normal chop saw it gets half way through and doesn't cut as fast based on the angle.  The 2414b lets you basically adjust the saw angle so that it gets through it quicker.  I would give it 5 stars but my saw developed a problem.  It tripped the breaker as soon as I turned it on, without even cutting steel.  Took it to service and they corrected the problem.  I debated with many saws and tried many, but this is the best.

5969	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just as described.  Seems pretty sturdy. . . although nothing special (I wouldn't try dropping it on the floor when cold etc)

2215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is my fourth compound miter saw and my third sliding compound miter saw. This saw allows piece of mind. You basically know that this saw will cut whatever stock you have, within reason. This is a very good tool, it is thoughtfully designed and has some real advantages and falls slightly short in only a couple of areas. The BOSCH 3915 ( 10" SCM ) is a fine tool, but only bevels one way, its toggle clamps are quick and easy to engage ( more so than the DeWalt vertical clamps, which are still effective ).I prefer the cast in angle markers on the BOSCH over the DeWalts painted on gauge or Hitachi's C10fs which are too hard to read because they are painted the same seafoam green as the base and they are too small. The detents on the BOSCH are superb, the DeWalt's are also very good, and the Hitachi's are not as plentiful or crisp. The cam action lock down on the DeWalt is great, but the BOSCH's screw type works very well because of its large knob, much easier than the smaller Hitachi's. Regarding the cam lock on the DeWalt, I was really impressed how well it locks down even a degree or less next to a major detent. The adjustable fences on the Dewalt are superior to the Bosch's which only one side moves, and the Hitachi's are too short to be very useful. For the most part the BOSCH has a very nice base, but the direct drive motor and mount is fairly old technology. The Hitachi is a nice and fairly compact saw with a great motor, very smooth start up, but the base needs updating. The DeWalt is a great compromise. It does not fall way short in any category that I can see based on owning the other two saws mentioned. The accessories not being included is a little disappointing, I believe that for the price of this saw DeWalt could atleast include the dust bag. Generally speaking though, I believe this saw is woth every nickel when you consider the other saws are very good, but have distinct shortcomings, the DeWalt really does not in my opinion. I have mounted this saw on a mobile custom cart with locking wheels and storage beneath, I mounted the the Rousseau extensions and stop system on my cart and it is extremely solid and useful. So far, although not perfect - this saw is the best of the current choices. Hope this review helped you.

It is tricky, when you buy a blade kit, to fit it into the case. Individual blades fit fine. But if you throw the blade case away, you no longer know what blade does what.

I just came up from the shop where I sharpened nine bevel chisels, five lathe chisels of various types, one plane iron, and three 6" jointer knives.  My session took about 3 hours, including cleaning and drying the machine.  My usual session is only an hour or so, but the lathe tools were in bad shape.  All the tools were ground with the 1000 and 6000 grit stones.  The lathe tools required a little fixing with the 120 grit stone first.

3127	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Clean little product, two metal stampings and two bolts with plastic knobs which secure the stampings to the side of the saw table.  Very easy to lay the molding to be worked against the fence, top side on the table and bottom against the fence with the mounting surfaces flat against the fence and table.  This accomplishes what the Kreg Crown-Pro does and has the advantage of being easily able to use, for instance, the workpiece supports on the DeWalt miter saw stand, DWX723 or DWX724.  One thing of importance is to set both stops to the exact same distance.  Having set one to the desired position and secured the retaining bolt, use a straight edge to set the other stop.  An alternate solution is to determine the desired projection and cut a strip of wood to that width and then put that strip on the table and against the fence, then bring the stops up and secure them.  The straight edge method is much easier.  With crown stops, no tricky compound miter cuts are necessary, just make the miter adjustment and cut the molding.  I would highly suggest getting a good angle gauge, which should pop up in the suggestions if you are looking at the DW7084 Amazon page.
The Holeshooter is a classic,geared to contractors who use their drill hard every day. Both are pro grade drills,but the Holeshooter is more likely to survive WW3. The Holeshooter is also easier to service.

1) It comes with the needed drill bits, so you do not have to buy those separately.
Relative to the recommendations of some that a used shaper might have  been a better approach, have you ever priced shaper cutters relative to router bits?  They are a lot more expensive.  Also shapers are not easily moved from the basement to the garage for a project.  If I were a production shop, then a shaper makes sense.  Since I'm not, the router table approach is the more flexible and cost effective approach for me.  Besides, I more than covered the cost of the equipment in the savings from not having to buy or have someone make custom wainscoting.

Con: Batteries must be replaced. I tried the Mighty Bright light that comes with an AC Adapter, which didn't work quite right and I returned it, but I also realized that being plugged into a wall isn't always practical when you're reading in bed, or anywhere else for that matter. The battery version is better. I seem to get a lot of reading hours before having to change batteries, so it's a minor quibble.

Such a smooth finish. Very nicely made and durable blade. Came packed very well with a hard plastic around the edges to prevent any one from getting cut. Surely worth the price to have this blade in your collection.  Very affordable saw blade. Fits any saw with 3/8 inch arbor and 4 1/2 inch blade. Would buy this again if needed due to normal use. Good product from Porter-Cable. Thumbs up!!
  Controling the Fein is difficult at best.  When sanding narrow pieces like a cabinet face frame, the Fein jumps around.  When sanding larger areas, the Fein sucks down onto the work piece making it more difficult to move.  Long periods of sanding with the Fein are a struggle.  The Fein is aggresive but, when you want less agressive sanding, you don't have a choice since it is only one speed not variable.  I am especially disappointed in the amount of vibration the Fein has.  The worse thing of all is the poor quality when sanding with high grit paper for the final pass.  One other downer is the high cost and lack of availability of sand paper for the Fein.  And if all that isn't enough, I emailed Fein regarding problems trying to register my sander online for the extra 2 year warranty.  I never heard from them.  By the way, I spoke with a Fein representative prior to buying the sander and told him I already have a Festool.  He said Fein is the best.  So much for honest salesmanship.

When not in use, I clip it on my lampshade next to my bed so I don't clutter up my bedside table with it and it has never left any marks on the white shade. The flex neck is excellent and allows you to easily maneuver the light to virtually any angle that you need and because it has the wire inside the neck, it will stay put in any position unless you physically move it.

 I installed the Freud on my table saw, and got the same excellent results. So I bought a second one of these Freuds. I like the 60 teeth. Commonly the 50 tooth crosses the line between great ripping and crosscutting. This 60 tooth appears to do the job beautifully, and still give you that extra smoothness that comes with the additional teeth. The Forrest is still covered in the protective rubber dip.

4904	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Does not fit all DeWalt miter saws. I have a DWS780 Type 20 and it, nor the adapter that comes with the bag, fit. Also, for those complaining about the bag not collecting a satisfactory amount of dust, that's a dust extraction system design issue, not a bag issue.
  Another nice feature is that the cylindrical drums roll in only one direction. That allows you to freely feed the work in, but if the work piece wants to start to back up it instantly stops it. That back roll is nipped in the bud, and that is the movement, that leads to the binding that I was telling you about. Combined with the hold down effect, that stops it altogether. So it actually performs a double protection effort.

2690	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Other reviewers are correct, this is a terrific little sander with one problem, the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task, this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent, noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended.

1387	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	You know that this item is cheap, and you correlate that with quality. You may try to justify this purchase by thinking, even if it doesn't work as well as those you get from Home Depot, you might still come ahead with 10 of these cheap bulbs - WRONG! My new replacement bulb died after merely 2 weeks. My previous one (got from a local hardware store) used in my desk lamp broke after 3 years.
8618	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Why in the hell would a company like DEWALT sell this item without DEWALT DW4706 4-1/2-Inch Backing Flange for the DW402, DW402G, and DW818?  I bought the 4 1/2 inch grinder and this blade will not function without the backing flange.  The flange is not included with the grinder and no mention of the flange is included in the requirements for this blade or the grinder.  Seriously disappointed by DEWALT.
For some of the negative reviewers here, perhaps you are expecting a lightweight trim saw to be as strong as a full size worm? If so, you are using the wrong tool. This is a great saw for plywood and trim, with the right (sharp) blades. If you want a saw you can fling into the box, toss around the job site, and power through ply with a dull blade, look elsewhere.

For serious woodworking I recommend paying a few dollars more and get better clamps for your project.

It's a very heavy tool, but it needs to be to have the solid feel that it has. I purchased a mobile miter saw base, mounted it to that, and I highly recommend you do the same. (See my review on the mobile base, a Delta 50-155). You do NOT want to be lugging this thing out all the time because of the weight.
As a weekend DIY warrior, I don't have time to make every little jig or fixture for every tool. I thought about how long it takes me to find a stable piece of dry wood, plane it to thickness, make a pattern, cut it out on the bandsaw, trim to exact size by hand or on the belt sander, drill the finger hole, make the hold down divots, drill the adjustment holes and install set screws, then paint the damn thing and wait for paint to dry. Screw all that. I'm not THAT cheap! This convenience comes at a reasonable price and gets me to the fun stuff faster. Besides, it's hard to explain to your boss (the wife) that you couldn't finish that project she needed last weekend because you had to wait for the paint to dry on your table-saw insert. Unless you're on a punishingly penurious budget, these are totally worth it.

4264	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Stanley has been making planes for a long time. They do know what they are  doing. I have a few of these around for general purpose work . I also have  some Lie Nielsons and I love them but I keep them safe and out of reach of  others'. I don't care who uses the Stanleys. I know if they get ruined ,  I'm not out much. With a little tuning a stanley will do a respectable job.  Lap the sole and the iron ,put a good bevel on it and it will cut  aggressively or produce a fine shaving. The adjustable throat is a must for  avoiding tearout. I like the low angle version of this plane a little  better. It is easier to control .It also makes a finer cut. It won't cut as  deep however. To get a better plane you will have to spend at least twice  as much so this is not a bad deal.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE awarded this saw as their best saw in 1999, which is why i originally purchased it. they reviewed saws again, in their SEPT 2005 issue. IT WON AGAIN! that's a real testament to me, only far superior tools win their prestigious award. a close second was the bosch wormdrive.

9777	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A cheap airhose (made from PVC, usually) is a pain. They stay coiled when you uncoil them, and stay straight when you coil them. A high quality rubber hose makes a huge difference. It sounds trivial, but it really makes managing hoses easier. When I'm in the shop, or out on a job I want to be able to run the hose out quickly, and coil it neatly when I'm done. A high quality rubber hose like this one makes it easy.

3161	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the perfect size little saw; I absolutely love it! I have mine mounted to a Rockler acrylic base that I use with a saw guide.  I still use my normal 7 1/4 for 2 x4's and such, but this saw will handle 2x lumber pretty well too. The left side mounted blade is great to see what you're doing, and the light weight is wonderful.  The stock blade is pretty awful, and as others have commented it can be tough to find blades for this saw.  I found that using a Skill 4 3/8" 40T flooring blade with 2 bushings works. The flooring blade has a 20 mm diameter cutout, and you can get bushings to go to 5/8", and then 5/8 of an inch to half-inch is pretty common. You can get this blade at Home Depot and Lowe's. Oshlum (sold on Amazon) has a 24 tooth blade with the correct bushing for under $8, so it makes for a nice general-purpose blade. The smaller blade is nice for veneer plywood, but at 4 3/8 of an inch it won't cut full depth.  Doesn't matter to me as I only use it for plywood, and a lot cheaper than many 60 tooth blades for the 7 1/4 saw.  Just don't lose your bushings! They are gold when it comes to the saw.
3880	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was undecided on what brand to purchase. I bought this one based on reviews and price. I'm very pleased with it and it is of much better quality than I expected. It is very easy to set the depth and height of the biscuit cut. I had to adjust the depth of the cut since mine was off by 1 mm or so. Once I made the adjustment, the cuts were perfect. My sole complaint is that the wrench provided to adjust the depth is useless and you can throw it into your odd and useless tool drawer. The head of the wrench is just too large and doesn't allow the nut to be turned once you slip it onto the nut. I used a Craftsman combination ignition wrench to adjust the nut and there was no problem. If you don't have ignition wrenches, I suppose you would be forced to use a pair of pliers to loosen and retighten the nut.
I am disappointed in the cosmetics of the ruler. I bought this particular model because if its satin-finish chrome blade. But when the square arrived, some of the finish was scraped off the blade, apparently by the head of the square. Amazon willingly sent me another, but it also had scratches on the blade. Given that I paid extra for the satin chrome blade, I am disappointed that two of the squares were flawed. I can only conclude that Starrett does not have good quality control since both squares came with an inspector's certificate saying that the squares met Starett's quality standards. Finally, I was disappointed that Starett did not respond to my Email regarding this matter.
Other than that, the router itself just seemed to lack that polish and precision in plastic molding I see on all of my other Bosch tools.
It might not keep everything out of the shop vac, but if it reduces my changing the bag by 70% it will be worthwhile.  Fein bags are expensive. I've checked the bag a few times and very little is finding its way in.
7547	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	...you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw (it sticks up about 1/32").  Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade (especially a thin-kerf blade), reduce chipping and noise.  This may be true, but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert.  I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost.

2835	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my second DeWalt drill and I couldn't be happier.  This is a corded drill, but has significant power for almost any home improvement project that I want to tackle.  I use this drill the most when I am mixing tile adhesive and grout for tiling projects.  The consistency of these products can tend to get very thick.  Even an 18V cordless drill is no match for it's corded big brother.  The added handle helps with stability when mixing a very dense tile adhesive.

3817	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	this saw was added to the other skil saws that I have in my collection.  a little heavy but it cuts through the 6 x 6 posts without a problem.
The plane seems pretty good now. I'm still working to find the right tension on the clamp; too little and it moves during use, shifting the blade laterally and altering the cut; too much and the vertical adjustment screw turns only with much force.
1970	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Speed-bloc is very well built and much quieter than ordinary palm sanders.  It does an excellent job and due to it's lower than normal vibration, doesn't put your hand to sleep in the process.  This machine is comfortable to grip and the on/off switch is conveniently located.  Changing paper is quick and easy (with or without the little tool they provide).  The Speed-bloc is an excellent old design that Porter-Cable was smart enough to leave alone.
Of course, for moderate to serious stock removal, get out the larger router.
Otherwise the stand assembled fine.  There is a misprint in the directions, it mentions the user having to drill 7/16" holes but there are actually only eighteen; four for each corner bracket and then two for the caster wheel.  There are twenty overall but the two foot holes are 5/16".
4th, the insert rings don't sit flush to the table, they are a tad short. This only causes a problem with very short work pieces and larger bits.
  Cuts bevel nicely once set. Stock blade works well. Better, smoother result with better blade.
9051	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Solid product and worth the money

4237	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This set comes nicely packaged (could have a better case) with good instructions and is quality, It makes beautiful cuts, however, I am reluctant to give it a full 5 stars because on softer woods and plywood, at lower speeds, it does chip/splinter, somewhat,(it says chip free). If you have a good motor on your saw with some good rpm's you should get no splintering (My old motor has beed rebuilt 2 times). In my opinon If you want a good dado for your money this is the one.
Coverage is decent (fine for a novel but if you are reading a coffee table type book, you'll have to move the light around the page as you read).
I'll still use dowels where appropriate, but never for edge joining again.
5829	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this thing.  No complaints, AND it's price is VERY competitive.  I initially set it up with a large Craftsman 3 1/4 HP router.  I had no isses fitting it in the cabinet (I bought mine in Feb. 2004, and I believe they had increased the interior height by that point...don't quote me on that).  I've used it for the standard edging applications and also for edge jointing.  It actually works quite well for edge jointing!!!  It takes some practice setting it up, but I used Digital Calipers to measure variances, and then move the in or out-feed fence accordingly.  Once you get a method, it's only a 5 minute set-up.  Not having a long bed makes jointing trickier, but hey, it's a router table.  It is no jointer, but for the time being it is allowing me to get by without a jointer (that'll be my next purchase).
6482	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a good small ratchet clamp FOR CERTAIN THINGS. It works on flat things, but it doesn't do well on any thing that's round or curved. The wobble-head ends make it want to slip off the project too easy. It seems like all clamps now days have "wiggly" ends. Rigid ends would be preferred on most of my projects. In fairness to this clamp, it DOES  do what I got it for VERY well. I needed it to squeeze the lock on a  cam-lock cinch strap .
An excellent to add quick change capability to any older model drills.

4466	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the first time I am commenting on someone else' comment. John Wendt made some excellent suggestions. I, too, have planed a lot of board feet and his suggestions (except wetting the wood) are what I have been doing for years. The only other suggestion is that you wax or lubricate the table often.  This, too, puts less strain on the machine and does a better job of planing. I use good quality car wax but there are other products available. I am going to try the trick of wetting hardwoods. It makes sense. I have a jointer and many other woodworking tools with blades that need to be sharpened. If I had my way there would be a federal law requiring tool manufacturers to make machines with the same blade setup as this Delta planer. I have wasted a lot of time installing and aligning blades and it is such sweet relief to just pop the blades in this tool and move on to woodworking. A final thing about this Delta planer. I have had it 16 years and it won't wear out. I have replaced the rollers once. It is a great tool and Delta does a good job producing very sharp blades that are easy to install.
This blade broke after about 10 minutes.  And it was probably less than 5 minutes of actual cutting.  The job at hand required trimming a stack of 3/8 x 1/8 plastic strips to length.
3822	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Fit my Delta air cleaner just fine.  Built well and look to get a good life out of it.
Considering my back injury, I've decided to stay with the Jr. instead of also buying the larger, full-sized Gatemouth, if for no other reason that it forces me to be practical in how much weight I lug around in that thing.  When a relative asks me to help them with a project, I can easily fit everything I'll need.  But if I had the full-sized Gatemouth, I would easily start packing tons of tools that I'd never need for that project.  So even though the Jr. can fit a magnitude of tools in it, it still keeps me grounded in what I take.  And it has become the primary way I carry my tools away from my big tool chest.
8482	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	great product
4600	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Worked well.  I'm still working through the kinks on using it with my saw and fence.
3678	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The sander arrived extremely well packaged.  It does what a belt sander is supposed to do and it does it well.  It handles well and is easy to control.  Belt changes couldn't be any easier and it is easy on belts.  I have another sander with a small front roller and it eats up belts well before the grit is worn out.  Belts are staying centered without constant adjustment.  I've only had it a short time so I cannot comment on its' durability.  But it looks and feels like a rugged tool should.  The motor is strong and does not bog down under heavy load.  I use it with a vacuum attachment and the top dust port turns out to be an added bonus.  The hose never gets in the way.  My two other sanders both have side ports and the hose is always in the way.  For the money, this is the best sander available.
When I opened the box I thought "whoa! They sent me a 3/8" drill by mistake."  Well, it was actually the 1/2" drill but in what I'm used to as a 3/8" 'form factor.'  I inserted the same 1.25" fostner bit and was amazed at how much torque this drill had. The Craftsman was struggling to drill a hole in 2 mins whereas this guy was blowing through a hole in 30 seconds or less.
* As cheap as they feel, the handles are adjustable and can be placed in 3 fixed positions. I like that more than I hate that they feel cheap.
My radial saw was retired by this beaut.
3441	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The clamp worked just like a clamp should.  It is very easy to set up and move to and from either side of the saw.  The only fault is that it would be nice if it were just a little bit taller so that it would be easier to swing out of the way over the fence without having to move the fence.

.
  I will say that it appears to be well built and would be fine IF  IT FIT MY SAW
I bought this primarily to run down (exhaust) NiCad batteries and recharge them to keep them in good shape.  My usage is highly erratic, and batteries sitting around slowly lose their charge and their ability to be recharged fully.
EDIT: After using the saw very heavily the last month I have noticed a couple short-comings, both minor and easily remedied. The foot plate has a plastic cover intended to prevent marring your cut surface, however it doesn't seem to fit very well. Most things I jig will be sanded or painted, so I removed the plastic cover. The dust collector doesn't seem to fit very well. I simply snugged a small screw up against the collector to hold it in place.


7395	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had the privilege of working with this table in my best friend's shop.  It's sturdy to say the least, and heavy.

6611	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What can I say, the perfect product, received quickly.  I ordered this for the new router table I was just finishing and the instructions made the installation very easy.  I am very happy with the product and the quick delivery.
2821	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a solid piece of gear.  Sturdy, stout and works well just not enough adjustment to earn five stars.  For example, when you place the light on a flat surface, you cannot angle the light beam in a downward angle without using a shim to tilt the base.  Other than that, it is solid gear but the MSRP is too high for what it delivers.

2755	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The feature I like the most on this guide is the fine adjustment knob.  It works very well for lining up the cut.  It is tricky balancing the router on the edge of a 3/4" board when cutting mortises so I built a jig with a slot for the guide to slide in and it works effortlessly.  Have not tried the dust collector.  I can recommend it to others.
2422	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price.
8357	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well balanced and great for around the house. Easy on the wrists and hands-arthritis. A welcome addition to my toolbox.

WITHit provided a clip light for evaluation and review.
As you can probably tell, I'm  convinced the uniguard adds considerably to the safety of my table saw.  And, if for no other reason than I spent a chunk of change to get it, I'll  be using it every time I turn on the saw.
8767	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Worked like a champ!
3879	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The first one I had to send back as the Angle Plate was crooked and no way to adjust it straight, and the cut was not centered on a 3/4" piece of wood. Amazon immediately shipped out another and gave me a prepaid UPS label to return the defective one. The new one had no defects and worked as it should. I only gave it 4 stars because the whole unit is not "polished" in its construction. Its ever so slightly on the "crude" side. Crude may be slightly harsh, but I cant think of another word for it. If it didn't work as it should, I would have returned it for a refund. Oh !!, one other thing is the dust bag works perfectly. Dust bags are usually useless. Not this one. Catches every bit of dust and shavings.
2476	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This stand is perfect for the Dewalt Scroll Saw. I was debating building my own stand because I always worry that these simple metal ones are going to be wobbly. I was pretty impressed with this one, however. It took longer than I was expecting to set it up but the instructions are very easy to follow and everything went together pretty easily. After setting the saw on, bolting it down, and tightening all of the bolts, this thing is very sturdy. I can easily drag it across my shop floor without any worries of it falling apart. The main drawback is that there's no storage anywhere for blades, tools, or anything else but that's pretty common with these types of stands.

7096	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nice set of unit shears this pair replace an old set of kett I had for 15 years cant go wrong
Now that it's assembled, no complaints. It's a solid build and a good weight--heavy enough not to slide around but light enough to be moderately portable. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the rigidity of the plate, but I don't expect it to warp. And unlike Bosch (who doesn't even sell blank drillable plates for their tables!),  it accepts my router without customization (Dewalt 621). Assembly is simple enough IF you have a manual, IF you have the requisite parts, and IF it's pre-drilled properly.

9362	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a good durable hose, that is to say, it is exactly what you would expect. It does not tangle but be aware that it may twist or kink, which can be frustrating. Make sure you lay it out before attaching it to air or else it becomes difficult to work with. The 1/4 inch connectors are pretty standard and allow for connectors to screw on as one would hope and expect. This hose will probably not change your world, unless you are using one of those cheap plastic coil hoses, in which case it might.

I don't need perfection so I called it good enough.

Dust collection is practically non existent unless you connect a shop vacuum to the unit in which case you will not get any external dust.  All the biscuit joiners (and for that matter all woodworking machinery) will have dust problems if you decide to use the built-in collection mechanisms.

The reason I bought this adjustable fence is to cut mortises on a home made jig. The router registers against a guide block using an attached fence mounted on the plunge base. Prior to, all fence adjustments were eyeball and unpredictable.

5034	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had a Freud blade on my table saw previously and thought I was pleased with the cut.  I saw this blade demonstrated at a wood show...cross cuts, rip cuts, etc.  The surface of everything I have cut since I purchased this is as smooth as a 220 grit sanded surface.  Plywood, pine, birch, and oak all have been tackled with no sign of dulling.  The saw runs with less stress and cuts are made faster.  The money spent, is recouped on the first project you do in time saved not sanding.  An example was I could go from a rip cut on plywood and immediately apply veneer without sanding.
7984	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I like this stand better than others I've used just due to the fact of the ladder design which catches the wood when you cut it.  The stand is a bit heavy compared with others but the big pneumatic wheels help quite a bit with that.  Also the ability to move it around on the job site by yourself is quite handy.  I just use it with the saw sitting on it, I do keep some small Bessey clamps on it to clamp the tool down if you prefer.  Works great with my planer as well.

The pad is softer than older models for sure. Care should be exercised in the sanding of narrower surfaces i.e. cabinet door and face frame stiles and rails, so as not to distort, or round them over.



4418	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought one of these ~ 3 yrs ago when I was just starting out with hand planes. About 30 wooden and iron planes later, I really like this one. It definitely requires tuning up properly, but once it's brought into shape it works very well. As a rookie this plane frustrated me, but as I learned what was important about tuning them, this plane performed better and better. The stock blade works just fine when properly sharpened, and the lateral adjustment works fine, as does the blade depth adjustment. I use this higher bedded (21) block on smaller edgee and faces to reduce tearout vs a 12 block for end grain.

Router plate (with router) can easily and quickly be removed and replaced -- 2 screws secure it to the table top. Plate rests on 8 set-screws that you pre-position and adjust to flush with the table top, and thereafter the plate should remain there. If not, fine adjustments are easy and quick, with or without your router hanging from the plate. BenchDog made this part -- keeping a level and smooth, snag free working surface -- easy, a nice design.
5510	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time. The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site. I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too. The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly. The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well. The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing. It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use. Those are the good points. There are a few points of contention which I have. The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure. The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so. This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant. The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned. Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance. I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use. Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.

3830	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Always valued my 10-year old D-handle Porter Cable D-handle router, kept it carefully and was always aware of the long cord.  I was especially careful about the cord and other objects when setting it down after running it since you can't just set the winding down router on its head because of the bump of short connector cord.  Unfortunately when I loaned it to a framer to rabbet wood siding ends the original cord got shredded. During production haste he wasn't as careful as you need to be. Didn't say anything because he worked so well but was not practiced with the quirk of the tool.  This replacement handle still fits same as the original and makes the router new again. The framer probably wants one of his own now too.

I use this sander two ways:  (1) freehanding on jobs like sanding my porch floor and (2) laid on its right-hand side on a little homemade base with a fence.  With the base, I can do detailed sanding/shaping to lines.  I bought the sander to sand my porch floor, but since then have used it exclusively and extensively for sanding shapes, e.g., Pinewood Derby race cars.  Belt changes are easy, tracking is easy to set and stable, and the dust bag works pretty well too.  This is a solid and well made tool.  Ear protection is a must.

7866	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm no tradesman and my use of it is not daily, but possibly weekly. However from my point of  view it is a great hammer with a good  comfortable  feel,  shock absorbing construction, and  good head that has  no deformation even with continued use of driving 4" steel nails into  Australian hardwood! It will be interesting to see how long the leather handle lasts, but so far I have no hesitation  recommending it.
The larger clamping-surface and precision-machined arbor-hole reduce chance for misalignment on the arbor.
6684	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I would give this 5 stars except the hole sizes were not engraved on the side as per the description.  I contacted the company and they said they no longer engrave the holes sizes to save money.  I told them they need to change the description.  Even the package it arrived in said the hole sizes are engraved.  I had to put tape on the sides and mark the sizes.
Its very easy to use.  Theres a little purple button on top of the light that simply clicks on or off.  The stalk is very easy to direct and aim, and gives more than enough light to read a book at night without bothering a partner.
4) The paper changing tool is something you do NOT want to misplace.  Zip tie it to your power cord.

6605	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This router plate is awesome, far more than I expected.  The router base plate has all the insert rings attached, they are stable and easy to configure, there are adjustment screws to level the plate and unique locking tabs in the corners. It looks serious and I love owning it. I have installed it, used it and am proud of it. I got 2 of them.  I am learning the Bob Rosendahl method ( PBS tv ) This plate is not screwed to the table top, it lifts out for bit changes and height adjustments. I can't compare it with other plates, I have always made my own from Lexan,  I ran out of Lexan, did not buy any more, it is too expensive. If a woodworker at any level needs a decent router plate, try the Roussea.
If that wasn't bad enough, now I can't even get it to turn off. It is supposed to have 3 modes, bright (both lights on) regular (one light on) and off. Well after using a grand total of 3 whole times, mine will only switch between one light or two lights on, it won't turn off. I have to pull the batteries out to turn it off. It's turned into way too big of an inconvenience for me to keep this. I'm returning it and getting something else.

I have a very small shop and have to cut sheet goods outside, under the carport, before I can get them into my basement shop. I've always had to cut my piece's oversized and then trim them on the table saw to get nice finished edges, but this blade gives me a nice finished edge without the extra steps. I have used it on Oak veneer ply and melamine sheets and the chip out is very, very minimal and stalling and binding are non existant. I understand that the teflon coated version of this blade is even better. I find that hard to believe as this little blade is simply amazing. This is the third Freud saw blade I have purchased and they all perform beyond my expectations. I also use Freud blades on my table saw and miter saw. I highly recommend this blade to anyone needing nice cuts with a small saw.

  While my router was out getting fixed under warranty I needed a 3hp router to continue with my projects and decided on a Bosch and I am happy I did.  I will write a review for it soon, but it is smoother, quieter (just a little), and has some great features for a plunge router this size.  My porter cable does run better since I have gotten it back from the service department at my local pc repair shop, but since I have gotten the Bosch I only run panel bits on it not the PC.

4876	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've used this joiner on various projects over the last couple years, finding it functional and easy to use, but when I recently put it through some considerable work I was seriously impressed. I just made around 400 slots in order to build a half dozen chopping boards. It cut through both jatoba (Brazilian cherrywood) and maple like butter, making clean, consistent, and accurate slots. The blade is very high quality. The dual rack-and-pinion fence is very accurate, easily adjustable, and stays where you set it cut after cut. The gauge is easy to read, a plus when your protective eyewear is covered in sawdust. The preset stops make it easy to choose the proper slot size too.
When you come to put it together you may find your jaws don't line up properly. This may be because you have installed the plastic dogs that lock the jaws to the frame back-to-front. It's easy to do. Turn 'em around and everything will line up just fine.

I choose the 25W ones because the 40W ones are damn bright.  As some reviewers have noted you have to be careful not to touch the glass as I believe the grease/dirt from your hands reduces some of the life of the bulb, maybe?  Either way doesn't take much to use a toilet paper "square" and avoid touching the bulb when you insert it in.  For use so far (its bee maybe 2 weeks) they are working fine and give enough light that we feel it was a  good purchase.  Good luck!

The only negative about the Freud set is that the spacers are not marked and it's extremely hard to tell the difference between two spacers that are close in size.  I realize that Freud may not have wanted to stamp them because a stamp might have changed the thickness in the area of the stamp, but the sizes could have been etched on.
I would not recommend anyone spend the money on these.

4019	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This was a GREAT purchase!  I almost went cheap and thought about buying a Harbor Freight cut off saw, but I looked at a few reviews and realized my time is worth more than it takes to buy and return a bad tool.  So, spending 3 times as much, I went for the Makita.  So, cudos to Amazon, it arrived in two days in perfect condition.  Unboxing, found it drop dead simple to use.  Went to work today making 25 cuts in cold rolled steel channel material to build a brew stand for my son-in-law.  Based on the reviews I went very slow for the first dozen cuts, then started to push a bit harder.  Much to my surprise the cutting started to go much, much faster.  There was more burring of material, but for the dramatic increase in speed it was well worth it.  When done, I had only used an inch or so of blade material.  All the cuts were perfect, 90 degrees.  Oh, I had it plugged into a powerstrip that measured AMPs and when pushing hard we were bouncing between 16 and 20 amps, so if you are running on a 15amp service you may need to go easy.  All in All a GREAT purchase.  I'm sure this tool will give me decades of great service.
So today I went to the local Woodcraft store, bit the bullet, and bought the Woodriver version.

Really, once you start to use this set. Freud makes it simple even with shims U can tell its well thought out and put together tool. I would have to say the only improvement, thus far is the case it comes ion could be little less generic in design, but then again its not bad and makes the set more affodable.

Furthermore, my attmpt at hanging the upper arm from the rafters while tigtening the bolt 1/4" turn at a time was...uhh...nearly very dangerous.  I am glad I made the purchase, but in the future would love to have known that I needed allen keys, and a crescent wrench set and someone to hold the upper arm while I tightened the nut.  This thing is rock-solid, and makes resawing 12" quite the pleasure.

I use it nightly.
Bad:  The jig arrived with the center dowel guide (black part in the middle) loose.  I did not know that, and hole wiggled.  I had to tighten up the jig with an allen wrench to make it usable.  This product should have gone through quality check before sending out in this incomplete condition.

When I bought it I actually put some stain on it to make it look used.....then 25 years later and after it being well used overt the last 15 i bought a new one.  Interestingly, I bought some parts for the Workmate 85 that I have had for so long and they fit very nicely.. so the design concept is still being used.  The only real complaint (if you call it that) is that I liked the "dual" vise operation as opposed to the now "one way" movement of the new table vice.  I like the size or the table surface area and the three slats for standing some wood on end for sanding and examination.  All in all, this is one of those tools I take for granted as to its usefullness.. I would recommend if you are a little cramped for space and need some mobility.
Great product.

  I can't give it 5 stars because it has some drawbacks. Trigger variable speed would be nice because starting a 4 inch hole saw can become a bit brutal and hairy if you don't hold the drill so it will torque away from you shoud the bit become jammed. It's all or none, in or out. But I do suppose a variable trigger would sacrifice some long-term reliablility. Secondly, due to its design I cant get it into as close of quarters as I like, but I see that there is now a Dewalt available with a design that is closer.

It comes with an adapter but that doesn't fix the issue either. My advice to all is to go online to DEWALT.COM and find the exact part number; don't rely on the term 'universal' because you might be disappointed.
It is very bright and you can use one or two lights. It is feather light so it doesn't weigh down the book.
It worked well on 4" to 10" stumps in my yard. That is not to say you can't grind larger stumps, but it would take a while and you get a little tired kneeling down in front of your stumps. I used a 7" grinder and it had plenty of power. I got a smaller lancelot and run both of them in tandem on the same grinder and it grinds stumps more effectifely. King Arthur recommends this, and it is shown in the documentation. This thing could be dangerous in the wrong hands.

2162	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this saw expecting it to replace my radial arm saw.  I discovered a manufacturing defect after using the saw.  The sliding rails are not aligned with the saw blade.  Whenever, I used the slide feature for boards wider than 4", I'd get chipout and/or burned edges on the wood. I reported the problem to DeWAlt and they suggested that I take the saw to one of their authorized repair centers for evaluation.  After 3 weeks and 3 trips to the repair center they decided there was no way to adjust for this problem.  The manager said he would recomend to DeWalt that it was a manufacturing defect because the yoke was machined inproperly and see if they would pay to repair the defect.  Guess what?  Not a word from the repair center or from DeWalt.  I'll never again buy anything with the DeWalt name on it and if you are considering this saw look further. If you are gong to use this saw for anythig other than cutting 2x4 for home construction you won't be happy with this saw.
6742	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My usual clamps are Bessey but I have several sets of Quick Grips which are very handy.  The entire line of quick Grips are great for being able to quickly apply clamping pressure while holding the work piece in place with one hand and working this clamp with the other. Quite often I use there to hold things in place before applying the sturdier Bessey clamps, but more and more I am finding these (quick clamps) are sufficient.  Irwin makes 4 different families of One-Handed Bar Clamps that basically differ in strength and robustness.  Be careful of over tightening the lighter duty ones as this will result in a sprung clamp that will lose its ability to hold pressure (it will slip).  This has happened to me with several Irwin bar clamps and they had to be tossed.  NOTE: I have yet to break aSL300 or XP600 series clamp under normal conditions. In testing (repeatedly clamping at different lengths applying as much trigger pressure as I could) I was able to eventually get an SL300 to slip at different points along the bar.  However, this was only after a lot of this abuse.  The XP600 never failed. But as I said, it was easy to over tighten and cause failure in the QG150 and Mini Bar series.

9259	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Compared to the hose that came with my compressor, this is ridiculously higher-quality.  yet to be determined, but it seems like this will easily last a lifetime of occasional use.  And it just feels nice - let's be honest that's important too.

The first thing I did after I unpacked the 7518 was to set it up to measure the Total Indicated Runout (TIR) of both the spindle and the collets.  I was surprised to find a runout of 0.0015" on the spindle, which IMO, is not acceptable.  I was even more shocked when I measured the runout of bit shanks held by the collets.  Bits held in the 1/2" collet had TIR ranging from 0.006" to 0.012".  Bits held in the 1/4" collet had TIR ranging from 0.002" to 0.005".  Again, this is not acceptable IMO.  The problem with excessive runout is that at the speeds these motors turn, it produces vibrations that can make the router difficult to control, noisy and cause the bearings to fail prematurely.  It can also cause bit breakage if the TIR is 10% or more of the bit diameter.
8459	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a really well constructed tool.  Design quality and craftmanship are all well spoken for with this unit.  The accuracy and overall utility this tool provides is astonishing.  But it has one crucial flaw...Just one and previous reviewers have addressed this so please excuse the redundency.  This unit should be able to manually set and store the spring angle of your molding.  Molding spring angle doesn't change!  Why does this tool require that we either measure it each time or open the legs to the spring angle?  This is nerve racking as this unit is acurate to 0.1 degrees and it is difficult to set the legs to a reading of exactly 45.0 or 38.0 degrees.  I mean you get 45.1 or 44.8 back and forth until you get it set to 45.0...What needless pain.  If you know your moldings spring angle then you should just be able to set it (via the buttons) and set it once!  Sometimes I think that the design engineers (they did a great job for the most part) lack the experience of practical application.  This leads to lack of forsite and ultimately the exclusion of a simple and needed feature of manually setting and storing the spring angle.  Oh well, i guess we just cant have perfection.  They came real close though...
4243	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws.  I was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy.  I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw, disconnected the bolt, and lowered it to the floor.  After that, the installation goes very easy and straightforward.  Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.
2023	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Tough motor and casing, but a small bump can tweak the base out of alignment. If you're wanting to use a clamped straight edge as a guide, you'll have to measure to make sure the base isn't tweaked, then you'll have to measure an offset of 1 5/16" to one side, or 3 21/32" on the other. Come on -- what's wrong with 1.5 or 3.5?  Who the heck designed this base anyway. A mixed bag for a lot of bucks.

3294	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've had this saw for over six months now and am extremely satisfied.  It's very accurate, easy to adjust and is particularly good for cutting crown molding.  The blade which comes with the saw is OK for basic stuff, but has excessive tearout.  For fine work you'll need a good 80 tooth blade. It's a little awkward for a left-hander at first, but easy to adapt to.  The biggest complaint is the dust extraction - the dust bag is almost useless, and hooking a vacuum to the dust port makes no difference:  dust shoots straight out the back, hits the frame and disperses in a huge cloud.  This makes it impossible to use in a customer's home; if it's a row house, finding a safe, convenient outdoor spot for it can be tricky.  Wintertime complicates matters.  One reviewer said, so what if it takes an extra hour to clean up - it's a terrific saw.  Well, it is a terrific saw, but time is money.

They were the post form type, and it made the whole job much easier cutting out sink holes from the top (no chips at all). Avoids flipping over a counter after cutting a large sink hole in the middle. Also it's easier to mark out on the top side. I used 3/4 plywood under the laminate counter, so the overall thickness where the holes were cut was 1 -1/2 inches.
Very Satisfied!!

8671	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I was given a high recommendation for Hitachi power tools by a construction veteran, so I purchased one. The compressor is still fairly new and seems to provide excellent power for framing guns, finishing nailers, and hoppers. However, I am not incredibly impressed with this compressors ability to start. I realize during the cold winter mornings (not too cold in the San Francisco bay area), that some compressors require an empty tank to kick over, but this is getting a little ridiculous. On a 45 degree morning I don't even try to kick over the tank before making sure it is decompressed completely, and during the middle of the day I still have to, on a not-so-rare occasion, pull the pressure release valve. This isn't a huge problem, but a noticable flaw. I have seen on another review that a Smart Start inlet filter can be purchased to cure this problem, but it's annoying that you need to buy new parts to cure problems on a new compressor.

7591	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	It surprised me that my new Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw didn't come with a rip fence.  I mean, every carpenter needs this essential accessory.  But I guess this all goes to achieving the right price point to be competitive.  So I ordered the only rip fence Milwaukee offers for this saw.  The calibration markings are pretty good, it is strong enough, and the range of extension (how large a rip you can make) is about average.  The annoying thing is that it doens't fit very well.  When you tighten the thumb screw to secure it in position for a specific size rip, three things happen.  The action of the thumb screw against the calibrated shaft causes the adjustment to change slightly as you tighten it, so you always have to double check visually and do a check-cut before starting the rip.  Most carpenters will do this as a matter of course.  But the thumb screw also leaves little dimples in the shaft that make repeated adjustments of the same or similar size somewhat difficult because the tip of the thumb screw tries to home in on previous dimples.  And third, the calibrated shaft cocks slightly, so the guide (that short part of the "T" that rides against the wood) isn't level, but at an angle of about ten to fifteen degrees.  Depending on how you support the work piece, this angled guide can get caught and trip up your cut.  The circular saw itself is such a fine piece of equipment that this misfitting accessory is very disappointing.  Milwaukee ought to fix this; it ain't rocket science.  Nonetheless, with a lot of care, you can make it work.
3742	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This base was advertised for the 20-729--732  table (cabinet saws)  IT DOES NOT FIT THESES  SAWS!!!!  if you need the base for this saw order the Delta 50-729 base + extension for longer rails if needed.

I had this "working like a dream" for about a year when setting up for cabinet door work it "grunted" and died.  Heck, I thought I had popped a breaker, or a "re-set," or a part that could be replaced.  WRONG, if THIS router "grunts" it fries the speed control module.  They charge about $80 for the module!  But heck, since I ALREADY have "modified" this router to use in my table, I "try" to buy the module.....  GOOD LUCK!  After 2 months of dealing with a "hitachi distributor," I finally told them to stick the order and bought a Milwaukee.  I "learned" a lesson, IF I find anything about half the price of all competitors, I probably should BUY TWO so that I can "fix" it when it breaks.

- The depth-stop system is shady.  If you press a little harder than "last time", the saw will bow down a little more.  It's very inconsistent.  Don't depend on it for a "real" dado.  That said, it is very convenient if ultra-consistent depth isn't important for a given task.

I worked (OK, DIY) with a sidewinder for years, but I should have just paid the extra money and gotten the Skil 77.  I expect that mine will be used by my grandson.  If you are undertaking any major projects involving sawing a lot of 2-by-whatever lumber, or thicker plywood, like a room addition or deck, this is a highly recommended purchase.  As a DIYer, if you get out the saw over, say, 15 times a year, you will probably get your money's worth out of the saw.  If you only use a saw a few times a year, it's probably more than you need.  For a DIYer, you should be aware that this unit weighs more than the less expensive consumer saws you may have used before, and some practice with scrap is advisable.  And check and keep the oil level up - that's the only real care needed for what is otherwise almost indestructible.

2223	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had this light for years and years, came in a combo kit. I have never had any trouble with it. You do have to balance it when you extend the light out away from the battery. I manage that by how I bend the neck to support the light. If I need to carry it as a flashlight, I attach the light to the magnetic base and use the neck as a handle. My ancient version is not as bright as the newer LEDs, or fluorescents, but it makes up for it in versatility! I can hang it by the neck, twist it around a pole, and aim the light where I want it. A friend has one that he used for hours on a job, switched batteries multiple times. The lens melted. I contacted DeWalt to get a replacement lens as a Christmas present for him (he really missed having that light). DeWalt got all excited about it, said they had never had one melt like that. I gave them all the specifics and sent them the lens. They sent a new one and my friend was elated! A note: my friend did not have it anywhere near a heat source when it melted. I never heard back from DeWalt on what they thought happened, but they sure stood behind their product!! When I buy power tools, I always go for the yellow and black! If you want versatility in a light, this one will not disappoint!

I'm editing my review to warn everyone that the Uniguard will prevent you from fully opening your motor cover.  If you have a right tilt unisaw with the metal box-shaped motor cover you'll find that it can't swing open more than about 6 inches before it hits the uniguard's steel pipe.  It opens far enough to get a vacuum hose in for cleaning or for one arm to reach in to feel around for that arbor nut you dropped inside ;) but it won't open all the way after you install this guard.

I initially ordered a set of ten about six months ago and have gone through 3 or 4 since ordering them (in 8 light fixtures)...so I just ordered two more ten-packs just in case this price ever goes up.  Even better, they also fit in the two light fixtures on the bottom of my built-in microwave.

3382	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great idea by DeWalt. However, they are cumbersome to put on and the angles needed tweeking to get them straight. These will give you a false sense of security, though. I say that because I bought finger jointed paintable pine mouldings at a big-box store and all the dimensions were not perfectly the same from board to board (different lots and manufacturers? Dunno). But based on my assumptions, I was relying on the stops and not checking closely enough and ended up with troubles.

1500	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Installed these in place of 20 watt halogen on outside landscape lights and found that they gave off more light similar to a 35 watt.  The light color has a slight green hue and doesn't provide a full light hue.  Has a kind of shaded or dull light.  Not as alive or bright as some other l leds  I have bought and not as clear as halogens.  I will probably keep them but won't purchase them again.
The bottom of the light is also the battery compartment, and it takes inexpensive batteries, CR2032, which are easily found here on Amazon or most local stores. (Ive even found them at dollar stores.)

5130	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've had my Delta 50-850 for a few years.  It worked pretty well until I moved into my new shop.  I attached it to my metal ductwork and it just doesn't have the power I now need.  Also, I bought a remote transmitter which saves alot of time going back and forth to the machine.  The only problem is that when the remote is pushed, about half the time the breaker trips. Because of the problems I'm having, I've just purchased a new Oneida Dust Gorilla.  It's a cyclone dust collector and hopefully will have the power I need.
4729	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've had this Dewalt plate joiner for several years and use it often for things like making shelving and for joining mitered corners on gates and doors. I find it to be decently made with adjustments that are simple to dial in. It will cut slots with consistent depth and alignment and the rack and pinion depth adjustment for the fence allows minute changes to be made for board thickness. The cut angle can also be precisely set anywhere from 0 to 90. The chip bag for this joiner generally seems to only be good for maybe two or three cuts before it becomes clogged with chips, so I will normally use a shop vac and 1" hose for dust collection. For me, the only minor issue with this joiner is that it doesn't also work for FF-size face frame biscuits, which could be useful for things like cabinet doors, but I see that there is now a smaller 3-1/16" diameter blade available from Amana that will supposedly give this Dewalt joiner that capability, so I am considering giving it a try. Overall, I've been very pleased with this tool and how well it has worked for my woodworking needs.
i will NOT recommend to any one
7937	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Wether you are doing furniture work or moulding installsalation, this hammer is for the finish nails that you will be using.
6798	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a great tool. Sure you can use a piece of scrap wood and a couple of clamps but it isn't as speedy. After I bought one and my father saw it...it became the next birthday gift. Same for my brother too. I've never experienced the "not square" problems some of the other posters have had. It always clamps tight and square. It's a real time saver.
2414	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the best saw of it's kind ever made.  I started carpenter work in 1957 and am still working and this one is the absolute best I have ever used.  Everything is as perfect as a saw can be; only fault is you must pay for it.  I have tried every professional saw in the past, until I got to this one.
9643	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It works like a extension should.
After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394-21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use.  My only other concern is the aluminum base plate, which flexes a bit under pressure.  If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5-star saw.  As is, it is still a great bargain - the only other saw I considered (a Makita with magnesium base plate) was $35 more at the local big box store.

These are well made and install easily.  I like this vendor better than some others -- I have sometimes received a batch of bulbs in a plastic bag and find some damaged in shipping.
4440	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Mine came without a flat bottom (so did my expensive Veritas). Flatten the bottom and sharpen and this is a fine block plane. Don't get me wrong - my Veritas is a much nicer tool with a much nicer blade but I keep this one adjusted differently and use it almost as much. In soft woods with a sharp blade the difference is not noticeable.
2946	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	We've been using these saws in our middle school wood shop for the last five years.  In that amount of time, I've lost track of how many times I've had these in for repairs.  It's more of a hobby saw that can not stand up to serious use.  In addition, one saw that we purchased, stopped working a week after we took it out of the box.
2149	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is clearly a very well built router.  The height adjustment is brilliant!  I have a rather noisy PC 690 router and was delighted to find that the PC 310P is much quieter.  The starting "kick" referred to in another review is definately there but not nearly as much as I expected.  For anyone considering a small router or laminate trimmer this is an excellent way to go!
2932	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	have owned this saw for close to 4 years and it has been excellent.  Very quiet, minimal vibration, reliable, and more than enough power.  If I earned my living cutting scroll saw items might have considered the $1,000 plus saws but I don't so they were never seriously in the running.  I believe in the law of diminishing returns and once you get to a certain level of quality and performance additional improvement gets very costly quickly.  That is the way I viewed the expensive saws; perhaps slightly better but not worth the cost.  As for comments about the blade hole being off center mine was dead on when I received it.  Out of curiosity I looked to see where my saw was made but it wasn't marked.  I don't have any problem with Asian manufactured products but there are some low quality manufacturers out there and frankly also here in US.  I would hope Dewalt is not lowering the quality of this otherwise excellent saw by going to the cheapest manufacturer they can find and then skipping quality control inspections.


Corrosion - Not a speck on mine after almost 4 years.  The steel parts are plated to resist rust.  The cast iron is not.  Maintenance is required, including emptying the water from the machine and allowing it to dry.  I use WD40 on the cast iron and on the steel too after a grinding session.  If you don't maintain the machine (that is, if you allow it to stay wet after use), of course it will rust eventually.
9559	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What I expected and it will work great.
2058	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this router to replace and older 1 1/2 hp Porter Cable router which I thought was great until I purchased this Porter-Cable 7518 3-1/4 HP Speedmatic 5-Speed Router, WOW what a difference in power it is night and day, I use to use a speed control to operate larger bits and the smaller router would bawg down but not this "Mac Daddy" it has speedmatic which increases power under load without making larger bits spin like crazy, I realize that it costs more but if you are a hobbyist like I am or even a proffesional this router is definately a good investment, my only complaint would be the two wrenches to tighten bits seems kind of old fashioned in this day and age
4328	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	High quality tool very happy with it.
2072	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Porter Cable 7518 is absolutely the best router available today. I use mine on my router table, and the variable speed option is priceless.  Now I can vary my speed based on the type wood used and router bit combination.  And the power of the 3 1/4 horsepower motor is exceptional.  Routes through hardwoods like butter and takes it easy on the soft woods. Thanx Porter Cable and Amazon.com


4827	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great belt sander. I had been using a much lighter duty 3" sander to do things like level flooring before installing hardwood - with the 3" sander it was a real pain and I'd burn through belts rather quickly.  Also the product removal was slow even with an aggressive grit, and I found myself always having to adjust the belt to keep it "true" and centered on the rollers.
The on/off  switch is on the back side of the head....it is a sliding switch NOT a pushbutton.
5152	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great design and works really well.  I wish it had come with some double sided tape to attach it to the floor, but easy to do myself.

The only downside is some tendonitis from overuse (but I can't stop using it, it's fun), and if you're buying outside the US it's ridiculously expensive. Not a problem for most of you I guess.
2194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	love it.  not as heavy duty as the 11 amp, but also not what i needed.  lots of positions for secondary handle.  comfortable, good torque without tearing up your forearm.  I mated this with Irwin Speedbor bits and it is a killer combo!  thumbs up.

2844	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After lengthy shopping for the lowest price on a set of replacement planer blades, I found that Amazon had the best price. These were genuine replacement parts so there was no sacrificing quality for price. The shipment arrived when I was told it would.
484	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It's a great little light that helps with a ton of tasks.  I'd buy it as a gift.  The flex arm is perfect and stays where you put it.  My only gripe is the clamp.  I've tried double stick tape to keep it in place but it always comes loose.  Still very good.
4633	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I researched "Plate Joiners," and "Biscuit Joiners" relatively thoroughly before pressing the "Place Order" button. This machine *does what it's intended for" better than much cheaper, and (maybe) more $pricey options. For my purposes, this machine is quite acceptable/adjustable. Much better QC in DEWALT Chinese mfg. plant than Chicago Electric's.
8074	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Beautifully crafted, a pleasure to work with.  Time saving tool that's accurate, and easily speeds up the process.  A pleasure to work with.  I'm a professional not a DIYer.  This is the go to tools for cutting treads.  Oak & maple treads are too expensive to screw up and labor is costly if you have to screw around doing trial and error templates.  Just buy it!
The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits, especially those included in the good sets, that require that size. Also, many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.
1736	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a very comfortable sander to use.  It isolates the vibration quite well from your hands which reduced my fatigue during use.  it is very well balanced too. I recommend this sander.  it's a pain to change the sandpaper but it works very well once you get it in there.
Within its limits, this tool does a very good job, and the current price at Amazon ($4.79) is very reasonable for a product that is so solid and well designed.  Although this clamp worked better than I expected, I wanted a little more reach, so I also purchased&nbsp;, which is a more solid, heavier duty item.
It comes with a chart to help you set the proper width but it's not perfectly accurate. I used it the other day to cut a dado for 3/4" plywood, which is less than 3/4" in thickness. I used the chart for 3/4" and it was a fraction too small. So you have to actually measure before you stack the blades on the arbor. But once you get the width set properly, you'll be rewarded with very flat bottom cuts and splinter free edges.
3614	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Milwaukee, again, has produced a superior product.  The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters, although I use it for a lot of different applications.  The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill.  It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise.  It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down.  Ever.  It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot.  In no way is it limited to tight quarters.
It's not the saw alignment.  It's dead on.  And the saw works fine with the original blade and it even works better than this with some of my worn out framing blades from my circular saws.

4116	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I usually use a router to make dado cuts, but there are some uses like lap joints that are better to do with a dado head.  The Freud 508 set is less expensive than Forrest's Dado King, but it got a good review in Fine Woodworking, so I ordered it.  It's been several years since I've used a dado set, and now I remember why -- setting up is a bit of a pain.  But...  I tried making lap joints once on a router and had to interrupt the work with a trip the emergency room for a few stitches.  To get reacquainted with dado sets, I made some 3/4" wide x 1/4" deep cuts with the Freud set in some scrap walnut, in melamine-clad particle board and in cherry plywood. The cuts  were perfectly smooth, with a perfectly flat profile and no tear-out at the exit.  Very impressive that it can handle such different materials.
8772	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Worth the money!  I replaced my $40 dollar combo square with the Starrett.  Starrett is a great  brand with great tools.  I love how smooth the square head works on the ruler.  the lettering is crisp and legible.  Don't settle for the cheaper squares if you are serious about precision!
6409	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good bond on everything I used it on.
The Separator will collect the large particles and some dust, allowing the smaller dust to be collected in the DC bag.  But don't wait for the garbage can to fill up before emptying it.  The fuller the can gets, the less area for the particles to drop, so empty the can about at half full.  When running my lathe or planer, that could be quite often.  BUT, it is easier than emptying the bag, OR sweeping them off the floor without a DC system.
573	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Don't expect it to last more than a few months.  It works nicely while it works but my first lasted about 6 months and the second has started to go after a couple of weeks.

As you tighten the screws, the plastic bends and gets cut up.  After just a few uses, it's all worn out.  When you try to slide this featherboard inside the miter slot, it bends and twists.  They have a sloppy fit inside a standard miter slot, which actually makes them dangerous, because they can slide around during a cut.
3569	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this sander primarily to strip paint of the bottom of my sailboat and it works great.  Vacuum dust collection is required by the marina and this works fine as well.  However, there will still be dust in the air and the combination of sander and vacuum is noisy so a good dust mask and ear plugs should be used.  I have been using the sander for 3 years and it has not given me any problems.  I use mostly 60 and 80 grit disks which make the tool moderately aggressive at removing paint, but not enough to mar the surface.  I also keep the variable speed setting at the highest level, so I have not found this feature very useful.  The only drawbacks are that it is a little heavy for overhead use and the cord/vacuum hose makes it a little cumbersome to maneuver.  If you are going to own just one sander, then this is the one to get.  It is more aggressive than the pad type sander so that it can be used for moderate paint removal, but can also be used for delicate finish work as well.
It lacks a clutch so I wouldn't use it to drive anything unless my other drills couldn't handle something but the variable speed trigger is responsive enough to make driving an option if that's ever needed.

I had several jobs to do including rounding a four-foot portion of the cabinet edge with a 3/8" roundover bit.  This edge has a molding sticking up just 1 1/4" inches away so only a router with a narrow base could do the job. Another constraint was that my 3/8" roundover bit is 1.26" in diameter.

Time will tell if the outer cover cracks and peels off in 3 years like those made in China. The Chinese hoses seem to use a thicker rubber that cracks easy when exposed to sun, cold or oils. The Goodyear hose seems to have a different outer covering.

6805	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this ladder so that I could clean the gutters on my house.  They are high, and a 40 footer is required.  The ladder is of great quality, very sturdy. It is heavy, and a bit of a challenge to carry around by myself, much-less to stand up against the house. Once it is vertical, it is tricky to move around to lean over, and care must be taken not to loose control.  If would really be best to have several guys to manhandle this ladder, and should not be attempted by one person.  I did use this ladder to cut a neighbor's tree, and it was very handy to be able to climb way up to get access to the top of the tree.  Did I ever clean the gutters? No. The ladder was plain too heavy for me to use it.  However, the ladder does come apart in 2 sections, and they can be used individually a bit more easily.

Most scroll saw web sites tell newbees not to use the spiral blades and I don't know why. I am not a newbee, but I'm not a professional either. I make basic craft things, and do not make the intricate fret work. The "New Spiral Blades" by Flying Dutchman, (# 5's)  go through my pine wood like butter and there is no need to  keep turning the wood either. I am not real good at making small turns with the regular blades.  With a blade that's twisted and can go in any direction, I have no trouble getting into tight areas. These blades have flat ends too, which make them real easy to install. (This saw takes only flat ended blades, no pin blades)

7360	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Just purchased this table combo and love it. The stand is super heavy duty. The table is flat and true. The insert plate is easy to get flush on all 4 corners. The fence is exactly 90 degrees to the table top. Micro-dot surface has low friction for easy travel over the router bit. Every thing went together with precision quality. I had a cheaper router table and had to fuss with it to get accuracy, decided to make the old one a work table and get a real router table. This is the trick. Kreg customer service is also very good. I bought this from my local Wood Craft store and the insert plate is the older style ( non-quick turn) I contacted Kreg and they are sending the most latest version in the mail. Could not ask for more. This router table exceeds my expectations in quality. I was a little disappointed the stand had " Made in Taiwan" on it( even though it is very high quality stand), but the rest of the table is made in USA, I believe? In the end this may be a little more than you want to spend but I can't stress the importance of true flat table top that has a 90 degree fence and how hard it is to get that in the low budget models. Get a Kreg you won't be disappointed, and you will be helping the US economy.

I have used it for about 16 doors so far and it is one sweet tool. Each door has come out perfect.

  It is now 2011 and I have owned this drill since 1998. It has given me great service. As a residential electrician and contractor is has made me quite a bit of money. The drill has cut well over an estimated 25,000 holes in 2x10 joists and 2x4 studs. It has performed beyond its design and ratings by powering 3- 1/2" self-feed bits through doubled 2x10 southern yellow pine. Mine has reverse and the mechanical variable speeds. The die cast angle housing and collar is superior to Milwaukee's version in that it won't come loose and twist on you. It's quite a little monster workhorse.
8291	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have been using for a few months on a Bosch 4100 table saw.  Most of time spent working with fir and redwood.  This set is an excellent value, it cuts very clean, including through knots without any shatter.  It's easy to set up and comes with all shims necessary for single-pass dados or rabbets in milled or rough lumber.
7802	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This is garbage!  I should have listened to the reviews on here.. It's cheap.  The build quality is bad, and it's just not big enough for larger pieces of work.  Typical crappy quality that we are seeing more and more of from guess where....
The price does hurt but I am hopeful that I won't ever buy another a mitre saw
Note that this model uses the same accessories as the 1613EVS. (they do not list them seperately). By the way Bosch, take a hint...please include the dust control adapter. Dust control is a health issue you should readily promote.
2) You can hold the outer barrel of the guide (it doesn't spin with the drill) so you can guide in long screws without the bit slipping off.

I'm right handed and always wondered why so many saws had the blade on the right side making it very difficult to see the blade when making a cut. Because of that I have always used a worm drive with the blade on the left. This saw is light, more compact, and much easier to handle than the worm drive. This 5-1/2" saw will now be my first choice.

I don't know whether to place responsibility for this problem with Craftsman or Freud, but as a buyer it seems like a little more up front information would be helpful.


8490	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This miter finder cannot find the simple miter for a 96 degree or even a 90 degree angle. Nor is it useful in the installation of crown moulding. The Bosch reps don't even know how to use their own product. We contacted several (3) all with different info NONE of which was accurate. It will find angles, but a protractor for less than a dollar will do that. We were also told ours did not work, so we bought a second one. Well it worked like the first!! Save your money.

But unfortunately, it won't fit the saw I needed this for, the DW716.  The fitting on this dust bag, and the dust outlet fitting on the DW716 are the same 1-5/8" O.D., meaning, the fitting on the bag won't go into or over the saw fitting.  The adapter is useless for this saw as well, as one side of the adapter is the exact same size as what's on the bag.  The only way the adapter could be used is if you turn the bag inside out, cut the zip-tie that holds the current fitting on, and replace it with this one, however, the current fitting is what has the wire supports that keep the bag's shape, so removing that fitting isn't an option.
925	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect replacement for my bathroom vanity lights. Even better was they were a fraction of the price of most other places! I have 10 lights now, so I don't expect I'll have to buy more---but when the time comes, I'll be ordering these again

3750	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind, they work great.  As for the stabilizer part, I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades, or at least I don't notice any  appreciable difference.  I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.


2202	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This scroll saw is great:
My only wish is that I could have got one in either (Freud) red, or DeWalt yellow. Either of those colors make it very clear DO NOT TOUCH HERE. I guess they recycle kitchen laminate - mine is a marbled beige. Not what I'd have chosen. But, while it would have been nice, I didn't expect any different. The listing was clear that the product could be any color, and so it was.
9841	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great
Kreg offers lots of lengths, different threads, specialty coatings and in various quantities. Obviously, it would be costly to buy a box of every variety to cover every possible use, so you do have to research and order appropriately.  I got the box of a thousand and used an amazing number of them, so get a bigger box than you think you will need  and you will have a nice collection of spares for those unplanned projects in the future.
I haven't tried every dado blade out there, but I feel comfortable saying that if I had to do it all over again, I would buy this again. How do you improve on the best. Hope this helps.

I made a much needed modification to the tables stock fence by removing and discarding the clumsy guard and adding a solid piece of 1X6 maple the full length of the table with slots cut in it and longer 2-1/2" bolts to allow the two piece split fence to attach in front of it if needed, but still slide normally. I made a half-moon cut out at the bottom center of the 1X6 large enough for up to 3-1/2" raised panel bit and to allow for dust collection. I found that this cut out in the solid fence also has the added benefit of acting like a concentrator nozzle, so dust collection at the cutter actually works reasonably well. With this setup, I can still slide a shim behind the outboard portion of the split fence for use as a jointer and the solid fence board is also removable in case I want to use the stock split fence as is. I also added a piece of 1/4" T-track so I can now more easily attach a vertical feather board as well.
3525	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love this drill, there not much else to say. The power is unbelievable, so be careful! Looked at several other brands, but this one was the best IMO for the money. It will last for the rest of my lifetime.
The etched satin chrome blade is much easier to read than a highly polished or stamped steel blade. The square slides smoothly and locks securely. The square head is forged steel, not cast aluminum or zinc. This is truly a tool that can last multiple lifetimes.
6517	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Smaller then I thought but has its uses. Good quality and hasn't broken yet!
 I bought this set as well. Why? Because when making kitchen cabinets, the raised panel bit that they provide with the set is too small for a large cabinet. (Unless you prefer that look) So I bought this set, to pick up the 3 1/2" panel raising bit. That requires a large opening of at least 3 5/8" on the bottom of your router, and the opening on your router table as well. The Bosch 1619EVS is even larger than that. The Fein RT-1800 allows for the the use of a 3 1/2" bit, but the casting prevents you from plunging a bit that size. Not really recommended, because you might accidently adjust it into the base. Their are others also, but most fixed base 2 HP routers won't accept such a large bit. So measure first.

7663	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Although I have an older version of this B&D work bench, I do have to say at this point that I like the way the bench part is on the older version verses this one. Kind of on the light side.....in my opinion. I do like the feature to where you can flip the bench up on one side in order to hold a larger product. I'll just have to see how it works out over time. Just seems to me it's not set up as well, (as far as heavy duty) as the older one is.

Oh, here it is-
3186	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'm getting exactly the performance from this tool as I expected. If you want a compact unit, this will do. If you need something with larger capacity, better get something bigger. Speed adjustment is very easy. The chuck is a bit sticky and I broke teeth off the chuck key right away. Maybe it was my fault, but I've used drill presses for years and never had this happen. I started using the other side of the key after this happened, and SNAP! it happened again. I'll get a quality key. BE CAREFUL!
9129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well, I had this tool for about a year without complaints.  I wouldn't use it as a production gun but is good for small jobs where it's a hassle to bring a compressor with hoses.  It does require a little more care than a ordinary nail gun but it makes up for it with convenience.  I give it 5 stars.
8583	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I use this mainly for framing.  I like the weight and balance of the hammer.  At 20oz it handles most framing needs.  Not an ideal hammer for "dirty" work, but I use my 160z general purpose hammer for that stuff.  Estwing makes a great hammer and this is no different.

Bottom line, I think this is one of the best products on the market considering the price, it's level of KISS engineering, portability, and the amount of labor that it can offset (even paying for itself on the first job), and lastly the obvious quality.

The end plate rivets holding the grip together are actually not rivets. They are part of the original forging and have been spun over into rivet heads to fasten the grip. (check out Estwing on How it's Made). The result is a firm grip with excellent control and just enough cushion to dampen the impact of the steel shaft. It feels like a high quality wooden handle and yet is absolutely unbreakable. I have a 12oz, a 16oz and a 20oz. The 16oz was my grandfather's. He bought it in 1928. The other two are youngsters,'58 and '62. They're all three still going strong. The 20oz is perfect for house framing and flooring. It has great balance and feel, so it's easy to swing it hard with accuracy. It's not a pneumatic nail gun but it's a great backup. I framed a few houses with it back in the day.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/25-Top-Tools-for-the-Apartment-Dweller/dp/1481808893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">25 Top Tools for the Apartment Dweller</a>

With the thin kerf Freud I tighten the arbor nut, turn the saw on, turn the saw off, and the blade spins on the arbor.  This is dangerous.  With the thick kerf the arbor nut stays tight but the stabilizer isn't needed with a thick kerf blade.  I'm returning this item.

The 310 is a small little horse of a router. It has micro adjustment and is exceptionaly accurate. It has none of the numerous flaws that plague the 7310 and the other "Rotozip" style trimmers. Against the advice of my cabinetmaker colleagues, I originally purchased a 7310 as my sole laminate trimmer, thinking I'd save a few bucks. I was so unimpressed with it and its inaccurate base and adjustment mechanism that I sidelined it for 1/8" roundover work and purchased a 310 instead. I now own three 310's and have them set up for my commonly needed tasks. One cabinetmaker in my shop has a dozen 310 trimmers. Now that's an enthusiastic fan!
DISAPOINTING single flaw, but a MAJOR flaw.

I tend to wind down at night reading OLD books that I don't want to clip something onto and weaken the binding, and this one will clip onto my bed covers, and the flexible neck lets me just point it at my book like a little lamp.  While the blue casing lights up, it isn't enough to be annoying or distracting.  I've been through several books with it, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet either.
417	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As stated by other reviewers, this little light illuminates both pages of a book. It works perfectly for reading after lights-out.

3765	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I did a lot of looking around at medium right angle drills. The drawbacks on the Dewalt is no variable speed, and no reversing. So it may be prone to stripping screws, and now way to reverse them out when they do. Ouch. For straight drill of holes it is great.
For maximum versatility, consider purchasing a 24 inch rule to go with your square (McMaster-Carr, $73). It is interchangeable with the 12 inch rule supplied with this kit. It allows extra measurement range and I use mine almost exclusively. You might also consider getting a smaller square, like a 6 inch. Experiment with your squares, and you'll be amazed at everything you can do with them. You can measure inside dimensions of cabinet openings, run parallel lines, and a million other things. Easily the most useful tool you'll ever own. What else can I say? Starrett is good old American quality built in Massachusetts. Yankee ingenuity at its best.

In the final analysis, I am not sure why anyone would buy this rather than just get a better saw in the first place.  The onyl reason I could think of would be to have a bigger table stand at home and be able to pick up the saw and go with it...I would just have two saws.  For me this was throwing good money after bad.

5551	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.  But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.  At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.  The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)  However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).  Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.  The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.  Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.

The stand was surprisingly heavy and assembled easily. A minor detail is that when the saw is mounted it seems to be a little top-heavy. I think that if you're clumsy like me and bump into it hard, it could go over. However, it doesn't seem in any imminent danger of falling. The light assembly is sturdy and mounts easily with two screws. It does need an extra outlet to plug into.

6266	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Milwaukee makes a good blade. The only complaint is the high cost of product.
- There is a chance the entire rig could topple over while unfolding the stand with a mounted saw, as the stand has to be tilted over on one end and held there so it doesn't fall over, while you lock the leg-spreader bar, then pull the whole assembly upright.  I haven't come close to dropping it (yet?), but if it fell over, the attached saw could be damaged.
Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!
4347	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Full disclosure: I'm a DeWalt guy.  Typical DeWalt tools work out of the box for me.  I own a DeWalt planer, miter saw, table saw, multiple sanders), but this one didn't fit the bill.

Then comes the Milwaukee 55 degree angle drill. Fine for additional leverage while drilling, but could be a problem for deeper access areas when making 90-degree applications. Especially important in crammed quarters, when you would have to swing the body out the additional 35 degrees to get a 90-degree angle.
I use it a lot for assembly / disassembly and it is perfect for the job, and with a chuck adapter light drilling.

Edger face set screws use either a flat  blade screwdriver, or a T-20 Torx bit (nice!), when adjusting the fence face (wide or narrow, depending on what you're edging or your particular bit). DeWalt seems to prefer Torx and Hex bits to screwdriver blades or Phillips, a feature I LIKE.
7642	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I find myself using this little tool all the time. It fits easily in my tool bucket and it is quite solid and sturdy. Great lever action and will rip up even the nails with the little heads on them. I also carry a flat bar, which is another indespensable tool, but this thing is nice to have due to the cat's paw digging action you can achieve to get out those embedded nails. If the nail is long, I find myself putting a piece of wood under the tool for additional prying action. All in all a great tool that will last and you can rely on.
  This hose comes in 3/8" which is the most popular size. The 1/4" hoses restrict air flow, which is especially important over a 50 foot run.
Makita really disappointed me with this one. I'm packing it up today and sending it back. I'm actually really puzzled how this saw got such great reviews, as I am normally in agreement with the majority of people. Maybe I just got lemon?
3245	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does a nice job.
Sorry, no chartruese but you do get a very nice, heavy, polished drill chuck attachment to show off to your friends or take down the neighbor's plastic, faded pink flamingo with the missing leg at about forty paces, gratis!  Apparently, their engineers have been locked away for the last decade and someone needs to get word to them that hex-end drill bits are no longer just a distant dream.
A great tool but like power tools should only be used by kids with direct supervision.

6075	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	First I want to say this is a sub $20 item. Anyone that complains is most likely comparing it to a product that's not even in the same category. Man my Ford Pinto really sucks. I'm going to one star review it because it doesn't keep up with a Lambo. With that said, after the addition of a $1 PVC elbow and a $1 amount of weather stripping, it seems to work great. The $50 model requires the addition of hoses and a 5 gal bucket as well so I won't include that in the overall costs to obtain 2 Stage Dust Collection. Quick note, the lid does NOT snap on but the suction will keep it in place for the most part. I'd buy this again and recommend it to a friend looking for budget 2 Stage. I wanted to stop dealing with a clogged shop vac filter as well as not break the bank. This accomplishes that.

7387	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was buying cheap made in China stuff and became frustrated with the quality.  Pony pipe clamps have been a quality tool in the shop for me for 35 years.  Handles are secure.  Easy to crank with material in the clamp.
6891	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Cannot say anything more than the name. First Class company and products as usual. Shouls have bought the aluminum units a long time ago and saved the  iron ones for home use.

I finally swapped out the 2x4 douglas fir for 1-1/2" square tubing.  After drilling it out, priming and painting, the metal was installed without issue.  I can say the base is far stronger now than it used to be and there is no flex when "popping" the stand up on its wheel to move it around.  As a bonus, semi-gloss Rust-Oleum paint blends in with the original Delta paint, giving the base a more factory made look.
So I searched Amazon & ordered a Wera K Rapidaptor that's top quality, same features, 1/3 shorter than the Dewalt, and they did not hide the length of the holder...2inches.  The line description beside the Wera holder is this: "Wera 889/4/1 K Rapidaptor Universal Bit Holder for 1/4" Hex Drives, 2in Long."  Everything is right up front. The Wera carries a higher price but you get higher quality, more compact length, more control & LESS wobble vs the Dewalt DW2505 & is well worth the few extra dollars.  Cannot recommend the 3in Dewalt DW2505.

4694	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Board Buddies [BBs] is a unique product and come in various configurations allowing clockwise, counter-clockwise, and free spin versions.  First, I confess I've only seen these in action as I own a now defunct version by Leichtung Workshops (sp?) that uses flat rollers that are toe'd in rather than BB's cambered rollers.  When mine become unserviceable, Board Buddies will be on my short list of things to buy.  Why?

While not a rubik's cube, this stick driver offers some very nifty controls. As mentioned previously, the torque setting is located on the black ring surrounding the bit holder: a perfect place and a perfect feel. Just below and very close without being in the way is the speed switch, not variable, just two clicks, forward=low, backward=fast.
It may sound kind of expensive at a total cost of $94 ($25 per light + ~$60 for a battery + $3 each for the bulbs) but I figure about 1 hour use per day, per light for 10 years (and still counting) results in a cost of just 2.6 cents per hour!!! (not including the electricity cost for the charger). If you already own a Dewalt rechargeable tool, the cost of ownership drops to less than a penny per hour based on my experience. How can you beat that investment???
Overall, this is a harbor freight level of quality with extremely scratchable and unprimed painted parts, and while I did get the correct number of bolts, the quality of the hardware isn't there. It's cheap.
8201	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been an Estwing user for many, many years so it was a no brainer to pick up another Estwing to handle all my home repairs. The handle is great and it has a generous head area. I chose the 16 oz straight rip claw to compliment the need of a claw in potential remodeling situations with the understanding that I would probably be dealing more with trim projects rather than rough framing and the need of a checkered head 24 oz framing hammer.

As usual, Amazon gets 5 stars for the shopping experience.
It isn't terrible, and it will work, but I won't be buying another. I cheaped out, and I got what I paid for.
FYI, both ends are threaded male connectors, which is unlike my other air hoses.



This DeWalt and the 364 BOTH have that adjustment.
This fence system has a hollow cavity, and the dust port is offset from the center of the fence. This takes some pretty strong suction to remove sawdust and debris from the fence area. Most fence systems have a hole that goes straight to the router bit area, and provides very little area to remove dust from. Shop vacs work well for those systems. Not so much on this one.
6768	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Finally!  My band saw runs like it's supposed to.  No more wandering blade.  I get a straight cut even without a fence and I get it every time regardless of how thick the wood it.  The rollers FORCE the blade to stay in line.  Of course, you need a decent blade too, but even if you're using a piece of limp seaweed, those rollers would keep it lined up.

Belt changes are simple, belt tracking is spot on, dust collection is quite good and the noise level is worthy of hearing protection during extended use.  The dust bag and cord placement is fine once you get used to it, and as with any power tool don't let your mind, power cord or fingers wander (my sympathies to the poor guy who got his fingers sucked up inside... that's gotta hurt!).  The clogging of the dust intake (not common with finer grits of sanding belts, but I've had chunks of wood get sucked up in there too) can be cleaned with a blast of compressed air from the outlet (where the dust bag fits on) back down.  Although it would be good to have a vacuum hook-up to use instead of the dust bag, I've always found that dragging the hose around while your sanding becomes more of a pain than it's worth.

5169	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	First - Great deal ... Ordered on Sunday afternoon - delivered on Thursday afternoon - Perfect condition - Outstanding job. Now the machine - it's big. If you have a small shop like mine this will fill up a big piece of it so be ready. The motor is very heavy duty and seems to run fine on 110v 12/2 wire with 20 amp breaker. Assembly is not bad and took about an hour. Instructions are pretty good but about what we've all come to expect with translation back and forth from English to Chinese. You will need to fully tighten the motor hold down bolts - they forget to tell you. Turned it on with the bare hose (a short length of 4" hose comes with it) hooked up to the lathe. Did some trial turning and it had very good suction - it will be much better when I add a hood. Overall quality seems very good. Base and swivel rollers nice & sturdy, motor is a beast, fit and finish great - no blemishes. Drum support struts varied from picture - they are stamped steel not tubes. Strong enough to do their job though. One surprise was that it came with a plastic bag (and a spare plastic bag) instead of the woven bag shown in the picture. I felt a little bit ripped off for that but since it will get changed out for a pair of 5 micron bags from Penn State who cares? The 30 micron bag is no good unless this thing stays outside the shop. The bottom bag does leak at the flange and would probably benefit from a 20" bicycle tube gasket or duct tape. The unit is surprisingly quiet and nowhere near the noise of a shop vac. I think it's a better deal than the DC1BXL or DC2 from Penn State even after the replacement bags are added.
7505	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this for every project I make. So sturdy and with the locking top, it keeps my work steady and easy to get to.

4631	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I put this blade on my Ridgid 12" Sliding compound Miter saw and it cuts very nice!!!  I heard mixed reviews but I tried multiple types of cuts and they all came out very nice and cut like a hot knife in butter.  A+++
3319	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws. I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw. The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of. However, I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw. I will probably take this and use it on some other machine. So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw, jointer, or planer.
Just have to make sure they are both in the same spot (measure twice), otherwise your cut could be off.

To fully utilize the Bosch (or similar) click-change chucks, you need to buy hex shank bits.  They're more costly than traditional, but for convenience it's worth it.

4858	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Here is my story...after two attempts to purchase this joiner, I went with the PC 557.  Both of the Dewalt models I bought had their fences racked which caused the biscuit slots to be cut on an angle.  Cutting a #20 slot was off about 1/8" from left to right.  Plus, reports of the chute clogging are true.  It was worth $30.00 more to get the PC.
3802	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought these blades in December, 2006, and have used them on hardwood and pressure treated decking.  They give a smooth cut with little or no tear-out, but they do deflect a little.  I would definitely recommend them though, as the cut is really clean.  I can't figure out why amazon raised their price to above what the retail big-box stores carry these for, makes no sense to me.  Amazon's price went to double what I paid just 6 months ago at amazon, yet the Marketplace sellers still have it at half the price.  The India-based customer service reps were of no help when I asked about the price change.

-  Any miter saw should work on this stand after adjusting the rollers to match the saw's table height.  Since every brand/model saw is different, you'll have to drill the holes to match your saw's mounting holes.  Use carriage bolts/wing nuts to secure the saw to the table, so it's easily removable.

  My first project was a breeze.  I'm a very amateur woodworker.  Nevertheless, I had no trouble with the saw.  It cuts wood like butter.  The saw is very easy and fast to set when making angle cuts.  The included clamp also is fast and efficient.  Although the clamp doesn't work well on the right side of the saw because it gets in the way of the motor.  The only limitations I ran into with the saw was with cuts greater than a foot.  This is where a table saw would be better.  The miter saw can chop, but it can't rip.  The maximum cut I was able to make was about 12.5 inches in a  inch board.  For bigger cuts I tried cutting one side and then flipping the piece over and cutting the other side.  However, it is pretty much impossible to get a cut that doesn't require sanding.
Pertaining to the 6 or 12, I chose the 6 first because I saw that one being used in higher end woodworking books. Authors even photographed themselves using the starret setting up the table saw blade for example. When I got it my first impression was, boy is that tiny. It probably will be the one that I use the most. I just don't want to be limited when I need to use one on lengths greater than 6 inches.

My biggest complaint is that the dust attachment (DW4111) comes separately (and is not carried by very many suppliers, including Amazon).  The dust bag that comes with their random orbit sander pulls apart and fits a standard 2 1/2 inch dust hose.  Why couldn't they do that with this one?
I really like the accuracy of this table so far...haven't used it much yet. I paired mine with the Triton 3-1/4 HP router and a Freud 1/2" nine piece bit set...set me back about $1000 for the package but its well worth the money...

I have 2 quibbles with these Delta replacement parts.  First is that the price is pretty high for the product, but I guess that's what you're going to find with an OEM replacement part.  Second thing is that they could supply these with a sharpened edge on both sides so that you could just flip them over when they need replacement.

I am attaching a collage of three photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses.

Assembly was more effort than I had expected.  The instructions are succinct.  Sufficient information is given to assemble the table, but there are not a lot of pictures for reference and I found myself making a few mistakes for brief periods.

  I dispute others negative comments:  Some complain that the fence only goes 0-90 degrees, unlike P.C. which goes 0-135 degrees.  They assume this means that you can't cut biscuits for mitered corners with the DW682 - BUT THEY ARE WRONG!  The fence stays at 90 degrees to reference the beveled cut and it works great.  It is all in the manual.  Some complain that the dust collector clogs - not true - even without a vacuum.  Works great.  Another complaint I read was that the biscuit slot was not parallel to the workpiece.  This is a simple adjustment covered in the manual.  Don't people read manuals anymore?  Mine came perfectly adjusted right out of the box.
This specific model Estwing really shines when used for trim work. Every other hammer I have (I do have some other brands, for throw away hammers and loaners and such) is much more likely to slip off the nail, even on a perfectly placed strike. The striking face of this model is either hand ground by a skilled American worker or is ground by a very well programmed and maintained CNC grinder. Either way, the grinds are consistently perfect.

I knock one star off because I thought the foam protective material was glued somewhat carelessly and there were some scratches on the interior of mine that seemed avoidable. Don't get me wrong. I fully expect this thing to scratched up over time.

(Means you never have to reposition it, even between sittings.) 5) Uses 3 triple A batteries, lasts much longer than book lights using the flat 2032 batteries. 6) Did I mention the bright white LED light? Far better than the older incandescent bulbs. Also throws a wide spray (I have another booklight with an LED light, but the area covered is not much bigger than a silver dollar, Ugh.)

There is even holes in the sides to guide a drill bit through the face frames nice and straight so there are no errors and end up blowing out the sides because you got too close with your hole.  Great idea that made my life much easier installing my cabinets.

7686	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg. It was inexpensive, I was inexperienced, 'nuff said.  The surprise came with its performance.  Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half  if I was in the right mind, it does a really good job of guiding my  workpiece through the saw.  The adjustment feature is simple and easy to  use, but the "graduated scale" is a bit hard to use accurately.  To set it up, I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to  the trailing edge of the guide.  This trial and error usually takes no more  than a minute or two, and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as  many cuts as I need to make.  Although there are nicer, more expensive  versions out there, you cannot beat the value for the money with this tool.

As for performance. This thing cuts 2x's and plywood like scissors through cheap wrapping paper.  I bought it to cut 2.75" thick oak beams.

I prefer the barrel grip because you get closer control. This saw is a dream, it's simple to operate, easy to hold, the lack of vibration is a dream come true. It's just awesome!

I have had one since 1990, and use is constantly.  The only things that have had to be replaced are the pad, the power switch and the cord in all that time.  The frame is metal and built for professional use.  It is louder than the newer Porter Cable sander that I bought, but this one still works, the other one died after 2 years of daily use.  The newer sander came with dust collection, which I thought I would like.  However, the holes that have to be punched in the paper for the dust ports greatly shortens the life of the sand paper, and the plastic components just didn't hold up. To sum up, this sander is loud, dusty, and does exactly what it was made to do.  I use one daily and wouldn't trade it for anything else.

1693	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	To be honest, even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years, I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers, the last thing I need was another router, so instead, I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable, very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base, it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes, to a predetermined depth with each pass, simply by turning the depth turret.
8474	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my first time using a Dado blade so I technically don't have anything to compare it to.  But, I absolutely LOVE this tool!

3521	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This drill is an absolute work horse.  Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials, I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar, grout, and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm.  After burning up two Dewalt drills, I decided to go with Milwaukee.  The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly.  The drill has a lot of torque, so use the additional handle and hold on tight!  Great drill....great price!

3606	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Obviously, I wanted a drill that would be able to get into tight places for various types of assembly and remodeling. For this it works quite well. I feel it is a better choice for all purpose drilling at odd angles than a right angle drill which tends to hit framing, duct, plumbing . .. . unless you are at or close to that right angle. When attempting to align the drill for a hole that is reasonably perpindicular to the surface, can be a little tough to guage, but for me the flexibility of the 55 degree head outweighs that benefit of a dedicated right angle drill. The paddle type switch works quite well,sometimes too well as it can be easily turned on because of the way your hand wraps around the housing and switch. It won't take long to figure out different hand positions to avoid that. The reversing switch is a bit awkward to reach while drilling, but in tight quarters once you have twisted your hands and arms to reach that tight spot, it is nice not to have to worry about inadvertantly hitting the swith to change directions; however, that being said, it works against you when you need to reverse the drill and have to back out of that tight spot or manuever your other  arm to the drill to switch directions. The keyed chuck works well, and the drill is basically comfortable and very useful. As for the reversing switch, I have not yet thought of a better location or type, but time may solve this minor gripe. Nonetheless, this is a typical Milwaukee product so far, it is well made, has a durable chasis and will probably run forever. I bought the steel carrying case to hold various auger and forstener bits which I tend to use a fair amount with this drill, the removable tray and the extra space of this box is very handy to grab and get to work, without having to pack up each time you use this drill. Nice tool to have around when the neighbors aren't asking for it.

Two smaller problems: (1) Jet only has one set of instructions for three different saws.

More recently, the front spring clip came apart so I'm out of luck unless I use adhesive backed roll sandpaper now. Eventually I'll sell it and look for a better quality sander - maybe a dewalt. Disappointed with P-C for quite a while now. My older P-C tools are still running well though - sad to see them go down so badly. Downgraded to 2 stars.

We accidently dropped our SAWCAT from an 8' ladder and lamented its loss - its alignment was never the same even after replacing the solid aluminum base plate. Black and Decker isn't the company it once was and the USA made Sawcat is no longer available from B&D but this saw lives on via Dewalt  - same saw but in a Dewalt body.
Be aware though that no router loves being upside-down.  If you are depending on the base for height adjustment, you will need to regularly remove the router from the table and clean it.  Also try to set up so that sawdust is quickly removed from the table.  I use a solid mechanical lift and a dust collection system, which helps a great deal, but good woodworking habits are critical to making the best of the 7518 or any other stationary router as well.

I would have given it 5 stars; here is why it received only 4.  If you are planning to mount a large heavy plunge router, ie 3hp Bosch, then be prepared to make some modifications to the clearance plates.  Also, the weight of this router is a strain on this table (and it IS a well built table), causing the user to make minor plate adjustments after a few hours of use.  I understand that a 3hp plunge router may be overkill, but for some jobs you need a router that won't budge under loads and thousands of feet of routing.

8964	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this a year ago, and have just recently been putting it to a lot of use.  After having done several projects now, I am not all that happy with it.  I bought it based on the Freud name and the price.  Does it work, yes.  I can't get flat bottom dado's... Every single time, my dado's have grooving from the outer blades.  This has been true with the 5 different dado widths I have cut.  Bummer..  The holes in the blades are not all the same diameter, this is a minimal difference but some don't even fit on my arbor...  Some are a bit loose... This would probably explain the grooves left in my dado's, and why some people have flat dado's and some don't...  As far as the setup chart with shims and chippers goes... The width configurations are confusing.. This has led to a lot of time testing out shim and chipper configurations... An example of confusing shim/stack setup is 13/32" and 15/32" have the exact same configuration, with no further explanation...  So what is the real measurement of stack A+B+C+D+S1+S2 if two measurements are given? It would have been a lot better to get an actual cut width and ply width designation.  It can be figured out, but wastes time.  I have the Forrest WWII as my main blade, which has now set my standard for blades... even with it's high cost, it ends up being well worth it in the long run..  I would not recommend this Freud dado setup for a profesional result, and look forward to buying the Forrest dado set. The best solution to this Freud dado stack setup is to take an hour or two and cut all the dado combinations on to one piece of wood.  That way you have this stick to test all of your pieces and quickly the proper stack setup for your project.  It is cheap though, so if that gets you cutting dado's, get it!

  I haven't been disappointed.  What impressed me first was the smoothness of operation.  I had always assumed a reciprocating tool like a jigsaw had to be rough because of the nature of the operation.  Somehow Bosch has practically eliminated the vibration in this tool.  Then of course, there is the power of the motor that just keeps on chugging at the whatever speed you select.  I haven't yet tested it on really tricky curves, but so far that blade support system has worked wonderfully, keeping the blade going straight down and where you point it.

It turns out that the installation was very simple and I can remove and replace the BB's any time I want in a matter of seconds. Instead of explaining the set-up, I'm including a photo of what we did. It's crazy easy. I used some scrap lumber I had in the shop that amounted to a 2"x4" and a small piece of 3/4" plywood. Since we did not permanently attach this to the table saw fence, we added two&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stanley-Hardware-756104-4-Count-1-34-Zinc-Corner-Braces/dp/B00004Z0PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stanley Hardware 756104 4 Count 1" Zinc Corner Braces</a>&nbsp;on the bottom of the handle end of the fence to stabilize the set-up and keep it from sliding. To quickly remove the BB's, I just slide the whole thing towards me about an inch and it lifts right off the fence. It goes back on just as easily.
* Cons: Finish is adequate, but a bit rough
Pro: it can clip to a Kindle or any e-reader, as well as any size book. The flex neck lets you put the light exactly where you want it. It has 2 bulbs and you can turn on one or both, which is like adjusting the brightness to your liking. I normally need just one bulb lit, even in a completely dark room, but when the batteries grow weak, turning on both bulbs gives me more hours of readable light before the batteries go dead. The LED lights allegedly will last a lifetime. I also use this as a mini-flashlight sometimes.

After nearly 3 years of using this type of base, I prefer it to the others I have had.  MUCH easier to move stuff, and for those who say you'll trip over the kicker, you're walking too close to your machine!  These levers rise up out of the way... I've NEVER tripped, and my shop is crowded!

This isn't a problem with Jet, but with Amazon. The box arrived looking like it had been dropped off a truck so one end was collapsed some. It turns out that nothing was broken from the damaged box, but I have no idea where the box was damaged.
  End of story, just use a good finer tooth blade. The Bosch blades are Swiss made, and they are so sharp they are almost scary. They fly through the material, and don't create any splinters, just clean smooth edges.

However, the big U-shaped tube may get in the way of cross-cutting long pieces of wood.  On my Delta Contractor Saw with 32" extension table and the Uniguard installed, I am limited to about 62" to the right of the blade.  A workaround is to loosen then bolts on the big tube and swing it back down and out of the way, but of course you won't have a blade guard (unless you re-install the one that came with your saw, and you won't want to do that).  The other workaround is to have the long part of the work to the left of the blade, but then you don't get the benefit of the extension table.

I read many reviews and looked long and hard before making the decision to purchase this saw.  I had seen various saws at Lowes at close out and their prices were tempting but I kept on reading and reviewing.  Finally an Amazon sale tipped me to this one.  Since I have had it I have used it constantly.  I have let my grandson use it so it has seen much use.  The blade change and tightning system is easy with no problems .  My 9 year old grandson has no problem changing or installing blades.

I find that a stand is almost a necessity with the 698, so it seems a little odd that Porter Cable no longer offers their model 6961 stand that used to go with this router table.

1913	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment. It feels good in your hand,although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch,which means that you don't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that. The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch,but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes. I tried to use it longer, thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that,but that is not the case ,it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter. It would be good for frying eggs,and making coffee.
I have purchased three of these and going back to get more.  The perfect light for reading in bed without keeping partner up with lamp....

This saw isn't for everyone; it's pricey for single, consumer use.  But, if you want the very best made reciprocating saw made, look no further than the Milwaukee Super Sawzall.  It's the class leader by a BIG margin.
6795	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tool.  It is solid and well built.  I use it as a straight edge for marking as well as for an edge for guiding power tools.  The 50" length is perfect for 48" panel products (like plywood).
Why the four stars instead of five? These parts appear to be castings rather than machine screw parts and the rings did not screw onto two of the bushings very easily. In fact, I ended up wire brushing the bushing threads before the rings would go all the way on.
1959	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I gave it 4 stars - 5 stars for its usefulness and 3 for its build quality.  I have several cordless tools from different makes, so I'm not using up the batteries all the time like I'm supposed to from what I've read, but having this flashlight around helps me at least cycle through my DeWalt 12V batteries.  The flashlight has a lightweight feel to it without the battery installed, so it clerly doesn't feel as "heavy duty" or solid as, let's say, a drill might feel, but I figure what should I expect?  Maybe the yellow and black color scheme along with the DeWalt label makes me expect more?  But, heck, it's only a flashlight!  You can't vary the beam width as you can with a MagLite but you can pivot the head which has proven useful at least once.  Lastly, I'm not quite sure how I ever got by without a flashlight in the shop!  My final recommendation is that if you have a cordless kit from any make, get the matching accessory flashlight!

I have used this and I have used the Porter Cable circular. This saw is a very nice quality with some good features. However it is bulky and less easy to manipulate. Mostly it is bulky.

Two minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner, so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide, those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut. To solve this I just filed them off. The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw.  I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother, and quieter.  I get perfectly square cuts now, and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .
He told me run caps hardly ever go bad and that the dust entering the windings were the cause. But he went on to say that the lack of rubber gaskets on the covers was the root cause. Clearly Jet's fault. So I e-mail Jet with my explanation and their response was:

I know it gets expensive, but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the DW723 miter saw stand.  The mounting bracket has a quick disconnect so it's easy to tear down and throw in the truck.  It's worth every penny!!!  Anyway, I own both the DW705S and the DW708 saws.  I find that I almost exclusively use the DW708 saw.  The table is absolutely flat.  I just checked it and after 3 years of constant use it is perfectly flat.  No gap.  The bearings in the slider work flawlessly.  This after cutting uncounted amounts of MDF.  I do blow it off with my compressor everyday, just to keep everything clean.  Some of the things that stand out on this saw:
1) Position clamps (one high, one low) and close the side jaws so they loosely hold the face frame.

This is an ingenious little attachment that operates like a little chainsaw in the palm of your hand. It removes a ton of wood quickly and is crazy dangerous, so make you're taking proper safety precautions (eye protection, use two hands, angle guard attached and rotated as instructed by manual).

7953	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	First of all I love hammers....and have a large "collection "......lol.  as a remodeler....my work varies daily.  On a recent job requiring alot of nailing.....I brought along several of my favorites.  The best performers were estwing and vaughan.  The Vaughn hammers were very comfortable and we'll balanced for all day nailing......but with the fiberglass handles....I didn't want it for demo.  The estwing hammers truly are wonderfully balanced and simply indestuctable.  If I had to carry just one hammer......it would be the estwing.  The grip is comfortable and I can go from demo....to framing.....to finish ......without changing hammers.  Either a 20 oz or 22oz.....smooth face hammer is really all you need to carry.  I also prefer the rubber handle.  Although I have the leather handle.....and it's gorgeous.....it's just a little too slippery of a grip for my taste.  The balance and toughness of estwing is unequaled..........and a very reasonable price for a professional quality tool.  If you are shopping different brands.....save yourself some time and go right to estwing.  If you have a 16oz.....a 20oz.....and a 22oz......you will never have to purchase another hammer for anything.....and you will get a lifetime of good performance from estwing tools.
the next step involves drilling the holes for the screws. you will need either a drill press or a portable drill guide to get the holes perfectly straight. using a 3/8 drill bit will work just fine. one piece of advice: make sure that you DO NOT drill the extra holes unless you have got extra 5/16 2" bolts and nuts. the instructions state that there are only FOUR holes that you need to drill (i drilled the extra two sets of holes and wound up having to take an extra trip to home depot).

Unfortunately,  I have to push like crazy to insert the male coupler and then push upward to lock the female coupler so they stay together.

Works great and lit up bright as described, however, for about ten hours of use per day on a crystal chandelier, some bulbs last a month while others last only a week or two.

I am a retired mechanic, 30 years in the trade, I started working on vehicles made in the 60s and 70s. I have seen the trend to cut manufacturing costs in the automotive industry. I believe the US manufacturers are now beginning to pay the price. As profits went up, quality went down and now foreign manufacturers are taking a big chunk of the market, especially Toyota. People are not buying their cars because of price, gas mileage, looks or even 0% financing. People are buying foreign cars because of their superior quality...I say all this because I fear Dewalt, Delta and many other American manufacturers are following the same trend.  Hope they change before it's too late!

I found the fence and table to be very accurately made. My Accra miter guage fit the slot nicely after a little adjustment. My PC690 fit the mounting plate well and is held securely. It does tend to get hot in the enclosure after usage. A dust port on the back or side would be nice as would some kind of measurement guage along each side of the table for quicker fence adjustments. It also needs an external power switch and outlet to plug the router into. If you use a shop vac, an additional outlet for that would be nice, too.


I don't really understand the last one, as my stationary sander is a relatively quiet tool.
7584	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A zero clearance insert is the difference between a ragged and a perfect cut on any table saw.  I have a TS350 Delta table saw and this is the insert that works.  Recommend it highly.

The T-bar is a good feature also.  You can loosen the thumb screws to slide the T-bar off of the protractor.  Be careful to not loosen the thumb screw all of the way since they are tightened by two nuts in the T-bar channel which will come off of the threads if the thumb screws are loosened too much.  Once the T-bar is removed you can then remove the nuts from the thumb screws so the thumb screws can be removed from the protractor in order to lay the protractor flat.  To re-attach the T-bar to the protractor insert the threaded shaft on the thumb screws in the large holes on the protractor, thread the nuts on enough to secure them, the slide the nuts into the T-bar channel and tighten down the thumb screw.  There is an indexing  lip on one side of the T-bar that the base of the protractor rests up against to ensure accuracy.
6.  A lot of people complain about the dust bag.  Mine is always full, but dust also goes everywhere.  That said I can't see a better way to mount the bag.  It's just a fact, on a sliding saw you will have this issue.  The bag has to move with the saw.

1360	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been very happy with these bulbs so far. The price was amazing vs. local, and the longevity has been fine. I haven't lost one yet, on all night for a few months now. The look and fit is identical to the stock bulbs in my landscape lighting. Just a brief comment to those who  had bulbs burn out quickly--it is advantageous to have the wattage of all the landscape lights installed come close to the rated wattage of the transformer, as the voltage coming out of the transformer is not regulated and so can be higher than anticipated if too few fixtures are installed. This will lead to premature burn out. I've got 76 watts of lights on an 80 watt transformer, which keeps the voltage down. Just a thought...

Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade.
And it was, apparently, already one generation old!
The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.

Recently, when Bessey finally decided to lower their prices I took the plunge (we probably have the new Jet clamps to thank for that).

Get them all, you'll be smiling when you get to change blades and it'll cut through whatever like a hot knife through butter.
Also, I cannot say these are the perfect solution for small parts. For certain applications, Grr-rippers are a better solution. For others, standard hold-downs and or feather boards are better.

I'd used biscuits in the past to build cabinets, but  pocket screws can be set up faster and require no clamping when gluing. The  only downside is that pocket screws, unlike biscuits, aren't totally hidden  from view- but the holes can be hidden in a lot of built in construction or  filled with oak or maple plugs available from Kreg.

This machine works but is heavy, like other reviewers said. Myself and my coworker are each 6 foot tall men in good condition. We can barely put in 6 hours a day with the tool and that includes two half hour breaks to allow for muscles to stop spasming.
Beware--this tool pulverizes the paint into a fine powder that goes everywhere. You will need ridiculous amounts of plastic drop cloths and bricks to hold them in place. Then you must sweep the powder at the end of each day. The amount that you collect is astounding. You can expect to collect about 10-20 gallons of paint powder from an average, 3BR/2Bath, one level home. This must be done for both legal and ethical reasons.

Both seem reasonably well made, but if I had known the difference I would have bought two of the 225-D instead of one of each, because the 225-D is cheaper and more heavy-duty.

There were a few flaws which they seemed to have fixed.  The blade had cut a groove in the sole plate at the 45 degree angle and the power cord has pulled out a bit.
2297	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	dont know why dewalt doesnt sell this with their kits anymore, most stores don't even sell it, the have 2 other kinds but not the snake one. nice light .
7248	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Went together without a problem. The handles seem cheaply made, not sure how long they will hold up.
I can easily recommend this light.  Its cute as can be, is well designed for readers, and works fine.
3581	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Because I think I need these things.  I've been a trim carpenter for only 25 years and I'm always looking for ways to make the job easier, faster, and turn out better. These stops are easy to use and they work.  Not on really big crown as D. Clarkson mentioned so only 4 stars but fortunately I don't have to deal with that too often.  If so I'll use his idea with the extensions.
I've been using them for the 10(?) years that they've been on the market. I've worn a few of them out, but I try and never drive a screw without one.

797	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very good
1748	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works OK. Sturdy.
5615	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The 4 inch end won't fit any of my tools.  It is the same size as the tool dust collector.  I am going to buy a piece of 4" sewer pipe to see if it will work to connect this item to my Dewalt Planer, Jet bandsaw, and delta joiner.
The power of this sander is perfect. I especially like the variable speed feature. This feature makes it possible to reduce the speed on soft woods to minimize the problem with removing too much material, yet have plenty of power to work quickly on hard woods. The balance of the machine is such that you realize you don't have to hold this sander with a death grip, which reduces arm and shoulder fatigue. It glides over the work. The belt tracking is the best I've ever seen. Put a new belt on, make a minor tracking adjustment with the side knob and forget about belt tracking. This PC sander is of the quality to make this reviewer wonder why I waited so long to get this sander, and convince me to make my next tool a Porter-Cable. I honestly can't imagine a 3X21 belt sander that performs better than this one.
I was disappointed to learn I could not use my 12" mitre saw (my most accurate saw) for my dado operations (I could but the capability would be severely limited in depth, etc)..  Too bad they didn't trick out the mitre saw a little more so I could have used the cast aluminum accuracy and 12" blade for ripping..
The clips on the top are to secure a metal platform if used, but I'm using regular wooden planks instead, so I can't use them, since they aren't designed to handle that kind of thickness.
Assembly was straightforward, with easy to understand instructions. All of the holes were lined up perfectly, and all of the fasteners were there (and then some - they included some extras just in case).
I am sanding a fiberglass boat deck so without the dust collector, fiberglass is all over the place even though I am outdoors.  I started sanding yesterday with the dust collector on.  I was amazed on how little dust was left behind.  This thing works great.  I wear a tyvek suit when sanding so I am not itching later, and I probably could get away with not wearing one (even though I wont).  If you are hesitant to buy this due to your model number, give it a try.  You can always return it!
My advice, avoid this one and look at Bosch.

The clamp has a fixed jaw, and a movable jaw which slides along a rail.  The maximum spread is about 4.  Depressing a plastic lever allows you to pump the jaws closer together, while pressing a metal trigger releases the clamp.  The mechanism that holds the moveable jaw in position seems fairly reliable, although it can occasionally slip.

OK I am singing a different tune now.  I just "invested" in two genuine Dewalts after several years of using the hardware store ones.  Partly because the cheep ones are getting hard to find and because I remembered the light being plenty bright back when new and hasn't  seemed that way for a while now.  Even allowing for the darkening that happens to the glass on the bulb over time
Tip: Buy an assortment of the screws in different lengths.  They come in handy for non-pocket uses due to the #2 square drive head.  I used the 2-1/2 inch screws to mount the cabinets on the walls.

4081	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a pro, so was a little leery about the price on this saw. Like others have said, though, it was love at first sight (or first feel) when I picked it up for the first time. It just feels good in the hand, fairly heavy, but with a nice balance. And when I first tried the depth adjustment mechanism, that about sealed the deal for me - set the depth you want without hardly moving your hands!
2336	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this for my wife about a week ago.  I'd originally bought a Porter-Cable and WE were very unhappy with it. I own SEVERAL Dewalt power tools, so I was confident in stepping up in price, knowing that the quality is commensurate.  It would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the pressure foot issue listed below.
5189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The trouble with the design of this blast gate is there is no way to clean out any accumulated dust.  Even with the best dust collector, you will always get some stray dust or debris that accumulates on the gate.  Every time you open and close the gate, this dust get packed into the bottom of the gate.  Eventually, the gate will not close all the way.  As more dust gets trapped, the less the gate can close.  I didn't observe this until about a year after using them.  I will have to replace all these gates with the metal version which has cut corners that will not allow any dust to get trapped.  With the metal version, any dust or debris gets pushed out of the corners when the gate is closed.

- Very solidly built.  Very stable.
4312	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Bosch 1619 EVS 3 1/4 hp router at the same time as this one.  The Bosch 1619 is a plunge router and is much, much heavier.

Oil, dirt, and grease clean off quickly with a damp rag.  It even stays flexible when cold, and doesn't keep it's shape after sitting for awhile like the coiled plastic ones do.
Because I grew up with fraction measurements, I tend to think in those terms.  However, when dealing with dados, figuring stack widths is much easier if I convert fractions to decimals (top divided by the bottom of the fraction) and work adding decimals.
Although the instructions do not state this clearly, as soon as you play with them for a few minutes you quickly learn that these two adjustments interact. You have to balance the spring pressure with the roller height for the best results. Once you get the hang of it, it takes only a few seconds.
There is a plunge base available for this motor yet I'm hesitant to buy it because the power cord coming out of the motor is only 5-6 inches long (it plugs into the top of the D-handle).  That means the power cord will connect to the extension cord right at the router base.  That can't be practical.

2829	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wanted a scroll saw to help cut out model airplane parts quickly. I did a lot of reading and settled on this saw and promptly received it a few days later. Bent. It is very heavy and feels sturdy but after running it for a few minutes, I noticed it had a knock at RPM's above speed 4. A quick google search later showed that this was a prominent problem from older models. After inspecting the machine further, I noticed it was cutting at an angle. No problem, just adjust the set screw and the thumb screw until the blade makes a right angle with the table. After maxing out the adjustment, the blade was a solid 1 degree off. On smaller work pieces, this is barely noticeable. Try to cut a circle on 1" thick wood or stack cut and you will quickly notice that the parts are all different. I took a step back and noticed that the machine's entire top arm was bent about 1/4" to the right which explained everything. A call to DeWalt support later and they said it will be a month before they can look at it. So, I simply bent the thing back - by hand. If I am able to bend this cast iron by hand, it isn't very strong. Now the knocking is gone and the machine cuts straight vertical cuts.

Coming from a Good American Company with a fabulous reputation, this little block plane is quite a disapointment.  No hand plane comes ready to use out of the but this one wasn't even in the ball park.  The iron was dull and the sole was out of flat in both dimensions.  A lengthy (for a new plane) tuning had most of the discrepancies resolved, but the lever assembly refuses to remain tight when in use.
6789	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As a home woodworker I have always chafed at the price of high quality clamps such as these because I was under the delusion that something this expensive should either have a motor on it or be a tool pretty enough to show off in a display case when not in use.  Thus, I have a considerable collection of pipe clamps, cheap/thin bar clamps, and all sorts of fad clamping products.  Recently, when Bessey finally decided to lower their prices I took the plunge (we probably have the new Jet clamps to thank for that).

I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill, contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill.

The ONLY reason I did not select 5 Stars is I read the chart, then I assemble the dado and load it onto my table saw and tighten. Then I measure the width to make sure its correct. Almost every time it is NOT! Why I ask myself? It is because the dang chart is so small, and its' crowded. When I've followed the chart I've actually followed the wrong settings. C'mon Freud! I happen to be an engineer, your chart sucks! I scanned your supplied chart and exploded it to 300% and then took a highlighter to make every other column stand out. THAT works.

These batteries cost at least 4 times what the light cost if you go to Lowes to buy them. They come in a two pack. I don't know if you can buy just one. If you didn't have batteries already the way I did, it would probably make this not worth while. Boy, dat makes for an expensive flashlight.

This unit could be built with more sophisticated methods for securing it to the can, and outlet tubes for securing the pipe, but then the price of the unit would rise. I like it just the way it is.

One last point about the so-called "Parallel" clamping heads: Even IF they worked perfectly, that only helps if the assembly is perfectly square. Woodworkers OFTEN must skew clamps in order to "square-up" a panel or frame. Once you skew a K-Body, the "advantage" of large square heads is lost because they will no longer be perpendicular to the face. Unless your woodworking is PERFECT, DEAD SQUARE 100% of the time, the Bessey-style clamps can actually dent face-frames and panels. You will often need protective cauls anyway, so why pay more for something that only performs better under perfect conditions?
Instead of raving on more about this elegant incarnation of the humble hammer, I invite you to test one for yourself. Try it along side other hammers for the same sized nails into the same type of woods. Spend 20 or 30 minutes with the test to get a good feel for how they differ. I can just tell you from my experience and that of most carpenters I know.

The saw does not come with very much in the way of accessories. It has the saw itself, one general purpose wood-cutting blade with carbide tipped teeth, and a wrench for the bolt on the arbor. Unfortunately there seems to be no place to dock the wrench onto the saw for storage when not in use. The saw has a spring loaded button for locking the arbor when it is time to change blades; a feature many saws lack; unfortunately, there is only one detent so you need to turn the arbor a lot before the arbor locks.
Over time, these are a better investment IMO because they can be customized and repaired. Although I have never broken a clamp, I HAVE seen other woodworkers who have distorted aluminum bar clamps by dropping them, storing them haphazardly or by applying excessive clamping force. Pipe-clamps, on the other hand, are nearly indestructible. They still work even if they are bent. Pipe clamps are easily and cheaply repaired too.
  I have a Fein vac and have struggled with accessories.  I love the vac, but like most things Fein, the tool is a dream, but the accessories seem overpriced.  I have purchased several different fittings and kits trying to avoid buying the rather expensive Fein accessories.  This fits a Fein perfectly out of the box.  Plug and Play.  While expensive, it's much less than the Fein accessories it is replacing.
3371	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This base works excellent with my Delta 14" bandsaw.  Make sure you get the right base.  There are 2 types of saw bases with different sizes.  I ordered the wrong one in my first order.
3166	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills, Table Saws, etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw, hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further, unless you are working in pitch black, the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light, that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight, it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher.....

Other than swapping out the brushes once (spare ones were included with purchase) it has required no service, and has never failed me.

2246	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	One word for everything - PERFECT.
1491	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	They look great and the price is great but there seems to be a very faint flicker on some of them. I installed 6 of them in an elevator and two of them flicker. You really need to look closely for a while to notice it but its there. At first I thought it was the transformed but its only two of the six, and they are all on the same 12VAC transformer. I will try with a 12VDC unit and see if that does anything. I will update you on how long they last.
The saw will cut through most anything with the blade they supplied.  It will easily cut 2x4 and 2x6 at any angle or bevel.  You can also cut up to 2x10 in one motion at 90 degrees.  The angles are easy to change, though the pivot on the back is sometimes hard to read and easily gets blocked by sawdust.  The sawdust collection doesn't really work, it needs a vacuum attachment or just a clean up after every job.  The downside to this saw, IMO, are 2: high price of accessory items, and no laser guide for cutting.  At this price they should include the laser guide (Sears even does it on a $200 saw, so it can't be that big of a deal).  You sort of expect high accessory prices from Dewalt, its just part of the deal.
7677	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I love the feeling of a sharp plane slicing through wood. Stanley has been making planes for a long time and they really know what they are doing.  You might veiw this as a plane kit. When you get it you will have some work to do on it. First you will probably need to lap the sole,and the back of the iron. This will remove the grinding marks from the factory. Then you will need to hone the bevel on the iron. Depending on the wood you are planing the angle might be right. Since this is a low angle plane 25 degrees is good for hard woods. You could even go as low as 15 degrees for soft woods. If you spend a little time tuning this somewhat rough tool up you will be rewarded by that feeling of slicing through the wood like it was butter. I prefer my Lie Nielson block planes over these. They are works of art and they perform like they are. But they cost several times more than these perfectly adequate stanleys.

5642	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Packaging was great and there was no missing parts.  Instructions for assembly are clear and straight-forward and yes, it took about an hour to assemble.  I recommend the addition of the aluminum plate to have the ability to change inserts. I added a Kreg multi-plug safet switch to the left side (facing the machine) and added industrial handles to each side to facilitate lifting it on and off the bench.  Mitre gauge slot adjusts easily and precisely.  Leveling the aluminum plate took some time to get it right but I was able to without a lot of trouble.  The Bench Dog was rock-solid after assembly.  I test ran a 45 degree mitre lock bit ( fairly hefty as bits go) with no problem - the cabinet performed well.  The fence is perfectly square to the table and adjustments were easy.  There are higher grade fences with more capabilities out there but quite frankly, I believe this fence wil do everything I need.  The exhaust for the fence is clear plastic and held under a fence knob on each side.  While this allows you to remove it and clean, I was a little concerned that the mounting of the port was weak but it seemed to perform fine.  I will be using the Bench Dog to do cabinet doors and picture frames and expect it to work well over a long life time of use. FYI, the router I am using is a porter cable 690 variable speed and at 1 1/2 hp, seems to work very well in this cabinet.  I highly recommend this product.

Fast, easy and accurate use.  Let's be honest.  It's nice to have the micro-fine adjustments of the higher end tables with a great lift.  But, a good router today sells with an above-the-table adjustment tool.  So it's entirely possible to get 1/64th adjustments with the turn of a $20 accessory!
6686	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good:  (1) heavy, beefy, and stable clamp on wood (2) good line alignment visibility.  Could be better, but still is good.  There is a port on the side that allows you to view the white line to align with your wood marking.

All bulbs were the same G8 size; there was even a quality control slip in the box indicating that they were checked.  The light is well matched to my other bulbs in color tone (a bit on the warm side, not a cooler light like a xenon bulb).  The only issue is that I received frosted bulbs; the picture indicates clear bulbs. This was not a problem in my application (I imagine that they ship both).  For the price this was a great purchase.  Yes, the bulbs are made in China, but so are most of the other options, like the Feit bulbs.
5825	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	FLAWLESS ITEM AND DELIVERY
6973	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have two traditional stabilizers but there are places where a full length, "square" stabilizer won't work, like when I'm working on a corner (inner or outer) or when I'm working  between windows that are not widely enough spaced to accommodate a full length stabilizer. This one is light weight aluminum, which is good because at the end of an extended ladder, too much weight can prove unwieldy. That said, it would be very helpful if there was a permanently marked center line to help perfectly center the device. Centering is not an issue with traditional stabilizers because the section of the stabilizer that is bolted to the ladder is parallel to the ladder rungs, with this device it is critical or the ladder may have a tendency to twist to the side if it is not centered on the stabilizer. The painted finish is very cheap, a powder coated, durable finish would be much better. Also, the only clear, large picture that shows how to mount device is on the cardboard box that the device comes in. A hook to hang paint buckets and such would be very helpful too. As one reviewer pointed out, in theory the stabilizer could move up and down the ladder as the u-bolts do not engage a ladder rung, as they do on a traditional stabilizer. I have not found this to be a problem, however. Once I have the stabilizer mounted on the ladder, I cannot move it at all without loosening the wingnuts on the u'bolts. Overall, this has been a useful product for me.

9587	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Very disappointed, especially with all the great reviews.  I bought two.  The hose was fine, but the 1/4 inch ends were the problem for me.  On the first one, the threads were slightly off and leaked air.  On the second one, the threads were also slightly off, plus the crimp area was leaking.  Lost 30 pounds of air overnight.  Sent the first one back already and will likely send second one back.
It is somewhat stiff -- stiffer than a good  rubber garden hose but more than pliable enough for woodshop purposes.  The  cuff connector at one end of the hose allows the connector to rotate  without twisting or winding the hose.  This is a very good feature I would  want on any hose.

I only tried one blade and perhaps I got a bad one, but I didn't make it through the first pallet before the blade and wood started smoking.

We ended up supporting the light halfway down the gooseneck by using two zip ties to secure the gooseneck to the upper saw arm.  We used a piece of foam between the gooseneck and the saw arm to prevent vibration and paint damage.  Taking this weight off helped, but is tacky looking.  Considered mounting it to the saw stand for a more vertical mount, but then it would be in the way of large work pieces.
- toss the included cotter pins into your parts bin and use removable clips.  The whole system is designed to be put together onto the column - why they include cotter pins versus removable pins is anyone's guess.
You just don't see stuff like this anymore (at least I haven't since I was a kid). I love mine and can't wait to put my 5.5 amp Magnum Hole Shooter in it.

This is a GREAT saw, The blade brake is a must-have feature, stops blade rotation in ~2 seconds. This saw isn't the lightest one on the market but it had topped the best saw list for years, and it's expecially great for left-handed craftaman - unlike the worm drive saws favored by right-hamders (that offer left-side cutting area views).

Another pointer - definitely get an extra Bosch clamp or two. They are not very expensive, are very well made, and make your job much easier, especially if you are working on your own.

The clamp is horrible, It comes loose, the screw striped out after 6 months.  If you make 45 degree cuts the back of the clamp is so far back the blade can not cut all the way through the metal, to correct this you have to put an extra piece of material behind what you are cutting to space it out far enough to cut through.  It vibrates no matter what you cut.  I've used saws with less horse power ratings that have more power.  It trips breakers all the time on circuits that don't trip when I use my 110v welder.  If I had it to do over I would buy a hack saw!
I read another review about dropping boards on it and having it break - I can't say I've ever dropped a board on it, but I would think, at least from the feel of the thing, that if dropping boards on it breaks it, then those same boards would have broken pretty much any hose out there that from the same price range.

When mine arrived I was disappointed with the fit and finish.  The unit that holds the work piece is made from cast iron.  Unfortunately, only one face had been machined smooth.  The supplied bolts would not slide the length of the slots in the cast iron work piece holder.  I took the unit to my local machine shop to have work piece holder re-machined.

There are two schools of thought for that proposition: if you just slip your hoses on the fittings, it will slip appart if you stumble over the hose while bumbling about your shop; if your hose is out of the lanes of traffic, clamp them to avoid having to crawl behind that stack of plywood to reattach them.  If your tightly clamped hose is strung accross the floor, it will trip you, especially if you can't see the floor because you're proudly hauling that newly completed vanity cabinet in for your adoring wife's inspection.

Although this hose will fit into a standard shop vac the accessories that came with your shop vac such as the extension tube, crevice tool, etc. MAY NOT FIT THE OTHER END OF THIS NEW HOSE! only Mr. Nozzles accessories or accessories that use a 1 1/2" I.D. hose end will fit this hose, and Mr. Nozzle does not have alot of accessories to go with this hose so you may end up with a great hose but a poor nozzle etc. at the end of it.
I wish the saw came with a case, as so many other DeWalt hand power tools do these days, but there is not even one listed on the website.
8009	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	After a little work of sharpening and smoothing the sole it is a very adequate tool for the money. The price difference for the better quality planes is very significant. This plane will do a good job at a reasonable price.

9690	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	works great.  wish I bought sooner
217	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works well.
I can't imagine why anyone but a production shop would buy the 7519. The single-speed feature may provide very slightly higher reliability but it greatly restricts the bits you can use. If you shop, there's no real difference in price between the two models. For almost everyone, the 7518 is the best choice.
9298	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Worked great for me, no issues.  Quality is very good.
4777	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Arrived quickly and exact replacement for original.

5498	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Just what I needed. I'm a firm believer in stock. And, I also believe in having parts available.
7888	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I made up my mind to purchase this hand plane there were four things I considered:
A bit expensive but they do help in holding the wood in place when it is large or long.
360	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wish the base was a bit more streamlined. Great for reading in any lowlight/ no light situation (bedtime, plane, train, car). Can clip right on to the book you are reading on stand on its own. Long battery life.
4653	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Bosh jig saw and blades are at this point nothing new, as they have been around for 20 years or so. This is what you should have if you are a pro; and even for the handy person. This is the finest saw and blade type in the world.
Caveat: I can't say yet how it is on battery-life... Haven't used it enough yet. But of course I only use rechargeable batteries with things like this so it shouldn't matter *too* much, since I don't intend to use it frequently. I also can't say how long the bulb will last, which is probably the more important thing. Hopefully it's not junky though!

has a hole too small for most of my bits.
6092	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It has worked very good. I use a Home Depot orange bucket. I pull the handle on top to keep the lid on.
I went into the local home center, and got my hands on the Milwaukee close quarters drill. Please understand I am crazy about Milwaukee tools, but ! Holding onto this drill is strange. The only way I can relate to it is to say, think of holding onto a 1.5 litre bottle of wine. You know the kind that quickly mushrooms out at the neck. Your little finger, second, and third fingers are holding onto a large body, while your index finger and thumb are wrapped around the neck. Now imagine trying to force the neck of the bottle into something. Albeit, the Milwaukee has a mushroomed head, it is a tiny head nonetheless. Difficult to put into words. Go into your local home center and pick one up. You instantly will know what I mean. In a few words, it is uncomfortable. I don't know what Milwaukee was thinking with this one. For a little more money, get the Makita DA3010F 3/8" Angle Drill with L.E.D. Light.

If you're having trouble getting the old diamond wheel off the spindle, here's a tip told to me by Drill Doctor.  Put the Drill Doctor in the freezer for 30 minutes and then, try again while the unit is still cold.  This may sound silly, but it worked for me.  The cold shrinks the metal parts just enough for the old wheel to slide right off.
9252	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was using the kit hose for about the last 3 years. and wanted to try something else so I purchased this hose. WOW. What the heck was I waiting for. This hose is so easy to deal with. My old vinyl hose was always stiff, constantly fighting it, and as another reviewer mentioned never laid flat on the ground. This hose is so much better in every way. I cringe just thinking if I ever need to use the vinyl hose again.
Lenox has included a total of 12 "speed slot" saws in this kit. Each is a solid bi-metallic plate 1/16-inch thick, appearing to be cold-rolled and welded, then after working painted with a non-stick coating. Each has a "speed slot" (one on the smaller diameters, two on the larger) to enable easy removal of material plugs after sawing. Two arbors (milled and knurled) are also included, as well as five pilot drills (not counted as part of the 17 pieces, by the way--classy!).

5942	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This fit extremely well. It is sturdy and well constructed. I lost the original that came with my saw in transit. I love having a zero clearance insert. You will not be disappointed with this product.
I bought mine for a basement finishing project and it served well; my 16 year old son and I used it every day for weeks, and the lack of an air hose alone made all the difference in the world. I thought it might become a bit heavy during all-day use, but we were passing it back and forth for more than a couple of 12-hour days and didn't give it a second thought.
9604	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great

9499	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised.  Much better quality than what you can find in a big box store.  The threads are longer and I don't get the air seepage that I do with those cheaper brands.
4225	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Having done all those types of cuts with a router, I had never used a dado set before. After having read all the reviews, I sprung for the Super Dado. I have nothing to compare it to, but the results were just amazing! I was test fitting a joint after my first cut and it was so perfect I wondered if it needed glue. The set up/sizing chart it comes with is dead on, but just in case it comes with shims. None of the chippers are marked with their sizes so you have to look carefully at an edge(or measure, but there are only three sizes.) I highly recommend it!
3151	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Mounting holes a little out of line but other than that does the job.
  The universal advantages of the board buddies, is that they are built a lot more substantially than the pictures show. They are large. That is great because they can handle the type of rigor required for a 4x8 sheet of 3/4" plywood.
Forget the dust bag though.  After two joins it is filled up.  Just point the bag mount to the floor and sweep up later.  The shavings are actually used by my wife in her gardening.
503	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use these as side-lighting for microscopic inspection of electronic parts. This is excellent because it produces two different levels of lighting due to its containing two LEDs each lamp.  The LEDs consumes low amounts of battery power.  After moderate use I've yet to replace the batteries in my first set that I purchased nearly three years ago.  The base includes a clamp to attach as you please, the neck is flexible to place the light exactly where it's needed.  The product comes with batteries so ready to go upon receipt.  Also there is the option to connect AC power adapter to these book lights although I've never tried it.  I especially liked that these were offered in my favorite color pink.
I used to use drywall screws with cup washers to do this sort of job, but these round head screws never split wood even without washers.
7856	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Took me 2 hours with my diamond plate to true the sole and blade. Each photo in progression represents 1/2 hour on the plate. I stopped after 90 minutes because my arms couldn't take any more. The sole could have used another 1/2 hour but I said good enough. The blade was better than the sole as it took only 1/2 hour to get to the good enough point. The last 1/2 hour was trying to set the plane up properly. I find the adjustments to be impossible to keep constant. Seems like each stroke of the plane heralds different results. Every time I buy a cheap cutting tool I think I can get it good enough? I guess in 50 years I still haven't learned my lesten and buy the Lea Neilson first. If you buy this plane and want it to work correctly plan on putting a lot of work into it.
8355	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this hammer after having multiple wood handled hammers become loose after a year of work, I had an old Estwing framing hammer, that had been through hell and back, so I thought I'd give it a try for the 16oz hammer, Wasn't sure that the quality would still be the same, but it was just as good if not better, this hammer with the rip claw can frame, trim, demo, whatever you need it to. Although It is solid steel, the shock reducing handle really does work. The balance is flawless, it swings like a dream, and is a tool I will pass down to my grandchildren one day, it's made like a tool should be, to last.

8197	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been an Estwing user for many, many years so it was a no brainer to pick up another Estwing to handle all my home repairs. The handle is great and it has a generous head area. I chose the 16 oz straight rip claw to compliment the need of a claw in potential remodeling situations with the understanding that I would probably be dealing more with trim projects rather than rough framing and the need of a checkered head 24 oz framing hammer.
1076	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Still working. Do lights things ever die?
7932	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Useful, well made, balanced. It takes some experience to use it right - cross cut or rip - and you have to know the kind of wood before starting the right side of the blade.
Milwaukee redesigned the charging units [old Vs new = cooling vents on side Vs cooling vents on top respectively].  Another distinction between the old spontaneous combustion chargers and their safer successors is the handy little built-in bit compartment on the original charger has been removed.
PPS. Unlike most other Makita products, this one uses a fairly standard dust collection port.

8564	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Most professionals or avid carpenters use nail guns for the bulk of their work, but there is something about the look and feel of a well-made hand tool; and this is definitely a well-made hammer, at a reasonable price. If it doesn't get lost, stolen, or misplaced, this hammer will be around to hand down to your grandchildren, and will still do the work for which it was designed.
8862	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The quality of the blade itself is really good and it is extremely sharp. The only downside to me is the plastic handle but other than that i am happy with this saw.
No regrets.  Not one.  I'm a bit concerned at some of the issues or reliability that are raised here, but I haven't had any problems and I've used the saw quite a bit.
I almost forgot to add something about the articulated dust blower, it's great!  You can set it to whatever position you need to blow the dust away from where you are cutting, and due to the low vibration of the machine there is no or extremely little movement.
4234	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble, install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one, but c'mon now!

3164	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The SKIL model 77 is without a doubt the best value in power tools a man,(or woman) can buy. It would be a wonderful thing if all of my power tools had the same quality as this saw. I have been in the carpentry trades for more than 30 years, and I found out that when it comes to buying tools that in the long run you are much better off buying quality equipment than trying to save a few $$$ by buying cheaper stuff.
So take my review as you will, good or bad. It seems to be a good scroll saw. It has been around for a good while.

8085	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This thing is very versatile but has a steep learning curve.  They really need better directions.  A youtube setup video would be greatly appreciated.  I got it to work, but it took some serious fiddling around before I understood everything.  As much as this product has failings, no one else has come out with anything better.
4775	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	not really sure why but this created deep random gouges (I've been a professional woodworker for thirty five years)
5743	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought 100 grit wheel as spare since I have several boxes of dull bits.  Original 100 grit wheel on grinder is working great.  And, I can just reverse the wheel when one end becomes worn [thanks to other Reviewer comment].  Its good to have a spare.
With reasonable depth-of-cut, a sturdy-straight fence and safe feed-speed, this thing cuts wood like butter. Obviously, you need good bits for best cut-quality. Use good bits, some judgement and don't get power-mad. You can see silky-smooth cuts in any wood. This will run all day, so carbide bits are best. I get good results with Whiteside solid carbide bits.

The blade performs flawlessly and will out-cut any of my Freud, De-Walt and other trim blades.  Buy it - you won't be sorry.
No spinning head problem - easily adjustable - seems to have long battery life - much better made than my last mighty bright 40513

604	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought the pink one because it was cheaper by far, and I *think* it is less likely someone will steal the pink one.  The light is excellent for my Kindle or any other book. I recently sat an overnight vigil for a friend in hospital, and was able to read very comfortably all night.  Unsure how long the batteries will last, but being able to read in that dark room all night was priceless. No heat involved. Lightweight. I was reading with the one-lamp setting and it was fine; 2-lamp setting is almost two bright for me. Nicely focused light, too, fine for bed-reading.  It'll be great on a plane.

9451	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Broke after one use with Ryobi impact driver using to drill deck screws into 2x4 boards. Will not stand up to heavy use.

One downside to the Delta is the need for the hardwood rails for heavier equipment. If you don't have a lot of scrap hardwood lying around, you should include the price of the wood in your price comparison. You should also have access to a planer and joiner to square up the wood, something that wasn't necessary with the pine.
222	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great light at a good price. It has two settings bright and brighter. The lower setting seems to be fine for me and will probably save on battery life.  The clip is heavy duty and holds the light steady

I already had a set of cheap ball bearing guides in the saw, but since the problem had to be in the guide performance somewhere, I bit the bullet and sprang for the Carter's.  These have an excellent reputation among woodworkers. So I figured that the risk was minimal.  I normally have a 1/2" blade on the saw - while the Carters don't work well with 1/8" blades they do fine with everything else.  For tight curves I prefer a real scroll saw, anyway.

3490	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Big red is still tops.  As a professional signmaker, we use drills daily in many situations for a variety of materials.  I still like the keyed chuck, nothing like it for really tightening a bit and I especially like the detachable cord.  I have a 25' cordset which I use; most of the time I never need an extension cord.  Power, quality, durability, it's all here...
1259	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Burn out in a couple months. Same product 20 W version lasting over a year. However, they paid for themselves in energy saved, so if you do not mind frequent bulb replacement, not a bad deal. I do, hence the low score.

After installing the LED upgrade the light is much better.

8904	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect dadoes. Flat bottoms. I have only used it for 3/4 and 11/16 wide dado slots and both were perfect.
For the larger framing job like nailing off a floor or on a job that is going to take all day, i would probably use the compressor set up, but this is a fun portable tool and I love it.
I also like it's hefty feel and it's weight makes it stable when I use the router for freehand routing. The soft start feature is also great. I intend to build a router station in the future to house this green beast, but I am holding off until I find an easier way to master the art of changing bits with this time consuming system.

First, you can go for the higher end Veritas or Lie Nielson block planes. They will be perfect out of the box and ready to use, however, at around $150.00 a pop that's a bit steep. Even if it takes an hour to tune up this Stanley, $150.00 just to save an hour is kind of expensive to me.
1297	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Used these lights outside and so far they are working very well. Shipping was fast and quality excellent.
No provision for the switch cabling.  They give you a place to mount the switch in a convenient location, but no good way to route the wires.  I drilled the tube myself and ran them through.
Now for the cons:
I highly recommend the Paslode Cordless Battery.
Another good package from Dewalt.
7733	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	A) The instructions were vague and part descriptions were inconsistent. For example, one is instructed to install two more "top blocks" than are supplied. This is an error in wording. Per the parts list these last two should have been referred to as "Front Blocks." The instructions end before describing how to place two of the three "Jaws" that make up the top surface of the bench. Apparently there are multiple configurations that could be used.
8963	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	once you get the right combination of blades, shims and spacer this is a must have for cutting dado grooves works excellent no problems. highly recommend.
I bought this one because I managed to "misplace" the last one I had.  I was drilling into some 2X4 studs while standing on scaffolding and when I switched my drills out, I could not find my magnetic tip holder.  I had to do it old school and I was dropping screws from the scaffolding left and right because I was drilling at such an odd angle and over my head.
So... what now?  Bloody head fixed... what to do with this broken gate...Well... since this is a design issue... a weak blast "weld" holding it together... I HIGHLY recommend that anyone using this as an end piece (not inline between twp pipes) you HAVE to reinforce the gate. I added foil tape to seal it on all three sides of the seem.  Then reinforced it with duct tape.  This is a cheap piece of plastic that WILL break apart on you if not inline between two pipes.

I find very little router debris in the cabinet, I am surprised, and the vacuum port does a great job of removing most of the debris. Super.

998	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought to replace oven light. Only issue is that it comes eight to a pack. Kind of a waste but maybe these will not last. First light lasted 13+ years.
And if attempting to install anywhere in between, then beware of the blade itself...

5310	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I know others have said these clog up with dust.  My thought is they are using too small of a dust collector for 4 inch lines and just don't have enough suction to keep them clear.  I have never had a blast gate clog up on me.  I have had 6 of these performing perfectly for 8 years.  One broke when I dropped it.  It doesn't look like they changed anything in the design so I expect great service out of the 3 new gates just like the 6 old ones.

I will continue to buy Dewalt tools, but had I known about the light's shortcomings, I would NOT have purchased it.  My wife bought an really nice OttLite fluorescent magnifier / light unit that we mounted to the Dewalt stand. It works GREAT!!!!!
7775	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Fortunately the unit I purchased was not in as bad a shape as units others received. The wooden slats were splintering in places but not warped. The unit is minimalist, not in terms of design but of quality. If it were made properly - heavier metal, vise mechanism more robust, better wooden slats, it could probably command twice the price at Amazon and be worth it. Unfortunately, it is made as a semi-disposable unit probably not the result of being made in China but of what B & D dictated as cost.  The instructions for assembly are close to useless - figures misnumbered and not very informative. Made instructions from IKEA  look like a Mercedes service manual.

1894	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What a great sander. We have been using these simple 330 Bloc sanders for years, we usually have three or four laying around the shop. They are easy use, do a great job preparing for furniture finishing (leaving minimal sanding marks). They go through a lot of abuse with us over the years and they keep on taking it. I've seen the price rise over the last few years, as well as the manufacturing move from the U.S. to Mexico, still a good sander.

As I stated in the bracing review, there is no way I can find to have this system wrap around a corner.  I have a need for this and will be building my own corner brace so I can put one of these jacks on the outside corner and laying "side B" scaffold on top of "side A" scaffold.  I don't understand why a corner system wasn't produced by the manufacturer - it seems like a logical thing to have.

8397	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had this set in my tool arsenal for many years , but never used it much until just recently. Probably because I was using the Instey bit system, which was working fine. I discovered that this is actually faster and dose as good or better than any system I've used, if you don't need to use an impact driver . You can purchase any broken drill bits or countersinks at Home Depot as well. Tips can be released with the turn of an Allen wrench on my model but maybe on a more updated model they have a quicker method. Either way it's better than a press fit,since sometimes the tip has a tendency to come out in use or be too difficult to get out for replacement on those types. And they are magnetic, which is a must.
The only bummer about the 310 is that PC has discontinued production of the excellent optional bases for the machine. The offset and angle bases as well as the laminate slitter are the finest available. I say "available" because even though they are no longer sold complete by PC, you can buy the individual parts and assemble your own, though this isn't cheap. Used and new-old-stock bases are also available on Ebay and other sources, but their relatively high prices attest to the die-hard following this router has among professional woodworkers. Don't let that put you off though, since most trim work is straight trimming and these bases are rarely needed. If you ever find that you really need, say, an offset base, go ahead and splurge on the parts and build your own.

And beyond all of these features lies the best of all - clamp jaw parallelism.  You can always rest easy knowing that these clamps are not bowing the panel or whatever it is that you are clamping, because the jaws always always stay parallel to each other.
assembling the mobile base was fun, overall, and it's simply the BEST value that you're going to get for the money involved.
This innovation was HUGE, and was carried over to the new "Random Orbit" sanders in the form of self adhesive disks. The self adhesive sandpaper took the market by storm, other manufacturers had to follow to compete.

1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.

6777	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a fairly recent 14" Delta bandsaw which has been pretty accurate through most of its life.  Until, out of the blue, is snapped the upper wheel mount.  Delta cheerfully replaced the part, but for some reason, the blade suddenly developed a tendency to yaw when resawing under full steam.  I decided that, if I was going to go through all the adjustment hassle I might as well extend the height as well.  To my surprise and delight, this worked, but the blade would intermittently wander, and then, just as suddenly start working perfectly again.  Definitely time to tear my hair out.

These stabilizers are great, they adjust to compensate perfectly for un-level ground.  I had to drill out the rivets of the original feet on my ladder, to remove them.  But drilling & installing the stabilizers was fairly easy.  The instructions were pretty good.  I wish I knew about these a long time ago.
This one's been my favorite, is very easy to coil and uncoil.  Recently, I noticed my compressor cycling on once a day and it appears this hose finally started leaking.  I'm tossing it and I'm here to buy another one.  Over the years it's picked up dust and grease and I've used various solvents to clean it.  I can barely make out GoodYear.

Several years ago I had a chance to use a friend's Dewalt DW364.  It was so amazing that I hoped my venerable Makita 8 1/4" contractor saw would die.  The Makita is still running strong (it's 22 years old) but I finally bought a DW364 anyway.

2870	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Overall, this is a pretty good scroll saw for the hobbyist and is $200 less than the regular price from Woodcraft, and $125 less than the annual sale they have.  This saw has minimal to no vibration, super quiet, and easy to use.  The quick-change blade process is very convenient compared to the more expensive Delta scroll saw I was using, and changing the blade speed is a snap with the turn-dial speed selector.  The blower hose is easy to adjust and does not get in the way of your work while really pushing your sawdust out of the way fast.
I have made several cuts with it, and I haven't had any tear out, or chipped work pieces as of yet.  I usually prefer to use my router for dado cuts, but if I am going to be making a whole lot of small repetitive dado's and rabbets, then the blade is worth the time and set-up.

But seriously guys, if you already have just at least 1 dewalt tool that uses the same battery. Then I would defiantly purchase one of these. It's well worth the money.

Please be aware that you should calibrate this unit prior to using it the first time (and after bumping or jolting it or after it has sat for long periods of time).  I took my brand new level out to use it to level a window sill that I was framing.  I finished framing the window sill and decided to double check it with my old 48" level and it was off by over 3/8".  I double checked with another 24" cheap level and it agreed with my 48" regular level.  I ran the calibration procedure and this level also showed the window sill off by 3/8".  I learned this lesson the hardway (i.e. by having to reframe the window sill), but I also learned that the calibration procedure was very quick to perform.

4247	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had this dado set for about a week and finally got around to trying it out.  This set replaces an old, but hardly used, Craftsman 8" dado set that I had used on a project or two with Ok results.  The bottoms were flat enough but the edges were burred and the blade had no shims available which meant I had to make two passes with a 3/8" setup in order to get 15/32".  Oh my gosh, what a difference this Freud set makes.  The dado cut is perfect in every way and the blade cuts much faster with a lot less effort.  I almost didn't purchase this dado set because of some of the negative reviews.  It is has been my observation that many times negative reviews have nothing to do with the product which is particularly unfair and irritating; other times negative reviews come from incompetent boobs who don't know how to use the product; finally, negative reviews come from negative people that always post negative review, as if it is their job to nit-pick everything.

The only thing I wish it had was longer arms. I'd be happy with a couple more inches. Better yet, if it came with 4 pieces that could screw into one another, getting twice the length.

With the soft pads and the one handed operation they make glue ups a snap on small items.

I have a bad back and a small shop (garage) and I can't have all of my tools in the most useful place all the time, so I have to move things around. Do not worry about the Kreg Casters making the table shaky; they lock the rollers movement and the swivel firmly in place with one action. I may order more Kreg casters for some of my other tools.

4038	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered the Freud 8 in. Super Stacked Dado set (SD508). The set contains: dado blades, shims, and a carry case. The majority of this review focuses on the carry case. The first set I ordered arrived with the internal red plastic of the carrying case totally shredded (see photos). In addition, the shims were rusted (see photos), likely because the bag was ripped open when the internals of the case were being destroyed. I returned the first set and Amazon sent me a second set. Once again, the internal red plastic in the carrying case was damaged (see photos), although to a lesser extent than the first box. I am a big fan of Freud blades, and own several. However, given that the carrying case is "part of the product I purchased", the quality of the carrying case (and thus the product I purchased), is ridiculously low. I did not return the second set because the quality of the carrying case is so poor, that I am not sure I can actually receive a pristine product via UPS shipping.

I am also an avid amateur woodworker.  For that reason I own a ton of different types of clamps.  In the past I always used either "F" style or wooden hand-screws to hold the cabinets together for joining.  This past winter my wife and I turned our bonus room into an art studio for her.  The remodeling called for the installation of several cabinets along 2 walls.  Since I would largely be working by myself I decided to invest in a pair of Pony Cabinet Claws.  Wow, these things are game changers.  I strongly recommend them.

8550	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	One of the divisions in my company is building heavy timber structures. I have bigger saws but this is the one that gets most of the use. It feels like a regular worm drive but will cut nearly 4" deep, perfect for 4"x6" and 4"x8 rafters and joinery. We even use it on the bigger timbers and just flip the timber to access the other side for the second cut. It's easier than breaking out the big saw. If there's lot's of big timbers to cut the big saw would be better but for most of our joinery and cut offs we use this one. I wish it had more power but it still does fine. A bump up in power requires 240 volts and converters, too much headache. The blade that comes with it is pretty good but put a real good carbide blade on this thing and you can do some very cool work! You won't be disappointed.

Starting off with my own woodworking experience and the input from a lot of contractors I know, I  determined what features people wanted and needed in a stand. Easy to use,  portable, fast to set up and rugged. I built several prototypes and each  time took them out to jobsites where I could put them into the hands of  people who work with the tools every day. One day I had 3 different  contractors actually pull their wallets out of their pockets and try to buy  my prototype. When I told them it wasn't for sale, they each put in an  order and got the first 3 to come off the line.  That's the MS-2000. It's a  good product. Good luck.  Jeff

  I guess I am getting wordy. Bessey's rock. They are stronger, (heard a crunching sound when I tightened one up against the edge of some fresh glued melamine, so go gently) heavier duty, precise (unless you over tighten and temporarily warp the bar, which causes a miniscule off angle. I know I am getting critical here.) And they look cool sitting on the rack.
First, if they drilled and tapped the open end, and put a plate there:  You would have a storage place for all the extra bits they give you to adapt it to different routers.  I bought this guide for use at work.  I've had the same guide for about five or six years now at home.  The pin to make it work as a circle guide was lost about a month after I bought the one at home.  One of the guys that works for me is a hobby machinist, so he is going to drill and tap the body, and make a plate for the end so we can store the extra parts in the guide.
The locking system was also not working at all, but then I discovered a plastic shim in the box that had fallen off the locking tongue. I glued it on with CA glue and it's now working as it should.

The bottom line for me is that the power and  height adjustment features outweigh the negatives of this router, and, when  you compare the price, it seems to edge out DeWalt, its biggest competitor.  With many of the negatives, we  aren't talking about anything bad, we are  just saying that this router is ever so slightly behind other routers on  the market in some ways.  But for use as a free-hand router, it's got to be  in the top of its category.

7985	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Read the instructions very carefully before assembling, especially regarding  the roller height adjustment.  A redesign of this feature is needed to make it easier to change the height to accomodate different miter saw table heights. As it is the square steel tubing holding the rollers can only be raised or lowered with a hammer tap once you assemble the stand. A second minor fault is the latch holding the stand together in the folded position. The latching mechanism disengages easily causing the stand to unfold. This is both unsafe and frustrating while transporting. Also, storing the stand upright against a wall is difficult as the tires make it roll out. This a quality built stand. The roller height adjustment problem seems curiously out of line with the otherwise great design of this stand.
The Table or the Stand should have come with a tool holder for the collet wrench and the miter gauge.  I ended up building a little tool rack from wood, to keep these things handy.

6794	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This truly is one of those tools that no shop should be without. It is a straightedge, cutting guide/ fence, clamp . . . I have completed several projects with this tool and think how simple and useful it is each and every time. It is solid and lightweight. It sets up easily, place it on your workpiece, slide the adjustable end to the edge of it and check your dimensions, then flip the lock lever. Thats it, when your done, flip the lever again and lift it off. No C clamps or quick grips in the way, not even the the levers are in the way because they are no wider than the tool itself, so you can cut, mark, rout on either side. I have ripped various sheet goods, scored drywall using this guide and a utility knife, run jig & circular saws and a router, all with excellent results. I have the 24, 36 and 50 inch models, all perform equally well.  My only complaint, and it really isn't the tool's fault is that if your workpiece is not prperly supported in the middle, the base plate of whatever tool you are using can ride under the Clamp-N-Tool guide and foil your cut. I generally press down lightly just ahead of the tool to keep it in plane. With a router this is difficult ( dangerous ) to do, so I have ordered the FTR Series with the router plate in the 96" length, I haven't received it yet so no review for now.  Hope this review helps you, these guides sure have helped me!

Unfortunately, there are  two shortcomings that cost it a star.  First, there are no adjustment stops for the 0 and 45 degree bevel.  Second, the foot on mine is out of alignment with the blade by almost 1/8", making it impossible to cut against a rip board.  I've used Skill circular saws for years so I'm not surprised - I just hoped they might have done better with this model. On the positive side, Skill stuck with a steel foot which doesn't scratch or drag on lumber and like aluminum does.  The only decent aluminum foot I've ever used was the nickle plated Hitachi (which appears to have been discontinued).  Wake up tool industry!  We have stainless clad aluminum cookware - why can't we get a stainless clad aluminum saw foot?

It took 5 weeks, 4 calls to WMH, and the receipt of three more 22mm guide bars before they could get me the right part.
But blast gates are mostly used in a several machine set up, and for that I cannot recommend this product.
Plus, it works as advertised, appears to be very durable with decent ends.
4669	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been a Contractor for over 30 years. Recently most of my work has been home repairs and remodeling. I do a lot of the work myself including the trim work. The saws I use are Dewalt 12" mitres. So until now I have also used their blades. They did a good job  for the most part. It came time to replace my current blade so I came to Amazon to check their pricing. That is when I came across the Freud thin kerf blade. It had great reviews and was about the same price as the Dewalt. So I gave it a try. Real glad I did. It outperforms the Dewalt hands down. Due to the reduced weight you get less handle bounce when you first start the saw. It cuts through Oak and other hardwoods like butter. There is very little to no tear out. That is about all you can ask from a saw. I am now a Freud fan. Just put one on my 10" table saw. Will not buy anything else!
2572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works well.

4605	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this instead of the blue high price non-Jet model because it hooks at the back of the fence rail as well as on the front.

When you install these blades you have to remove the inside washer on the table saw I used the outside washer to replace it.  I replaced the outside washer with a thinner one.  Not a big deal for me because I had one in the shop.  You could go to the hardware store and pick one up.

I've been using  sawzall's for quite a while now and I have always admired Milwaukee  Sawzalls for their dependability and durability. When I finally had to  replace my old one and discovered that Milwaukee had introduced a new  sawzall to their line, it was a simple choice for me. The added power and  easy of use make this an idea choice if your building something new,  tearing something down, or fabricating something for a job. I would highly  recomend this product to anyone who wanted to purchase a sawzall.
These bulbs claim that they do not flash. However when I dim them to 50% they will randomly flash for a while, then they will be fine for a while then flash again. This is VERY irritating. We have the same fixtures using the same light switch with different bulbs in another room and they do not flash ever. We switched bulbs around to multiple configurations and these bulbs would still flash while the other bulbs did not, not matter the configuration.
9987	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Did what they were advertised to do. I only used one of them for about 30 plugs because of the size I needed. Used them in a hand drill. Just a bit of practice.
7412	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This clamp is the ONLY clamp to have.  First, only buy pipe clamps.  Second, only buy Jorgensen--they have smooth action and easy re-setting, and they are cost-effective.  Third, only buy this model, with the crank handle, because you can get the  highest torque for the least strain on your hands/fingers.  With pipe clamps, all you need is the appropriate length of threaded pipe--which is CHEAP.  Go to the hardware store, buy a 12" length of their threaded pipe--you've got a great clamp.  Buy a 36" length of their threaded pipe--you've got another great clamp.  Know what I'm sayin'?  You can have loads and loads of variable length clamps for CHEAP!!!

2064	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This sander literally is a horse!!!!! Big,heavy,and powerful. So powerful I dial the variable speed back to control it.

5603	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am very pleased with this product. The assembly instructions were clear, it was in perfect condition, everything is straight and it is heavy enough for me not to worry about it moving around while using my router. The ProLift Router Adjustment System fits perfectly along with my Porter Cable Router making this a complete system. After I have used this for a while, I will add to my review.
All in all I am very pleased with these clamps and will buy more.
1715	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Huh. So I had a love-hate relationship with sanders. My first sander was actually a Bosch finishing sander. I used it to refinish a table once, and spent half four hours trying to get rid of swirl marks, then had a tingling sensation in my wrist for the next day. I eventually went with a nice 5" Makita random orbit sander, but it wasn't any gentler on my wrists, and on top of that, with round pads, it was basically useless for corners or any even moderately complicated shapes.
In addition, if your hoses are stiff you may have an issue with the cover coming off of the bucket, but once you turn the vacuum on the suction should bring it down to create a nice seal. But if your worried about it coming off you could just attach a few screws in your bucket and put a bungee strap over it to secure it in place. I did something similar to this when I built a little cart for the bucket and lid to ride on above my vacuum to it would all move together as an assembly.

4577	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After a few years using the factory blades that came with my table saw and sliding miter, I decided it was time for an upgrade. Ths was part in preparation for a few big projects. After a few weeks of use, all I can do or say now it to kick myself for not buying one sooner! I've been breaking down a few hundred board feet of 4/4 and 6/4 red oak and some 8/4 new and old growth pine, all anywhere from 4 to 12 inches wide and this saw/blade hasn't skipped a beat. I should note that my saw is a craftsman sliding miter, certainly not the most powerful out there. I would certainly have had bogging issues on the old setup but not this blade. If I wasn't watching, I wouldn't even know this thing was cutting. It's quiet, smooth, no bogs or burns, no chips or tear out issues, and the price is right! Leaves a nice end grain finish that requires minimal, if any, finish work left depending on your project. Definitely recommended (I'm equally impressed with my new Freud rip cut blade for my table saw), and certainly where I will be headed when it's time for replacement!
Problem #5.  This one's minor as I didn't expect it to do much anyway.  But the "blower" moves about as much air as a flea fart.  it's pretty much useless and is more in the way than functional.

3179	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Ive been using three Delta 50-345 mobile bases for years with 1.5 X 1.5 oak for the frame.  I recently purchased a band saw and I was pleased to see the Delta mobile base still available.  The quality of this new base is at least as good as those Ive had for years.  Using oak for the frame is definitely the way to go as there is very little flexing when using oak over pine 2 X 2s.
 - a better dust management system.  I will not use this sander inside the shop.  Also, I am left handed so my tendency is to drive the sander with my left hand.  With the sander at full power in my left hand It only took a few seconds to receive a face full of dust due to the "blow by" resulting from the poor fitting dust bag.  That said, the sander is balanced so well, using my right hand with this tool is not a problem.

4222	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm giving this 5 stars because it did exactly what it's supposed to do and is fairly priced. But, I never needed it after it was installed. There's just no reason to be cutting 12" resaws on a 14" bandsaw -- you need a bigger bandsaw for that stuff.
Now... on the positive side... well, gee... if you're using a Forrest blade and you haven't warped it or something, the blade's cutting wood like hot butter anyway... So why use this?  I've noticed no perceptible difference when the dampener is attached, yet still... I leave it on.  I guess it gives me a little more security knowing that my blade is more rigid than without it.

I read the reviews online extensively, and I'm a sucker for having the right tool with no compromise. This blade is everything that was promised, and more! Forget any complaints on here that seem half-baked - this saw blade is the real deal. Try to find a better blade. The next best will save you $40, but resharpening from Forrest so many times, with great attention to craftsmanship, makes this blade a very smart investment. The next best blade would be tossed after one sharpening, if it would maintain any quality that long.

However, one time during use, I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel.  The tool sucked the cord up, wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing, and grinding the motor to a halt.  The cord was easily repaired, but the drive belt (which connects the motor to the drive wheel) was shot and needed to be replaced.  The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord, and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times.  Other than that, the tool has performed flawlessly.

The shroud is approximately 6 inches in diameter at the intake, permitting full range of motion for a 5 inch pad.

I have not noticed a difference in the amount of dust collected based upon the position of the shroud, although the instructions say that it should be "placed as close as possible to the top surface of the pad."  The outlet of the shroud is the Porter-Cable one-inch outside diameter standard.

9067	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wanted a framing nailer for personal projects so spent considerable time researching on-line at various sites.  I finally called a friend who is a builder and asked what he used and recommended.  He said he owns and uses several different brands of nailers, but when he gets busy on a site he always reaches for his Paslode first.  Based mainly on the recommendation of a professional, I purchased a used Paslode.  My first use has been framing two new rooms in my basement.  Not having to share an enclosed space with my compressor or stretch an air line from outside was famous.  The Paslode was quick, convenient, and worked like a charm.  It's a small thing, but the squared body of the engine lets you lay it down on the floor and the handle remains upright and easy to quickly grab when you need it.  When I first got it I suffered a few misfires and slow operation, so I gave it a thorough cleaning per the operators manual.  The process was relatively simple if you follow the book and the difference was immediate.  It doesn't bump fire, but will spit out fasteners as fast as I can pull the trigger.  The one thing I did not read about in any of my research are the fumes.  Because it uses butane fuel the exhaust has a distinct odor to it.  In an enclosed environment like my basement you really start to notice it after awhile, and it gave me a slight headache until I opened a window.  Bottom line: I do not regret my decision to purchase the Paslode as my only framing nailer.  All my other nailers (Hitachi coil roofing, Bostitch and Senco finish nailers, and Bostitch brad nailer)are air nailers, but for the convenience and ease of use I love just being able to grab my Paslode and drive a few nails without all the setup of compressor and air lines first.  Now I'm looking for more projects so I have an excuse to use it :o)

UPDATE:  I am now upgrading this book light to 5 stars because I feel it's worth it in spite of its high cost.  I just replaced one of the 2 lights I initially bought because my dog got hold of one of them and chewed it to pieces. I value book lights so much that I can't stand the thought of being without one on one of our long night-time drives, and these book lights have held up so well (except for the dog chewing up one of them).  Thus I decided to replace the one I lost with the exact same model.  The problem I have is because I married a New York driver, which could make anybody's nerves raw.  Reading a book in the car at night (or in the daytime, for that matter) keeps me from watching the road while he's driving and thus keeps me from turning into a nervous wreck before we reach our destination.

Don't expect the circular pieces to stay white though, they seem to lose their paint rather quickly.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that it's too difficult to remove the motor from the base.  I do the router dance - I clamp the router between my knees and twist the motor away from the base with all I got to seperate the two pieces.  Ugghh!! Wayyy too cavemanish.

  I also own the Freud Diablo D0860S, which I like almost as much.  It's about 1/3 cheaper and I think gives a slightly smoother cut, due to greater tooth count.  Cut quality of the two blades is the same for practical purposes.  The LU91R008 gets my vote due to the way it slices through trim with almost no effort.  Over the course of the workday I believe the LU91R008's ease of use will have a big impact on user fatigue, resulting in fewer mistakes, better quality and greater productivity.

3690	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I always wanted Porter Cable belt sander. I had an old Ryobi and it lasted for years doing continual carpentry work...but I knew it was not a great machine.  I got this 352VS from Amazon 5 years ago, put about 8 hours on it (no longer doing carpentry full-time)...and a few weeks ago did some light-duty sanding on a piece of furniture.  The belt started slipping and then stopped.  Opened the tool and found the drive pulley is plastic, not metal.  It had sheared at the "hub".  Seems foolish for Porter Cable to have replaced at 40-cent metal pulley with a 15 cent plastic pulley but that's what they did.  My local tool repair guy told me they did this for a while.  Now they are back to metal, supposedely, but who knows what else they changed.  Now that DeWalt has bought Porter Cable, who knows what things will be like in the future.

One interesting thing.  Klutz that I am, I managed to bring the guard down into the blade and take a chunk out of the middle piece (the 'upper' guard).  While the saw continued to work fine I discovered that there is a wind tunnel effect under the guard and the blade would whistle loudly.  When I put in the replacement part (Delta parts and service is excellent, by the way) I found I had to carefully adjust the guard to get rid of the noise.  Now it's fine and I'm back to being a happy sawyer.

EVERY expensive table saw has blade-stiffeners like these as STOCK equipment. Superb saws (>$10,000) have stiffeners / dampeners for a reason: Their engineers understand the importance of keeping blade-vibration to a minimum.
These are 40 to 50% less expensive than the Bessey K-body clamps, so you can get MORE clamps for the same investment.
2392	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I really like this light. I brought this one to replace the first light I have had for a several years.  The first one was out of warranty and the flex broke near the base of the base of the light. It still worked, but you couldn't hold it in position.  Hoping they have improved the design. You can bend this to just about position to get light on something and free both hands to work on it. Uses the standard Dewalt 18v rechargeable batteries. Has a spot in the light to carry a spare blub, it's near the blub, remove the cover like you are going to replace the blub and you will see the small hole to drop a blub in. My first one came if a spare, now they don't. The blub lasts a long time, but if you don't want to be without light drop in a spare just in case. I own three different Dewalt 18v lights and if I need to work and free both hands this is the one I pick off the shelf. I gave it 4 of 5 stars because of the concern it too may break the flex again and need replaced. Amazon's price was great, cheaper to buy the new light than the part to repair the old one.
Also, you should consider making or buying a broader base for hand-held work with this. The stock base is big compared to most routers, but the machine sure benefits from having my homemade base. (one-foot square, 3/8" thick lexan)

I mainly use beading, round-over, and small straight cutting bits to modify oak, poplar, and MDF trim.  The router's small size makes it easy to modify trim in place when necessary and to work on small pieces.  The base's diameter provides a really good balance between stability and small size.
One everything is in place and adjusted the Uniguard is a pleasure to work with.  It never seems to be in the way and there is plenty of clearance.

Dewalt is a bit stingy with saw blades, only 2 come with the saw.  I'm learning that blade supply can be a tough hunt, and Amazon's selection is not either a good start or final destination.

The hammer in question was, of course, a 16 ounce straight claw leather handled Estwing, and later, when I got old enough to do more than fetch tools--when I actually started swinging a hammer myself--then I understood.  That Estwing was just plain RIGHT.  It felt right, it struck right, it was absolutely rigid and true, and despite the way the old leather handle may have looked to my childish sensibilities, the thing just felt really good in your hand.

5495	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.  It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.  Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.  Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.  I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.  And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
Just remember to never strike any other hardened steel with this quality of hammer. Since it is hardened, you can crack other hardened steel tools with it. That's another reason I don't like nail-sets. Since some are made of brittle-hard steel, they can break. Small chunks fly off. That's why you need safety glasses for using something as simple as a hammer, not just for power tools. Believe me, I found out the hard way. It's no fun getting a hot piece of steel removed from your leg. Plus blood looks unprofessional on white overalls. If you DO need a nail-set, get the good ones made of tempered steel. The slight difference in cost is miniscule and could prevent injury.
The parts are very well made and machined - no compromises anywhere.  Of course, when I figured it out I spent nearly as much to enhance my 14" band saw as it would have cost to by an 18" saw in the first place.  But that's another issue entirely.  If you are trying to improve what you have, this kit is the way to go.  If you're shopping for a new saw than the standard advice is buy the very biggest you can - it's cheaper in the long run.
I found myself reaching for the Jorgensen & Dewalt clamps for most of the glue-ups of the small parts. The Jorgensen is definately the most robust of the 4, has the best ergonomics, and easily the largest pads. There is a lot more product for the money put into the Jorgensen clamp! The dewalt is also excellent in function, as it clamps well, pads stay flat, has the largest throat depth, tied with the Jorgensen for max jaw capacity. I did not notice any functional difference due to the smaller pad surface area on a clamp this small. The Dewalt's are not as ergonomic as the Jorgensen clamp, but the smaller pads DO allow it to fit the 1-1/4" dog holes in my workbench, while the Jorgensen's are too bulky to fit through the holes.

I called Delta immediately and to my suprise, a human answered the phone!  No waiting, no music on hold and no message telling me how important my call was to them. They took my information and they agreed to send out replacement parts.  Satisfied that I wouldn't need to return the rest of the unit, I decided to go ahead and install it.
I brought this tool home on a Sunday and had to cut up 15 pallets to downsize them for garbage disposal.  If you've EVER had the fun task of cutting up pallets, you can appreciate that the wood is FULL of nails (everywhere) and it's genuinely very hard, dense wood.  Has to be to support the loads that pallets carry.  I chucked in a new Milwaukee blade and 30 minutes later there was over 10 pounds (yes I weighed it!!) of sawdust and a BUNCH of small boards left.  Saying the Milwaukee cut the boards like a hot knife through butter, in my mind, does a disservice to the hot knife!  I ran the saw until it became so hot I couldn't hold it anymore, which is being overly severe to any tool; I just wanted to see if Milwaukee's vaunted reputation was as deserved as people say.  It is.  The saw NEVER stopped running; I honestly believe I could have put on gloves and kept going, but did allow the saw to cool down and resumed cutting.  If a nail was hit, it bucked a little and just went on through it.  It's a beast, plain and simple.

Now here is the fun fact that refutes some negative reviews. When the rollers are positioned as I described ( front roller well in front of the blade and back roller an inch or two behind the blade) you can move the fence to within a 16th inch of the blade and rip VERY narrow pieces. The rollers are actually to the LEFT of the blade while the fence is close to the RIGHT of the blade. This is VERY handy for making narrow strips such as those we use for edge-banding or long strips for boat building.

Second, my first cut after installing: burned wood. I figured there might be some shmew do I did a couple more and kept getting the same result. My conclusion is this blade is not a horrible blade but is definitely mostly hype. Returning.
Be warned.  I am new to using pneumatic tools and did not know that I needed to buy connectors to make it usable.  Luckily I bought a swivel plug ( Bostitch BTFP72333 Industrial 1/4-Inch Series Swivel Plug with 1/4-Inch NPT Male Thread) and had the female connector around my house.  I highly recommend the swivel plug.  It made the job much easier.
  I think this kit is a great idea. It might be all plastic, but is ideally suited for the purpose. Highly recommended.

It only comes with two cheap blades so buy more and better.  I am a beginner scroller but I am getting better quickly with this machine.  I use a 4x4 block to hold up the arm when I change blades or do internals as you see in the pics.  Maybe the more expensive saw like Henger is better but for now this is good.

Others have had this problem, while others have had no problem at all, so it's probably hit-or-miss with this product.  I am going to try to modify it so that it's usable.  Don't waste your money.
Update: One poster mentioned the case. I neglected that part of the review. Where would this drill be without the case? Kudos to Dewalt for including a quality case for this tool. It stores the drill and the all-important bits to make it handy. My case is just as old as the drill, and it hasn't broken, warped, or cracked.
The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life, unlike the the itty-bittys, which I found went through batteries like crazy. Of course, the LED "bulbs" don't burn out like the itty-bitty blubs (and the XtraFlex2 doesn't heat up from its bulbs, either). The XtraFlex2's integrated battery pack is also great; no getting tangled up in a cord while you're in bed.
Definitely a great gift item .

I've also owned several other types of Estwing hammers and they're all just as good. You will never go wrong investing the extra $10-$20 for the Estwing since you will get better results and will never have to buy another one as long as you live.

Long-term addition: I've had this drill for a few years now and there is one thing I should mention.  If you may need it for the type of work where you need to have one hand holding your work while drilling with the other, you may want to get something lighter and smaller.  I think Milwaukee makes a Holeshooter that is not called "Magnum".  It has a smaller motor.  Anyhow, between this drill and my Makita 12V 3/8" Ni-MH cordless things are pretty much covered.  If I were to do it again, I would probably get the Milwaukee with the 1/2" chuck & side handle for the heavy duty stuff and a good 12 or 14.4 cordless for everything else.  Just keep in mind that the 1/2" chuck on the Milwaukees won't take super-small bits.
I may have to invest in one of these for myself, after seeing how nice it is.

I do not think they are weatherproof but after flashing and the trim, they will be protected enough.

I recommend getting the 24" track also.  It's long enough to cover most of the fence and you only have to install it once.  If you need a different position you loosen two screws.  If you didn't have the track you would have to install the buddies each time you needed a new position.  It's just more efficient with the track.

Many woodworkers use various router set-ups to make grooves and there are times when that makes sense, but for those perfectly sized grooves and clean cuts nothing matches a good dado set. If you do this kind of work, then this set is a good choice. If you want to spend more, then certainly the Forrest dado set would be a very nice choice indeed.

2982	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	While looking around in the tool department at the local Sears Store here  in Fairbanks, Alaska, I noticed this sander on the shelf.  I had heard how  great Random Orbital Sanders were from various people, and since it was my  birthday, I snatched it up and took it home.  To date, I have used this  sander for about everything!  Initially, I used it to sand kitchen cabinets  that I built from scratch and faced with Hard Maple. Then, after finding it  did a better overall job than a belt sander, I sanded two cedar patio decks  (ten by twelve ft, and 8-x 12 ft).  I then used it to refinish the capping  board (2"X 6" on my eaves) that had been badly weathered.  I have  used this sander without mercy for hours on end; I have dropped it from  height approaching twenty feet, and have soundly thrashed it on too many  projects to name.  In short, it still operates like the day I took it out  of it's box...four years ago. The grit of sandpaper you install determines  this sander's versatility!  A great buy for the money!

The yellow rubber pads at the end of the jaws have a smooth finish, so if traction is required, you might not always have a good grip. The depth of the clamp is about 2.4, and you can usually increase the effective surface area, by placing a suitable flat object between the jaws, although there is a limit to what can be achieved.
2624	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this for a few weeks now and it works well. I also use it with some special blades that cut metal. It cuts through 3/16 steel with no problem and it doesn't make the machine bawk at all. It does  need to be mounted down though it it tends to vibrate a bit making it hard to do precision work.
3038	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I replaced the base plate with this so I could better watch the cutting edge do it's work, cutting a curved thumb relief on banjo fingerboards - before I had to do it by feel.

816	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Don't do what I did and ASSUME the length would be OK.  The bulbs are nice and they worked as long as I didn't put the lenses back on my light housings.

In the meantime, I purchased a cheaper ($39.95) thin kerf Freud blade.  It is just fine and I can buy 3 of them for the cost of 1 Forrest WWII and one sharpening.  The Freud thin kerf cuts just as quickly with a nice finish.

8704	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I finally had the opportunity to put this to use.  I needed to cut some 15/32 inch dadoes to fit what supposedly is 1/2" plywood.  Following the guide on the case insert, I stacked the left outside blade, a 1/16" spacer, a 1/8" chipper, the .020" & .012 shims and the right outside blade.  I set the height and fence and proceeded to make my cuts.  The results in poplar were excellent.  The dado width was spot on and the 15/32" plywood fit into the dado beautifully.  The edges were perfect and the bottoms were flat.  There was minuscule tear out when exiting the dado (maybe a half dozen wood fibers not cleanly cut off).

8287	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this set for my Stopsaw and it has performed well so far. The biggest downside was the literature which is printed on the back of the graphics sheet as seen on the blade set. It was very confusing trying to figure out what combination of chippers and spacers were needed for any given size. The chart is on the backside but making sense of it was not easy, at least for me. A call to their support line and a search online for the information was all that was needed. As far as quality of cut, it's clean and square. What more could you want or need? You can spend more but I'm not sure what that would accomplish other than spending more....

2938	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	You don't realize how nice it is to have fresh blades until you replace them...now the wood passes through faster, quieter and smoother and with 2-sided you can flip them when done. Be advised, these are not carbide tungsten or anything crazy, they'll dull a bit after passing wood for 15-20 minutes if the wood is hard so best to think of these like disposible razors: great for a while but know when it's time to move along.
4948	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I own 4 (now 5) Forrest blades.  There are NONE finer.  High quality, American made.  I will never buy another Freud blade or Home Depot/Lowe's special unless I'm cutting wet lumber or suspect wood (with old nails in it).  Forrest cuts finer, smoother bottoms, and cooler.  What's more, there's actually enough carbide on the teeth to have them sharpened.  These are not disposable blades by any measure.  They will turn your $200 contractor saw into a true woodworking machine.
Other than the much more easy to read numbers and the weight, the biggest difference between this and my cheapo combination square is the ruler lock.  On the Stanley, I have to really crank down on the knurled knob to lock the slide and even then it tends to move, but the lock on the Starrett has a much more refined and better feel to it and it locks the ruler perfectly every time with much less effort.

I am always amazed at how fast I can cut through cement with this saw.  I just finished building a deck and I had to cut 2' x 2' holes in the patio.  It cut like butter.  No bogging down.  The only thing that slowed it down was the hot warped blade because this thing cut so fast.  I find that I like the rafter hanger that you can flip out.  It's handy to have a way to hang your saw and not have to hang it from your cord.  You can't go wrong with this saw.

9872	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	"SQUEEZY" and "PULLY" that is the deck building duo names for my wife and I.  We reconditioned our large deck with all new 16ft boards.  This tool was awesome.  We have super straight boards now and it looks fabulous...darling.  I have no suggested design changes nor do I have anything really negative to say about it.  It works exactly as I had hoped.  So when she and I worked together using this tool, we primarily used it for squeezy work pushing the loose board closer to the previously secured board. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to install deck boards.  It is not as easy to use by 1 person as I read in an earlier review.
For example we just used this last week to reframe a cathedral ceiling on an existing home. Lifting heavy LVL beams that are longer than the finished room you're working in is definately a workout done by hand off of ladders. We used the Telpro to lift the beams up into the attic. The tilt feature worked perfect and allowed them to slide up into place without damaging the walls or wearing us out. The lift made the job a breeze, just like it does for many other tasks.

I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second, the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.
That said, this is my primary "go to" hammer and is a constant companion on my tool belt. I do have a 22 oz Estwing framer that I used for primarily demolishing, but 99% of the time, the 16 oz is on my side with my other tools.

  I mated this stiffner up to the Forrest Woodworker II on my table saw, and I am getting cuts so smooth, you don't even have to sand the edge. It is finish quality perfectly smooth. (The Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence helps, giving me a true exact paralell line with the blade.)
And beyond all of these features lies the best of all - clamp jaw parallelism. You can always rest easy knowing that these clamps are not bowing the panel or whatever it is that you are clamping, because the jaws always always stay parallel to each other.

About the only complaint I have about it is for the price, it should come with a work light. Even the cheapest poorest quality saw I've tried had a light on it. Almost $500 for it and they want another $30 Bucks for a work light. And it would be nice if they threw in the stand for it too for that price. Its a sweet machine but I think they want a little too much just for their name. That's why I didn't give it the other star.

Everything was working fine, then I went to turn it on and there was a bright flash followed by an explosion and a shower of glass across the entire bathroom. It is going to be a huge pain to clean up all those little splinters. It also destroyed part of the light fixture the bulb was in which was also made of glass. I will be throwing the rest of these away.
This shorter (< 35mm) base bulb is the exact size replacement for my lights.  The standard (37mm) bulb would not have fit.  This bulb produces the same amount & type of light as the 4x more expensive bulb from HD that clians to burn whiter, brighter and longer than other bulbs.

So, thinking maybe it's my drill, I go to 3 mass retailers with the word "Home" in their name, their competitor that starts with L, and another retailer that has "Ace" in their name (because Amazon deletes their competition's names).... at ALL STORES BUT ONE, 8 STORES, the adjustable handle could not be moved, by me or by staff.  One was easily adjustable.

2905	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this saw at a local woodworking store while it was on sale a few weeks ago. I had been using a Hitachi CW - 40 which works well for a low end saw, but the DeWalt is a horse of another color - Bright Yellow!  Now, the nuts and bolts: QUIET and vibration free. Big smooth table, easily trued after making angle cuts. The blade tensioner is right there in front and stays where you set it. Likewise, when you re-clamp the blade, just bring it to the tension number you had it on and it stays there. Easy, EASY blade changes. The wing clamps hold the blade by hand tightening alone. I haven't had a blade slip out of the clamps yet. The stand is a must. The rear leg will adjust up or down to give you the table angle that is comfortable for your use. It is fairly tall, but a regular workshop stool will put you at the right height, making it comfortable to work with. The blower is powerful and clears away the dust. It too stays where you place it and it is easier to bend and position that I have found on the other saws. The hold-down clamp works fine, but like most scroll sawyers, I don't use one and I removed it.
4673	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Again, if it comes from Dewalt, it's going to work well! Plenty of gut's to do any biscuit job. Accurate, and plenty of power. On the lite side as far as weight  goes too.

I installed this blade and ran a few test cuts... I was blown away by the effortlessness of the cut and the incredibly smooth finish on the edge.  With my previous blade, cutting a 1x12 at a 45 bevel was a struggle, but this blade made the cut like it was nothing and left an edge that looked like it had already been sanded.
I used the 5L SNAP-BACK arbor for the 2 1/2" saw. Both arbors are designed for quickly changing the size of one saw size to another, another nice feature. Lastly, I used the 2 1/2" hole saw to drill through 1/8" thick aluminum. It cut well and made it through in less than a minute. Had to use the Speed-Slot again, aluminum being softer than the steel and wedging itself inside the saw.

3082	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	There's a fair amount of work cutting the wood just so and drilling/bolting everything together, but this is very solid.  I built it to support my wood planer, which is about 25" x 48" and weighs a LOT.  It's remarkable how much more I use the tool now that it's easy to wheel out and do a quick job, blow it off and roll it back to its parking spot.  Well worth the money for me.  Now that said, I bought a similar set at Harbor Freight for about $5 less and it's a little different - instead of the flip up/down thing to make it mobile, this one is on four casters and rolls around until/unless you lock it down with two screw sets; I put my band saw on this one.  I would say either is fine, but I would give a small margin to the less expensive one from Harbor Freight, but it's a close call.

No more messing with making 2 adjustments (bevel and miter) on your saw.  Set these up once for the width of the crown molding that you're cutting, and you'll typically only have to make your miter adjustments, which is easy when your DeWalt has the positive stops for the crown molding cuts.  In addition, due to the way they hold the crown molding, they eliminate the mistake of having the molding facing the wrong way when you're making your cuts.

PC was the better of those two, but both would rattle your teeth.  Then based on advice of some folks I trust, I bought the Milwaukee.  What a change for the better.  The orbital action is awesome!  The saw cuts through anything without complaining, and without punishing the operator.  The lack of vibration makes up for a little extra weight.  The tooless blade change system is a pleasure to use - simple and effective.  The shoe adjustable shoe is easy to adjust and hholds its position.  You should always use it.  The shaft is significantly larger in cross section than other saws.  This saw is tough (!), but gentle on the operator.

I recently purchased a Freud Diablo class D1280X (Diablo is Freud's mid-level line), also from Amazon, and found that in some ways it equaled and even surpassed the LU91. (I reviewed the D1280X blade on Amazon, too.) For one thing, in spite of having more teeth (80 vs 72), it cuts faster. This is because instead of a negative hook angle it has a slightly positive one. The positive hook allows the blade to lift sawdust into the dust port at the back of the saw. (Sliding miter saws are not particularly good at scavenging dust, so I modified the saw by installing a removable dust scoop under the port to facilitate the scavenging process.)

Now a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a  carpenter will own right after a hammer.  I wouldn't be surprised if every  saw here on Amazon got five stars, because everyone likes something a  little different with their saws.  You have to decide which features are  right for you.  There are almost more opinions about which saw is better  than there are saws.  That's why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing.  But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the  sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work.  This is  also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing  saws.  It was time for a change.  No saw is perfect - here are the gigs:  This saw is a bit noisy.  It has a good blade guard but it still would be  nice to have a blade brake.  Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and  make one that has a left blade.  That would make my day.

First, the router worked great with very smooth and powerful operation in all the tasks that I used it for...which may be beyond what it is supposed to be used for.

Protect the threads on the ends of the pipes, use the crutch feet to protect your floors and feet from the pipes.
Update:  It's been another 1 1/2 years and this saw still works great.  I still find that I need a regular circular saw though.  The torque on this saw is so strong that it will really twist in your hand when you pull the trigger.  I prefer to use the circular saw on precision work, like doors.  But that's the nature of a worm saw.  Nothing slows this saw down.  It's durable too.  I'm hard on my tools.  This has met the task.
I almost ALWAYS try to use power tools to make my life easier, but in this case, the hand tools wins by a long shot.  It makes VERY quick work of the needed cuts.

6934	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are great, should have gotten them long time ago. My 16' extension ladder is a type 3 (200lb rating), so the side rails of the ladder which the levelers attach to are a bit narrower than most ladders, and that made it a little more challenging to attach the levelers to. But I got them on and they work beautifully (well, as beautiful as a ladder leveler can get, anyway - lol). They're sturdy and solid. I've actually used them more often on level ground to extend my ladder to the max equally on both legs to reach those tough high areas. They work very well over stairs provided the stair treads are wide enough. Ironically, adding the levelers to the ladder also increased the overall width of the ladder causing the ladder to be just a tad too wide to fit over narrow stairs. (Not all stairs are the same width! Whoda thunk it?) Out of the 3 houses that I've painted tall walls by the stairs, two of them had stairs wide enough for the ladder to safely fit on, and one did not. So I guess if you really want to have all your bases covered, you need to buy one of those Pivit levelers, too. But I really do like these Universal Level-Ett ladder levelers. Works great over most stairs (provided they're wide enough), and they've turned my 16' ladder into a 17' ladder, and that is very valuable to me when I'm painting those tall 2-story walls.

For the extra hundred and fifty (approx) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity, longer quill stroke, larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs, etc.
The one main drawback, and it isn't terrible with the 16 oz Estwings, is the pinging when striking a nail. It is still there some, but not enough at all to dissuade me from using it often.

So it's important that the heavy blades come with a rugged case to store them in. With this product, the case does not hold the blades properly; it is flimsy and cracks easily as noted by other reviewers - the blades are held apart by a thin layer of cheap, very fragile plastic that crumbles with the slightest movement of the heavy blades. Also, the metal shims are corroded.
If you think you'll do more than one project in your lifetime though, spend the 90 bucks.  It's SO MUCH faster than the cordless drill approach.  And you won't over/under drive your screws (assuming you set the depth correctly to begin with, of course).

Construction: The base is made of a thinner steel.  It's so thin the stop lever has already dented the base during shipping.  There is so much plastic I almost feel like this could have come from Harbor Freight.  Although Dewalt and Ridgid also use plastic, theirs feels more solid, thicker, and there's less use of it.  The guard, again thinner and flimsier than others.  The deflector, again, thin and flimsy. Already bent in the box.  Makita has a plastic safety button.  I don't see why a safety button is even necessary.  The button  a lot of play and I can see this thing breaking soon.
The purpose of BARS is to make the clamp more rigid so it does not flex during clamping.

7049	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought 2 sets to use on my old no name clamps and they didn't fit but, they fit perfectly on the Bessey clamps I just bought so I will be buying several dozen more. For those who complain about the price, $2.25 per clamp is cheap insurance. It just takes one project to be damaged from clamp jaws to realize that. These pads don't stick to my work after being left for days either.  *****

Despite what others have said, there are the correct number of bolts. You just have to be careful about which ones you use and for what. The instructions are terrible. The contrast is set so high on the copy that it's blurred and hard to make out diagrams.

In the 1980's Porter Cable updated both the 330 speedblock, and 505 with the then innovative "StickIt" sandpaper system.

It is a bit heavier than I originally thought it would be, but that does help with vibration and stability, and doesn't to affect its manuverability. It is very comfortable to hold and use. The lever type trigger is a plus, much more comfortable than the conventional type trigger. I usually place a piece of foam rubber under the trigger to enable me to maintain the speed I want, without having to "hover" the trigger. Really lessens the fatique factor. I especially like the fact that the drill body does not heat up, even under continued use. I sometimes will use this drill for hours on end, and having to wait for it to cool would be a pain. It has a nice long, heavy duty cord, that doesn't tangle up easily.
The blades may work in a standard jig saw but I did not try them. I ordered the countertops from hd, ready-made from the fabricator, straight runs of counter only, and recommend this approach -if you only do counter tops every 20 years or so..

One thing to be careful about: make sure you are careful as you use them or you can pinch the palm of your hand pretty badly between the trigger and the grip.  I found this out the hard way!

There is a "saddle" spot-welded to the bottom of the case, to hold a drill in place.  (See Customer Images.)  Since I wanted a small tool box with a tray, but not a drill case, that saddle is in the way.  I might drill out the 3 spot-welds and just remove it.

When I used  this to cut through floorboards and 2x4's it was as smooth as a hot knife  through butter. Unistrut and allthread were also no match for this machine.  This 11 amp Super Sawzall has a standard blade stroke mode, plus an orbital  stroke mode for a faster, more agressive cut through thicker wood. You can  also adjust the amount of orbital action from none to full depending on the  application. This sawzall also has the new Quik-Lok blade clamp with allows  you to change blades in seconds rather than minutes. There's no more  searching for a hex wrench to change blades here.
All Starret tools are expensive, whether it's a 4" square or a 12" combinatiom square.  Surprisingly, they are not the most expensive I've seen.  But they aren't stamped out in mass quantities, they are individually inspected, and they come in their own little box.  They aren't just the best, they are heirloom grade.

This tool had NO PROBLEM removing the nails!!
I recommend making several copies of the instruction sheet and keep them near your saw(s).  The setups for crown molding require a few steps and if you don't use the tool every day for compound miters on crown molding, you will become a little perplexed if you don't have the instructions.

I also dedicated a piece of hose to connect this to my shop vac, which I then sealed in place with silicone.  I've not noticed a drop in suction, and I get a lot of material dropping into the bucket instead of the vacuum.

- I added steel conduit channel (12 gauge) horizontal bracing above the "X" bracing.  Overkill to be sure, but I'm not fond of heights and this added even more support to the "X" bracing.  (this may be a mental stability thing - the "X" bracing was adequate, but.....)

  Compared to the other saws in its class the Hitachi is nice but the dinky table and fence is the same as the old 8.25" saw and very inadequate.  The bevel adjustment on the makitas has you bumping it hard to release it.  The plastic lever for the bevel on the makita is flimsy and could break. The Makita has the nicest smoothest feel and spring action though. A decent table too.

I used it to build 5 pieces for a laundry room built in, and each piece was nearly 7 feet tall and heavy with several shelves. Using the biscuits really helped the assembly / glue up (which anyone who has built furniture knows is stressful). The tool's settings are easy to use, and stayed locked in position despite hundreds of cycles. The case is useful and I only wish I had bought one sooner.

6110	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just finished setting up a dust collection system with the 2hp motor from Harbor Freight. This separator fits on top of a $15 silver trash can from any big box home improvement store. The openings fit 4 in tubing perfectly and do a great job. I've filled a trash can twice now and I have no more than a gallon of dust in the bottom of my collection bags. Less chips and stuff that go through your impeller the better. I know building a thein baffle would be even better, but for the effort and low cost of this unit - it's all I'll ever need.

8532	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	First off... I LOVE Estwing hammers.  I have several, and I have put them through their paces over many years.  I have used them for framing, demo work, roofing, masonry and everything in between.  This is a great "small" version of my favorite hammer.  It would be ideal for small projects or as a high-quality child's hammer.  I purchased this to include in an EMERGENCY TOOL KIT, and it is ideal for that application.  It is small, so it fits in a small tool bag and it is high-quality, so I know I can depend on it in a pinch.  You're not going to frame a house with this one, but if you're looking for an exceptionally durable, extremely strong and well-made small hammer, this is it.

* Base is not too heavy and clamps on securely
I have only one small complaint about this product:  I wish the outside pockets had a top flap (and a way to secure the flap), to keep things from falling out of the pockets if the toolbag gets overturned.  As it stands, I never put anything in those pockets, because my bag gets overturned all the time (being tossed in the back of the truck, or tipping off the end of the counter or workbench).  It's not a deal breaker.  But it is something that I'd like to see added in the future.  In my opinion, that option alone would make the Gatemouth series of toolbags a perfectly flawless product.
My only complaint is the "Hold Down" mechanism.  It's real sloppy.  Keeping it level is worth a day's pay.  Seems like a company that could design such a great tool could figure that little accessory out better.
6478	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works well.  Would have liked better if it had a mounting plate.
When you consider the cost, it's a no brainer.  For what you'd spent on this tool, you're half way to a SUPER plunge router -- or a "real" benchtop mortiser -- and all the way to a good used or refurbished one.  The router's more versatile, so the money you spend gets you a lot more.  I'd definitely recommend a harbor freight mortiser over this unit.

5200	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The first two packs of these were failing within ten minutes of use, I just stumbled upon the 3rd package of these, along with the receipt from the shipper which I am going to leave anonymous at this time.  I tried one at work today and kept the second one in the original packaging.  It is marked as "original Fein", "made in Switzerland", etc...  I can't find the email link on the Fein website for customer service or complaints, so here it is.  They have finally cheapened these things to a point where I will never buy them again and I would imagine their sandpaper is going to suffer the same fate.  I bought my multimaster in the late 90's and it was used when I got it.  I have praised the folks at Fein for the past 15 years and I am a professional who gets to use a lot of different tools from major manufacturers.  I can no longer endorse something that has gone the way of total junk.  Either someone in another country is bootlegging these accessories or they have changed the adhesive they use to assemble the pad to the backing plate.  Either way, it's a waste of money and worse yet, time.  As a contractor, I don't mind paying for something that will perform well and last.  Kind of like a mechanic paying for a Snap-on tool.  You can't have something break in the middle of your work day, even if it does have a warranty.  Who wants to stop everything to run to the store?  Since the global patent expired on this oscillating tool and everybody and there brother jumped on the manufacturing bandwagon, the cost of accessories has come way down.  I no longer HAD to buy genuine Fein, but continued to do so because they WERE the best.  Here's a message to the bean counters in Switzerland.  When you cheapen your product to increase a profit margin a few percent, let's hope that you can survive by selling to homeowners (who don't know they are getting ripped off).  Us professionals who built you business by buying (400 dollar) tools and accessories, would like to thank you for turning your backs on us, the ones who supported you all these years.  Do I expect too much?  Maybe, but I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, a blue collar, hardworking town where tools are passed from one generation to the next  If you think you have built a tool that will last, just send it to a major city in the rust belt and we'll let you know how it holds up (in a real world work environment).

5156	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Does not fit a 4 inch pipe - it exactly butts-up to the other 4 inch duct - not into or over it.  I bought this item to reduce the 4 inch hole on the PSI Woodworking DBGULP Big Gulp Dust Hood I bought for my table saw. I have had to make so many "adjustments" with duct tape to make my dust collection system operational. This fits exactly nothing and the industry seems to need to look up the word "adaptor" and "reducer" as this should fit either inside or outside a 4 inch hole (industry pick one and outside might be a better choice). I have run 2.5 inch pvc through my garage and have several of my dust makers installed (again duct tape to snug the fit in almost all cases). In my garage I don't need or want a 4 inch pipe.  All that said I blame myself for not looking at all the reviews however, the words reducer are grossly misused.  Providing measurements might have helped some.  It is sturdy hard plastic.

The crank makes it easy to tighten, they tighten very fast.  Biggest flaw I see from experience is that they have a small clamping face...this makes it less effective when clamping an "edge" like a cabinet or door.  A Bessey or Jorgensen parallel clamp has a much longer and even grip on the edge of wood...down at least 5 inches or so.  Then again when you need a small clamp, as when clamping a small table leg...this is the best choice, the parallel clamps are too big.  So these are best for powerful clamping of small spots, or strenth and straightness over a distance, such as a door, where a pipe clamp will arc and bend your wood out of alignment.  You can always spread out the clamping force with a piece of hardwood, but then you need 3 hands to hold it all together.  You can use these with steel, where a Bessey wouldn't even be considered.  Wood screw clamps, like the traditional Jorgensen, are best for really long edges of a foot or so, or small piece where not much force is required.  Then again you don't want to squeeze out all the glue either.  So you have to match the clamp to your work...no one clamp does it all.  Another use: when first setting up the wood, squeeze the pieces together with this clamp, as when gluing two pieces (as in making a door with a rail and stile) with a biscuit or biscuits.  This powerful clamp will act like a vise and pull them together, it's easier and quicker to get great force out of this clamp than any other kind of clamp.  Then use a Bessey or other brand to hold it evenly.  The "vise" action of this is unique and sometimes the best option around.  I have every brand of clamp and many antiques but when this baby does its thing there's no substitute for it.
If you are having trouble figuring out which two-pronged bulb you should order, head on over to Wikipedia where there is an excellent chart. Watch out for voltage.

3699	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this belt sander to replace the Porter-Cable 3 x 21 belt sander Mo. 337 I had bought used over ten years ago.  They are the same except for the dust bag connection port, the way the belt is changed, and the variable speed feature.  This new version does everything well for me and I really appreciate how easy it is to put on a new belt.  On the Mo. 337 I sometimes knocked the floor plate loose because you had to push the sander down against the floor to release the pressure.  The Mo. 352VS picks up about 80% of the dust it generates depending a little on what grit you use.  It's pretty loud as one would expect but is very aggressive and operates flawlessly for hours continuously if you can take it. Except for when I need to level glued up slabs for shelving or cabinetry after biscuit joinery, this tool does it all.  Since I'm an all out person I rarely use the variable feature. For my large slab sanding I prefer my Porter-Cable 12 amp 4 x 24 belt sander which also eats wood but with a greater appetite.

3243	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My wife's Indian tribe has a casino in Oklahoma. In May 2005, we were on vacation visiting my father-in-law, and stopped in to see my wife's tribe's casino. I'm not really a gambler, but I put $20 in a slot machine, hit the button three times, and won $250. I cashed out, and gave my wife $100. I knew what I was going to spend the rest of my money on, a Skil HD77 Wormdrive saw. My father had the old metal handled version of the HD77 when I was growing up in the 60's and 70's, and it was what I learned to saw with. In my adult life I've had cheap circular saws, but I always longed for the Skilsaw of my youth. Once you have used a Skil HD77, you just can't go back to any lesser saw. I was also fortunate that when I got home, and purchased the saw from Amazon, it happened to be on sale, and I got $25 more dollars off for spending $199+, so I got my new saw for the cost of about $110. Some people think the saw is too heavy. Personally I don't mind the weight, I think it steadies the saw. I love quality and value, and this saw has them both. If you read most of the reviews, mostly five stars, they speak for themselves. I've built saw horses, bookcases, cabinets for my shop, raised beds for our tomato garden, a closet organizer, a coffee table, a computer desk, a sewing table for my wife, the list goes on. I guess what I would like to pass along is that I am sorry that I waited so long to get this saw. Now that I have one again, all DYI chores seem easier. I look forward to using my saw. It makes any sawing task, a pure pleasure. I should have just bit the bullet and got one a long time ago. If you are a person, contemplating the purchase of a circular saw, especially a younger person, my advice is spend your money wisely, and get the best, the first time, and you won't regret it. Throw our the cheap blade it comes with, and buy a decent carbide saw blade. Change the oil ocasionally, and the Skil HD77 will last you a lifetime. There are not too many purchases that you can make for around $150, that you can say that about. If your are lucky, you might catch it on sale, or be able to pick up a used one for even less money. If so, grab it and run like the wind.

7616	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hammer was left by someone when I moved into my tiny New York apartment in 1970.  Back then it looked as if it had many years of heavy use.  Now (October 2015), although I have moved out of the city, and moved several times, ending up now in the country,  I still have it and use it for all our jobs both inside and out. For the first time, today I have had to super-glue one of the leather rings back in place on the handle.  This is a great hammer - if you can call a hammer great - very well balanced, sturdy, and seems to be lasting forever.  You could not ask for better.
One note is that these have built in rubber pads, that completely cover the metal internal end. That is an advantage when you do not want to mar the wood. That and the fact that you can squeeze these with one hand, creates a mechanism that is easy to use, but not something that you would want to use for strength clamping. As a safety measure, these clamp sufficiently for most operations, but a threaded bar clamp, is stronger. So for those operations where extreme strength is needed, these are not the clamps to use. You sacrifice mountain holding strength for the ease of use. For example if I was using a large bit on the drill press, and drilling into metal, I would clamp it with something more. Even the slightest movement in an operation like that, could cause a snag, sending the piece into movement. If you are using just one of them, at the end of a 24" board, and decide to rout the other end, it will move on you. Securing it with two of them, and it is super tied down. You get my drift.

My first clue that something was different was before making my first cut.  I placed my homemade panel cutting jig on my table and the blade was about an 1/8" away from the jig where as before it was so close that I could hear the blade brush the jig as I ran it past.

As I said, this appears to be the most advanced tool of this kind in the market. The alternatives to this tool are limited in functionality: there is a "do-it-yourself" kit from the Collins company ("Collins Tool Company Stair Tread Template Set") made of metal (available on Amazon) and its plastic versions for $20 at HD for $35 at Lowes. There is an all-metal WDP Stair Jig from Ampro-online sold only directly from the manufacturer (about the same price as this jig but less functionality), and "Stair Tool" sold directly by TheStairTool company. They all probably work about the same when it comes to measuring width of the stairs and angles, but none of them has built-in functionality to measure depth of the stairs and risers. You need to have this depth (plus additional overhang) in order to correctly transfer measurements taken by the jig to the stair. Note that you measure the depth of the stair from its rounded nosing and not from the back. You need to know this depth in order to position the jig correctly before marking for cutting. With built-in adjustable stops, The Stair Wizard takes out of the game those additional measurements and reduces potential for errors.

Dewalt could/should have done better.  They are part of the same conglomerate that owns Porter-Cable (and Delta, and Black & Decker).

3189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	While the saw works great as I used it to cut through some interior doors I was replacing but it has a big design flaw!  There is a guide plate that has about an inch on one side of the blade and over three inches on the other.  If you were making a cross cut and wanted to slide this guide against a straight edge you would want to use the 3+ inch side to have more support for the saw, right?  The makers of this saw built the motor so low to the guide plate that it cannot slide against anything more than an 1/8 tall.  This is really stupid.  The saw works with the guild plate if you are cutting something thin like plywood, because you can raise the saw up (making the cut less deep) to clear your straight edge. The solution: for cutting something thick like interior doors, where you might want to use a straight edge - you have to use the one inch side.  Not great support for the saw - but it works.
Before I explain the problems with this plane, I have been doing woodworking for more than 35 years, and I fully understand that you will have to do a lot of "tuning" on virtually any plane you buy, new or used.  Also I own and use eight other planes - one Wood River, four Groz, one Craftsman (from about 1940), one Worth (an "antique" from the early 1900's - I think), and one really ancient Stanley from before 1910.

It does misfire on occasion but i'm sure it is purely because i have not cleaned or oiled it in 8 years. I know, I know...what a slug. If there is a complaint it is due to Paslode going to primarily all round head nails the last couple of years. The clipped head nails used to drive sure and deep every time.

The chippers add up to make all dado thickness' 1/16 inch apart..  From 1/4 to 29/32 (plus plastic shims to tweak even this)..  To use the thicker capability though, your saw arbor would need to be long enough..
I ripped about an 1 1/2" off the 12" short stationary piece to fit in between the tablesaw top and end of the Delta supports. Then chamfered the lead edge of that short stationary piece.  I did that before installation because that was mentioned in a previous review. Thanks to that reviewer for the heads-up.  I also widen the rabbet on the short stationary piece to line up with the Sawstop miter slots which differ slightly from the Delta's.  I eventually replaced the stock piece with a custom plywood and laminate piece 7/8" thick with  narrower rabbets in the exact location.
9511	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this hose primarily for my nail guns.  It is nice and heavy so it lays flat when in use.  It also winds up well unlike a pvc or plastic hose.

2079	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am far from a pro but I do demand performance and quality. The store salesperson had not opened the new 7518 box yet and when I asked why not his reply was "I'm afraid to look as I would have to take one home for myself". This is a quality machine and it shows.
One tip - run the guide on the WASTE SIDE of your cut if possible, so any slips don't ruin the piece.  If you need dead-nuts accuracy (ie. you don't have a "waste side", then you need to be very careful. Run a couple practice passes before you commit.

4641	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I have an older DW705 (which still has its original bag), and a newer DW716 that needed a bag.  I was wondering how this universal bag could fit "all" of their saws, since the dust outlet fitting on these two saws are different, but I saw from the description that this universal bag included an adapter, so I decided to try it.  If I was buying this for my DW705, I would have given it three stars - it would fit that saw fine, although this new bag is only half the size of the original bag, and made of much thinner material.
Because it hard-bolts on from the bottom, there may be mounting considerations if you plan to bolt down the saw itself!

Luckily, I was able to do a side-by-side comparison. I replaced one of two halogen bulbs in my 8-month-old KitchenAid Range Hood. It was right next to an original halogen bulb that had been installed by the manufacturer. Same brightness and intensity! No difference whatsoever. I can't speak to the longevity of these halogen bulbs, which is still a concern for me. I hope to get at least 8 months of use from each of these 10 bulbs. Then I'll be a true devotee!!

Brief overview:
If you've never used this type of base, they are a dream to use.  A simple foot lever lifts and lowers the tool once the base is installed.  This is MUCH better than having to individually lift each corner by hand-tightening plastic-handled screws.  I also have a Vega base that requires a long handle to move the unit around, and I'm telling you... this Delta system can't be beat!  In fact, I'm going to replace my Vega base with one of these.

Unlike many lesser competitors, especially "household" stick drivers, Milwaukee's torque settings offer a wide and *precise* range of torque settings for most applications [6x2], any even better, the very tactile ring and positive torque detents which are handily[but not so visibly]located on the ring just at the business end of this driver. Furthermore, the detents on this very tactile ring aren't limited to just six positions as the numbers would suggest, but many intermediate positions for that "just right" setting that can snug your fastener perfectly into place.  For heavier applications, a little bee's wax or soap on the threads goes a long way and also helps to keep things from going squeak in the night.
2300	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is the best scroll saw I've used.  What I really like is the very small amount of vibration that you feel in your hands when they're resting on the platten as you manipulate work into the blade.

I use the pipe insulation as a spacer to keep the pipe from touching the wood and to provide a consistent surface. I cut the insulation into 5" sections.
I tried the PVC route when I got tired of dragging my old hose between the house and garage.  While looking for a new air hose all I could find was PVC, so I bought one.  After spending just a few frustrating days trying to deal with the very stiff springy coils, I decided enough was enough and ordered this hose from Amazon.  The hose coils nicely and is easy to pull behind while you work.  The rubber hose lays flat with no springy coils to snag on studs, joists, or saw horses.


All things considered, I appreciate quality tools and am not dissapointed by this one. Highley recommended!
I was first introduced to the Magnum Hole Shooter by a boatbuilder who called it the single best power tool he owned. Not only was it powerful enough to drill through an oak keel or refasten a few thousand hull screws, it was built uncommonly well. You just can't destroy this drill in ordinary use, and if you do manage to  break it or wear out the brushes, it's easily serviced.
4977	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nothing to say but this is a tough powerful sander that has been reliable for me. The bag collects the dust well.

As far as the Freud SD208 set goes, it does exactly what it was intended to do and it does it very well.  Cuts (rip and cross) are clean.  Excellent product!  I'll stick with this set until someone comes up with the magic set that installs itself on the saw.  P.S. the carry case is perfect for storage and transport.

6211	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This has to be the best value in my shop.  I used two spiral 4" connectors on the inside of the lid to connect to hoses outside.

If you don't cut through materials thicker than 1-1/2", this is a great saw. It weighs probably half of what my Makita did, and that was with the aluminum shoe. The steel shoe of this saw follows aluminum edge guides without binding. (aluminum to aluminum always binds up) The left blade design is great for righties.

524	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I couldn't decide online which type of clip-on light to use for my Kindle Touch. Too many reviews and it seems like most people want a really bright light, which I don't - I want a dimmer one so I can see my Kindle and my husband can still sleep. So I had to go to a store to try some out; Barnes and Noble brick and mortar store has a few in its booklight selection. This one is really light and small (it uses those annoying flat batteries rather than AAAs, but I am making that sacrifice for size and weight). It has one LED v. 2 or more for the other ones. It is still too bright in the dead of night. I "solved" this by cutting two pieces of white electrical tape to size and putting them over the entire lighted part, so that the light is quite well dimmed. There is still a little glare, and it is annoying. But the lights all cause glare -- it is definitly possible to angle them up to reduce glare, but then the size of the cone of light they cast gets bigger, and that defeats the purpose of trying to light up only the Kindle screen itself and not my husband's side of the bed. You can clip this on the side of the Kindle instead of the front, and choose the side that points the light away from your partner. That also helps. The light also "leaks" a little out of the back of the light switch area (mine is a dark blue color light, so it looks like there is a blue light on the back of the light's head). I covered that up with black electrical tape.
I whole heartedly recommend this product.

By the way, Jet makes some corner clamps of a completely different design, and this Bessey product blows that stuff away.  The Bessey is easier to handle, doesn't mark the surface, and just generally better.

This is my first set of dado blades and the first time I used them it went smooth as it could have. I cut tenons for a mortise joint using oak from a house built in the 1800's. Needless to say the oak splinters very easy. No tear out what so ever. Smoothest cut I could have imagined. The only other cuts I've seen that smooth were from a forest ll blade.  The blades were easy to figure out. They store on a cheesy plastic holder but as for the blades I can't imagine any better. Highly recommend.

When you factor in the weight of hefty-hardwoods (or wet construction lumber) the torque of big-bits this can handle, PLUS the serious power it puts out, there are TONS of forces at play.

So I put the motor on the bench and removed the metal covers from the capacitors. One is the run capacitor; the other is the start capacitor. Once again, both of these covers were packed with dust. There are 2 wires running from each cap to the inside of the motor through a hole and I could see dust inside the motor. Not good. A TEFC (totally enclosed fan cooled) motor - right?

Would also be nice if it had tabs in the back like the stock dewalt insert.
2026	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have half a dozen or so routers, mostly PC, but also a large Dewalt plunge  router and a smooth Makita with standard and plunge bases.  More often than not I pick up one of the PC 690s because they're perfect for almost anything.  I bought the 7518 for router table and a Shop Fox W1736 over arm router.  The 7518 is huge compared to most things, and running by hand on really large projects like a boat or bar top might make sense, but it's the ideal stationary router.  Has huge bearings and tons of torque.  Pretty expensive but it will out live me!

6.) You pretty much need the tool to install the sandpaper. Everyone I know (including me) who has a 330 uses PSA paper because of this. Bosch has an ideal setup on their 1297DK, which is also a nice sander, but 12,000 RPM.
With my experience now, I would recommend the 300 lb rating to anybody who is going to be doing much work on a ladder.  I'm only a buck seventy five, but I much prefer the heft and stability of this ladder when doing something up there that takes some exertion or reaching.

3148	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Went together easily. I cheated and used birch plywood I laminated together for the sides instead of using hardwood, then reinforced the side with the pivot wheel with some angle aluminum I had laying around. It works fine for the benchtop planer I'm using it for, but probably wouldn't work for heavier equipment. Buying hardwood to complete this would not have been cost-effective for me.

7072	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This produce is very dangerous because unlike a normal stabilizer it can't be secured to the rung and the rail of the ladder. This makes it susceptible to slipping up the ladder or even folding flat against the ladder. And the clamps do not fit squarely into the ladder and this also allows it to become loose while you are up on the ladder. It can't be used on the corner of a roof with rain gutters because it does not hold the ladder far enough away from the roof. I own a rain gutter business and use ladder stabilizers every day.  You can see from the photo I've included with notes added why it is very likely to become loose due to the improper way the clamps fit.  I would not recommend using this stabilizer on any ladder. In my opinion  it rates NO stars but I had to give it one star or I could not post the feedback.

I bought an HTC mobile stand for my table saw, in part to compare the two models. On design, the Delta wins. The freely rotating front caster makes the unit very maneuverable, much easier to move around the shop than the HTC. In addition, the lever in front gives a much greater range of motion, so it lifts the unit much further off the stationary feet. The two units are roughly equivalent in difficulty of assembly. Do your own measurements for the wood; the unit will take a tad more than the 1 1/2 inch square cross section recommended. I also recommend drilling the bolt holes with a drill press if at all possible. I don't own a drill press, so I couldn't get the holes drilled perfectly square, and the unit looks like it was assembled by a drunken sailor. It works great, but I can't really blame Delta for the appearance.
6238	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	They worked for me.
Because it is so strong, you might be tempted to hog wood too fast. Don't...

3001	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This sander really does work fine, it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though, I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum, but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover, that I usually fail to properly toggle, so when I start to sand, it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however, that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it, dropped it, loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders, but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over.

I have been using this sander for about three years, and it has been put through some tough tests -- sanding up to 1/2" off  wood edges, sanding floors, sanding tough wood, and even sanding plaster  off the walls of a 250-square-foot room.  In every case, it has done a  terrific job, never weakens under pressure.  The sander has very little  vibration, and it leaves no swirl marks, even when using lower grit  sandpaper.  Several times, I have dropped the sander onto the cement floor  of my shop, and still it keeps on working.  The only minus I can see with  this sander is that the dust collection system could be better.  Even  though it has a dust-collection bag (which gets filled up, suggesting it is  catching a lot of dust) you need to wear a mask when you use it so you  don't breath in harmful particles.  It is even pretty good at getting into  tight corners, better than other sanders.

The finnish on the head was flawless. The slide mechanism was silk smooth - no jamming or rough spots. The satin chrome finnish on the blade eliminates glare and makes the blackened numbers and lines  easy to  read under all lighting conditions. The built in level was accurate and although I don't use the scribe for my work it fits snuggly in its holder. No fear of losing it. I highly recommend this premium square.
7758	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This company made the first of these hammers in 1926. The handle is unique. It is made with stacked leather washers. The end plate rivets holding the grip together are actually not rivets. They are part of the original forging and have been spun over into rivet heads to fasten the grip (check out Estwing on How it's Made).The result is a firm grip with excellent control and just enough cushion to dampen the impact of the steel shaft. It feels like a high quality wooden handle and yet is absolutely unbreakable. I have a 12oz, a 16oz and a 20oz. The 16oz was my grandfather's. He bought it in 1928. The other two are youngsters,'58 and '62. they're all three still going strong. The 16oz is great for trim.

One positive thing I can say about this product is that it seems sturdy when the legs are unfolded.  Also, once set up correctly the fence seems pretty accurate.  This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a portable solution.  Heavy and no wheels.  Very unwieldy to move around and no wheeled base is available.

6865	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you have ever hassled with trying to install hinges on a non pre-hung door, you are familiar with the challenge. Figuring out the proper layout of the hinges on the door. Trying to take a single templet and align it perfectly straight up in order to prevent an off angle hinge. Trying to mount that templet at exactly the correct amount of depth to get a uniform edge. Routing without a glitch, or even moreso hand scribing an edge, then chiseling a flat base. Even if all of that goes perfectly, then we have the challenge of transferring those settings to the jamb in order to hang the door. How do we close the door on the hinge and scribe out the edge of the hinge onto the jamb. Opening the jamb and laying the hinges on it kinda works, but then how do you keep the distance correct for the clearance of let's say 1/8 inch at the top of the door. In plain words using the door with the hinges mounted is a rough way of getting the job done.
1479	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I moved into my new house a few years ago, I installed a bunch of outdoor landscape lighting.  I went a little nuts.  Front yard, back yard, two porches, an atrium, all-in-all over 30 fixtures that use these little G4 base 10w and 20w 12V bulbs.  I quickly discovered that these halogen bulbs are a lot less reliable than the 7w wedge base bulbs I had used before.  What is more, at around $6.50 for a two pack at the local builder store, they are also a lot more expensive.

1256	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I installed the light bulb in a Maytag Gemini oven.  Maytag wanted a ridiculous amount of money for a bulb.

I've had the replacement bulb in the oven for over a year and it's still working.

3074	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my new Craftsman 14" band saw. I used square tubing instead of wood. Not the most stable base I have when moving, as it uses three wheels not 4, but when set down it is very stable.
7060	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Yes, their router bits are more expensive, but well worth it. You can always get better results with fewer passes using their bits. These are no different.

9585	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm well pleased with this rubber air hose.  It seems to be very good quality and the price is good too.
Moving this side to side this was not staying aligned at first, so I attached a straight piece to the black edge guide to give it more surface area and make it more solid. The bulk/weight of the unit can be counter productive in smooth movements in this regard given the small surface area of the edge guide, but since it comes with holes already I think you're not supposed to use it as is to begin with. Though after attaching a straight piece to the black edge guide I discovered that the edge guide while stiff laterally can be easily bent vertically. This is unfortunate, since the rest of the unit is rather solid. Though the bending issue is avoidable by simply not resting the router on top of the edge guide.
A truly great-feeling tool for around my house and garage. Best of all it's MADE in the USA!  This would make and excellent gift!
I've also owned several other types of Estwing hammers and they're all just as good. You will never go wrong investing the extra $10-$20 for the Estwing since you will get better results and will never have to buy another one as long as you live.
7783	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The biggest feature with this blade is the knockout center. For those of you that own a Big Foot saw you know what im talking about.

In summary I have been duped by advertizing to expect that tools with DeWalts name on them should perform reasonably well out of the box.  This one did not.  Being gullible is my own fault so I am only deducting three stars.  Not because the tool did not eventually work well, but because although I paid DeWalt; they didn't pay me to do their work for them.
3: Size: I have Irwin Quick-Grips that came in part of a larger set and I thought that's what I was ordering with these. It turned out that they were quite a bit larger than the ones I already owned. That said, the squared off rubber grips can clamp the smallest edges with ease.
I have other sets but this is nice and without having to switch blades.
They're great. Easy to attach, rip right through drywall, wood, and other light materials, and make consistent holes.
Review is based on experience using the pads with I-Bar Clamp.

8895	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm a big fan of pull saws, I use them often at work for trimming off shims, cutting down overhangs on sills, and slicing off a bit at the bottom of that pesky jamb. Solid tool, replaceable blade
8742	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have has this for several months.  Great little pull saw.  Have used it a few dozen times no problems at all.
  The square ness is right on. The typical check of taping a piece of paper to a flat surface in front of a fence, then use the square to draw a line, flip the tail of the square over to the other side, and see if the line is dead on.

8049	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good quality clamps. Exceeds my expectations. Would definitely make this purchase again or recommend to anyone who is interested in this type of product.
4886	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I won't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well. I've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it. I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive. I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt. This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.
It feels great ergonomically, and has all the power you need for almost any drilling task.


Maybe this saw was overkill for my small home improvement projects but the ease of cutting and lack of kickback and vibration are worth the extra money.

Since you will add your own clamping pads, you can angle them to compensate for pipe-flex during clamping,
1389	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got these as a replacement for the back-lights in my Char-Broil 463250811. It was hard to find what bulbs I needed, but once I connected that 12v, 10W bulbs I needed (manual) were T3 bulbs, this was the best deal I found. Working great so far (2 weeks in).
The bad part is that it is much harder to handle than a smaller, less powerful random orbit sander.  It took me a while to develop a smooth technique with it, and it still sometimes wants to "walk" off the work piece.  I use it for preliminary sanding on flat surfaces before assembly.  I think it would be a poor choice for sanding small parts of an assembled piece, and a disastrous choice for something with a lot of different surface levels close to each other (a rolltop desk, small table, chair, etc.)


Another solution: USE GALVANIZED PIPE instead of the cheaper black pipe. Galvanized pipe will not hold glue squeeze-out and will not stain wood. It costs a little more, but is worth it for dedicated woodworkers.
3723	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Hitachi makes a good blade. I always get them for my machine which is an Hitachi too but they'll work in all brands no doubt.

9194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	High quality and flexible. No weird rubber smell like foreign material.
First, instead of being flat to withing +/- 0.003" (or so), the sole was cupped more than 3/64" at the throat, with a particularly obvious downward curve of the throat causing the throat to be > 3/64" away from any level surface.
Before this happens to you...Stop what you are doing and go reinforce them right now!  Even if it seems solid now... it WILL break on you at some point.
The ultra precision collet set from Precise Bits makes the world of difference, plus the collet never sticks and requires you to back the nut off to get the release to pop.. just wiggle the bit and it slides free. It really brings this machine up to a pro level quality.
3698	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I have used this sander for a while, even bought a new switch because while it was under warranty it wouldn't shut off. It was easier to just buy a switch and put in myself. It sands great, I use it mostly for removing planing marks and sanding out joints.
7451	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I built a shed recently, making the door from tongue-and-groove decking boards.  Before I could attach the 2x4 braces I needed to clamp the tongue-and-groove planks together.  To fit big tools in the shed this door is 3-1/2' wide, so I needed a couple of big clamps.  Two of these Jorgensen fixtures, plus a pair of 5' black pipes, did the trick quite nicely.

1634	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I attached this thing to my "Saw Boss" which has  "9" amp motor. I buzzed through plywood, 2X4's and an assortment of stuff with little effort. You must remember this blade cuts less material so you are working a lot slower, as in really slow when compared to the other blades. I made excellent clean cuts with no problems at all, but then again the Saw Boss pulls "9" amps so it does not slow down for much. Never used this blade on my cordless so I don't know how that would work, but I would guess as soon as the blade slows down the project gets to be a real tedious.
3317	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product, light works great I'd be lost without it, if you don't have one get it, makes the saw easier to use.

Old school easy cutting! Included Makita blade cuts clean and smooth. Motor seems to run hotter in temperature than I remember in other Makita miter saws I have used. Not an issue at this time. I would like the unit to have more bolt holes to fasten it to a table better. The two in front work OK, but I would like a couple more at the back of the frame for my confidence. So far (about 100 cuts in 1X and 2X in both soft and hardwoods) the saw has adequate accuracy and power for my general carpentry backstage and at home. - Stagehand Jim
very high quality, and this is the best price I've found.
6244	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent blade. This is the best Milwaukee blade that I have. I use it primarily for cutting heavy cardboard, but it also works well on wood.
2589	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Pretty crappy work light. Not bright at all, very yellow and dispersed beam. For a flashlight it's fine but for a work light it's trash. There is no hook or other attachment so you can hang the light to go hands-free. Because of the battery it pretty much has to rest standing and that's where it really fails as a worklight. I was working on my car engine and tried to rest the light to angle the beam where I was looking. The light kept falling over and pissed me off so much I chucked it at the ground. Surprisingly it still worked so I tried to get back to work, only to have it topple over again and piss me off again so I chucked it at the ground again, only harder. This time the head assembly exploded. Even more surprisingly it seems to be ok except for the broken bulb. I might get the LED upgrade but it probably isn't worth it since the light is terrible as a work light. I'm still a huge Dewalt fan but not a fan of this light.

Positive features first.  One thing it definitely has  going for it is power.  After researching several of the  "high-powered" routers (DeWalt, makita, Hitachi), this one was  obviously better.  You get about another 1/4 HP for a price that's still  reasonable.  Also, the router comes with a very nice height adjustment  mechanism that usually costs extra with other routers, such as DeWalt.  The  router is easy to hold when doing free-hand work, and because one side of  the base is flat, it is easy to run across a straightedge or a jig (as  compared with other routers that have round bases).  It is relatively  quiet, considering the power it has.

This uses 3 AAA batteries.  I'm using the ones it came with and will change to rechargeable ones when these die.  It might take a while for them to die, though - LED lights don't use up much energy.  That's good because rechargeable batteries don't hold much charge.

Over the long run you won't regret the cost, your work will be better and you won't be wasting money filling the landfill with junked garbage tools.

It's great in that it lets me shake out most of my sawdust before it hits my shop vac and means my tiny shop vac is actually useful in my wood shop. It's not so great in that nothing seems to quite fit so I end up with things cobbled together to make things fit snugly. That said for under $20 you can only expect so much, and it certainly meets expectations there.

The only reason it's getting 4/5 stars is because the clip that you need to squeeze to open it is soooo smooth and it always slips from my baby-soft yet manly fingers. That's really annoying. A little bit of texture on the clip would give it a better grip and make squeezing the clip a little easier.

  The gun was originally designed to fire clipped head nails but Paslode has introduced an assortment of full round head nails for this gun as well.  These nails dubbed "RounDrive" are available mainly in the western regions of the USA but I understand that they will be available in the rest of the USA soon.  I am from the east coast and still have yet to find them on the shelves.  Many local ordinances are requiring full round head nails for certain applications like sheathing so this is a welcomed and necessary offering.

This is, of course, not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).

Secondly, the 1/4" reducer collet will NOT hold 1/4" shank bits down. No matter how hard I tighten the collet, my bits keep slipping out after monor cuts. I was using a dovetail bit with a dovetail jig and the bit just kept sliding further down as I cut! I had no problems with 1/2" shank bits, only 1/4" shank bits. Hitachi should do something about redesigning it's collet reducer to grip better.
The table took about an hour and a half to assemble at a leisurely pace.  The instructions were very clear with mine, only one piece was numbered incorrectly on the parts list, but its pretty obvious when you're putting it together.  If you follow the directions exactly (most importantly, not tightening everything down at first), the result is a very sturdy, well-built router table.  I didn't have any issues leveling the plate with my Ryobi router installed in it.  It took me about 10 minutes to get it right where I wanted it.

6025	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have a DW745; this insert is advertised for other models but the manufacturer includes the DW745 on the instruction sheet.. Another reviewer explained why - when the DW745 blade is extended to its highest point the trunion hits the insert and pushes it out. The remedy is to route out a cavity matching the one on the original metal insert. Leecraft doesn't mention this but should for safety reasons or it should route the cavity in the manufacturing process. .
8316	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Enough said? If not, this tool works exactly as advertised and no way can you make your work easier and more accurate.  and if you can email me as to how.  tkae the time to read the directions and then you will be using this tool even when you don't need it.  I broke mine out at the job and was the envy of the job.  as well as very popular (loaning it out). it will figure any angle out for you. and if you are like me and prefer quality miters as opposed to coping your joints.  then this is the tool for you
Previous to using the saw, I checked all of the adjustments as explained in the manual and found that they all seemed to be set perfectly.  I also cut several test pieces and checked them for squareness and various angles; they were all perfect.  I haven't yet used the saw for crown moulding, so I can't comment on how well it does for that purpose.  As far as the operation of the saw itself, I was generally satisfied.  Since I have been using a miter saw that has a vertical handle most of my life I had no issue with the handle on this saw.  I do realize, however, that some folks prefer a horizontal handle.  The one feature I don't like is the placement of the power switch lock-off button that has to be depressed before the power switch can be pushed in.  No matter how I contort my hand I can't find a comfortable way to depress both buttons at the same time.  On my other miter saw, the lock-off button is perfectly placed so that both buttons can be easily depressed at the same time.

5175	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I was hoping that these were designed to fit inside the 4" port of my table saw, when in fact it was the same diameter and I had to duct tape them together. Otherwise, this product works as expected.

4668	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my DeWalt 7790 RAS because I wanted the extra depth of cut with a 12" blade. Hard finding a good 12" affordable blade with a 5/8 center as this blade has a 1" center I got the Freud BL7MCE9 1" to 5/8" bushing. Cuts and works perfect in my 7790 with no noticeable vibrations/wobble that I can tell. I may get another in the future for my miter saw.


This is a good quality hose that supplies the full amount of air most air tools need and is oil resistant so it will resist cracking more than the cheaper hoses.  I noticed a few one star reviews; not sure what those reviewers got but this hose was well made and the fitting were true and didn't leak.  Not much else to say other than it was worth the $30 to get the air I needed delivered to my tools.
2637	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect addition to my collection of Dewalt 18 volt tools, since they all use the same battery.

2180	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had both my 12v and 18v flashlight bulbs go out quickly on my M series Milw. flashlights.  The reviews all stated that the replacement bulbs went out quickly as well.  I just recieved  these bulbs and tried them out; the first 10 minutes on a freshly charged battery I smelled plastic, and after 1 hour and five minutes I found lens too hot to touch(probably before that time as well).  I only checked it twice as I was also watching a film. I found the reflector to be too hot to touch, and the little paper ring between bulb body and reflector came unglued.  Bulb spring was hot but not too much. No scorched or melted plastic.  Incidentally,  the beam blinded me when I looked directly into it.  I even banged the flashlight around a bit and didn't lose the bulb.  This puppy is going back into the van and back to work.  I may replace the paper ring with a couple of neophrene washers to isolate the bulb/reflector, and I will also definately drill a couple of holes in the botton body to facilitate convection out of the side vent holes, cooling the back of the reflector.  As I am a plumber, I'll not drill holes in the top for water to get in, of course.  This test was with flashlight sitting vertically on bottom of battery with lens set to shine horizantally/90 degrees; usual working position for me.

Overall, as long as you use it for its intended purposes, i.e. measuring general relative wetness in drywall, concrete, or even wood, it's a good meter, but don't rely on it to give accurate absolute moisture content readings.
2750	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The table alone weighs over twenty pounds. Milled flat and smooth. a pleasure to work on this big table. The saw is quiet, and no vibration until you crank it up to maximum speed, a speed I'll probably never use. The pin-less blades are a snap to change, and for fret work, one simply loosens the knob at top, and the entire saw arm lifts up, so you can pull your project up and reinsert it in a new starter hole. Tighten a wing nut to connect the top of the blade, adjust the tension lever and you're ready to saw. The blower works better than any of the scroll saws that I've owned or used. The blade tension and speed are adjustable on the top, front of the saw. Both easy to adjust. I highly recommend the DEWALT stand, it takes up little room, following the shape of the saw base. Also a foot switch, which I've used on my scroll saws for years.

The big advantage of quick grip clamps, is that they handle wood beautifully, even for glue up operations. Hold workpieces more than securely to do the job in most applications, and are so handy that they deserve more than 5 stars. I would feel lost without them. It is another tool in the must have category.

It's bright and very convenient to use when you need both hands to be free to work.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for a friend who had been wanting one for a while.  He's thrilled with it.  I think, though, that this is a rather expensive device in its own right before you have to purchase the expensive 18 volt battery that makes it work. (Note, the battery does not come with it!)  If you already have Dewalt or Black and Decker devices that use this battery, however, you're in good shape--especially if you own more than one such battery.

I have used my dado blade set several times without the insert and finally ordered one.  I had ordered another tool from Amazon and added this to the list.  I actually got it for $4.00 because I ordered it when Amazon offered $25.00 off a purchase of $125.00. I would recommend adding this to your shopping list when Amazon is offering promotions.  It works great and the leveling screws work flawlessly.  I would like the insert to come with a mounting screw like the one on the regular insert that came with the saw.  It fits perfect in the slot and has a nice weight to it.  I have a Delta 36-675 with T2 fence. (Upgraded to a bigger Biesemeyer fence in mid 2006 or so.)

3661	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This review is ONLY addressing this sander from the prospective of using it and being left handed.  If you are left handed absolutely avoid this torture device.  First of all the "continuous on button"  hits you right in the middle of your trigger finger. To compound that,  it sticks way out and is particularly uncomfortable.  It is also possible to inadvertently lock the "continuous on"  feature unknowingly, making this tool potentially unsafe for a left handed person to use.  I sent it back immediately. I also called Porter Cable to complain about this lack of respect and concern for left handed people ........they couldn't care less about the 35 million  left handers in the US.......why?  By the way, this sander is overly heavy and quite noisy.  My front line sander is a Bosch 1274, really quite nice for left handers, but now unavailable.  Rats.!!!

585	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've owned quite a number of book lights and this one is the best so far.  It's light and can clip to the book. The gooseneck allows for adjustment but I didn't need to move it around because the light is sufficient to light both pages of the book.  The light is also pleasant to read by.  I like that you can switch to from 1 to 2 bulbs, which can conserve battery life if I only need some light and not too much.  And the book light can stand on its own.  I didn't think it could do that until I set in on my desk and I was surprised.  It can be a mini-desk light.  I'm quite pleased that because of it's size, flexibility and large clip, I can probably even use it as a flashlight in tight spaces.  Certainly worth the price plus I love that it comes in purple!
