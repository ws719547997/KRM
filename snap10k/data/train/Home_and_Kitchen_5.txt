It's without a doubt the best strainer I've purchased anywhere. I hung it on a hook because it's too big for my various utensil crocks, but I find myself reaching for it even for pasta, for which I'd normally use a colander.
I got this because hey, $60 is a bargain. But a vacuum is something you need to maintain a clean environment, and that is something I value more than my roommate at least. I'd definitely shell out for something more expensive if I had to buy another one (and probably will soon, after a normal use in a medium apartment...this thing is hot enough to cook breakfast on. Feel it's only a matter of time before the motor burns out.

6191	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I owned 3 Mighty Mites over the last 2+ decades.  Loved all 3.  The last one worked great for about a decade.  I use it in my service business as both a hose vac and in seconds could switch the hose around to the back side for a powerful blower to dislodge dust that a vacuum attachment would never find.  With the thin attachment on the end of the hose, the blow power was just short of an air compressor.

For example, dried pinto beans are fully cooked after about 30 minutes.  We bought this one to replace another presto pressure cooker that my wife had for at least 10 years. The only problem with the other one was that the inside got a little roughed up and beans would stick.  This is just as good as other pressure cookers that cost more than twice as much.

I developed a badly cracked lip area after an intense dental procedure. Once the yeast infection was gone (that's what causes cheilitis), my skin would still crack open and bleed because the area around the mouth has to be moved so much. The derma e Cracked Skin Relief was apparently stocked in Squaw Valley for the many skiers, but it was a heaven's send for my cheilitis as well. The creme stings a bit when first applied but goes to work immediately. I applied it often and had great results. My face surrounding the cracked lip area was very read and flaking, really unsightly, for at least two weeks. Whith the derma e product, I was able to heal over the weekend. Terrific stuff!

The great part about this Oxo pie server is that it is strong and has serration on both sides of the blade. We are both right-handed in our house, but I still like that it is symmetrical. The blade is actually pretty sharp, but it probably has more to do with that it is really strong. This is not a bendable item, and I have no problem whatsoever cutting through whatever foods I am presented with. The blade doesn't sag or bend when I'm pulling up on a slice of something.

The lenses themselves are very substantial.  Just to disclaim - I'm not a professional photographer.  I take pictures because I love to take pictures, so  I cannot tell you what a pro would say.

This coffeemaker has a 3 YEAR warranty. Best coffee I've ever had at home. I've now had this over a year with no problems.

The 4 qt unit is probably large enough for a family of 4. I like the 6 qt unit because it doubles as a pasta and stock pot.  There is a small accessory handle that is easy to grab and take to the sink to run cold water over.  I know that there are units that allow you to vent steam and depressurize safely.  I can't see the utility in that.  15 seconds of cold water running over the unit in the sink drops the pressure to zero and you can open the cooker safely. The interlock, pressure weight, and safety plug all drop quickly with cold water, giving a clear signal three different ways that the unit is ready to open, and the interlock prevents opening if pressure is present in the unit.

The old Mighty-Mite was wonderful.  The wands were made of metal, and they had a very positive feel, and they were incredibly durable.  This new Mighty-Mite has plastic wands.  They feel mushy.  If you press down on them, they flex, so you can't really lean into them to get your rugs clean.  Furthermore, THEY BREAK.  I stepped on one of them, and it splintered.  Eureka told me that they would replace it for free once, but if I stepped on it again, I would have to pay.  However, in 25 years of using the old machine, I must have stepped on the wands a thousand times and there was no problem.

2406	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I've had this exact model for about two years. My wife and I are both smokers.  This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.  Also when something starts smoking on the stove and fills the house with smoke, this fan will clear the whole house in less than a minute.  Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob. At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.  Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.  Our window are 5' in height and this sits in the bottom 2' and since the window sill is only 8" off the floor, the fan does not block the view at all except for the dogs.

5411	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.  I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.  However, the Linx roller stopped working within a year.  I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.  So, I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work, but be much cheaper to replace when needed.  The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx (which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum), but it does pick up most items on a single swipe.  Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.  I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.  All things considered, this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx.
This cooker makes cooking fast and easy. Everyone should own a pressure cooker and it will make cooking easy.

If you need to add more stuff to the pot while it is still hot and whistling; care fully place the hot pot under running cold water and cold bath and wait for the pressure to decipate.  Always clean the rubber seal coz, it does accumulate food residue.  And always, always be careful with dealing with high pressure and high heat.  Happy cooking.

I have 4qt, 6qt, and 12 qt cookers. I would have liked the 8 qt one but saw reviews complaining about the stubby handles and difficulty opening them. I had the same problem on a big canning Presto that I had to put in the log splitter to get open. Needless to say I no longer have that cooker. So I opted to try the 6 qt stainless one. The price is good at $44 I think it was to my door. Well, it is a bit new fangled with a semi hidden pop up/drop down pressure relief valve. You have to make sure and push down the valve or you cannot close the top. The same goes for opening it after cooking and cool down. I run mine under cold water to drop the pressure when I am ready to open up. Once one gets the hang of the new valve everything is OK. You may have to press down on the lid to close. The semi hidden pressure relief valve is visible at the base of the handle. If in the up, pressure position, it prohibits opening the lid via another gizmo that it prohibits from moving. On cool down if the relief valve does not drop down all the way of its own accord, you have to take a toothpick or something and make sure it is all the way down before the lid will open. Good cooker once one learns the ropes on it's use. Get one.

I found it relative easy to install, I did have to go to home depot to get some hardware as it only comes with hardware for 1/2 inch piping and my piping is 3/4 inch. The clear plastic where it meets with the blue plastic will leak if it is to tight or not tight enough, it really annoying as you have to fiddle with it to get it just right. It does clean the water nicely there was no more chlorine or mineral taste. Also I noticed that the toilets and shower don't have to be cleaned as much. The water pressure was the same after installation..

7381	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Most kitchens probably do not have a lemon zester as a routine item, but the OXO zester is a must for both casual and professional cooks. The problem with most zesters is they aren't sharp enough to properly zest only  the lemon peel but instead give you white pith along with the zest. But the  OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts  sharply and cleanly. Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing  tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two  kitchen gadgets for the price of one. The zester is quite durable and goes  through the dishwasher quite well too. This tool is also extremely safe for  even the youngest of hands as its slip proof construction allows you to  grip it easily without fear of slipping and hurting oneself. So add some  zest the OXO way!
The only big downfall for me was that if you want to lock this item, you need two padlocks, on on either side.  With only one, someone could easily see what's inside, and likely get it out.  It is made for padlocks with long shanks, but will accommodate small locks.

Luckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.  These two products looked like the lids would be interchangeable, so I took a chance and placed the order.

By the way, the salt and pepper lids work on this set, too:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tupperware-Smidget-Container-1oz-Each-Assorted-Set-5/dp/B001E3DMXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tupperware Smidget Container 1oz Each Assorted Set 5</a>&nbsp;I have been hunting for a good set of portable salt and pepper shakers for years.

On side by side comparison with Indian pressure cookers like Butterfly, Prestige or Hawkins, this model does cook faster but the whistle does not work the way Indian PCs work. You don't hear a whistle, just a hissing sound. So when the steam builds up, start your timing & turn off the heat after 3-10 mins depending on the food.

The new presto has a flatter bottom which sits better on my cook top unlike the old one which rocks a little bit, the heating is even and its easier to clean as well. What I didn't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is  made of aluminum. But its not a deal breaker for me.

Love having both, in case the power goes out, we have a gas stove and can use this Presto model to make a meal. It's a good size, have cooked soups, veggies, potatoes and beans (pre-soaked). We are vegan, so one of the best ways we have found to cook healthy, nutritious meals. Love the air vent/cover lock, which is a huge improvement over my mom's old pressure cooker from the 1970's. You have to attach the handles yourself out of the box. Easy to do, but be careful, I installed the body handle upside down & didn't realize it for a month! Duh! No wonder it was uncomfortable to pick up. The small helper handle on the opposite side is great. Easy to clean as well, love the stainless steel. Beans soaked overnight only take 10-15 minutes to cook, depending on the type of bean. No fuss, just turn the heat off & let it cool naturally on the stove. I've left it to cool on the stove for over an hour, taken the lid off & the food is still hot! Veggies, 2-3 minutes. Soups turn out fantastic. All kinds of resources online on pressure cooking.

The only downside to these boxes is that you cannot see what's in them until you open the box, so some sort of labeling system is useful.
When my boyfriend goes on his weekend car adventures, I pack him lots of fruit and a trusty Tupperware Citrus peeler.  I'm glad I bought the 10 pack, because I passed some off to friends and family.  This little gadget spoiled me quickly.

Don't use pressure cooker enough to validate the $150 models so for the price, convenience and ease of use - this is greatly recommended.
4940	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Utter rubbish.  After a charge the batteries will run for maybe 60 seconds then die.  The lights give no indication whether they are charging or not or whether they are charged. One light stays solid this other blinks all the time. I have had the unit for a little over a year and have used it maybe 10 times.  Unacceptable.

Takes standard size attachments (I recycled a few add-on attachments I had form an old vac). Stores it own on-board. Has a nice long hose and cord. Doesn't weigh too much - has good suction. Used it on the cars today and it picked up all kinds of small rocks and things with no issues. Couldn't be happier.

272	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Family member who got this one loved it, magnets work well and it's fun to play with the combinations you can make.
The 5' and 10' were measured straight ahead from fans. The fan surface measurement was done roughly 1/2 way up the fan blades right against the grill.
9601	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very sharp and easy to handle.
1206	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This was just not what I hoped for.  I love my magic bullet, but I was looking for something to work as well yet with larger capacity. This had larger capacity but could not even chop up garlic unless it was already partially chopped--so what's point?  It was just cheap and ineffective for what I wanted.
6109	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This vacuum is ridiculous.  My hubby got it for me after reading other reviews.  He thought it seemed like a great bargain.  It is a prime example of getting what you pay for.  Totally useless on carpet and nearly just as useless on hardwood.  Tried it out for about 2 minutes and realized that it is the most pathetic vacuum I've ever tried to clean with.  Sending it back.  Don't waste your time or money.  Cheap, lousy product.

5964	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This vacuum is Mickey Mouse, cheap thin plastic everywhere. The suction is very weak, and the plastic hose is so flimsy that if the hose is slightly twisted, it will pinch, thus no air flow. I returned it.

Performance - WOW! We were blown away by how well this unit does its job. With the rotating brush OFF for floors, it gets all the grass clippings even when wet - plus the dog hair - off the floor quickly. I tried it on the carpeted porch with the brush ON and it did an amazing job there as well.

So some genius came up with the idea of sticking magnets on these babies, and they haven't gotten lost in our house since. I wish my walls were magnetic and more products could just be stuck on there for storage. Alright, that would look terrible, but these things are a great idea and they even look kind of nice and colorful decorating the fridge when they're not holding bags of chips closed.

5482	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I got this for my son when he moved to his own place.  It's got hardwood floors and area rugs so this is perfect for it.
6674	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am pleasantly surprised by this fan for the price. For under $20.00 I did not expect much. The fan arrived in perfect shape with no dents or other defects on the box. All I had to do was take it out of the box, install the included feet (which snap on) and plug it in. The fan moves a good amount of air even on its lowest setting. The fan is loud on high which is perfect for me. My house can get a tad noisy and my neighbors houses are close by so I use a fan as white noise. I also like the size, it fits perfectly on a small table next to my bed so I get a great breeze while sleeping. We only buy Lasko fans due to the reliability and air movement. In 15 years only 2 Lasko fans have died on us. One of them was my fault for lack of cleaning it and the other just shut off. The motor spins freely it just stopped working. More then a half dozen box store brand fans we have bought have died in the same 15 years, that is why we switched to Lasko. I would not hesitate to buy a couple more at such a good price.

Also, the wall mounts don't come with screws to attach to the wall.  After a quick trip to Home Depot we got screws and were in business.  If not for this, I'd probably give it a 5 star rating.

7847	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	As with all oxo products, this item is quality made, and attractive being part of their new steel line.  It is the perfect size for a slice of pie, and the rather sharp serrated edges on both sides make for easy digging into.  If you're a fan of oxo products, you'll love this one.  Now you can have your pie and eat it too!
8119	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The OXO "Good Grips" Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester, but it's a lot simpler to clean after using, compared to any larger screen-type grater.
4111	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I found this pressure cooker to be everything I wanted.  Great size, easy to use, easy to clean up.  Highly recommend it.
I'm here today to read reviews on other blenders and decided to warn anyone who was thinking of purchasing this one.
Incidentally, reviewer Jenna is very perceptive when she claims "these [OXO Good Grips Bag Clips, Set of 4, Multi-Colored] have all sorts of uses that even I haven't thought of!". I recently learned that Free Diver and Haircare specialist Tanya Streeter used these OXO clips on her nose when she successfully attempted her record breaking dive last year. Incredible, but not surprising, considering the robust nature of these wonderful OXO Bag Clips. Top marks. Buy, buy, buy!

I had a Dirt Devil canister that I loved and tried to replace it when the wand completely broke, I even duct taped it together so I could still use it.  That did not work.  Dirt Devil no longer makes that model, nor do they have a replacement wand which  housed all of the controls.  This is not my old Dirt Devil, but it's a good vacuum.  I especially like the pet roller attachment,.  I use on the stairs which is the only carpet (red) in my house.  My dog is white so it really shows.  This attachment picks up all the hair better than anything else that I have tried. The price makes it all worth it too.

3101	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This was the lowest priced stainless steel pressure cooker that I selected after extensive shopping.  I will definitely keep it for small portions.  Having used the 4 quart now, I probably should have chosen a larger size since it's my only PC.  It is too small for a small whole chicken, but perfect for beans, brown rice, etc.
IMO, the best way is to crack (4"-6") windows in opposite parts of the house and let this pull air.  In the mornings, I have this set to intake and open the attic door so that the attic can ventilate up and out the roof vents very well.
However, being green is an important factor for some folks, so here below is a comparison in electricity usage I measured.

I really liked the Eureka Might Mite for another reason I'm sure the designers never thought would be a feature. I'm convinced our house was built on an ancient spider breeding ground. Their favorite spots (because they're so hard to get to) are the underside of furniture, and the foot space between the bottom of the kitchen cabinets and the floor. On this Eureka, the rod that connects to the extension rod has a slight bend to it, and the floor tool swivels 360. Both features allowed me to vacuum the underside of some furniture, and along the bottom of our cabinets, without having to put my hand up there as I do with the Bissell hose.

5828	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the best vacum ever. It does everything Dyson does and just as well. I had the Dyson but it was so heavy it was hard for my aging hands to navigate. It does have vacum bags, but so what if it works this well then its a small price to pay - literally and figuratively!
1236	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This blender arrived on Friday the 11th, and is being returned on Monday, the 14th.
 From the Eureka website I got 2 additional hoses - they were quite cheap with free shipping. No other retailer had them for this cheap. (In April they were 25% off $4.12 instead of $5.49 each.)
3218	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love it so much I ordered one for my mom!
I got this one to replace a Shark/Euro-Pro bought by my parents several years ago in the same price range.  That was Chinese-made, smaller tho heavier, had a good 9-10 amp ball-bearing motor, retractable cord and adjustable metal wand.  It was fairly well designed and offered a reusable, washable bag as well as a HEPA filter.  But it quickly transpired that the cord wanted to slip back in when hot, the hose wouldn't stay connected, and after a while kept tearing at the flex points.  That could be fixed, but only at the expense of several inches of length, and it was shorter to begin with.  The wand was great for floors but unwieldly in any other application.  The final straw came when the clumsy apparatus holding the bag in place broke.  I bring all this up because the competitors to the Mighty Mite made by Hoover and Bissell look to me to me to be made by the same outfit and except for the bag arrangement largely the same.  Maybe they've fixed all the problems, but despite being $10 cheaper I didn't trust them, and I understand getting bags is difficult, too.  My parents, who already have an upright, will appreciate this one's lightness and reach, its simplicity, and that it is "Hecho in Mexico."  BTW, I wouldn't even consider a bagless.
Cons:

The dual brush attachment doesn't work as well on the brush side as the other, but all-in-all it will do what I wanted quite well.  You have to get it adjusted just right and there's a ring you can slide to let some of the suction off.  That was open when I first fired it up and was disappointed at first, but with that ring covering the hole, it's fine, especially for the price.

While you're at it, stock up on bags, too.  Like the old Scouting motto, "Be Prepared!"
The only two flaws I can see are the short battery life (maybe 5 minutes each).  For my purposes, this has not been an issue.  And it is a little harder than expected to empty the canister.  Maybe it'll get easier with practice.

It is a family tradition at gatherings to make ice cream in that old ice cream maker.  We are very pleased with this new one and it has worked as described.  Our only BIG disappointment is that the motor is no longer made in the USA.  The old family unit was made in the USA and we wanted to continue this American tradition...knowing this took some of the fun out of the tradition but we will enjoy this maker regardless.  It has operated well so far - we have made 3 batches as of this review.

I do not foresee a problem with these and from what I can tell highly recommend company and product.
392	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Was just as described
HOSE:  I read about the hose prone to kinking.  I had that happen once.  The hose is made of light weight plastic.  If it is turned the wrong way it will kink.  I believe the kinking is due to my not fully understanding how to use the canister.  Vacuuming with a canister requires slightly more thought about how and where you are going to vacuum.  As long as I had the canister behind me to allow the hose to fully extend the hose did not kink.  Again this is a vacuum for a specific purpose.  if you understand that it will be a good vacuum.
Also good for stews.

I especially love the mechanism to open and close them (push down to open,pull up to close) so much better then the kind that use a metal ring that slides up and down.

I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.

5950	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is for the 12.0 amp.  I don't know about the lower amp ones, but suction is amazing and even with a half-full bag its still great.

1171	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Once I figured how to put it together, it worked just fine. My first project was to grind chicken to make burgers. I sliced the breasts into long pieces and laid them on the blades. No sooner had I turned it on low when the job was done! I went through 3 breasts in less than 3 minutes. This is really a time saver. Too bad some others did not have such good luck. I also love the deep red color. Great purchase.
8661	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Don't think I've met an OXO product that I didn't love yet.  They are basic things that you need for your house, but for some reason it seems to be so hard to find quality products for these basic needs.  I was so tired of paying good money for things that would end up breaking/cracking/leaking within a year.  OXO always delivers.  Yes, they are a little more expensive, but since they last they end up being cheaper in the long run.  Just a standard strainer, but it does all the things you expect it to do without breaking, leaking, etc and the quality makes me believe it will last years upon years.  Very thin mesh, but large sized strainer.  Perfect for smaller things (quinoa, thin pasta, etc), but can still hold a good quantity and fits very easily over the sink, pots, mixing bowls, measuring cups, etc.  We use our colander much less now as this can strain most things in portions needed for cooking for 2, is easier to handle and easier to clean.  I also use it to shift flour.
If you plan to use it in wet areas or where it will get wet now and then, you probably should get the "water shrouded" unit&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lasko-3720-Premium-20-Inch-Weather-Shield-Performance-Box-Fan/dp/B000BOCD1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lasko 3720 Premium 20-Inch Weather-Shield Performance Box Fan</a>.. made to sit in a window and survive the occasional rain storm.

On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is, of course, just a sample point, and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal.  Nevertheless, I hope this air velocity info helps us get a better sense for the differences between the fans.

I use it to store carrots in water in my fridge. It keeps them fresh and crunchy longer, and the water makes them especially cold. (I swear it's true.)
I haven't found the fill hole useful.  I either overfill or underfill the trays, and it's hard to get water into all of the slots.  I fill the tray with the lid off, just like filling any ice cube tray, then put the lid on.  The lid will be difficult to get on the first few times, but with a little use, it limbers up and works great!
*the design is not efficient air mover if you need truly forced air pressure due to lots of "leakage" front to back around hte blades.. Lasko makes a shrouded fan at a higher price which would be much better in that application (NOTE: This is shown on the Lasko web site, but I don't find one on Amazon.)

5587	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this little yet powerful vacuum.  Works well on carpet/tile floors AND will take pet hair off furniture with the attachment (included).  I like throwing away bags full of dust rather than cleaning the bagless cleaners.  I have owned far pricier vacuums, but this one works better for me as I use it for 2.5 hours at a time and it keeps up fine.  Very easy to dust ceiling fans with the brush attachment.  I will buy another when this one wears out.
Also, my old Mighty Mite would not carry its attachments, this one does it gracefully. The new hose coupling is free to rotate at several places, while my old one would not so ended up tangled. The new coupling between the hose and the canister snaps in securely without needing to be aligned, and out with the press of two, opposing buttons. Very easy.

Easy and then I am able to save and use my wax for starting fireplace and camfires! The very best! I give these away with purchases from my wonderful customers.
After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new.
If Eureka ever reads this, PLEASE put in a retractable cord! That's the main thing I miss from our old vacuum.
Update - 12/9/08 - Apparently it finally died about 3 months ago, so it made it through 5 years of almost daily use.  My parents loved it so much they bought another one.  I'd still give it 5 stars.  The main reason I think these do break now and then is because you do have to take a couple minutes every time you use the grind feature and clean it out.  My parents did that, but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time.
But for me it's the perfect size

I swore I'd never own a Eureka vacuum cleaner ever again! I've had 3 that were miserable pieces of junk. However, the local vacuum cleaner store insisted that I examine the features before storming out of the store, so reluctantly I did.

I can't imagine any kitchen activity that this spoon wouldn't be up to. It is very ruggedly made of stainless steel, and best of all, is dishwasher safe, a feature sometimes not present in high end utensils. The only thing that surprised me a bit about this spoon is its length: it is just over 11 inches long, which is somewhat shorter than many competing serving spoons. In my kitchen, this hasn't been a problem, but for some people with extremely deep pots it could come up a bit short.

4780	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Powerful, lightweight and very functional.  This is our second such vacuum we purchased and did so for a second home.  Our first was purchased well over twenty years ago for our main residence.  It is still going strong.  There have been improvements made with this newer version but the overall feel and function is basically the same.  I highly recommend this product.  In fact, we have any number of vacuums at our home which we have accrued over they years.  By far, the is the one we reach for most often.  It not going to be as good as an upright for carpeted areas.  Otherwise, for all other areas and purposes, this vacuum is great.  Also, one other important consideration is the bags.  I am not particularly mechanically inclined and often struggle to change the vacuum bags on the various vacuums we own.  Sometimes I even whine and recruit my otherwise busy husband to stop what he is doing and come over to change the bag for me.  Needless to say, he is not esp thrilled with these requests esp when he is busy doing something else.  Not so with this vacuum.  Changing the bags is simple - open the latch, remove the old bag, pop in the new and its done.  Extremely easy - does not even take a minute - maybe 30 seconds on a bad day.  I have two words for you should you be considering this vacuum - buy it!
I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However, it still broke after three months so you should be careful.

It is easy to use and the directions are very clear and easy to understand.  This one is foolproof and safe.


A note, though, don't put these through the dishwasher, as it will dissolve the glue that holds the rubber to the handle, and the rubber will just slide on and off freely.  (That's what happened with my old one.)  Not a huge deal, and I kept using it for years that way, but kind of a pain.

The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously. My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference. After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use. I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured. While not very scientific, it convinced us. I have thrown the other bags away.
5805	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have used these vacs for 30+ years.  They are the best little machines for hard floors.  And the bag part, love it!  All dirt is contained, easy to dispose of.

4781	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great little vacuum cleaner. But, you need to add a couple things to make it better. This unit comes with an amazing amount of suction. Wow! It has super pulling power for such a small cleaner. The attachments that came with it are good, but not good enough for carpets. The floor attachment for the carpet has no turbo spinning brush. Just sucks up without deep cleaning, whcih kind of sucks! (sorry, couldn't stop my self lol) Now, the pet attachment is fantastic. That attachment is small but works real good to get pet hair off the easy chair. It is a turbo, spinning brush, but too small for the carpet. It would take all day to do the floor carpet with this attachment. Why Eureka didn't include acarpet brush is kind of amazing. Even if it raised the price by another $20.00, it's needed. Also, the bags are paper. It came with just one. I got my cleaner used. It has a scratch on it somewhere. I have not found it, but it saved me alot. I paid just $55.00 for it! Great deal for sure! So, get the generic turbo brush for Iit, you will be needing it for the carpets:

The fan is still working well, no problems.  While it is not as powerful as a true "whole house fan", I am using it like a whole house fan (set on high exhaust setting, in the third floor gable window).  It does an effective job of enhancing the stack effect to cool the whole house.  I cool the house overnight using the fan, and then seal up the house in the daytime.

It spits out a lot of hot water, well, more than I expected. Stand back while it's cooking. Once it gets going, the "spitting" stops and it just has a little steam with the rocker.
I only wash it by hand so I can be sure to get all the raw meat out of the grooves and not have a problem with bacteria growing in it.

5206	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I know why this is a Number One Best Seller.  First of all, my wife was dead set against getting  a cannister vacuum. I ordered it anyway, since I do most of the cleaning on our terrazzo floors in a sandy beach environment in Florida.  It works amazing. The suction is Very Strong, and it picks up sand and dog hair (we have a Lab) as good as any vacuum I've used, and better than ANY upright that I tried.  I wanted a bag style since it doesn't require cleaning every time, and this is the suckingest (is that a word?) bagged cannister I could hope for. The wand is extra long for getting under the couch and other furniture, although the floor brush is low enough to get under most everything anyway. It has a 12 amp motor, which lots of uprights don't even have.  The wheels are well designed and follow you accordingly, and the cord, being 20 foot (which wraps nicely under the unit) is plenty long.  Oh, I almost forgot; my wife now loves the Mighty Mite and she's a pretty tough sell after 33 years with me.

1253	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this item confident that it would live up to the Cuisinart name.  Wow-am I disappointed!!  This processor won't even chop walnuts uniformly.  In order to get a uniform chop you have to "pre-chop" even the nuts! Why would I want to stand and cut all the walnuts in half before I drop them in the processor bowl?  I have adjusted amount, speed, time, you name it. It is the same dismal failure with onions, celery, anything I put in it! Part of the onion is ground to mush and there are pieces the same size as they were when I put them in still flipping around in the bowl! In my 40 plus years of cooking this is one of the most disappointing kitchen appliances I have ever owned.  Tonight I was mashing bananas and had to take them back out and mash them with a fork! I did not pay a lot for this appliance but it was not worth even what I paid for it.  I am contacting Cuisinart and if they don't want to refund my money or replace it with a different model, its going in the trash and I am going to buy a different brand.

We've used this thing maybe 10-12 times since we bought it.  I know that doesn't sound like a lot, and you're right!  The reason is because the battery will not stay charged long enough.  We keep the batteries charged, so when they die on us we can switch them out.  The final straw came the other day when I pulled the vac out to use, the battery died about 15 seconds after I started it.  I switched the battery out for the fresh, fully charged spare, and it went for literally 45 seconds before dying.

After placing the cover over my rack, a few movements of the brackets and a couple of other "touches" had the cover fitting perfectly. Stack-It-Brackets did the job, and at a lower cost overall than buying a pre-made rack.  I'd buy them again.  John
They do have some problems ..
I like the design it allows for those transformer plugs that take up so much space. The color code is nice and I used as applied but I don't have all the things labeled, that is okay used them for other items.

Love the colors too!
9226	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If you buy one of these, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it!  Whether you're turning steaks on the grill, arranging chicken breasts in the saute pan or pulling potato pancakes out of the frying pan, this is THE tool.  Comfortable in the hand, with just the right "springiness" in the hinge.  Put it in the dishwasher when you're done, lock it closed when you put it away in the drawer (but it won't stay there long).

1257	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's a little smaller than I expected.  The Amazon product features section says it is 24 oz. capacity but that is incorrect.  I thought I had made a mistake when I read the description but it was Amazon that goofed!  It says right on the box it is 21 oz. capacity but what you are working with is more like about 16 oz.  If you try to put in more than that it is just too full.  Even so, it still comes in handy for all the little jobs.  This is great for chopping up small amounts of veggies for my personal size salads and salsa. I even manage to make some hummus in this.  Just be careful when disassembling and cleaning the blade!  I'm saving for one of the bigger ones for the medium to large size jobs but this will be handy for the little ones.  Cleans easily and tucks away nicely.

I love making soup and stock, but it usually takes up so much of my time when the stock is simmering.  With this pressure cooker, I can make a meat-fall-off-the-bone soup in an hour!

6118	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Needed a small, light duty, vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews, purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact, lightweight, has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag, which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor, non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But, the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All, in all, this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive, convenient vacuum.

6 quart is just too small.  Then after the 2nd use, the rubber seal that keeps keep it tight and pressurized stopped working and got loose...it expanded and didn't fit anymore.
Honestly, I think the Pet Lover name only refers to the little gimmicky pet hair claw brush attachment it comes with, and I don't even use it. The first time I used it on the couch, it jammed on itself and stopped rotating altogether. Eureka sent me a replacement for free, but since it doesn't stow on the machine like the crevice tool and upholstery tool, I left the claw in the closet and forgot about it. I think that the HEPA filter can be bought and attached to the regular Mighty Mite too, so you don't *need* to get this model if you want to save some money and don't want the claw.
Occasionally, it also leaks a little water by the handle from steam, but is no big deal. Just seems to stop or evaporate after a while. Seems to be well built.

My boy is CRAZY about gears and the fact that this clock has two internal gears showing through a clear window grabbed his eyes and riveted his attention the second he saw it. He immediately wrestled the clock from my hands to play with it. Since playing is learning, I let him have it. The hands are cleverly geared to where the hour hand will advance when the minute hand is turned but the hands are not "locked" so you can move the minute and hour hand to wherever you want them to be. This is VERY helpful when you are first teaching time. I could place the hour hand EXACTLY on 12 and the minute hand EXACTLY on the 6 to help him identify 12:30. With other clocks the hour & minute hands lock so when the minute hand is on the half hour, the hour hand is between the 12 and 1 and it won't let you move it forwards or back. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this clock does not lock like that and lets me move the hands completely independently or in tandem as I choose! Sure, he can see that when he moves the minute hand, the hour progresses on its own towards the next hour number and NOW he understands how to read a clock when the hour hand is halfway between two numbers but before he was confused by the hand being between the 12 and 1 and would guess at the time (sixty o'five?)

They can be brutally honest.  I can be brutally honest too.  When I'm alone and making ice cream cones for myself, I don't even use the lever that releases the scoop of ice cream.  I just fling the scoop of ice cream into the cone by shaking it up and down and hope for the best that it lands inside the cone.  Sometimes it lands properly, sometimes it doesn't.  Depends on my accuracy on any given day.  Now you know how sloppy and careless I can be but when I'm alone I don't really mind.  My family wouldn't approve of this behavior understandably, that's why we're not going to tell them how I conduct myself when making food for myself.  It's not like the flies on the wall or the ants patrolling the kitchen counters will tell me I'm doing it wrong.  This isn't one of the better scoopers out there anyway- the ice cream often gets stuck so flinging is becoming more of a necessity regardless who I'm making the ice cream cone for.  If the ice cream cone recipient walks into the kitchen and bulges their eyes at me in disbelief as I fling their ice cream carelessly into the cone, well don't judge me people.  It's the scoopers fault the ice cream won't release, not mine!  Don't blame the messenger as they say.

These are the perfect size for dips, pills, spices, jewelry, safety pins, etc.  The tops fit very tightly, which I like; plus, the materials are high quality and attractive.

417	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have both of Eminem's other CD's, and after one listen through, this is my favorite.  It's easily his most danceable (which may earn him more criticism) and there are even signs that he's grown.

5612	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Edit to my original review. After changing the bag to the eureka sanctioned bag in hopes that the horrific suction problems I was having were related to the bag, I was bewildered. Then, I set about taking the vacuum apart piece by piece to discover huge clumps of junk clogging different parts of the vacuum. I thought I'd solved the problem! Except there is still no suction. Even straight from the shortest part of the hose with no attachments I can't even suck up pieces of cat food crumbs off the floor. I am so disappointed. I have hardwood floors and was looking for a decent vac that would keep them clean ish. I use a dust mop (chenille sock stretched over a swiffer device) before I try to vacuum so that the fine dust and cat hair are picked up first. Still no luck with the vacuum. I hate it. It's easier and cleaner to sweep and then go over the whole house with a dust mop.
  "The Eminem Show" continues to show the evolution of that talent.  "Without Me" captures the same fast-paced, light-hearted slams at popular culture that "The Real Slim Shady" did on his previous album.  In addition to such 'amusing' songs like that and "White America", Eminem delves deeper into, and makes some peace with, his sordid past.  "Cleaning Out My Closet" goes right to the heart of his pain about his upbringing and his fractured relationship with his mother.  If his lyrics in this song are indeed and accurate depiction of his life growing up, then it's no wonder he's such an angry individual.  Yet, through that anger, he seems to be making peace with himself, even if it means terminating any relationship with his mother.  It's gritty, harsh, but real material.

9480	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've lost track of how many OXO products I own, but I do know I have reviewed quite a few on Amazon. I don't think I've ever owned anything by OXO that I haven't liked a lot which is why I have stuck with the brand. This pizza cutter is no exception. I recently got a microwave/pizza oven and am so delighted with the gooey warm pizzas that have been coming out of it that my pizza wheel has been getting plenty of use. The round blade/cutting edge when applied with slight pressure provides a sharp and well define cut on a pizza or a fruit tart. One cut tends to do it with no repeat passes. This kitchen tool is easy to clean and it is durable. A simple soap and water wash is pretty much all that is needed. When I am exceptionally lazy or just forgetful, I've tossed it in the dishwasher with no ill effects. It is comfortable to hold and it is an easy and efficient way to take care of what might be an otherwise messy job.
When I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;)

Previously, I had a comparable Kitchen Aid version and it broke after about 12 uses. Hopefully this Cuisinart will do the job more reliably. I'm a professional chef and this is a basic machine for making bread crumbs and light chopping at home.
4452	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Description states Hepa filter eliminates 99.97% of dust. Well the hose and attachments attracted most of the dust to the outside like magnets. The canister became very hot around the Hepa filter, rear end and handle of the unit. Suction was not great and did not work well on carpet, picking up only surface dirt.  Floor attachment did not roll well over carpet. The canister, hose and attachments were rather cheaply made.  I don't think this unit would last very long before the plastic parts start cracking. I was very disappointed and returned it. Gave it 2 stars because it is light weight and did appear to work well on bare floor.
8425	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Honestly, this isn't a very good peeler and feels cheap when I use it. Peeling is not easy with this product. I think I will spend more money and get a good peeler with a sharp blade.

Good for stairs, hard floor, tiles, carpet and the car with the long hose and attachments. Strong suction, the easiest bag exchange. Refill bags either here (a lot cheaper) or at any local store that carries vacuum bags. Would love to see just this as a bag less option though as every time I exchange it I feel bad for the environment.

- Low price.  Would be happy to pay more based on how good this unit is.
Pros:
I probably wouldn't even need to vacuum that often if I was a normal person, but if I feel anything, and I mean ANYTHING, on my feet when I'm walking through my house it's time to vacuum.

The vacuum itself is light enough to carry while I vacuum to further protect the floor finish (I am VERY picky about my floors). The only drawback is that the electric cord is a little short but I just keep changing plugs and the hose seems a little cheap, but for right now I am very happy with this little sucker. And it sure does suck!

There is a small gap in the welds on the sides by the masher that catch some food particles but they clean easily.  The compact size also fits better in a gadget drawer.  My preschool age children can also use this with relative ease when helping with food prep.

I thought I was going to have to send it back, however, my daughter the other cook in the family was very successful in attaining this task. It works very well, I thought it was a bit cheap but it does just as great a job, I suppose as all the other pressure cookers. No problems with the release valve, it work well. So don't spend any more money than you have to, this one is great. So why did I give it a 4 and not a 5, good question. Would I purchase it again for a gift yes, do I recommend it, absolutely yes.

Note that for any given loudness or air velocity they overlap in, these models have very similar sound/velocity profiles. That is, when comparing points where air velocities are roughly equal for the fans (at the same distances), the loudness difference is so small I can hardly tell which is louder and the numbers support that.

I make all of our meals from scratch and that sometimes involves peeling a lot of potatoes -- a 10 pound bag a night for our big family when I make mashed potatoes (which is at least once a week).  My husband helps with dinner and does the peeling and dicing, so I went looking for the best peeler I could find for him years ago and this was the one that I picked. At the time, he said potato peelers were all the same but he changed his mind and now complains if he doesn't have "his" peeler.  The kids also ask for this one and don't like peeling carrots and other veggies with the other peelers.

3587	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I don't know if this is just my pot or a general problem, but the seal feels very flimsy.  It take a long time to bring to pressure, about 15 mins in high heat, in which time I would think be enough time to cook the entire content just with the heat, and my food comes out a little burn on the bottom always, even though I put enough liquid as the recipe calls for.  I'm new to pressure cooking and I don't have other things to compare, but I just have feeling, this is not the way it's supposed to be.

9099	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Bought this in 2014.  It cuts with little effort, and still works with minimal effort on my arthritic hands BUT..no matter how I've tried to con this thing into not letting the lid slide into the open can or how slow I approach the last bit of lid to be cut, it leaves a nasty snag ALWAYS and so you have to pry the lid out of the can, grab it and twist it to break the "snag" it leaves.  I've managed to decorate myself and the wall behind my counter with tomato sauce more than once.  And I've managed to cut my hands so many times, I lost count.
Whatever.

5572	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great light-weight cordless vac that can be used anywhere. I keep it downstairs for the kitchen and touch-ups in all the other rooms. It's great for a quick clean up by the litter box each time you scoop. I keep my reg vac upstairs because this Eureka Quick Up is better as a daily vac, so then I only need to bring the heavier one down once a week or so. Bonus - the cordless vac does stairs effortlessly - cleaning them as well as being carried up and down. LOL  Note too that with this bundle it comes with an extra battery pack which can be charged in the charger while the other charges in the vac all at the same time. This way you don't run out of power before you're done. I never had that problem with my first one and I only had one battery pack anyway. Nothing wrong with that one, gave it to one of my daughters to take to college and bought the new one for me!

If you have a child who is a tactile-kinesthetic learner, has had difficulty telling time or you just want to make homework a million times easier, get this clock!

In addition, it's a four for three item, meaning that if you purchase four of these, you get 12 bags for the cost of three, or $11.97, making the net price about $1 per bag.  Because it's a super saver item, you need to purchase at least $25 in your total order to qualify for free shipping. This seemed like a good deal to me, considering I got the vacuum free from my mother-in-law, but that's another story.

But as a consumer you won't know that it is defective until you use it and take it a part to clean/wash it. when time to reassemble blade and container to base it will not fit back on the base tightly at all. I tried for hours and my husband tried for hours to figure out why it will not align to fit back on base. Because of this defect this item is unsafe to use and I will have to throw it in the trash.

Be careful with the wings that extend to fit the window. They're not unduly flimsy, but they are a little flimsy. I broke one already. Another commenter worried about getting out of a window in case of a fire if the fans were screwed in. My take is that an adrenaline-charged 6 year old would have no problem flinging this fan across the room when screwed in. If you're worried, wedge.

The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid, the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height, the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.

The small bag capacity might be a nuisance if you have exceptionally hairy and shedding pets.
Granted, you could painstakingly handwash the scoop every time you use it, but I'd rather spend money on something else that you can just throw in the dishwasher or, for those of us without a dishwasher, be able to wash without checking all the cracks and crevices to make sure there isn't any gross food stuck inside of it.

This pressure cooker has many positive points:  stainless steel, included rack for inside the cooker, and a good locking lid.  I've cooked beef, chicken, and pork with it, and it performs very well.

I would think, if I ran a company, that if people are paying a premium price for stainless steel, it is because they don't want to cook in aluminum! They have shown their preference (or aversion)... but screw that! We'll just cheap out and throw in a disc made of aluminum anyway.

I use it daily on the carpet setting ... seems to pick up better.  I try to vacuum quickly before the battery charge runs out.  The batteries don't always get my whole house (even with using both batteries).  I'm not sure if they are charging all the way.  It does pick up the majority of the dog hair.  It can go under my couches, but it is inconvenient because it is kind of wide.  The canister does have to be emptied a few times during each cleaning and I usually have to use my hands to pull the dog hair out of the canister (it gets stuck in the flap).  The canister is on the small side, but it does the job.  Also, it is somewhat inconvenient to put back on.

8184	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My husband loves pie, so naturally I decided to purchase a pie server because it makes cutting and serving pie a more convenient process than simply using a knife. There are many pie servers out there, but I did my research and decided to go with this product. The server looks pretty fancy, but it also functions well. The serrated sides really allow for perfect cutting and it has a comfortable grip that does not slip. It is every bit as durable as it looks. I have used it successfully for homemade pie, cake, lasagna, and pizza (I'm glad I don't have to purchase a pizza wheel). This OXO pie cutter is easy to clean and use than a spatula when serving foods like lasagna. The only difficulty I've had with this product is that it doesn't work well for cutting large cakes, deep-dish foods, or foods that may require big slices...but that's really not what it was designed to do so I'm not taking off a star for that. I have owned the pie server since February 2014 and I am very happy with my experience thus far.

5167	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	We purchased this vacuum cleaner for our 85 year old mother after researching numerous brands. We chose it because of its light weight and because of the Eureka name. She used it 4-5 times at the most and over a very small area. The last time she used it, the vacuum cleaner got very hot and started to smell like burning rubber. The vacuum is supposed to still be under warranty; after locating the nearest service center we dropped it off. They said it would take several weeks before Eureka notified them if they would even approve the repair under the warranty and send the needed parts. Then it will take another 3-4 weeks to repair it. We are totally dissatisfied with this product and  will think twice before purchasing another Eureka. Perhaps they should change the name from Mighty Mite to Mighty "Might", because it might not work as expected.

Often, instead of getting out and using my large food processor, I only need to process something small. This little Cuisinart is the absolute perfect size, and it has a lot of power. It will chop an onion, make cracker meal out of whole crackers, or smoosh an avocado in no time, The little blade is reversible so it can be used either at the top or at the bottom for the most efficiency. This processor does not take up a lot of countertop space, and, being a lover of all things green, I adore the color, although there is quite an array of other colors to choose from. There were some smaller and less expensive processors available and I previously had one of those. However, the Cuisinart holds just slightly more (a whole onion, cut up, for example, instead of part of an onion) and definitely has greater power.

We bought it to do quick cleanups of our rooms that have hard wood flooring, and keep on top of the fur that our husky leaves behind.  As these areas are actually quite large (probably totaling 800 sf), wasn't sure if the battery would hold up before the job was done.  Absolutely no problem.  There's no loss of power on completion, which includes using the 'rug' setting on our low pile throw rugs.  The rug setting doesn't work on shag rugs, but that's understandable.  But it can handle low pile rugs and carpet rather well --- again, for a quick cleanup between serious vacuuming.

867	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Look, ignore the negative reviews. It's beautiful and it's cheap. Yeah, you have to do a little work. You have to screw the bases into the wall. They need to be screwed into something secure, not just drywall. There's going to be significant pull on the bases, and you don't want your curtains sagging! Hit a stud- usually about 1/2 inch out from the window edge. Mount the bases, then snap the covers over them. Mount them both first. Then extend the mechanism on the right side as far as it'll go. The instructions show how to do this, but it's easy even if you don't have instructions. There are 3 cylinders on the right side. The left one holds the wire, the right one is attached to the wall, and the center one connects them and tightens the wire once it's attached. The right piece isn't moving. It's screwed to the wall. Use the supplied Allen wrench to loosen the tiny nuts on the left fixture. Insert the wire. Tighten the tiny nuts onto the wire.  Stretch the wire until it'll fit into the right fixture with no slack. Having a friend helps here, but isn't necessary. Loosen the nuts on the right side, insert the wire, and tighten the tiny nuts again. Now hold the left cylinder so it doesn't turn, and turn the middle cylinder to take up the slack! Seriously- they sometimes don't come with instructions. The "wire" is actually a thin, braided cable, so wire cutters are necessary to keep the ends from fraying. Frayed cable won't want to go into the holes. Don't be afraid of the installation process- it's a snap.

The handle has a nice wide shape and rubber trim that allow for a comfortable and secure grip. This is almost a perfect pie server. The one area I do not like is the material of the utensil. The metal is a bit soft so it will have some bend; I can't tell if this is a design feature or a way to cut down on cost. It's definitely not as sturdy as my mother's stainless steel pie server that seems to weigh twice as much, but at $10 this is a fantastic deal. I don't anticipate it breaking any time soon, but on the other hand I don't anticipating it lasting a life time.

Just in the last two years we turned the fan direction to BOTH fans OUT in the room with two windows and the rest of the house windows open.  The hairspray presumably will end up being drawn up by the fans, especially the one I am standing 10 feet away from and right in line with.  In prior years, that fan was set up to allow air in, not out, for room re-circulation.  So in that case it was blowing the spray away from the fan.  However the other fan, further to the side in the second window (blowing out) was always the fan that developed motor problems; it would just bind up.  Opinions? (I have tried google.com to search for this possibility, to no avail).

About the clips themselves. I like them ok which is why I got them, but not outstanding.
instant
My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash, but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore, etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.
again for what I needed cleaning large wall and ceiling areas, drapes, etc it meets the need and the price is reasonable.  The only thing I do not like was that it did not include a soft hair bristle suction brush, which I felt it should have come with to complete the value and versatility of the unit.  I would never expect it could or would be used for sucking leaves up through the 1.25 inch hose system as the photo indicates. Go figure???

6733	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought these about a year ago to build a rack for my firewood.  I used pressure treated 2x4's (x8' length) that I purchased from the local DIY store along with deck screws to hold the lumber parts securely to the brackets.  The parts went together very easily with just a slight bit of trimming with a jigsaw at the end of some of the 2x4's to make them fit into the brackets.  It took about an hour with all the cutting, assembling, and screwing to finish the project from beginning to end.  I could have built a wood rack without these brackets, but I think that without these brackets, it would have either taken more lumber and much, much more time to put together something that is as strong and that can hold as much firewood as a rack built with these brackets.

Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins, particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly, we're not only enjoying dinner faster, but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!

3952	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I never really thought I would be writing a review to praise a pressure cooker. But, anyways I am. Some of the most common problems that people face with pressure cookers are: loud sound, too many whistles and food that sticks to the bottom never comes off while cleaning. This cooker is a pleasant surprise, because none of these problems happen with this Presto. I simply dumped lentils, carrots, peas and pearl onions altogether into this cooker and boom, after 30 minutes, the lentils soup was ready. Now, you may think what is so special about this. Well, here is the interesting part. Generally, when lentils are cooked in pressure cookers, they appear like separate lentil seeds cooked individually and do not gel with the vegetables together to form into a running soup. But, after cooking in this Presto cooker, the whole thing turned out to be a perfect soup, even without me putting any extra effort to mix the vegetables with a spatula. It blended the lentils and vegetables in such a beautiful way that it was just ready to eat. Now, here is the good part, it did not make annoying whistles, it did not pour even a single drop of water or soup out of the top and the inner side of the lid is immaculate even after cooking three cups of lentils. So, that means, nothing was spilling during the cooking process. It is the most controlled and well-designed cooker I have ever used in my whole life. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Whenever, you cook in this cooker, it will make you feel like something healthy is in store for you to eat and also gets you excited to eat it hot from the stove and of course contributes to a much more healthy lifestyle.
8204	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	When I first heard about a zester, I was intrigued. I promptly went out and bought one to remove lemon peel for Lemon Meringue Pie. I decided that a zester had to be the best thing since the invention of the whisk.

I have been very happy with this item!!  So far it is holding up well, although use is occasional.  The heat distribution is good.  I have to be careful not to fill it too full when cooking beans.  Perhaps the next size up would have been better for us.  However, I like it and am glad to have purchased it.

This pot is sturdy, thick and I love the stainless steel over the old aluminum pressure cooker.  I do think the handle is a bit flimsier than my Presto from 15 years ago but the good quality steel itself is a huge plus.
CONS- *Doesn't always clean corners * Not great on longer carpet  *Can't access small places *No attachments *Has scratched my wood floors when gravel gets stuck on wheels *Emptying waste cumbersome -filter hard to remove/shake off pet hair which sticks to it.
The unit is well made, the handle locks easily and it has a safety feature that wont' allow you to unlock it when there is pressure.  the ONLY thing you have to worry about is knocking over the weighted pressure release and allowing steam to fly up.
2)  The HEPA feature is laughable!  This vacuum leaks so much air around the HEPA filter as to render it superfluous and useless!  This is one of those abuses of truth in advertising, that you need to be mindful of...  Sure, it accommodates a HEPA filter...  But it is by no stretch of the imagination a HEPA grade performer--there's too much exhaust air leakage for that!  Nope, you will not be doing any asbestos abatement with this puppy.

The only problem I have is that it is relatively heavy and the handle is narrow, so when the pot is full of water and potatoes it is difficult to pick it up with one hand and hold the lid to drain and pour out the water.  This was not a problem for me when I used my old anodized aluminum West Bend saucepan.

Many peelers that have a swivelling blade allow it to swivel from only one point in the handle, for me these are always either jamming up or coming lose. OXO fixes this problem by allowing the blade to swivel on two points as you can see from the image below. This will keep the blade from coming lose and the swivel points are easily cleaned to keep the blade from getting jammed up and losing the ability to swivel.

I'm very excited to try and use it soon!
3605	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.  Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point, I have to remove the lid, and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli, but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time, but with my old one (not nearly as good, overall) I never had to think about it.  Remember, this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching.

If you want to make a pretty display of oranges and lemons, you can use the "channel knife" to cut thin strips of peel out of the citrus fruits. The result is a decorative pattern. I start at the top of the citrus fruit and wind my way around to the base. Think of how you peel an apple and it is just as easy.
That is what I tend to use. You do have a higher Pie drop ratio with a fork and a butter knife or spatula but it won't matter unless you're in a social setting where a "Pie Server" utensil is deemed absolutely necessary. And then, you'll probably be eating caviar with snob Pie anyways. Sometimes I even use my dirty hand or just use a dirty spoon to eat Pie out of the tin.
6315	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Useful organizer.  No problems over the closet door.  I did not use the anchor screws.  I didn't have problems with it banging or rattling.  We use it for ties and other things.  Ties are 100% silk, haven't had problems with slippage.
For those expecting to blender bigger jobs, like chunks vegetables, cooked beans, to make soups, I don't recommend these smaller blenders........get a bigger professional blenders that have the power and capacity to handle big jobs.
6019	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This was so cheaply made it should have been embarrassing to manufacture it and put it on the market. All it was ood for was making noise!  This one went back immediately.

9847	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Bought this for my daughter - who has managed to destroy 2 other potato mashers - didn't even ask how.  Know OXO makes a good tool so  I thought she could try this one.  It does its' job fairly well and she says she is happy with it, but she is waiting for the day she can inherit the potato masher that my mother used, I currently use - and was bought in 1955.  The two side bars does make it a bit harder to use in certain pots - and it is short for some taller pots - but nothing you can't work around.
5419	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	It does a fine job, for what you should expect of it. Lets face it the price is great the shipping was great and I would buy another one, and did for a friend, in fact we have them in all our places so they do work, just don't expect it to pick up a bolling ball.

Cons:

I hope that the folks at Cuisinart will take all of this customer feedback and commentary and put it to good use, i.e., a renewed effort to redesign this machine so that it is more reliable, durable, and flexible in terms of brew strength.

7517	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I was hoping for the larger OXO handle like the paring knife. Ithe handle is just a bit too small for arthritic hands to hold comfortably. I was going to use it as a spreader but the serrated edge gets in the way. Did not really want to cut with this. In general it does not do any one thing well for me.

1106	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I found this totally worthless. I'd try and chop up just a few small pieces of leftover meat and potato and it made a mess. There is no handle so no place to put your hands except on the bowl if you need to remove it and add something else to the processor. The motor is powerful but it is so difficult to handle this thing without a handle that my hands slipped and I had to wipe them off every time before I could do a second batch if I wanted to do it. If you need a mini processor, get one with a handle. I was very disappointed in this mini processor.

UPDATE 1/20/13 I still love these lights. These are the best rope lights I have ever purchased. They are still working just fine. I have had absolutely no problems with them at all. I don't know why these lights are getting bad reviews from others that state they stop working. Mine have been on every day since I put them up (they light up our dog area) and have never failed. The light is wonderful and really makes it easy to see at night. I'm actually going to buy another set soon to use on our porch. I'll try to get a picture of ours and post it here.

1613	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great decoration. It's an artistic, spooky scene. It goes on smoothly and adheres perfectly.
However, it should be noted that this is a vacuum that costs far less than one hundred dollars, so one should not expect a true, heavy-duty canister vac.  It is a very light duty vacuum and not one that I would consider using extensively in my house.  The unit is a noisier than mid- or high-end vacuums and at four pounds with rather cheap all-plastic construction with a motor that gets very hot rather quickly, it doesn't have the feel of a vacuum that would last more than a year or two with household use. As well, the full-size floor head is a lightweight plastic unit that attaches via two hard plastic hose lengths - not a fixed, full-size arm - thus use on household carpets or floors would be awkward for some.

If you have memories of trying to swing lettuce around in a kitchen towel, or have tried to use paper towels while they are falling apart all over the lettuce, you must try spinning in this great salad spinner. Once you have spun the lettuce you can remove the inner bowl and dump out the water.
5484	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I am returning this after using it twice.  The hose and parts are so cheaply made, the short cleaning path made it kind of worthless, and the cleaning path tool (the part that fits on the end) didn't roll when I pushed it to vacuum, it stuck and scraped.  The dog hair stuck to the bristles and stopped the suction action rendering it pretty much useless unless I stopped every pass to clean it off.
3108	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Not a bad, inexpensive pressure cooker--works great.
Instructions included are kind of rudimentary, but the idea is to heat it up on high until the top knob starts to dance, then turn the heat WAY DOWN, to a point just enough to keep the dance going.  If you've ever simmered anything in a covered pot, you have an idea of how low that heat may be.  It depends on your stove, of course, and some fiddling to find the "sweet dance spot" may be required.  Once you know the SDS, you can walk away for the requisite amount of cooking time until it's time to take it off the burner.

 I also bought the "frequently bought together" items (specifically the Eureka Generic Fits: All Floor Brush, Metal Curved Swivel Elbow, horsehair bristles, 1 1/4" fitting, 10" wide, color white) which I feel is a MUST. The brush has shorter bristles in the front so the floor stuff has room to be sucked up, not pushing the stuff around or trying to tilt the brush up. Small, light weight, powerful.  I have laminate and linoleum floors. There is not beater, this is not for wall to wall carpeting. Appreciated the snap together assembly, no tools required. Also, it came with a bag already in it!!

There are many things I like about this product. The grater sides come apart for storage in as small as the silverware drawer. The length of the grater sides are long enough to make full strides making a lot of cheese in a short amount of time. I can place the two sides together and create a stable grating station or I can take them apart and grate cheese over whatever I'm cooking. The grip itself is stable and easy to hold. Basically all pluses for this product. It was a great replacement from what I had before.

2543	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The first fan I purchased like this was in 1992 from Sears. It had their name on it, but it was obviously built by Lasko. That original is still functional, but after 14 years, it was time for a new one. Must be a proven, solid design to have been in production this long. It moves the air through my home easily, but my house is smallish, only about 1500 square ft. My only gripe concerns the fan guard, or grill, which faces towards the outside, through the open window. This grill is plastic, which we all know doesn't last forever. Exposed to direct sunlight and the elements, this grill will eventually become brittle. It takes several years for that to happen, but that's what happened with the first fan.

4627	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this item several months ago, and so far it has been worth the money. Most cookers follow a basic design, and though there are no frills here, this cooker preforms as it should. Being aluminum it has stained some what on the inside, but that was my fault as I burnt a block of corned beef in it once after I fell asleep after a hard days work and failed to hear my timer go off, but it cleaned up pretty well. I use it for making stews mostly but also for sterilizing caning jars. The rubber seal is still good, and is expected to be the only part to wear out over time. The handle is a high temperature hard plastic and the locking lid has a simple pressure relief valve. The steam pressure regulating weight doesn't make that nice slow n' gentle "ssshh ssshh ssshh" sound like the one my grandmother's cooker did when I was a kid - I love that sound, this one is much more rapid, higher pitched, and louder so when I'm watching TV I have to turn up the sound a bit to drown it out. Other than that its perfect and with good care this cooker can last several years.

I like that it has 2 battery packs - we've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it's out of charge. The only issue was the first time I emptied it, dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum. Also, the screw somehow came out of our handle and won't stay in anymore so the handle is pretty much useless now until we find a nut to use. The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair, but it was easy to cut free. Overall, a solid vacuum, but nothing insanely life changing.

2173	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My granny was a happy camper. At first she got mad I bought it for her and told me to not spend my hard earned money on her. I told her just be happy I got it for you and it's OK, I like to get you things. Well, it passed and before long her eyes lit up, she had a big smile and she upwrapped it like a kid on Christmas. She used it and invited me over for the first meal she made with it. She makes the same classic meal every time with it. I kid you not, this was the juiciest meal she has ever made. She's happy which makes me happy. This is the best brand you can get, and the biggest size you can get too.
5777	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum cleaner is so good that it was my second purchase.
The only downside I've run into is the silly slip ring you can adjust to change how powerful the suction is. For my purposes I always want the suction as strong as possible. However, it's very easy to hit that slip ring and accidentally open it. It seems it's not in a great spot to keep your hand on it to keep it closed constantly either. I may wrap a little duct tape around it to keep it closed, but as a flaw it's not quite enough for me to deduct a star. Also, when not in use it's small enough I just hang the canister on a 12 inch hook on the wall and hang the hose and they're out of the way. I've had it for about 8 months now, and am happy with my purchase.
NOTE:  I'm revising my review after using the vacuum for several months.  I've lowered the star rating from 3 to 1.  I have an area rug that never really looks like it has been vacuumed after using this vacuum.  My cats' hair gets rolled into a ball stuck to the bottom of the floor attachment and I have to manually pull it off.  There is a lot of cat hair left on the area rug as well.  Now, the cheaply-made hose has begun to constantly bend right at the point where the hose attaches to the wand. I think I need to look for another vacuum, or convert my carpet to hard wood.

9797	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We've been using this for years and the metal is just starting to get a little flex to it.  I consider it a good purchase because it folds down, grates in both directions, and has held up well for us considering we do NOT buy shredded cheeses often.
Another reviewer called this pan "too heavy," which I disagree with because high quality pans have a little bit of heft. This pan's weight is not in any way excessive, though it feels strong and sturdy, which it is. The nonstick surface is of a higher quality than teflon and is a breeze to clean. The pan heats evenly, the handles don't get too hot and the sides are shaped perfectly for easy flipping and stirring.
4599	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Wow.......I've waited to review so I had some use of the machine before I raved about it. I use a $300 dyson at a house cleaning gig that lasts for 10-15 minutes of cordless time before you need to charge it.

Definitely order an extra battery as one only lasts about ten minutes.  With two, I'm able to do all of the floors in my house.
I've been using this blender almost everyday to make shakes/pina coladas for over 8 years, and it still works! I use only four of the 7-speeds since you only really need high-medium-low settings. The glass is of excellent quality and very thick; I've banged it accidentally several times and there's not a scratch on it. The top has a great grip when you close it. The base is made of plastic and weighted. I'm not sure what else to say about this item, it blends well and it's easy to clean up after, simple as that! I do recommend regularly scheduled cleaning of all the individual pieces, depending on how often you use it.

UPDATE 6/30/2015: Looks like I'm down to just 2 Lasko 2155a fans. One of the two was purchased in 2011, the other, 2014. Of the remaining 3 that I had, one just stopped spinning (hair spray issue, no doubt AND NO WAY TO OPEN IT UP ENTIRELY!).. The two others both screech constantly, so loud that i just want to pitch the things into the garbage. We took them apart, clean, lubed, oiled, you name it. NOTHING WORKS.
Overall, I'm very happy with it. For the low price, I don't mind having to replace the accessories, given that the vacuum itself is very good.

There are only two drawbacks for me so far: the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat doesn't keep my feet warm.  I have to use the small one for my feet.

We overloaded a couple of shelves and over time they came loose, so I decided to add extra brackets. These new ClosetMaid 21775 are not like the originals. The curved end has less of a curve than the originals and are not as secure. The shelves are solid in the old brackets but loose in the new ones. So I ended up drilling a hole in the bracket at the curved end and used a tie strap to secure it to the shelf. These ClosetMaid 21775 brackets are really disappointing.

I bought another type, I won't mention the name of the other type but it was not powerful at all and ran very slow on all speeds, but all my Lasko fans work extremely well.
This Eureka came with a spare battery! And it last nearly 30 minutes before it starts to need a charge. Two settings...one for carpet that runs a rotating brush and one for bare floors. Easy to set up, easy to store with the storage/charging station that also is included. Convenient beyond belief!!!! kitchen hardwoods to rugs on the floor to the carpeted LRm to the bathroom. All on one battery charge and you have a tidy up grand job in no time at all!
Power and performance. The Eureka is listed as a 12 amp motor and there isn't any listing I can find that states the size/amperage of the Bissell. Another line that Bissell has especially designed for pet hair lists them between 9 and 12 amps depending on model. The noise level of both units has the Eureka putting out about twice the noise level of the BMC. The BMC is so quiet that if someone was sleeping in the next room it would not awaken them. I have to relate the sound to a pleasing purr instead of noise. When you shut it off as it slows down it sounds like an extremely quiet 747 with its whistling sound as it de-accelerates.

112	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	What a fun way to decorate the fridge! I gave this set to my teen for Christmas. We have all enjoyed making poetry with the magnets from time to time.  I only wish there were more prepositions. Also, I removed the words "crap" and "sex". A little pricey and I would recommend getting more than one set for a better variety of words.
In any event even taking all of that into account it was still by far the fastest pot roast I have ever cooked and better than average in taste. We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes. It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are still getting a feel for seasoning. Sometimes we have had dishes too seasoned and other times not but nothing that hasn't been easily as tasty as other ways we cook things.
This one probably weighs about half of what my old pressure cooker weighs.  They are no longer made of stainless steel, but are instead made of aluminum.  It is rather nice to be able to lift it easier, but I am concerned about the link between Aluminum and Alzheimer's Disease.  I know my steel cooker has survived durned near 30 years of heavy use, so I wonder how well the aluminum will last.  (I'll ask her to check in with y'all in 30 years and let you know how it has survived.)

I already own an 8-quart electric pressure cooker but wanted something smaller for the smaller meals.  So far I have used it as a pressure cooker 2x, searing meat 1x, and sauteing unions 2x.  I'm glad I went this route instead of buying this Presto cooker and shelling out another $50-60 for another stainless steel sauce pan.

I can't imagine this not being enough battery power for anyone.  I haven't mounted mine on a wall yet but plan to do so, wihch will keep both batteries charged always.  I cannot believe what this sweeper picks up.  It misses nothing.  It weighs next to nothing and I can sweep my hardwood stairs finally without dragging a back breaking vacuum around.  This picks up everything--cat litter, cat hair, dropped food, anything (might even pick up the cat!).  I run it with the brush turned on mostly, and it works on bare floor or carpets that way.  Works well with the brush turned off also if you'd rather.  As far as using on other things, I have used it on dining room chairs and it works fine.  You can wipe it off easily before going from floor to chair, but I would not use it on all my furniture.  I only wish they would find a way to let you put a smaller attachment on it so I could use it to pick up small spills off a counter, and cat litter that falls near the edge of the wall, etc.

I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use.

This cutter works sooo much better. I don't know if it's sharper, or if it's because it has more heft, but it cuts right through those pizza crusts, like a charm.  I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that, too. Finally, it cleans up quickly easily. Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have.
Seriously though, such a small size and big power are hard to find, and for around 50 or 60 bucks a good deal.
Also, funny story about the first one I bought... When it arrived, it was left on my doorstep by the carrier while I was at work. When I came home, the package was gone. I was later informed by my property managers that someone had opened my box and thrown it in the trash, but another resident found it and saw my name on the box so they took it in for it to be returned to me. The resident hand-delivered my package to me and asked me where I ordered it from because they loved it and needed one for themselves as well!! Seriously, these are great and we will get good use out of them before they ever need to be replaced.

Apparently, if you want to get true HEPA filtration from Eureka, you have to buy a model with "Sealed HEPA Filtration", which is Eurekese for "actually filters all vacuum exhaust through the HEPA filter rather than just some of it". This is a very important distinction to make for people with allergies, respiratory problems, or someone who's specifically purchasing the vacuum for DIY mold remediation/cleanup (aka me).
The wheels are configured the same but that is about where that ends. The BMC have softer wheels either made out of rubber, or more likely a rubbery plastics grade material that is guaranteed not to scratch itself across your nicely finished hardwood floors and tile. The Eureka wheels are hard black plastic.

I also have the Primula Tea Bag Buddy (in white). I couldn't make up my mind, so I got both!

5292	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have a very large apartment with all bare floors. Once a week I sweep and use a dustbuster to pick up the piles, then wash all the floors using the Twist n Shout mop system. During that week, I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings. Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back. I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it's as strong as the dustbuster but I don't have to bend down at all. Today I used it again and got perfect results. I have a 55 lb. dog and it picks up all his hair with ease. I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch. I couldn't believe all the dog hair it swept up from the couch because I didn't even see the hair on the couch and my dog is black. Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand. The Eureka doesn't fit there. Great Product!

It works exactly like its name and we are so glad to have it.
5501	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I've owned other small Eurekas at my cabin and they have been dependable and long-lasting.  This Quick Up Cordless Vac is great.  While it's not a deep-cleaning vac it does what I bought it to do.....bare tile and hardwood floors.  The sand and grit hauled in by me and my dogs not only grinds on my nerves, it dulls floors.  The Eureka was easy to assemble, hang and use.  I can't comment on its durability yet. One very pleasant surprise is that it is small enough to fit under my bed foundation to get pet hair from a Sheltie (yuk) which I had much trouble reaching with the attachments on my Hoover. The extra battery pack was the final factor that caused me to purchase this.  For bare floors and very smooth rugs/carpets it performs very well.  At its price with battery packs, I'd recommend it highly  ADDITION Aug 2013: While I still like the Eureka and it does everything that a simple, cheap electric broom should do I've discovered one Achilles Heel for it.  The beater brush, used for rugs, winds up lots of rug fabric and thread around the yellow brushes.  There isn't a way to open the beater bar and clean it.  I phoned Eureka and was told that if you remove the four small screws in the head you can clean it BUT(!) you may not be able to reassemble it!  This was their confession.  Other than that annoying feature I am very satisfied with the Eureka Quick Up so far.

The big handle on the pot part never stays totally tight; the others are fine. The pot seems to perform as promised, although you need to learn how it works and how to use it. The 6-quart is actually fine for two people if you eat a lot of beans and other foods you like to cook in quantity. Overall, it was a good purchase and I'm pleased with it.

It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped. It works awesome. You even have to put a door stop infront of a door in a beadroom if you have the fan in the room blowing the air in, otherwise its strong enough to slam your door shut. We liked it so much so that we bought a second one and installed it in the kitchen to clear the air when we are cooking.  we will usually put the fans on exaust and open up the living room window and it pulls in a strong breese with them both sucking the air thru the house.

6020	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm a small person living in a three-floor home (with a husband, two messy young children, and a cat), and there's nothing worse than lugging a heavy vacuum up and down the stairs. This vacuum is so light, I never have trouble carrying it. This vacuum may not have the deep-clean action that the higher-priced vacuums have, but it has turned out to work perfectly well without destroying my family's small budget. It handles the cat hair and litter, the kids' (and husband's) spilled food, and the general dirt that gets tracked in every day. The attachments it comes with makes dusting easy, too - I use it on my bookshelves (containing both books and fragile sculpture), on light fixtures, on paintings/photographs, and on those pesky ceiling-cobwebs. Given the amount of time I spend every week keeping this place clean, I find myself far less tired using this lightweight vacuum than I used to be with our heavy-duty one. You may still want a heavier vacuum to use once a month for the cat hair and dirt that gets worked down into the carpet - this vacuum won't be great on that stuff - but we actually don't even have one of those, and our place still looks great and clean with our using this vacuum twice a week.

  side note, the fan came packed only in it's original box, and the first one was cracked and broken. i sent it back, got another, and, and, and... the second one was broken also. it didn't affect the fan really, so i called amazon, got a 10 dollar credit, and kept it. they said they would be flagging the company, whatever that means. never a problem with returns etc at amazon. but since this is a review of the product, not the packaging, there is no star reduction.
Updating my review August 2016, works great, I don't mind the loud sound it makes as it is powerful and works great.
Overall Fan blade width: 18 5/8" W.
I thought this detached and acted as a "dust buster" as well, but I was wrong (read so much about so many different ones, I most likley got confused).  But it is so lightweight and small and you can use it just about everywhere.  I would like something with a little more pin-point action, but it's not advertised as such so it's not the machine's fault.
Box is a 5 for sure - BUT, shop around, you can very likely get a better deal if you do. I have about a dozen of these and the only negative thing I can say about them is that if you load too much weight on top, the latches will fail - but this is true of any box, not just these.

It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next, I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial, yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last, this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one, but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again.

If you are planning on using a full 3 gallons in this be absolutely sure that it is placed on a completely level surface while in transport.  I had mine slightly leaned back on top of a plastic tote on my front seat and it started to spill out of the top a bit.  Thankfully I had only gone a few feet from my home when I discovered the problem.  Once leveled out evenly I had no further problems.  The lid does not screw on (which likely caused the leakage I experienced since it was leaning back a bit), but does stay securely in place with the white handle.  My only regret about this product is that I didn't purchase it a few years back.
I am returning it to Amazon (they have made this very easy, UPS will even pick it up from my home).  In the meantime, I will be looking for a good quality stainless pressure cooker that is securely made, and doesn't come with "assembly required."

The cooking rack is made from cheap aluminum.  They should have stuck with making this out of stainless as well, and this is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.

Inside dimensions are a bit strange for books as the walls are molded to the "Action pack" shape and are not square.  I have trouble with a lid on one of the boxes as if the base is shifted or settled at all then the lids do not fit properly.  Think that was due to over-filling though. Amazon sells these way more expensive than Osh or Walmart, so if you want to pay an extra $20/each then buy them here. You can get them for half the price elsewhere.

One might criticize the friction attachment of accessories. Yes, if you go too quickly, or don't have the right angle, they may drop off. BUT-- they are just light enough to be fairly sturdy, they are not over-specced like some others, and it really is not an issue to me.

9996	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This strainer has a very fine mesh, as was noted by another reviewer, so I decided to try it.  I was SO pleased to fine a utensil with a fine enough mesh to be able to wash and rinse quinoa, since it's a very tiny granular grain that slips through most other  strainer screens.  Previous to buying the Oxo strainer, I had resorted to lining my other mesh strainer with coffee filters, which worked, but was a real pain to get the grain off the filter.  The mesh on this one also seems to be stiffer than some other models of strainers.  I have had to discard several other strainers of a similar type, that have had the screen crumple and pull away from the framework, over the years.  I am very happy with this item.

3489	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love my pressure cooker. Super reliable and if you follow the directions, it always cooks perfectlly Brown rice is cooked in 12 minutes! My first lesson was to factor in the amount of time it takes for the pressure cooker to cool down enough to open the lid. That usually takes another 10 minutes - if you are trying to orchestrate all your food being ready at the same time for a hot meal. I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process. The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful. Very east to clean, make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use. I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking. Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes.

I can't understand why it would be any diffront than a  electric coil wire stove top, it wouldn't contact the bottom any more than My glass top,  in fact less ,,according to you to get proper contact you would have to use a gas stove only.
I hate the shape -- for some reason it's tall and narrow instead of shaped like an ordinary pot (like my old 4-qt Mirro, for that matter). So this one fits the little burners of an electric stove but not the large front burner where one you'd normally want to use it. That leaves plenty of burner uncovered for you to accidentally burn other stuff on, yourself included. (Joy.) Also the weird shape makes it nigh impossible to brown your roast in this pan; you have to brown it in a separate skillet then stuff it into this thing sideways. And, yeah, the chickens stand on end.

If your window opens top to bottom, then the width of the inside window ledge should be at least 26.5 inches and less than 34 inches, and you should be able to open the window in such a way that the height of the opening is no more than 21 inches, 22 at the most.

I looked locally, couldn't find it and finally decided to purchase another brand at a local store. It was terrible. Plastic parts inside and tub, icecream was course. Motor was so weak.  I returned it and found out that if I could find a White Mt. maker that would be my answer to the ultimate icecream. It is a real wood tub, stainless steel can, steel and wood whipper, stainless steel lid and cork. Freezes my mixture in about 25 minutes and larger than most - 6 quarts. After I cook my mixture, I always cool it off up to 24 hours before I freeze it.  I think that helps with the short length of freezing time. I found it through Amazon.  The best icecream ever! I have perfected the family recipe and it's better than DQ.

At first I was hesitant to buy stainless steel, because it's more expensive and doesn't conduct heat well.  But the bottom has a layer of other metal to absorb heat, so it's not any different compared to my aluminum Mantra cooker.  Stainless is easier to clean as well, and looks better.  Some people worry that aluminum causes alzheimer, but there's no medical proof of it.  Oh well, at least I get the stainless steel so that I don't have to wonder.

9046	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Item arrived on time and packaged very well. We love this potato masher. It did a very good job and made great mashed potatoes. It was much easier to use with the design of the handle. The quality seems very good also.
3760	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The product came in on time, the packaging itself was giving a very China made kind of feeling. We still did not lose confidence and assembled the handles of the cooker. Even that was also not very clearly explained in the manual. The handle on the lower pot has just one screw that attached it to the pot and the handle on the lid had two screws!! A Major design flaw. The pot has to hold a lot of weight with food in it and needed a firm support. So once the cooker was assembled, we tried lifting it empty the lower pot handle felt as it will yield to the pressure of the hand was not sturdy enough. It did not take us more than 5 minutes to realize that we have made a wrong choice and the product needs to be returned before it is too late. So here we are returning the Presto 6 Qt Stainless Steel pressure cooker. We figured that may be it is a better choice to add 20-30 bucks to your budget and go for a sophisticated decent brand.
- After a few months it developed a terribly obnoxious rattle. At first I assume a loose screw/washer that I could tighten down. I disassembled the fan and simply can't find the culprit so I now suspect a bad bearing someplace. When it is in it's "rattle mood" it rattles regardless of speed or direction. It rattles maybe 25% the time. When not rattling it is quiet enough on low speed to sleep near, but when rattling, I can't stand to be in the same room.

I ordered some bags along with it because I heard they can be hard to find. I would buy this again if I needed to. It is not too heavy to pick up and take from room to room one-handed. All-in-all I really like it  for its size and suction power.

5473	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have birds, so before getting this stick vacuum, I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages. This vacuum works beautifully, and picks up things very well. It's not a "suction" type "vacuum", but it does a great job mimicking one. The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries, so you are never without power.  I had a stick vacuum years ago (different brand), and it only had one battery, so if the battery died before finishing, you were screwed, and had to recharge.  With this, if your power dies out, you have another one waiting, and you continue on.  I can vacuum my living room area, the hall, etc., maybe three nights before it starts to sound low. So it has a good longevity to the battery. Again, I love this thing! I'm so happy I bought this!

--  I wish the feet were made so that the fan could be pivoted such that they could be used without them sticking out on one side, like when the fan is placed ageist a (window/ door) screen.

4861	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	It's so bad. The suction is great, but only for linoleum floors - the tip is horrible if you have wooden or carpet flooring. If you have wooden flooring it'll scratch up the floors over time, if you have carpets it won't clean at all (AT ALL). The only thing this vacuum is really good for is if you're truly a filthy person who wants to fool your roommates into thinking you're vacuuming (which isn't cool, just get a real vacuum).
4711	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This light weight vac is so handy and really picks up dog hair and lint etc off wood floors and my rugs
I had not yet thrown away my old Might Mite and so I tried the old floor attachment hooked up to this canister.  Everything worked perfectly.  So I can say that this canister has good suction power...

6821	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This works well if you put it in your window to pull in fresh air.  I don't think this fan works well unless you put it in a window sill or up on another surface to actually get the air flowing.  The one downside is that the fan is really unstable unless you can hook in the feet that it comes with and that can make it kind of take up a lot of space.
7083	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	True to form, The RIVAL Co., has totally destroyed another great American product.  White Mountain freezers were the best made freezer in the country.  Now, they have been cheapened to being outsourced in China.  Believe me, you do not get what you pay for.  What I would give for The Rival Co. to go back to the original design they obtained, when they bought White Mountain, and return the product to the quality it once was.  It is no longer worth owning, at even half the price.  The electric motor is now made in China, and the first one I received of the 'new' inferior quality had to be returned because the gear mechanism was torn up when I plugged it in for the very first time.  Upon receiving a second one, the quality is totally inferior to the old product standard.  The metal can can be bent with a finger, and the aluminum canister top is so thin, it would break if dropped from a countertop distance.  The only thing that hasn't been degraded yet is the dasher.  I believe it is because they haven't found a satisfactory way to make a dasher out of plastic.  The cast metal one is indestructible, but the dasher alone doesn't make for a quality product.  Besides, in another year or two, the dasher will be changed, or else RIVAL will pull the product from their line as a 'non-seller'.  Planned obsolescence I guess!  More credit to the good ole' USA and greedy corporations.  DEFINITELY NOT worth the price charged.

1917	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The description of the model's that these belts fit is in correct, it said it would replace my belt but was two sizes to small.
This little unit does make big noise, but I think that's due to the powerful suction.  I don't consider the noise level a drawback. It's a lot less expensive and a lot more convenient than renting the Rug Doctor or calling in the professional rug cleaners for a few dirty spots.

This is an invaluable tool for every bartender. It feels solid and comfortable in my hand. It makes very quick, easy twists that look great. And you can use the same lemon for many twists, depending on how tight you make your turns. Everyone who garnishes drinks should have one of these, especially at such a reasonable price.

Also, I should explain to people that whereas you can get adequately strong coffee by using more than one measure of beans per cup, this essentially transforms the "ten cup" machine into a four or five cup unit.

6355	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	ok
Secondary niggle:  The hose end where it snaps onto the "face" of the vac doesn't seem like it's very robustly designed.  I say this because my first vac had to be exchanged.  There are two tabs you squeeze to snap the hose in, and when you release the tabs they are meant to spring out and secure the hose.  Well...they kinda do...but plastic meeting plastic makes for a rather loose and wiggly connection...and I would consider this the most vital connection in the vac system.  My first vac had one tab that never locked in, so I exchanged that one and on the current vac they both lock, but it still leaves something to be desired with how wiggly it seems.  That being said--I do pull the vac around by the hose to get it to follow me as I clean, and the hose hasn't popped out yet.
Make sure you read the description, as it does not come stretched or framed (I knew this but some people seem to be complaining).
The only issue so far is cleaning - since its aluminum the food leaves behind some residue thats difficult to clean.
I made beans without soaking them, and I could taste a slight bitterness, but they were better beans in half an hour than 12 hour beans in the crock pot.

1744	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have had one of these in the kitchen for the past year and just cannot seem to wear it out.  Analon Titanium seems to be one of the best.  I have other similar cooking units in my kitchen and have no complaints.

5678	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical about this as I have no luck with vacuums and this was cheap.  Several months later I am so happy I made this purchase.  I have 2 cats and 2 dogs on hardwood floors and this sucks up all the hair and dirty they leave behind.  I have only had one clog do to sucking up a Lego of my sons, but that was easily removed and no other issues.  Wonderful suction.
After purchasing both dyson and then Hoover bag less vacuums (about 5) over the past 10 years I finally went back to a unit with bags.  I believe that it is pure marketing hype that bagless vacuums are less work to maintain or use.  I am sick (and tired) of taking them apart to wash the internal filters every other month.  :-).  Changing bags every few weeks takes 30 seconds.
I'm comfortable with this because it's relativly easy to take the motor apart for a simple cleaning about once every 9 months [or so].  I've also added 2 4" circular layers of the old, cheap, black, 'washable' air-conditioner filter material between the back of the motor and the interior protective grill to lessen the amoung of gunk sucked into the motor.
8595	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Poor quality junk  Purchased this a while back from Amazon, but use it so rarely that the retail sticker is still on the handle, shiny as it was on Day One.

2547	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with this purchase.  This pressure cooker is perfect when cooking for 2-3 people.  It has worked well since I got it, it has kept its color (no stains inside), and cooking time is reduced significantly.
I love the plastic grill and blades.  They're easily removed to wipe down with a wet cloth.  Functionally, it performs as described.  I have never had to replace a Lasko product, so I expect this fan, which is a little pricey, will also be a great investment in the long run.  Six months in, and it looks and runs like new.  And it's made in America.
5213	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This isn't a fancy vacuum cleaner, but if you want a cheap workhorse, this is it. I have the eureka brushroll clean upright for my carpets since we have an annoying constantly shedding golden retriever. That vacuum is amazing for that, but you can't get into crevices unless you use the tools, which I find aggravating. So I bought this one for utility purposes, corners, hard floors, kitchen, bathroom, etc. I grew up using this vacuum, my parents still own one. If you have an animal and carpets, you'll need something with rotating brushes as well.

3327	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker, hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!
It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them, but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)

4972	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am sure they will be fine. Not tried these per se, but I think they will work great!
Cons:
7708	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love all of the products I buy from OXO, this peeler is sharp and it fits my hand perfect. The tip will dig out eyes on potatoes. I recommend this brand
7372	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Nice, fine grater. Almost a zester, but not quite. Quality OXO product.
And it delivers.  I've always kept my desk fans under my desk.  That way, they don't blow in my face or send sheets of paper sailing.  But they do circulate air and help push the cooler air upward.  This fan is quiet, but not silent.  I can hear it, but it does not disturb phone calls or conversations.  In fact, I'm the only one who can hear it.  No one knows when I have it running.

7436	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We went to a cooking class where we were told to never use the micro grater for zesting (like we all do) and to use this tool instead because its much less wasteful and you don't get the bitter white pith in your zest. Well we bought this one and I have to say I agree! I am getting triple the amount of zest for much less effort and time. Soooo great.
7150	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Purchased one two years ago and still using it.  Just purchased another one for a family member.  Power Center been through power outages and protected tv, dvd player, etc.  Really like the designated plugs for each electrical cord.  No more having to figure out which plug goes to what.  Would definitely buy again.
I don't get it -- the electric fan technology has been around since 1900 --
I would rather have paid a bit more for this vacuum and have the stronger hose that Eureka used to produce.  I still like the product but have to deduct one star for the hose quality.
2991	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is my 3rd pressure cooker and my last one was not a Presto, and was disappointing.  This one work beautifully and for me it is just the right size.  It seals quickly and gets pressure up easily.  I really love this one.

I cannot address how well they hold liquid but I imagine they would do just fine. They were delivered quickly and the price was fair. These work great for travel. Four use around the house the dollar store sells a pack of 10 rectangular containers that work ok. The lids don't take much to pop off so they are not suitable for travel, transport or rough use.

263	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I bought a few add-ons with this product, and we couldn't have had a better time making up extremely offensive sentences to shock the pants off of people!

It's small, which is good for saving counter space and for storage, but don't try to make dinner for 8 using it, unless you don't mind emptying it repeatedly! However, for a single man like me or for a couple, it's the perfect "must have"  kitchen tool. And not at all expensive either.

6671	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.  My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.  There got to be much better design.

2944	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Perfect size for two people family.  I do not have any problem with loose handles as some other reviewers noted
I don't think I would recommend for long carpets, or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that.
Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.
1381	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I really like this product for clipping to a blanket to use as a nursing cover or to clip a blanket to the stroller. The only thing I'd change about it is I'd make for clips metal. Plastic clips seem a bit flimsy...  it does the job though.
Overall a good buy and would recommend it to anyone looking for quick and easy cooking.

It is light weight, so good for anyone with lack of muscle power in their hands or arms, The cord is long so you can cover much territory without changing sockets, makes for fast vacuuming. But best of all, it sucks up the dirt like crazy.. So great for the price! In fact if you are vacuuming a small rug, you need to anchor it down with your foot.

8328	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's amazing what a difference quality tools will make in the kitchen. My old strainers did the job. They... well, strained. But they were getting rusty and they just felt cheap. These strainers simply feel great. The handle has a good grip to it, the mesh will have you rubbing it a little when nobody's looking, and it just looks classy. The 8" size is the perfect general-use size. The price is a little steep for what I'd normally want to pay for a simple tool, but it was worth it.
This is also pretty big - would recommend looking at an equivalent sized vessel in person before purchasing.  I also like that's it's stainless steel as opposed to aluminum.

1320	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Item is as advertised.  I have one for myself and bought this for a friend.  She will enjoy it.  Great place to store a warm wet tea bag neatly at the table.
The thing that attaches to the hose (that you hold when vacuuming) has a crook in it that can get clogged fairly easily. I've learned to always check the whole hose and assembly for clogs before assuming that the bag needs to be replaced.
2452	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I'm sorry to say the top would never close. And i had several friends try as well. Checked the comment boards and people were helpful but still didn't work.

675	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My favorite feature is how I can set the thermostat in 1-degree increments (unlike other units that either give you 5-degree increments or just a high-low knob or something).  Also, this warms up my master bedroom very nicely. I have bought 3 of these units. Only peeve is the beeping that accompanies each button push.
That handle is secured to the cup with some glue and a slight ridge running around its inner circumference. It was easy to clean off the remaining glue from the stainless steel and I could - if I wanted to - re-glue and reattach the handle.

In summary:
6799	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this fan for 3 summers now.  It's pretty powerful and very very lightweight.

The wire tools don't work very well. This masher does! Spray it with a little non-stick spray, mash a few time, and yum. This is definitely the tool to mash potatoes by hand. I avoided making mashed potatoes before I learned about this type of masher, now I make them frequently. It's small price to pay for a tool that really works.

I noticed many other reviewers here say they wash the pan in the dishwasher because it is marketed as being "dishwasher safe," but I would urge you to wash it by hand anyway. Over time, the nonstick surface will wear down from harsh detergents and besides, it is SO EASY to clean in 20-30 seconds by hand!
1869	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the 2nd order I place on Amazon for a new canner seal.  The first one did not fit properly...it was way too small.  This one is just right.  In reading through the reviews on several of the canner seals offered for sale, I would recommend measuring the diameter of your canner lid to know which size seal to order.  I do NOT recommend using the canner model number or canner size as a good way to judge the correct seal to order.  Hope this helps someone avoid ordering the wrong size in the future!

9837	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great strainer. When I wrapped it up for my fianc and put it under the tree he knew what it was immediately. He was excited to get it and I love when he cooks for me so WIN WIN! the quality of this product is good. Buy it, or regret it.
7812	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Nice spinner, easy to clean. I saw a Chef's video that showed it being capable of removing seeds from canned diced tomatoes, which I why I purchased it. However, despite being able to easily spin very fast, the holes do not allow tomato seeds to pass through. I realize that is not the intended purpose of this device, and otherwise it's a nice spinner. I knocked off 1 star because, in my opinion, it is over-priced for what it is.

5807	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Great little vacuum except for one fatal flaw--its hose continually collapses on itself when twisting. If Eureka can fix this one issue (just make the plastic one micrometer thicker, sheesh) this would be a five-star vacuum.

2599	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I have used other versions of this Presto stainless 6 quart pressure cooker for year. This time the cooker came disassembled and I had to screw on all the handles (3: 2 on cooker, one on lid.)  EVERY time I use it I have to tighten the handle screw.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  This cooker is no longer the top quality item I have purchased from Presto in the past.  Avoid this product.
5739	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This is absolutely the worst excuse for a vacuum I've ever seen.  There are no rollers, so it hardly works on the carpet at all.  The suction is very weak as well.  When you use the "switch" to go to hardwood floors, it scrapes loudly against the wood floors.  I was terrified to scratch the wood floors, so I stopped immediately, boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon!  I'm SO disappointed.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

5781	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Just received vacuum today and it is so powerful, love it! I have a dog and 2 cats, all of whom shed tremendously, and hardwood floors throughout  my house. This is the first vacuum I've had that actually works at picking up pet hair, dirt, dust etc. perfectly! I would always have to sweep floors in addition to vacuuming, which was pointless.  It is also really easy to use and move around. It has a really long cord, which is helpful so that you can clean larger areas w/o re-plugging it.

5926	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a low-cost, no-frills, mini, plastic vacuum that will be the BEST you ever purchased. It is small and even looks 'cheap' but the job it does will (excuse the pun) "BLOW" you away..... I originally bought this to keep in my sewing room, but now use it all over the house.  It has amazing suction, gets every little hair.  Fabulous for tile, hard-wood laminate and rugs.  There is no auto wind for the cord, you wind it under the machine all by yourself.  You toss the bag when full, no trailing dust.  Additional vacuum bags or filters can be ordered on Amazon but I also noticed my local Walmart and Target carry them. I had ordered an extra filter but do not see that I would need to 'change it out any time soon.  I used the Mighty Mite on a cat tree I was going to toss - The Mighty Mite made it look brand new.  Yes, it is that good at getting animal hair off of furniture too. Do not bother paying for expensive models - this will do the job.

I know - its not intended to be a vacuum replacement.  That's not why we bought it.  We bought it for quick spills, crumbs, etc.  We never intended on using it for anything else.  Sadly, we can't even use it on that.  Please - don't make the same mistake we did.  Its not worth it.  I read all the reviews - I did my research - but this one doesn't measure up.
2006	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Fit as advertised.
2139	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this item to scrub carpets and floors. I found that if you tighten the tank that holds water/detergent too tight, it leaks on floor when not in use. It runs automatically after plugging it in and pressing lever on bottom but it runs with less resistance backwards. It would be better to have a switch to turn on. It would be better if it ran with little resistance forward rather than backward. Since it does not pick up dirt, it would be better to buy a steamvac that actually sucks up dirty water rather than leave it in carpet or floor.
687	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful, heavy, not cheaply made, and worked wonderfully.
5163	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this and took a while to actually use it, as I didn't need it at the time. When I finally did, around February 2014, it did not work as well as I had expected, the battery did not hold a charge for very long and it did not pick up crumbs very well. I used it infrequently, and this month, just after the 1 year warranty expired it just died. I should have sent it back but the whole shipping thing seemed like such as hassle. I will go back to dustbuser or sharks!
8090	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The only reason I gave this item 4 stars was that I bought them for a shower gift and didn't try them.  The bride requested them, however, and was thrilled to have them.  (She loved the grips and the colors).

- Lose suction with brush attached - it's ok though.  can use crevice tool instead and get heavy suction
8975	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Functions VERY well.  The only thing I notice is that the gear/cutting mechanism - while sturdy in appearance - is not quite as heavy and robust appearing as our very old Swing-A-Way can opener.  This is NOT to imply that it seems cheaply made - it does not.  The biggest difference is that the teeth designed to grip the can are smaller, and spaced closer together.  But so far, that does not seem to interfere with operation.  I just have a bit of concern that the life of this device won't be as long as the much older one that had much deeper can-gripper teeth, so even as they gradually wore down, there was still plenty left to keep from slipping on the can.

It is not a quiet machine.  However, it is not loud to the degree that some of the reviews led me to believe.  I don't feel as if I have to wear ear plugs when using it.  Frankly, it is probably better than what I expected for an inexpensive vacuum with this power.
Stainless are a lot easier to clean. It collects less food residue on the bottom.
2686	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	WHat can I say?  Its Presto.  Great product.
It's so lightweight, carrying it up and down the stairs is nothing, but if you have the mounting space and a few extra bucks, you might want to pick up a couple of these.
2131	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have an older vacuum and was worried that I wouldn't be able to find the right kind of bags for it, but I looked around on Amazon and found these.  They are allergen filtration bags and trap dust mites, mold and cat dander.  The Type A is still used in quite a few vacuum cleaners from what I read on the bags, so these should be available for some time.
will last us a long time, they serve their purpose well.
The Lasko 3720 and 3721 also look a bit different than the Aerospeed BX100, so looks may be another deciding factor for you.
2667	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Looks good but my husband burnt it on first try, so that's it!!!!!!
Cons:  As others have noted, the hose is very flimsy.  Hold it wrong and it twists, causing loss of suction and a loud sound.  Normal operation is very loud.  The wand is extra long, making it awkward to use. The whole thing feels cheap.  You get what you pay for.  I suspect we will be buying a new vacuum within a year.

2002	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's hard to find vacuum bags at the store anymore, I still swear by the older models...
My cooker has its bottom rounded and I don't know if it came that way or it became that way from heat and the pressure. Either way it shouldn't be rounded, thus minus one star.
9410	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is just what I was looking for. It is great because of the non-slip handle, dimpled on one side and flat on the other. Perfect for whatever your needs in the kitchen. Well made too.
8839	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Sharp, and easily gripped to open cans.  Sometimes it doesn't grab right away, but it could very well, be user error.  I love them. Great find! Would definitely recommend.
The bad: if you have carpet, this is not ideal - you need a powered head. And as I mentioned earlier, it's designed to a price point - certain parts feel flimsy - the hose is small and thin (but mine has NEVER broken or collapsed) and the attachments don't have much...bristle. But if you read above - you can fix almost any of that. Some people don't like the friction only connectors for the hose and wand and attachments. Mine fall apart fairly regularly, but usually when I pick it up when it's been stored - and it's not tragic - they just slip back on, and if I remember to make sure each is tight before I start to vacuum, they probably won't fall apart while I vacuum.
6470	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	good value
4497	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I've had Eureka canister vacuums before and this one has the expected suction; it even does a good job on my low carpet.  The only thing about it that I do not like is the hose -- it's way too stiff and makes it difficult to vacuum.  Otherwise, this vacuum has good features and does a good job.
472	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Generous size, cute design, has been great for practicing letter identification. Has held shape. After 2 years consistent use, much of the image has worn off even with gentle handwashing. Just something to consider.
3310	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	while the product is ok overall, the screws are just terrible. They just rust very quickly even with proper care of drying it after washing. Not worth the money when you have to buy or replace parts every few months.

1634	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I searched locally (Lowes, Home Depot, Ace Hardware) to find a replacement hose for my Weber Genesis 320S with no luck. I even looked online at the Weber site and this hose length was not available (as noted by other reviewers).  I wanted to replace my existing hose after hearing a "hissing" sound when the propane was turned on- a bit scary to hear.  Anyway, I'm so glad this hose and regulator is available on Amazon- this length is so difficult to find. It looks exactly like the original that came with the grill, it was easy to install, and my grill is functional again. Also, the price was reasonable ($29.99 + $4.99 S/H). I hope it's durable. I'm very happy with the purchase, highly recommended.

4746	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	How can you go wrong with an Aluminum Presto Pressure Cooker?  After all, that's the cooker that was used by my Mother over sixty years ago.  As I recall, she never replaced it - just used it regularly until she died. I believe my sister wound up with it. Stainless may look better and last longer, but does not conduct heat as well as aluminum.  I won't use it as often as my Mom did, so this cooker will surely last the rest of my life. I'm 65. Besides, aluminum is such a bargain. I could see no reason to spend almost twice as much for stainless. And certainly not two to three hundred dollars for so-called luxury brands. All that's required is a safe cooker that holds a head of steam. The Presto has been doing that for almost a hundred years or more.

8064	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works great!
1778	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This was a replacement light which we had for many years, and I wanted the exact same light again.
But that makes this very lightweight!  And without all the allergy filters etc, it leaves room for a huge bag on such a small vac.  And there are some tools,  a combo small brush and upholstery tool, a crevice tool, and the main head has a brush that drops for when you aren't on a rug or carpet.  And you can hit it with your foot so when you go from the rugs to the floors you don't have to stop.  There is also a thing on the handle to open up so that it reduces the suction on the head.  Be careful though.  Before I knew what it was I sucked my hand in and pinched my finger.  But it will let you cut down on your suction.  (frankly, it got annoying to me and I just taped it closed.  I LIKE lots of suction.  :) )

It is  made from very sturdy plastic (not just laminated) cleans quite easily. I found all of the learning place mats on Amazon to be about 25% overpriced at 5 to 7 each. It would be nice to see them offered as a group with more reasonable costs. Great visual aid for teaching multiplication basics and to 5 year and up.
4087	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's durable, sturdy and rugged enough for a +200 lb person to use as a seat (in a bind), it has built-in wheels & grips and it holds a good amount of gear. It's much better than a regular plastic tote and I feel it's worth the higher price. The plastic is thick and isn't at all flimsy. It's not waterproof (so i hear / haven't personally tested it) so use caution if storing perishable items where the chest will be exposed to the elements.

Use your favorite breading. 2  Fill pot 1/3rd - 1/2 the way up with oil. 3. Get the oil HOT!  4. Brown lightly BEFORE clamping down the lid. 5.  Wait for the weighted valve to wobble vigorously then turn it down to medium-medium high on a standard gas stove. 6. Pressure cook for 14-15 minutes then pop the top.

What you sacrifice for value:

Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also, you should look at the recipe book.

I like to keep extras on hand because without them the vacuum is useless.
I had my heart set on a Miele (very quiet, great HEPA filtration to help with my allergies) but there was no way I could afford it, so I settled on this Pet Lover Mighty Mite. It has a HEPA filter that attaches to the exhaust on the back, and you can use Arm & Hammer vac bags with baking soda to reduce odors (it's a lot less dusty to close & dispose of a bag than to tap clean a little dirt cup that comes with the bagless varieties). It has the same amount of suction as a Miele but it's in my spending range - and it works just fine. It's a huge step up from my handheld Shark, obviously. The powerful suction picks up wafts of bunny hair, hay, pellets, stray poops - it even picks up hair from the previous tenant's cat that my old Shark couldn't get.
2251	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	At first it worked exactly as described. After only 2 1/2 months though it doesn't keep any pressure. The small valve near the handle will not pop up and keep the steam in. Water drips from the lids edge when I use it.

4538	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I wouldn't expect this thing to sweep up pile carpet, but it works great for picking up cat litter and other dust / debris that it can find. The unit sucks up bits much better if the beater bar is running. It is easy to clean, comes with replaceable filters, and has two batteries. If you don't attach the charging station to the wall, it's easy to swap out batteries as needed. A battery usually lasts us 3 or 4 days of decent usage before we swap. Replacements are sold as well.

9313	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Actually my wife loves it, She is really enjoying using it on daily basis.
A note: This type of cooker does not have an instant pressure relief valve, so you'll have to run cold water over it if you need to release pressure quickly -- for instance, with some vegetables. Not a big deal IMO, but if it bothers you, you'll need to spend two or three times as much. I can't see the point.
Works better than sweeping since I can shove it back in corners and it sucks everything up, rather than trying to get that stuff out with a broom which never seems to work very well.

6. The "air hole" in the tube won't stay shut. I'm not sure what that's even for (suction reduction, maybe?) but I do know I rarely use it and it compromises regular performance. But it won't stay shut! Keeps sliding open from the slightest of touches.

We see below that the difference in yearly electrical cost is fairly small, and of course much less than air conditioning. If a little additional on-going expense for a fan makes this much less costly alternative to air conditioning more palatable, then that's probably a good investment.

9520	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I really like this strainer, it is super fine so it's perfect for dusting power sugar and dusting flour mixes for angel food cakes or macarons.  However I should not suggest purchasing this item for anything that it not super fine. I have tried straining flour mixtures that required kosher salt and all the salt just stayed in the strainer. This also goes with sugar, if you do not use the super fine granulated sugar then you might see some left over in the strainer as well.
I'd buy it again...
Then I tried it near cat litter boxes that are on vinyl floors. It seemed to push the litter forward and not pick it up to be sucked into the vac bag. Again excellent suction but the design of the floor/carpet attachment was faulty. It just pushed the litter around. Uprights with a rotating brush just splay the litter in a 360 degree pattern so that's not a solution either. I finally drug out my Shark cordless and it sucked the litter right up. The downside to this vac is that it's not for big litter clean up jobs as the dust pan is not large & must be emptied frequently. But the trade off is that it is very, very effective on cat litter clean ups.
2262	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very simple and basic - no adjustable controls - but works fine.  We've used it a couple of times so far: for a Pork 'roast' done in an hour; a stew done in 30 mins; and for just boiling potatoes, done in 10 mins.

3004	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works well for a small family or couple.  Nice quality finish.  Handle on pot requires periodic tightening.  (Not a big issue).  Cooking timing and cooling is critical as some things cook much faster than expected.

The basic theory is you cook the longest cooking time ingredient first. Let's say, chuck roast then you release the pressure when almost done. That's the time you add Potatoes, onions seasonings and carrots. After reading the booklet for cooking times and recipes it is almost faster then a microwave oven.....REALLY!
Minor annoyances: Make irritating noise if jar base is dragged over smooth counter-top surface.  Jar base fills with water in the dishwasher.
6279	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Never a problem with these bags.
The rubber handle is always a favorite feature of mine (for Oxo products). It helps me to get a good grip on it even if my hands are wet. Even better is that it is dishwasher safe, so I can get it sticky with pie and can still throw it in the dishwasher. The pie server maintains a sophisticated look because it is predominantly stainless steel and then just has the rubbery sides on the handle. The rubber sides have a "fin" pattern to them that makes them "grippy".

I chop up my lettuce, put it in the basket and rinse it well with the sink sprayer. Then I put the basket in the bowl and fill it with water to make sure the water looks clean. Pull the basket out, dump the bowl and then spin the lettuce. It's so simple and the lettuce tastes so fresh and lasts so much longer!

It includes a grill rack that can be used high or low. I've used it high as a draining table for cheese making, and low for roasting a chicken. Handles are handy on a roasting pan, but too many of them make storage difficult. I want to be able to stack pans, a large roasting pan that requires it's own storage area is not handy, The fact that it's not non-stick means I can brown bones for stock in high heat without damaging the finish, and ruining the pan.

5584	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I got this to use as a "quicky" cleanup sweeper in my aircraft maintenance office and shop.  I, too, was a little skeptical about the charge life of the 6-volt battery, but since it came with a spare battery, I fugured that would be okay - I could just pop in the extra when the one in use died. I just did the entire floor - about 700 square feet, including 2 6'X8' rugs and a couple more 3'X4'.  It performed beautifully, picking up an amazing amount of dust, various kinds of "grit", occasional bits of paper, and so forth - all on one battery!  It choked up slightly when I tried to pick up too big of a glob of spilled paper from the document shredder, but it cleared itself quickly and went on working.
The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.

I especially like the large 4" wheel, which makes cutting pizza or bread dough fast and easy.  It's securely fixed to the handle with two legs(my old one was riveted on just one side, directly to the handle)so there's no rattle or wobble when using it, and it won't pop off.  Despite the larger size of the wheel, it fits well in a drawer.
I last bought this here on Amazon in June of 2015 and paid $30.94 for the eight gallon size.  They may have come down some in price but I still think it was worth every penny I paid.  Fantastic product!

Yikes!  I opened the Amazon carton only to find a very small box for a 6-qt. cooker. Turns out, this pressure cooker will arrive at your door IN NEED OF ASSEMBLY.  Well, I was still game.  Pulled out my handy dandy Philips screwdriver and carefully followed directions.  The long handles had one screw only -- Not much for all the weight and pressure that pressure cooker handles must endure -- But I still gave it a shot.

The brush must be cleaned after every use.  It simply wraps up long dog hair.  Also, the hair wraps around the small "glider" wheels and is nearly impossible to remove.

I have started cleaning the carpet and am very pleased with the results. The brushes are powering out stains/dirt that the steam cleaner wasn't getting, and the brushes have raised the carpet pile in high traffic areas that were matted down. After using the Floormax, I extract the excess fluid from the carpet with a steam cleaner and then steam rinse with clean hot water; the results are amazing. The carpet brushes get right up to the baseboard so there are no dirty carpet edges. I also cleaned the old linoleum in the kitchen and was surprised how beautiful this old floor actually is.

The battery last a reasonable amount of time and I can get the job done one charge. The problem is the the replacement battery's cost a mild fortune.

We typically order Large (18") pizzas with a LOT of toppings that are cut into 8 slices- big, heavy slices. This thing does not bend at all under the weight, and has less than an inch of overhang at the edges. Those edges are chamfered to to help you get under the slice.

In the beginning, I religiously followed the directions on making brown rice, but one day, I decided to try it without the bowl method.  So, I put the brown rice in the pot, filled water up to the same depth as the rice (so if the rice was 1 inch deep, I added another inch of water to create a total depth of 2 inches).  I place the pressure cooker on the stove on high heat and as soon as it starts rocking, I lower the heat (just below medium) and set the timer for 18-20 minutes.  Besides, you can smell when it is burning...don't aske me how I know.  Outside of the few times when I don't pay attention or set the timer, I get perfect rice.  The texture is fabulous.  I don't even need to soak the brown rice in water before I start cooking.  And, the cleanup is very simple.  Most of the time, I don't even have any rice sticking to the bottom of the pot. And, if I do, then I put some water or chicken broth in, cook on the stove for about 30 minutes (you can add veggies too if you like) and make a savory brown rice porridge with it!

Longer pet hair has to be pulled off the brush roller occasionally - but that is because this vac actually picks it up.

4267	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Although I never before thought this was possible, this vacuum has almost too much suction.  The hose attachment will grab onto surfaces and is sometimes hard to move even when the suction adjustment is fully open.  The hose seems to be cheaply made and does not feel like it will last .  The floor attachment doesn't glide smoothly and, although I do not see any marks left behind, it feels and sounds like it is scraping my floors.  I would be concerned if I had laminate floors but thankfully, mine are stained concrete.  Saving the cord requires that you actually pick up the canister so you can wind it around the bottom clip.  Also, if you run this vacuum for longer than 5 minutes it gets extremely hot.

The basic idea is that because of the pressure that builds up inside, water gets to 250 degrees, it is super hot. And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly. Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good. Well it does cook fast and it is tasty. I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.

I have Prime, and when I first bought them, I was not given the option of buying  nine, so I had to wait to buy something else to be able to get them.  I was not really happy about this, but I expected that Amazon would have them cheaper than I could buy locally at the "big box" stores.  I am a daily vacuumer, and bought a Dyson from Amazon, but it lost its suction in seven months, and luckily I had saved my two Hoovers... a convertible and a concept two (which I think is from the 80's, and still is wonderful) so I use a lot of bags.  I would much rather throw a bag away than have to empty that cylinder every day.  Well, since I found that I can buy them locally for the same price, or the Arm and H..... ones for half that price, I won't be buying them any more from Amazon, but I still really like the vacuum bags, and they have proven their worth.

One tip, if you are using this for a window that is bigger than 1 window wide, get the center support.  It really did make a difference.  Also, try to put them into a stud.  We installed with anchors originally, and they started to pull out pretty quickly.  I really wanted them further out from the window sides, but the curtains pulling out of the wall looked terrible.  We moved them to a stud, and have had no problems since.  Looks great!

If you need a suction-only vacuum for hard floors with the ability to vacuum dust above them, this is the vacuum for you.

If you are reading a hardcover book it is the perfect size. If you switch to reading paperback books, it's over-sized and you must compensate by moving it around until you find an angle that is comfortable for you to hold both the light and the book. Otherwise you could buy the paperback size version of this light. (Things could be worse - I guess it's better to buy large and compensate for small vs. buying small and having to constantly move the light around for larger books - just FYI.)

3	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This mug does only a fair job of keeping coffee hot.  It will absolutely NOT protect your shirt, pants, carseat, or anything else from spills and drips!  The lid does help to keep the coffee hot in that without the lid it is exposed to the air.  That slight benefit and it's attractive appearance are the only advantages I found.  If you have NO concern about leaking/dripping, this mug is sufficient, however, the Contigo Autoseal West Loop is a much better product, and for essentially the same price.  I have returned my Timolino PABLO-46GREmug and purchased 2 Contigo Autoseal West Loop thermal mugs in 2 of the many colors available (I like lilac & gunmetal).  This Timolino thermal mug, in my opinion, should cost only $10 due to it propensity to leak!
This is not like the Mighty Mites of old- the hose on this is super cheap and thin, resulting in repeated kinks that lead to weakening of the hose and then leaks. The suction is not as strong. The head on this thing ONLY works on hard surfaces- forget any type of carpeting other than indoor/outdoor.

5030	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this vacuum cleaner. The hose is a little too long but that's a minor complaint. Great price too.

I would recommend that users NOT oil the gasket as directed on the package.  I did that as directed with my 0598 canner, added water and ran a 'test' on the empty canner. The canner sealed and built pressure, however, gasket stuck to the canner so the lid would not open without MUCH aggravation and pounding.  Thankfully it was EMPTY of food products for the test.
This way I put one of the extra clean filters on the extra filter cage and I have one ready for a quick change out. I then can take the extra cloth filter with it still on the extra cage and wash it out in the kitchen sink with dishwashing soap. I rence until all the soap is out and wala I have an extra clean filter without taking it off the cage every time. I just hang the filter on the cage up with a clip until dry. Makes for a quick and easy change out. Works for me and my wife.

1975	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	great product, very tough belt,
When I unpackaged the ricer, I was impressed with the sturdy build of the ricer.  It is a white plastic ( it reminds me of the same plastic that by Bosch mixer utilizes).  The plastic is sturdy but not clunky.  It seems like it will stand the normal pressure usage.  The unit came with 2 ricing screens, a larger on one smaller.  They are both made of stainless steel and look very similar to the meat grinder attachments I have.  For my first use, I made mashed potatoes for a big family gathering and chose the large holed ricing screen.  I was in too big of a hurry to peel the potatoes so I took a gamble with the skins.  As I sort of expected, the wholes got plugged after a few rounds of ricing and I would need to clean the screen off.  But compared to the amount of time it would have taken to peel the 10 lbs. of potatoes, it was a great deal.  The ricer was exactly as I needed and was very impressed with it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.  The only improvement that could be made is if the potatoes riced themselves!

It is well made and I can see no reason to spend double the money for one of the exotic cookers.

Then, Winter showed up and I thought I would have to remove the fan and store it till next Summer.  But, then the so called free heat from the steam radiators came on and as long as it was waaay late Fall and about three degrees above zero, it was kind of comfortable in here, even though the exhaust fan was still running.  Then, wouldn't you know it?  A few days later the outside temp went up to sixty degrees and I figured it was time to shut off the heater valves.
7567	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this and the OXO Good Grips Zester at the same time.  For zesting, the zester was indeed much better.  This is a fine grater, though I lean towards a box-shaped one that captures the shreds within it (so they don't fly away).  The teeth are sharp and I doubt they will dull.

8396	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This replaced a similar meat tenderizer which I had for at least 10-15 years. It did the job, but it was very heavy and hard to handle. Normally I would have bought this through Amazon, but I wanted to make sure this was lighter and easy to handle. The good news was it was perfect. The handle was especially great......easy to hold and very comfortable. As for the implement, it is very much like a double sided hammer. The flat side is good for pounding and the ridged side works well for tendering meat. I use it for chicken and veal cutlets, swiss steak, etc. without complaints. It does a very good job and doesn't wear me out while using it.
Even though it's smaller.

5669	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am about to purchase this newer model of the Mighty Mite.  I purchased one 12 years ago and it just broke; not the vacuum itself, but the latch that holds the top on or it would keep on working!  It has great suction and I have not yet found another small vacuum that can pick up virtually anything it has in front of it.  I am bummed that the latch can't be fixed because the vacuum itself is a champion!  I purchased a Bissell a couple months ago and there is absolutely NO suction.  I can't wait to get my new Mighty Mite vacuum!
But, lesson learned, only after buying this.
It does not have a rack in mine, it does not have a 15 pound control, it is 10 pound by the instructions.
5958	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full, pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No, it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair, dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture, dog pillows, and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years, the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me.
790	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	It's definitely personal salad sized. Makes quick work of rinsing and chopping.
Really lightweight, which is great. The cord-wrapping mechanism is pretty much useless; I just coil up the cord and leave it next to the vacuum.

5016	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Has been awesome, easy to pull out unlike a traditional vacuum. Good thing it has 2 batteries as they do not last long. Suction power stays good as long as you clean out the filter frequently.
the unit gets really hot, really fast. It's not a big deal, but it's kind of weird.
I don't like the plastic handle because it is less attractive than an all metal handle, less comfortable (at least for my small hands!) and raises the risk that it can melt if I am careless and leave the handle too close to a flame. No strainer handle should be over a flame, but if I make a mistake it will take longer to cause a problem!

This is an inexpensive vacuum, very narrow in focus (hard surfaces), so it's not for everyone. On the other hand, I always had a canister (usually an expensive one with a motorized carpet head) and an upright anyway, and the uprights are generally excellent carpet cleaners, so I didn't miss much by losing carpet capable cleaning from a canister. If that sounds like you, you might want to think about this little vac.

3504	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	For the price, this pressure cooker is/was nice to have... but recently I've noticed the seal isn't good--steam is escaping around the edges of the lid.  This, of course, means that the pressure isn't high enough inside to cook things at the proper rate.  So, it depends how you feel--since its so cheap, is it reasonable to expect to have to replace it in a little over a year? (Purchased Sept 1, 2013).

3567	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This pressure cooker is exactly what we need.  Because I use it at least four or five times a week, I wanted something I could trust.  I've used Presto products for years and know they're reliable and long-lasting.  I would highly recommend this pressure cooker, especially for Indian families who frequently cook lentils (what I use mine for the most.)  It's easy to use and easy to clean, and I have the peace of mind knowing that I have a product that will last me a long time.
The Eminem Show follows up the Grammy winning Marshall Mathers LP with a bang.

Very pleased with this fixture!
My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore.  Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes (at 6000' altitude) and was fork-tender and delicious.  My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup, which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans, and it turned out perfectly. Beans were completely cooked but not mushy.  Next came a pot roast with potatoes, which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen, and was perfect.  Then tried a chicken with plum sauce--again a nine-minute success.  Most recently we tried pasta with meat sauce, which was a delicious one-pot meal ready in 7 minutes cooking time.
Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend. Just keep in mind the small size, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've provided a photo that gives a realistic view of the size, and I put actual magnets from the tin on it. I have small hands, and my hand is next to the tin (even though it looks like it's above it.

I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us. And remember to always get STAINLESS STEEL.

2333	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This is a good design. The only problem is that it rattles on the 2 lower speeds no matter what I do. Sounds like it's in the motor bearings.
To begin with, I like the feel of the chunky handle.  I feel it gives me more control over what I am doing.  It is simply the most comfortable server we own.  I like the double serrated blades, which are actually quite handy, especially when you are dealing with large cobbler type dishes of serving consistency. (By that I mean that some of these dishes are much better served with a large spoon).  One of the best features of this kitchen tool though is the strength.  As advertised, it is flexible, but it must be noted that the blade is extremely strong...probably the strongest of all our servers, even the high-end ones.  To serve a pie correctly, you do not want something that bends around under slight pressure like a chunk of thin plastic....no, you need a blade with a bit of substance to it, a blade that means business.  This one delivers.  It is of stainless steel and cleans up very nicely in the dishwasher.  As I am the primary dishwasher in our family, this last fact is extremely important to me.  We have a number of old wooden handled servers, which I would not trade for anything, but they are a real pain to wash.

3627	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	As reported before... single screw in bottom handle will come loose.
The new Mighty Mite use a single metal, telescoping wand.  This has the advantage that you can adjust it in smaller increments... so if you are slightly taller or shorter than the average person, you can make it the right height for you to do the floors.  And you can adjust it down to half-length so it (in essense) can work on the same jobs where you'd use just one tube from the old model.  One down side, though, is that it is a lot heavier.  If you often used the old wand for overhead work, you're going to find your arms getting a lot more tired with this model.
2818	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A most excellent pressure cooker.  It is significantly larger than those electric ones that plug in the wall that have all those digital controls and pre-programmed whatnot. No bells and whistles, just eight quarts worth of pressure cooking directly on the stove.  The older models used to have a metal list of pressure cooker ties fastened on to the handle. Too bad Presto quit doing that, but if you use a recipe, it gives you recommended times anyway.

2680	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use, easy to clean.  Once I figure out how long to cook everything, this will be my only method for cooking.  No bells or whistles, but for $45, it's well worth doing things the old fashioned way.  Preparing meals at home is no longer something I dread.
7600	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love the size of this grater and the fact that it has a handle makes it incredibly easy to use. Its contoured shape makes grating cheese and soft foods a little funky since you have to adjust it frequently but the shreds it produces are thin and perfect!
The reviews praise the quality construction of this cooker and I couldn't agree more. I have used both natural pressure release and the method to speed it up by sticking the cooker in the sink and running cold water from the faucet over it (it takes all of 20 seconds and doesn't have to be so complicated as making an ice bath for it in the sink). I have never seen any signs of the metal layers splitting, the pot warping, and there has been no denting from handling and washing. The 6-quart capacity is enough for me and my husband to have soup with some left over for lunch or another soup dinner, but not so much that we're sick of eating the same thing.

I've had several since, including a $500 Hoover upright with powerbrush attachments.  A friend recommended the Mighty Mite as a lightweight but powerful machine when tennis elbow made it difficult to move the very heavy and awkward Hoover upright.  While my Roomba does the bulk of household cleaning it doesn't totally replace a conventional vacuum cleaner especially if you're a person like me who, at any one time, has a home improvement project going.  I needed something to clean sawdust as it was coming out of the saw and to catch concrete dust as I drilled holes in the concrete ceiling (if I let this reach the hardwood floor, it would act quickly like rough sandpaper and destroy the floor's smooth surface).  I paid about $50 or $60 for a reconditioned Mighty Mite and expected to get a low-power machine that I'd need to replace in a few months.  Instead, I got the most useful and most powerful vacuum cleaner that I've ever owned or used in my life!  It's a brilliant machine.  What use is a decent vacuum cleaner if it never gets used because it's too heavy or cumbersome to use?  This machine is always ready to go and has incredibly powerful suction.  It's a bit noisy but I don't run it for more than 5 mins at a stretch so that's not a big problem for me.  I can take it anywhere with ease.  The ONE negative about this bargain-priced machine is that the flexible hose can't withstand the very powerful suction of the motor. This means that within a few months, the suction was regularly closing the walls of the hose in on itself, blocking the airflow.  The only remedy was to turn the machine off and twist the hose around until it regained its proper shape.  This got progressively worse so I bought a new, reinforced hose specifically designed for the Mighty Mite (from Ebay) for $30 or so.  I baulked at the cost, given how little I paid for the whole machine but it was well worth it as I now have the perfect machine for me.

They last, and they maintain a tight grip rather than losing their "spring" after repeated use.  Also, the relatively wide and flat surface on the business end does a better job than most alternatives at holding closed a wide-mouthed bag of pretzels, chips, etc.  The bright colors are also attractive, and the fact that they double as refrigerator magnets is a nice twist.

I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy, but when it comes to pressure cookers, it's not like other cookware where you "get what you pay for."  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers.

I have no idea what the metal composition of the handle is (definitely not 18/10 stainless), but it stains very easily, which also makes me wonder what's happening inside the wheel rivet.  I also question the need for rubber grips on any kitchen utensil, as it's harder to wash clean, and creates another seam.  I'm not questioning their initial functionality, but these are not designed to last.

I will say...once you start off the pot boiling a little, then add the ingredients and lock the lid it's just a wait away. It has a safety lock so it will not open when it is pressurized. After that...my tough stew/soup - comes out flavorful and super tender in less than 20 mins!! Yea...from what used to take a couple hours down to only 20 mins and the meat or whatever is even more tender!!! I wish I did this before. PS: take the others' advice - get the Stainless steel instead of aluminum! Yes the SS is heavier but don't have a metallic taste to your foods. Certain foods (perhaps acidic content and other factors) can pick up the metallic-i-ness in this super heated/pressured process. Spend an extra 10 bucks and have great tasting food. Best advice ever and I thank the prior reviewers for pointing this out so much!!!!!

Alas, the album as a whole is close to genius.  He proves here that despite his vulgar use of words deemed inappropriate, he cannot be defined by his controversial take on life.  By toning himself down here, Eminem shows us that there is a great deal of talent behind those offensive slurs, developing an album reflective of where he was in his rise to fame.  I love that he is back in the game, and I can't wait to see where he goes now.  If he can top this album then we'll be looking at one of the greatest rappers to ever set foot in the game, but then again, I think he's already achieved that title.

4090	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I always read the the one star reviews for a product for amusement. Nine times out of ten, it is obvious the user never even opened the the user manual or they are complaining it didn't ship fast enough which has nothing to due with the product. This pressure cooker works great if you follow the directions and the recipes, at least until you get used to it. I have decided to eat or more Mediterranean diet using whole grains and beans instead of meat most of the time.  I have cooked beans and lentils in it with no sticking or burning because you only process it for a few minutes then turn off the heat source and let the the pressure dissipate on its own. I would never cook a acidic food that is cooked a long time( like tomato sauce) because it is aluminum, but tomatoes that process a couple of minutes I wouldn't worry about. If you are going to do use it for a lot of acidic foods, definitely go for the the stainless steel. If you cook grains in it, the directions say do it in a stainless or glass bowl that you put in the cooker. If one has a brain and can read you won't have a problem with this cooker.

9227	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best I've found so far. Unlike collared tongs, the Oxo locking mechanism will not accidentally engage while tongs are in use. They have good stiffness and torsional rigidity and the metal at the gripping ends is thick so you won't cut into your steaks/wings/whatever even under high grip pressure. Rubber handle inserts give these a solid feel that provides confidence when you're using them. Price is right too!

4362	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I would have to rate this pressure cooker as on of the more disappointing purchases through Amazon. The price is cheap for what turned out to be a cheaply made cooker.  I would rather pay much more for a cooker with a thicker layer of stainless and more secure handles. The lower handle design depends on one screw - it doesn't work. I am finding that it loosens too easily. I don't want to continually tighten screws on my cookware.
So bought a new one, tis great! Works just like my old one, lighter weight however.
This is the Amazon page describing what was shipped:[...]
The one flaw of the design? It's short handle. However, it's not a deal breaker. In fact - the plus-es of this more than made up for it's sole shortcoming. My old masher (vertical handle) was about the same height and had the same issue.
1213	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a great machine for those folks who basically want mush.  You have to have Superman reflexes to slow this thing down, but it does a great job.  There is a dull and a sharp side to the blade, but won't matter....both sides will make mush out of an onion in no time flat.  But, for me, just so I don't have to chop the onion by hand is a blessing.  I guess once you get the hang of it, you can get it to just chop in larger pieces, but so far, it has been juice city for me.  But, this little devil has plenty of power and is great looking and super easy to clean.  I would give it an A minus. Worth the money!!

The suction is GREAT for loose cat litter and little crumblies you can feel underfoot while walking on tile/hardwood.
There is some assembly required with this Cooker - none of the handles are attached when it arrives & you will need a phillips screw driver to put the handles on - be sure to snug the bolts securely.  The rubber gasket pops right into the lid & the pressure cock just sits on top.

 should you pick up something that gets stuck in the hose..I do not care for the slip ring suction ring on the handel of the machine. I see no purpoise in that . You want to have a machine that is powerfull. And when this ring rolls around? It cuts the suction power in half. So you must be consciencous of this fact.

7344	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Pardon the pun, but using a grater can sometimes be a really grating experience!  Most have thin inadequate handles, are hard to manipulate, are too large, too small, or just leave a huge mess for cleanup.  I have a number of other OXO products and have been thrilled with them, thanks to their very user friendly grips and was equally excited to find this grater.  Now that I have I can give away all the others cluttering my drawers and cupboards as none comes close to working as well as this.  I have the old box style one with four edges, but honestly with a food processor who needs it, not to mention it develops rust.  With this easily held grater you can position yourself over a plate, a bowl, a pan or whatever, and make precisely the grating you need.  And did I mention the handle?  Even though I'm hardly elderly or suffering infirmity, it's nice to have a grip that is easy on the hands instead of some thin one that's hard to hold.
5175	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent little vacuum, which I use daily for quick cleaning. It picks up tracked cat litter, which is a challenge for any small vacuum, and is twice as good as my previous three. It has two settings, but I only use the carpet one, as it handles grit/litter much better. The battery lasts a long time - longer than I need. Plus there is a back up one. I alternate battery use daily. Some reviewers found it difficult to re seat the dust cup, but I don't have any problem with it. I would definitely buy this again.

3807	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	At the price, it must cut some corners, right? Not so! Presto has been making these things for a long time and it shows. This is the "old-fashioned" design with the rocker on top, but it's very quiet compared with older models and needs only a very modest heat to keep pressure up. The build quality seems great and the pressure interlock (that prevents the top being removed under pressure) is simple and works fine.
What I know now didn't know when I purchased:
4574	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've had this pressure cooker for 7 months now and so far I haven't had any issues with it.  I've only used it for artichokes (my husband and I love them!) and large beef chunks for stews.  I like very tender meat like in Chinese restaurants.  I never bothered measuring the accurate pressure (who wants to, anyway?!) but the trick I do to keep the steam vent "whistling" is I let the water reach boiling temp in between medium-high heat.  Once the vent starts hissing, I let it hiss for about 5 more minutes.  Then I gradually reduce the heat to low and the vent would keep on hissing.  I used to boil artichokes in a stockpot for an hour but with this pressure cooker, it's done in 25 minutes.  It probably takes less time than that but I never bothered to experiment further with the time.  At 25 minutes my artichokes are super tender and the "petals" practically fall off when I take them out of the pot.  Hmmm next time I'll try 20 minutes.
3831	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have an induction type stovetop.  I was pleasantly surprised that this cooker has the required "Magnetic" bottom required for optimum operation with this stove type.  The cooker is well made and with the optional glass top makes a great cooking pot.

One caveat is that this isn't for all cooking needs.  You could probably cook broccoli in it but in five minutes, mine was mush.  So, watch the timing.  As for the quality I think it's great for the price; I could afford stainless steel over aluminum.  No problems yet with handles, screws or parts; but I usually hand-wash at least the cover.  Don't be intimidated by pressure cooking, you're missing out on convenience and taste :-)

5121	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I purchased one of these for the first time about a year ago.  Although I liked it, the charge on the batteries wouldn't last long enough for me to sweep 3 throw rugs.  So when I saw this one, I noticed that it came with an extra battery so I decided to get it.  This one is sooo much better than the first one I purchased.  The first one I bought had a clear yellow cup but this one is brown.  So even though I paid the same price for both, this one is hands-down a much better product.  It almost makes me feel I got ripped off on the first purchase but I didn't know better since I had never had one before.  I definitely recommend this particular one and since they have the same name, be sure and look for the one with the extra battery and brown cup.  I wouldn't waste any money on the yellow one after seeing how good this one works.  And having the extra battery to be able to switch if needed is very helpful.

The only thing I would do to make this a better vaccuum is to add some sort of locking mechanism to the floor attachment as it tends to come off easily while you are cleaning. A minor adjustment would make this the "Perfect Vaccuum". We are amazed at the suction, the long handle fits easily under all our furniture and the long extension cord make moving around a snap!

7078	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	We were given a plastic electric ice cream freezer for our wedding which froze good ice cream approximately 4 times per year for 25 years. After 24 years it started to take a long time to freeze a batch so I started researching something new. I figured a new one could last me many years if I bought a really good freezer. I surveyed friends and family and read everything I could find online and chose the  White Mountain F69206-X 6-Quart Electric Ice Cream Freezer. It froze ice cream fairly quickly for 2 years (4 times per year). I wasn't crazy about the airy creamy texture of the ice cream but after freezing the leftovers in the deep freeze it tasted almost as good as ice cream from our old freezer. I thoroughly wash all parts when finished and store open and separate parts to avoid rust etc. I don't get the motor wet. Earlier this year it took a very long time to freeze a batch of ice cream and then this week it roared when I plugged it in. My husband took it apart to oil some parts and could see that one of the problem parts was even deeper and would require more time to dig into. So he stopped, put the motor back together, and I used the freezer which was making a little less noise after the oiling. It still took longer than before but it worked. In the meantime I borrowed my daughter's garage sale freezer to freeze the other batch and it worked great. Since I haven't used the freezer many times I looked into returning, but Amazon won't return after this long.
3537	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to replace an Aluminum Presto pressure cooker that was made in 1941 and still working, but I wanted a stainless steel one.  I love this new one.  The recipe book is a huge help because it lets you know whether, or not, to let it cool down on it's own or to cool it immediately under cold running water and it has a time table with quantities that serves as a guide.  Once the pressure regulator starts rocking, it only takes 10 minutes to cook a 5lb pork roast and that means no created heat in the kitchen which I especially appreciate in the summer.  You do have to brown roasts first, but they melt in your mouth.  I did find that artichokes took 5 more minutes than stated in the book, but that's still really fast.  The stainless steel cleans up very easily, especially if you soak it for a few minutes.  I highly recommend it!

When used with genuine Eureka bags, the air filtration is acceptable, even with my allergy/asthma problems.

But, it was a pain to have to drag out my big corded vacuum after work every day, and quite frankly, I really wasn't keeping up with it like I should have. Well, now I have no excuse! I can walk in the door from work and within 15 minutes (start to finish) I can quickly take care of vacuuming the floors - I have to confess that I have even used it for my "weekend" cleanings! It picks up all the hair and other debris without effort (I do put the vacuum on the carpet setting even though I am using it on hard surfaces - you just seem to get better "pick up" ability when the roller is spinning) and the battery life is amazing! I have not had to change out the battery yet (but I LOVE the fact that it comes with a spare battery just in case you run out of juice in the middle of vacuuming - that was one of the main reasons I went with this particular cordless model), and the extra battery is always ready to go because it stays housed in the charging unit that is so conveniently attached to the hanging bracket.  I had originally had my heart set on purchasing a cordless vacuum that was about $250.00 more than this one (you probably can guess which one based on the price) and am so glad I didn't waste my money!

For $20, I bought a Trueliving 16" fan on a stand.  It's less powerful but will exhaust 1300 cfm for only 40 watts.
It does have a powerful motor, but it is only a 21oz capacity, so that should make people aware not to over extend their expectations.  It is the perfect compliment to the larger processors and I would highly recommend it. For such an inexpensive price I think it is worth it!

Aha moment:  Why do the pet hair grabber brushes on this thing look like  a woefully undersized version of those on my Eureka hand vac, which picks up pet hair pretty well but does it faster because of its wider surface? Answer: Because the Mighty Mite lives up to its name. The little-bitty picker-upper apparently comes attached to way more power than the hand vac and that makes a huge difference. The woven fabric armchair that's been the bane of the hand vac just gave up a motherload of cat hair to this one.

This fan required no assembly. It will keep air moving in a small room. Especially at the two highest speeds, it's also very effective at creating background noise that served as a sleep aid (or at least as a distraction from the uncooled summer air!)

3691	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have been using it for a long time after buying it. I cooked soup, rice, and many dishes with it. And the quality is very good, and still very good after using it for a long while. I would recommend it to anyone.

* They are reasonably inexpensive, and blow a fair amount of air. I have definitely seen box fans that blow more air, but for the price, these seemed to be a very good value on a "cubic feet of airflow per dollar" basis.
Edit: I've had this vacuum for over a year now and I still use it on a daily basis. Suction is still great. This is a must buy. I use it to clean my floor, suck up hair, clean my car.. No need to go to the carwash to use the vac!  Awesome product. I changed the bag 3 times and use the non brand name bags that you'll find here on amazon which is so much cheaper but fits fine.

I use it just of my face because of the cost.  It's pleasant to use.  Contains 15% Gylcolic Compound. Not too grainy.  Just enough to know it's doing the job.  I can see the difference in a couple of days.  I shared this with my husband, and he likes it, too.  Really gives the skin a healthy, rich look.

6201	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have two Oreck uprights (upstairs and down), am a single, widowed guy with a housekeeper who loves the upright Oreck vacuums but they are not good for wood floors (great for carpet), we BOTH disliked the Oreck canister vacs which I had received free with the uprights as they were weak in power and had VERY small bags.  We BOTH REALLY like these Eureka Mighty Mites, a LOT! They are great for multiple cleaning projects and I just got my 2nd one for my upstairs home office.  The bags are large for a small canister vac, they are VERY powerful (no comparison between this and the Oreck canister)!!!.  For wood floors, Eureka does have an attachment for sale on their site which is a little better for bare floors but the one with this will do just fine. I also use this for my car-great for cleaning cars and in garages.  I also use one for cleaning the wood floor on my screen porch.  A GREAT price, large bag, powerful, lightweight, could not be more pleased.

2067	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These are the real deal.  AUTHENTIC Eureka belts for use with the Sanitaire's and any other of the older style uprights that have the belt running down the middle of the brushroll.  I have tried generic belts in the past and most have suffered from premature failure and "burnout".  Some have even cracked and broke as a result of the heat and friction created when the motor is running. It all depends on the type--and quality--of the rubber folks.  There is a reason manufacturers recommend sticking with genuine replacement parts.  Though generic belts/bags *may* fill the void, my experience has always been less than positive.  These fit my 30+ year old Eureka upright perfectly and make it run like new once again.  I also refuse to part with this machine because I firmly believe it outperforms many of the newer models on the market today.  What's more, the maintenance and design of these older vacuums are such that you can usually do the work yourself.  If you understand how these vacuums work and are mechanically inclined, they are virtually maintenance free.  There is literally nothing that can go wrong on these machines except the belt and the occasional light burnout.  I generally need to change my mine roughly every 2-3 months depending on use.  Also, carpets with tassels and loose threads wreak havoc on these things--get rid of them.  They are nothing but a nuisance anyway.  Overall, I'm quite pleased and hope that Eureka continues to make these available for the long term.

It also crushes ice like nobody's business, which was the final deciding factor. A couple other reviews mentioned issues with the button labels peeling off (under warranty, I'd have gotten an immediate replacement - could have missed QC), dripping into the blade housing (no clue how that could happen unless the user held a glass directly over the blade seat) and the motor burning out after "only" 2 years (no mention whether the use was extremely heavy, or not). Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those. The more predominant reviews were fairly glowing, and those I paid attention to.

I like the way it works because it is very similar to my old cooker but improved safety wise. I am going to hand wash it so that it will keep its shine.

We use it to heat our apartment living room instead of blasting the heat and running up electric bills for the whole house. It can heat our living room from ~50 degrees to ~70 degrees in 5-10 minutes on all high settings (i.e. high vent, highest temperature) and oscillating (our apartment living room is about 10x12 sq ft. The plating really helps the unit from being too hot to the touch, so you won't immediately burn yourself - or your pets or kids. The remote is very convenient, and we found that it fits perfectly into the "handle" part (on the back of the unit where you carry it) if the non-button side is inserted into the "handle" area.

4815	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	After buying an aluminum I read about the leaching of the mayerial into the food and the health risks involved. I was advised to spend the extra money. Since this is a stock item, I took it to Wal-Mart and traded it for a 6 quart Stainless. Boy was I surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as I used to have a sixx litter European and a whole chicken fits just fine. Anyway, I can't recommend this, because of the material and because of the size. If I could afford it, I would go for the electric pressure cooker with at least an 8 quart size of stainless - Cuisinart or other brands check Amazon around $150 and up. You get what you pay for.

I can go over my house and still not have to change the battery if it's just a quick pickup.

5360	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I Researched cordless stick vacuum cleaners and decided on this one after reading reviews. I don't know if my expectations were too high or what but I was not thrilled when I pulled it out of the box; very cheap plastic, and after letting it charge for 12 hours i ended up I charging it for another night hoping that I just didn't have it charged up high enough. It goes at best seven minutes on a full charge and the last three minutes of it are so weak it doesn't even pick up a Pine needle from my fake Christmas tree. I realize that it's not going to be a strong as an electric model and it's more of a light duty sweeper but my $15 Walmart special Bissell 3 in 1 is much stronger. I also have a continuous red flashing light on the charger that I can't find any reason for in the generic manual that comes with it. It has been plugged in and charging for three days now and still flashes even after checking the connection and wiping them off and re- plugging it in. This may just be a defective model , I hope so ,but I'm going to be returning it and exchanging it for a plug in vacuum. My suggestion is if you're not looking for a cordless light duty sweeper buy a sweeper with the roller that moves manually as you push and save some money. I'm so disappointed :(

3560	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I already own a 6qt Fagor over 15 years old and a 2qt Kuhn Rikon.  This is much better than the KR and in every way as good as the Fagor and it cost 1/5 the price of the KR and half the cost of the Fagor similar model.  Based on other reviews I replaced the Steel Screws with Stainless  2 each 10-24 x 3/4 pan head, 2 each 8/32 x 1/2 pan head and two 8/32 x 1/2 inch flat head.  I used locktite red on each to prevent them from loosening. So far no rust and no loosening.  Cost for the bolts was around $3 and since I had to assemble the handles anyway only the two flatheads inside the lid had to be removed from the original item.  Note the top is not stainless though or is a cheap imitation thereof..  It is magnetic so probably steel.  The pot itself is stainless.  Unlie the KR and FAGOR this pot weight wobbles making a noise.  I like that.  Aural and visual indication of pressure.  Nice..  Finish and fit are fine.  Bottom thick enough but not very thick.  All in all for $36 a good deal.  I am retiring the KR. because the screws keep pulling out of the handles (no inserts like this one) and other things keep failing like the gasket and handles themselves.  KR maintenance $30 per year, Fagor $0 per year (gasket once during it s 15 year life so far)  This pot, who knows, not much to go wrong.

This three speed, five blade, box fan, although inexpensive, has been faithfully doing its job on the lowest speed setting for a few years now, sitting on a card table, and keeping some air movement going in our basement, -helping to prevent (along with a dehumidifier) rust, mold, and mildew. This fan with its plastic blades, runs with very little noise of any kind. The sides of the box are grey, and the fan blades, handle, selector knob and the blade grill covers are white. It also has a couple of plastic foot supports to prevent it from tipping over (on a hard surface anyway, -on heavy carpeting, maybe). Definitely worth buying.

I thought, as battery powered,at first, something has to give as a tradeoff.....either power or run-time.  Well, all worries came to ease after it's initial charge of 16-hours.  This broom is a little powerhouse.  It is perfect for our use, which is, to pick up stray cat litter.  It not only achieves this, but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low-pile carpeted floor.  Run-time is fabulous.  It has run for more than fifteen minutes, with no degradation of power, on the initial battery.  if one has to sweep longer than this, of course, the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten-seconds.  Highly recommend.

They are bulk generic, just like these, but I have had good luck with generic.  I have a bag type commercial model from Sams Club and I was told before buying it that it was notorious for breaking belts.  Belt breakage is a small price to pay for the way the vacuum works.  It was suggested by the carpet installer that did our house and he was right.  No dust, clean carpet.

5526	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We recently had laminate and tile flooring put down in our house, taking carpet up in all but the bedrooms.  My big vacuum has a hard floor setting, but I knew I would like something lightweight to use on the new floors.  While searching the internet I came upon the Quick Up Cordless.  After reading the reviews I decided to order it.  The bonus battery pack was definitely a selling point.  I can vacuum the entire hard floor areas on one charge though.  It is a little messy cleaning the container out, so I do that outside.  It's amazing how much the little thing picks up.  I normally use it with the brush roll off, but have turned that feature on at times.  It's delicate enough to use on the laminate without scratching it like a regular vacuum would do.  It's wonderful not having to plug and unplug a cord from room to room.  Please note that this little vacuum cannot be expected to vacuum carpet like a regular one.  It's not intended for that use.  It will pick up off of carpet of course, but not deep clean carpet like a regular vacuum.  I use my Quick Up everyday on my tile and laminate and love it!

At 24 gallons it is not too heavy for a woman to lift when loaded and 2 of them hold all the basics for camping.  Once they are unloaded at the campsite they can be used for seats (for 200-pounders), step stools, or wash basins for dirty dishes.  If you drop them while they're loaded they will not crack, unlike the clear plastic ones (learned this the hard way).  They are lockable and while I have never experienced human thievery while camping, I have experienced the raccoon version so to keep them out I thread long twist-ties through the padlock holes in the handles. I only wish they came in clear plastic, but other than that they are great.

I like the size of the new spinner and the non-slip base, but it is too cumbersome for my almost daily use. The plunger that makes it spin locks automatically when the stop button is applied. Removing the top portion reveals an inner lid that must also be removed to take out the lettuce. Then the whole thing needs to be reassembled and unlocked before the next batch of lettuce can be spun dry. Maybe the inner lid is supposed to come out together with the top? (Mine didnt.)  Im too accustomed to the efficiency and simplicity of my old Zyliss to appreciate the Oxo model. I have several other Oxo kitchen items, and they all work well for me. However, this spinner is being returned, and Ive ordered a new Zyliss.

This little guy, however, had a wand that is long enough that I can stand upright whle vacuuming!  (Quite a treat for me!)  Also, it weighs next to nothing, so can easily travel wherever I want to go, including upstairs.  It was a breeze to put together(in fact, out of the box, assembled, and most of my downstairs was vacuumed in 40 minutes).  Although some reviewers ciomplained about the noise, I don't share that complaint at all.  In fact, my dogs didn't clear out to the back yard as they usually do when I start a vacuum.  Oh, and the cord is long enough so that I don't have to continually change outlets from room to room And I love the fact that it has a bag.  I've had it up to here with the canister vacs that have to be emptied and scrubbed twice in the course of vacuuming my downstairs, and all the mess they create.  All in all, this is one of the best purchases i've made from Amazon,  and I have made a BUNCH.  I love my Mighty Mite!!!

3501	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Years ago my family used a pressure cooker often so I thought I would like it but I found that it is more trouble than it is worth.  It pretty much requires constant attention.  I'll stick with a slow cooker.
2012	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Didn't know what size to get but careful reading of instructions and what I make I determined this was the best size for me.  Couldn't decide between a 4qt and a 6 qt.  I wanted a 6 qt but Amazon forced you to buy Amazon Prime if you wanted the 6 qt and I didn't want that FORCED on me as I don't want Prime Membership right now and didn't want the hassle to quit later.
6032	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor, easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However, it has 2 problems.  First, the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing, so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second, the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength, but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak, I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition, it works as well as any canister.
Very disappointing as I had such high hopes!

I use the rolling non-motorized floor attachment on the hardwood floors, low carpeting, and the area rug in our sub-1000 sq ft apartment with great results - I find that I don't need a motorized or air-driven brush since it picks up everything perfectly fine without it. It used to bother me that there wasn't a button to secure the floor attachment onto the adjustable wand (you just shove it on and it stays ok) but I constantly need to reach in crevices. Instead of changing heads, it's easiest if I just step on the floor attachment, pull out the wand, use it directly to get into corners and under chairs, then shove it back into the floor attachment.
6402	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	these are the ones i need for the hoover tempo U5140900. the belt that came in the vacuum lasted almost a year. my fault for getting it stuck occasionally on clothes or small rugs which wore the belt out faster and snapped it. good price. keep some on hand because the vac is useless when they snap.

5073	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	When my husband first bought this (wife writing review) I thought why do I need this....I have a vacuum.  After using it once, I was hooked.  For such a little thing it really does the job.  So many times when I need to just spot vacuum, this is so handy to use instead of pulling out the big vacuum and unwinding the cord.  Works great on our hardwood floors, easily goes way under dressers and shelves.  Like that it has the extra battery.  The battery life is only 15 mins or less so it is helpful to have your other battery charged and ready to use.  We bought several for our church to vacuum the pews.  I would repurchase this product again.
1285	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This kit was purchased for my 9 1/2 year-old son as a gift and he loved it.  I am not a fan of root beer, but the rest of the family loved it.  Fairly easy for him to do, but needed to purchase special bottle cleaner prior to making the soda.
While we had it, it turned out countless wonderful meals.  It's easy to use, it locks securely, and the jiggler always lets you know exactly where your pressure is.  No fancy doo-dads, gimmicks, or useless features.  Before this one, we had the same cooker in aluminum.  We basically wore that one out, then used it in our camping gear on a Coleman stove for many more years.  Unlike the currently popular electric cookers with a dozen programmable cycles and delayed start (don't ever use this when cooking chicken!!) that don't restart themselves when the power comes back up after an outage, you could use this one on a grill or open flame, which is ideal when you're stranded after a hurricane (no kidding, I saw these being used when I was cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, when the only power was a generator in the back of a pickup!)

946	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	These wine glasses are worth buying if you buy them at the Ikea store. They are about $5 for a 6 pack and you can't get cheaper than that. They do break very easily but what wine glass doesn't? The good thing about these is that if you break them you can just replace them because they cost very little. Also, because they are so cheap they are also cheaply made so you can find some irregularity and imperfections in them, but nothing too glaring. I had a few where the tops were not perfectly balanced on the stem so if you looked at it from certain angles it didn't look quite centered, but it never interfered with the functionality of the glass and didn't seem to make it more likely to tip over.
1097	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I should have known better. I had hoped to use this to grate cheese but it is too under powered for that task. Serves no useful purpose. Does not evenly chop even onions. Great paperweight for holding down shelf paper. Stick with a full size food processor.

Oh by the way, the steam vent would keep hissing even after you turn off the heat which means do not open the lid yet!  I remember my mom used to release the pressure by lifting the vent a tiny bit with the tip of a knife.  Well, I don't want to go through all that trouble so I do my pressure cooking at least 2 hours before I start dinner. After turning off the heat I just leave the pot sitting on the stove hissing away.  By the time I come back, the pot has cooled and all ready for opening!

The fact that you don't need to replace filters although they are available, you can simply hand wash them and use them again, and again, and again. With the Eureka Mighty Mite you have to buy new bags, and with the cost of them being a dollar a bag, how many 9 packs do you have to buy before you wind up spending the same amount of money as purchasing the BMC in the first place, and there are sooooo many advantages to the BMC.

I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held, but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power, and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus, tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time.
Hate to do this to Amazon, but if you have a commercial bag type it will last years and you will save loads.  If they turn out to be no good I will edit my post.

4692	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	A nice compact, light, but powerful vac to have.  I still like my Kenmore canister vac, but of course, it's heavier & bigger to lug around.  I did have to glue some felt strips onto the large wheels as they had a tendency to scratch my new "wood" floors. I also use the hard floor attachment from the Kenmore as it is a little softer.  The bristles on this seem rather scratchy also, but I do like being able to switch from hard to soft surfaces as I do have area rugs also.  It is rather loud as others have said.  The cord storage system is a bother, as there is no way to just use a shorter amount of the cord; you have to have it all dragging around.  But it is a nice long cord that does not require frequent moving from plug to plug.  (I am spoiled with the retractable cord winder system on my Kenmore.)  It has good suction.  For me the biggest plus is having dirt bags.  I have yet to see why people like bagless vacs!  They are messy & put untold amount of fine, almost invisible dust back into the air no matter how fancy their disposal system.  I've always had to vacuum again after emptying one.  And cleaning those air filters (on some models) are a health hazard!  You need gloves & a mask to do the job---& then have to vacuum again!  But I digress! Sorry!  That's my soap box for the day!

Jiggler pressure control is just a scary as the original. It's just heavy enough to get the job done. I bought this as my "second" pressure cooker. I take it traveling, on extended campouts, etc. and leave my more delicate T-Fal at home. It's nice to save fuel and time wherever you go and this cooker gets the job done.

No action at all from Eureka. They consider Amazon a third party vendor so will not honor warranty. Eureka is pure junk. Appears to be a dying company.

9776	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use these primarily for flipping fries and searing the edges of steaks. While both those tasks can be done with other tools, this seems like a far more elegant and controllable one. Having a tiny kitchen, I was iffy about getting another contraption, but I find this an invaluable addition. The locking mechanism is simple and useful, I've never had a problem with the non-slip grips, the scalloped edges are great for grip, and the tension is just right (at least for me) for getting the job done. Now, of course, I have no experience with alternative designs, so this should be taken with a grain of salt.
Now lets talk about a really big feature with me and that is the filtration system. The Eureka has a joke of a small plastic post-filter that is designed to let everything through except maybe large chunks. My main complaint with that one is when my brother is vacuuming and the exhaust is blowing out the back it enters my room and has quite an odor to it. I go and close my door and turn on the air filtration unit to clean the air. The BMC has a very fine filter on it that is thick and looks like something someone would use with a hazmat suit to filter out serious allergens. It is white and instantly looks like something you would trust your lungs to. It is good to note that the ultra-fine stuff is what causes the problems because your lungs don't have such an easy time getting it out.
Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. Lightweight Vacuum
Cons: - size, it is a good size but the way it juts into the room it could be intrusive in small spaces, no problems for me though
5829	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I don't know how anyone could complain about this vacuum! I have been through 2 vacuums in the past 2 years and not cheap ones. Each of them failed me with suction ability and also with clogging. This mighty mite is very powerful for its small lightweight size. The suction is incredible. And picks up cat litter. I was not looking for a vacuum to clean carpets since my apartment has all wood flooring, but it does have a lever to switch between floor and carpeting. I have used it everyday without issues and I love how I can walk around with it in my hand as an option while vacuuming. It's not as loud as most vacuums I've owned, The only drawback I can see is that the cord is not retractable and the hose is not as flexible as some I've had with canister vacs but either of those 'cons' do not affect it's performance. It comes with 2 bags, one in the vacuum so it's ready to go, and one extra. Bags are simple to change. I am extremely happy with my choice.
Cons: Very Noisy, runs hot, average performance

3832	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I researched brands and sizes of pressure cookers for over a year before I decided.  I narrowed it down to the Fagor and Presto, four and six quart.  As I am a senior citizen, I decided on the four quart so it would not be so heavy when full.  I really had a hard time with the choice of brand; both got equally good reviews.  I finally chose the Presto because I called customer service to ask a question and they could not have been more friendly.  I thought, if I had more questions, or needed to order any additional items in the future, they would be great to deal with! As well, they have a very user-friendly website. I have now used it twice (put if off for about a week - a little intimidated by it).  I made chicken soup - excellent!  The pressure cooker infuses the chicken flavor so much better than stove top cooking.  I usually add chicken broth when cooking on the stove, but didn't need to with the pressure cooker.  I also made potato-leek soup which was marvelous.  And the little instruction book that comes with it is great!  It explains everything very clearly and has some great recipes (including the chicken soup and potato soup)!  It took a long time to choose,  but I really feel I made the right decision!  I am so excited to try lots of recipes.  Oh, and the shorter cooking times are great - both for expediency and for saving on electricity!

However, I would still choose this one over that other model because there was no hand fatigue with the Oxo. My family loves mashed potatoes and when I make them I make a lot. This was definitely put through some trials for Thanksgiving. I'm looking forward to using it for Christmas, and for meals in between.

We have now had this Eureka for a month and plain and simple, IT WORKS GREAT! We can usually touch-up the entire house (even the rugs) on one battery, sometimes near the end we do need the second one to finish. It's amazing how much it can pick-up, including the dog's hair! Cleaning it out is no problem. We just open it up, remove the filter over the wastebasket and dump it. I use a small floor brush to clean off the filter and that seems to work quite well. I have not had to wash the filter yet and the suction seems to be "as new". I did buy a second filter, but I have not used it yet.

- The rocker makes quite a bit noise.
My two favorite things: it comes with a little mini spatula, which allows you to get nearly every drop of whatever you're prepping out of the processor and into your recipe, which isn't always the case w/food processors - big or small.  Also, cleanup is a breeze- it rinses with a wipe (or top shelf dishwasher safe) and a quick wipe of the top of the base unit gets any "dust" from mixing right off- no crevices for stuff to get stuck (and get nasty).
9988	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love these locking tongs. They are well made and heavy duty. They should last my lifetime.

2597	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Finally I have another pressure cooker with the rocker regulator. I have been using a pressure cooker for over 35 years and never had a problem with them. My previous pressure cooker was dropped and it bent enough that I couldn't use it anymore. I purchased one of the newer ones without the rocker regulator and it scared the hell out of me. I couldn't tell if it was pressurized until the steam was coming out so strong that it blew the safety valve. It went straight to the trash can. I bought this one and I am back in business with pressure cooking. When the rocker starts hissing and rocking I know to adjust the heat to get that slow steady rocking. I also have a 4qt. electric pressure cooker that I use for certain things. The biggest reason for the stove top model is, being able to take it to the sink and run cold water over it to instantly remove the pressure, add something else and pressurize it again.
2510	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We have had our Presto 6 quart pressure cooker for 35 years, and it is still going strong. We bought each daughter a pressure cooker this year, one got an insta-pot, and one got this pressure cooker. This is a product that will be around for years, long after the insta-pot has met the scrap pile.
If you have more to store, get two or more of the 24 gallon boxes instead. They stack very nicely and are lockable (2 padlocks not included), if additional security is important to you.
4381	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tool to have in the kitchen.  I'm glad I bought this Presto cooker from Amazon.  I couldn't find a better price anywhere and after using it I'm wondering why I didn't purchase one sooner.  It's easy to open and close, easy to use and easy to clean and saves me a lot of time in the kitchen.  No matter what I'm making, it comes out cooked to perfection.  Just follow the instructions in the little recipe book that comes with it and you can't go wrong. I made a pot of dry red beans in 8 minutes, brown rice in 12 minutes and Sirloin tips with gravy in only 11 minutes! This is a great little cooker! The only problem is.....now I wish I had two because it's a pain to cook the sirloin tips with gravy then clean out the cooker so I can make the brown rice. If I purchase another it will be a Presto!  It gets an A+.
9447	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Functionally as a meat tenderizer it is quite adequate: hefty enough to do the job and with a grip comfortable to use (like most Oxo products).  Its principle drawback is that it can't be put into a dishwasher.  I use it a lot on chicken and like to sterilize it afterward - which has to be done by hand.
8811	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love to make pies, and pride myself on the crust.  A great server was the one thing I was missing.

2562	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The fail safe on this pot prevents it from getting enough pressure built up to work properly.  I was using a pressure cooker at age 14......I'm now over 50.  When I put this pot to use, steam came out of the rubber safety vent and it never built up enough pressure to jiggle the regulator.  After cooking, I pulled it apart- there are ridges in the rubber plug- no wonder it did not work.  That is a dumb design!  I know you are a dying to make it safe; but, in doing so, you have rendered it useless as a pressure cooker!  Now I understand why Persto makes a glass lid for this pot- so when unsuspecting people, like myself, purchase their product and it does not work, they will still use it.  I won't, though, because my pots are of better quality.  My advice is to spring for the much more expensive All American brand and don't waste your time or money on this Presto Pressure Cooker.
9970	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I used this today on crunching up oreos for a dessert I was making - it worked really nicely and was easy since you can really put your fist into it with this design and grip.

6704	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great product. Sturdy and use it to blow cool air into the house.
3190	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Don't buy a more expensive pressure cooker.  The quality of this cooker is as good or better then any on the market. Furthermore, since it is so popular, if you loose a part and/or a part breaks or deteriorates with age, you can replace it.  I have used different pressure pots - this is as good as it gets.  It has a common sense design and is easy to use.  Six Quart is the most universal size.  People who are canning may want a larger capacity version.
Summary:  If you have an old canister vacuum you should be able to put together a very nice product.  Just don't expect the out of the box product to last very long.  Why four stars???

4924	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This does a good job on floors and carpet.  Good that it has 2 batteries as it does not seem to stay charge very long.  For the price, it is a good bargain and I am very happy with it.
6156	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I live in a very small apartment, with a carpeted bedroom and tiled kitchen and bathroom.  The vacuum has been great on both surfaces so far, picking up crumbs, dust, and, most importantly, hair (my roommate and I both have long hair!).  The main brush works very well; it's a relief that I don't have to pick dust out of the bristles -- everything gets vacuumed in!  Given my apartment's small size, I just store the vacuum in its box -- so it takes minimal space.  I love that it uses bags -- cleaning out filters and dust buckets was a nasty experience for me!  With bags (which do last a while), cleanup is CLEAN and easy, with no dust entering the air.  And yes, I would say that the vacuum is indeed "mighty" :)

so excited for her cute son to wear this little hat :))
Let me explain my situation: My building is really old, retains a LOT of heat, and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment. Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.

CAUTION: In order to tilt the fan up or down, I suggest you remove the small plastic cover on the side of the fan head, loosen the screw, tilt the fan to angle you wish, then tighten the screw and replace the cover.

What I discovered is that if you try to use it with the bristles extended on something with a low-nap, the floor attachment becomes angled in such a way that pushing it forward becomes 3x as hard as before, AND it looses almost all suction when you start to pull it back.  The attachment actually bounces up off the ground as you pull it back!  There is no way to have a smooth back-and-forth rhythm... it's PUSH HARD, and then pull back until ACK! it jumped over the spot it needed to vacuum so do that part again.

Since 90% of our floors are hard wood, I choose the MM because Eureka has always proven to never loose suction.  I have had this particular vacuum for a year now and it still works great even after tons of use!  I find the bags in a 3 pack at ACE or online anywhere between $4-$8 and have to change the bag after about 5-7 full house sweeps.  However, I have 3 dogs, one which sheds profusely. I have one thick rug and 3 slimmer ones, I use the same brush setting as the hard wood because the "combs" grab the loose hair from the rug and I then pluck it off and let the vac suck it up.  I am not gentle with the vac and it takes sometimes the better part of an hour to complete my sweep.  I am constantly (accidentally) banging it on the doorways and pulling it around by the hose but it still works!  Not too loud but not quiet either.

Recently, one of the locking clips broke. Without the locking clip, one cannot pick up the unit by its handle, so we have to carried the whole unit from the base all over the house in order to use it. It seems we can't live without it. I researched the web and various stores looking for an alternative model, thinking that with so much cleaning to do, we might be better off with a more powerful model, perhaps one that uses steam rather than hot water to clean.

2519	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought my 8 qt presto at a local farm and fleet store. I did not buy it here. I love it so far. I bought the aluminum model on the recommendation of a friend that has both stainless and aluminum pots. He prefers the aluminum and has cooked with his hundreds of times. The base of the kettle is thick and sturdy as are the sides and the lid seals perfectly.  This product works as promised and cooks beautifully. As with any product you need to read the instruction manual from start to finish before you assemble it and put it to use. I read the one and two star reviews and all I can see in my mind is inept users that do not follow directions and ruin/discolor their product from misuse. What the hell are people thinking when they put an alloy pot in the dishwasher and subject it to harsh chemical soap combinations and heated dry cycles? Is that REALLY a problem with the construction? Use your brains people. Not to mention it's a complete waste of space in your dishwasher when you put a giant 8 quart pressure cooker on the rack. I hand wash mine every time with Dawn dish soap and it looks great. By the way, there are two kinds of dish soap. The wrong kind, and Dawn. Had to add that.

3715	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm a busy mom of two...who loves to cook at home but am sometimes pressed for time. I thought i'd give pressure cooking a shot since a friend of mine has been raving about it for quite some time now. I initally purchased a 6qt in the same design, and loved it so much, i returned to buy the 4 qt. While the 6 qt is of a perfect size to cook like a whole chicken in like 12 minutes for my family of 4, I felt i needed a smaller version for daily use when i'm preparing a smaller potion. It is definitely worth the investment, and I cant say it enough, I feel like with the few meals I have prepared over the past week, I have already recovered my money's worth. For those who are wondering, this is EXACTLY the same shape as the 6 qt only 2 inches shorter. Infact i did not assemble the lid for this one and use the same lid of the 6qt pressure cooker that I already own just to save on space (in my apartment with minimal storage) and the lid fits perfectly. This is also an amazing way to cook rice. I had like 2 cups of rice cooked in approx 5 minutes, amazing and fluffy...cooked to perfection. It also cooked lentils so tender and soft in record time. I am a new believer in pressure cooking ! Thank you presto for an amazing and affordable product that saves time and energy for us mom's !

6892	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow.  Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime.  Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night, and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day, and this fan achieves that for it's lower price.  Box fans are great, place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time.  It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans.  It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating.  Other than that, you really don't need the foot attachments.  I placed on the desk, turned on high and it did not fall over.  So, to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow.

4247	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice size for the smaller cooking jobs in the kitchen.  We have used it for cooking many things and it works well.

Yea, there are really dumb annoying things I'd like to change; like the brush attachment that is more plastic than brush, so it's of very limited use for me for dusting windows, and it's loud. I mean it's almost like fire-up a 2010 F1 car loud; the high speed whirrrrr of the motor really messes with our cat's mellow disposition, but...w/ loud comes the results. It kills cleaning wood floors and areas rugs. If you want an extremely powerful vac that's light and portable this is the one.

1274	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot, I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet, I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time.

3724	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker. The quality is great and the price is fantastic. The pressure cooker from India blew a whistle by itself to let out the pressure and 4-5 whistles were enough to cook lentils, rice, potatoes etc.. This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times. Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly. I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker. That way I can cook Dal and rice at once. Definitely recommend this cooker. I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets

5516	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome little vacuum for the price and fills in without the inconvenience of try to use the hose attachment with your upright. AND, it has a disposable bag that filters the exhaust air. SO, when you suck up bug, you never see them in the upright type bagless vac's. Just pull out the bag and put in a new clean/empty one. It has a long cord, works great in those hard to reach areas under shelves and in behind the toilet. Even works wonders on the exhaust vent covers on 10 foot ceilings. The big wheels on the back make it easy to maneuver, and the extra attachments give you all the cleaning power for most every clean task. BUT use your upright for everyday carpet cleaning, but when the Christmas tree comes down, and its a real tree, it does wonders on the carpet to pickup the needles that fall off...then you simply slip in a new empty bag...and its ready to go.

Strong suction, light enough to carry around with one hand, and I vacuumed the main level of my house literally in 5 minutes!  My husband put a strap on it too so I can wear it on my shoulder.  It makes doing the stairs very easy. The cord doesn't retract, which is kind of annoying, but I'm willing to out up with that.  The hose pieces/extender just attach with pressure and a few times they have come apart, but they would likely be fine if I get my husband to push the pieces together.  Overall very happy with this purchase.
As a side note, this pan single-handedly brought my girlfriend back into the kitchen, as she now enjoys making fried eggs in it.  The sides are gently sloped, so flipping omelets is a snap.  This little honey seldom leaves the top of the stove; it has become the favorite kitchen pan.

2325	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've been using an ancient 4-quart Presto pressure cooker I inherited from my mother. The old one was probably made in the 60s, or before. They last almost forever. But I burned some food and couldn't get the old one clean, so I got this replacement. It's lighter and easier to handle. With occasional gasket replacement, I assume it will last the rest of my life. The booklet that comes with it is small but useful, listing cooking times for common dishes.
4221	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This 4-quart cooker heats up and cools down much faster than it's 8-quart big brother.  It's also easier to clean up because it's not so heavy.  The bottom is very flat and it sits well on my glass top stove.  The cooking rack is stainless steel too.  I like my 25 year old cook book better because it has more recipes.  Use a paper towel to wipe a thin layer of cooking oil on the top of the pan where it meets the gasket the first 2 or 3 times you cook with it.  That will prolong the gasket life and make it easier to open and close the lid.  Pressure cooking is the best fast food you'll ever eat. I looked at all the new style pressure cookers but the pressure regulators were all too complex which just invites problems.  Simple is better.  I've been cooking with Presto pressure cookers for 42 years.  My first one was a hand-me-down from Grandma and I replaced it because it was aluminum.  I still use my 40 year old 8-quart stainless cooker when we have a lot to cook.

4164	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Defective. Quality control is obviously lacking for this Made in Mexico Eureka Mighty Might product. Plugged it in, it ran without pushing the on/off button. But, the on/off switch mechanism must not have been installed so there is no way to turn the vacuum off or back on. Unfortunately I had not opened the box to inspect until after the Amazon 30 day return policy expired.  So I called Eureka Customer Service. They were helpful, and referred me to their local service provider to either repair or replace.  Word to the wise, inspect all merchandise from Amazon before the 30 day return policy expires!!!!
My pressure cooker is still in use daily and is going strong

My complaint as the person who maintains this placemat is that the design scratches off easily. I have to be careful to use a washcloth instead of a dish scrubber when I clean it--it's much better to clean ASAP rather than letting, for example, oatmeal dry on it.

The noise is awful --  and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise.  The construction is all plastic.  They don't make them like they used to.

4779	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We needed a canister vacuum that was specifically for cleaning up after multiple pets. We have 3 dogs, and this mighty little vacuum cleaner sure can clean! I recently used a Dyson canister vacuum, and it didn't compare to the suction power of the Mighty Mite. I should mention a couple of things about this, though. This vacuum works best on hard floors, upholstery, and rugs, not for carpeted areas. If it had a carpet cleaning attachment, we wouldn't need any other vacuums. This is perfect for sucking up cobwebs and such (we have 12-20 ft walls: it extends). This is a fantastic value.
Not cool.  Literally.
2) Hose is sort of cheap feeling. Thin plastic. One sharp object and I think it won't hold up.
5259	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a small apartment-sized vacuum with incredible power.  You will go crazy trying to figure where to store the wands and hose and miscellanea -- I ended up using a plastic bucket I had lying around, the heck with esthetics -- but once you plug it in and use it, you will be delighted.  I have a much more expensive vacuum in my main house and it doesn't pick up as well. Best sucker for the money.
Pros:
I thought the price was decent for it's value and super easy to clean!

I eat a lot of citrus so these are wonderful and having a few is ok when I don't want to look for the one that I lost or fish around in the sink of dirty dishes.
A hard plastic, I clean the tube ends with a bristle paintbrush (dirt forms at the ends after vacuuming).  If you're a clean freak, you can just wash these.
My concern was the accuracy of the pressure and internal temperature, and it isn't easy to check it without special equipment and modifying the lid, but I figured out a way to estimate it. I put a small jar of oil, with a loose lid, on the rack, poured in 4 cups of water, brought it to pressure, and let it rattle for an hour. Then I sat it in a sink of cool water, pressure dropped in seconds, and I quickly opened it and placed a digital cooking thermometer in the oil. It read 247F and falling. That was a good indication that the internal temperature had been near 250F, the target temperature for 15 psi at sea level, and I'm about 90 ft above. Water loss for the hour was 8.5 oz.

Longevity is doubtful.  The canister is plastic, which is probably why it's so light, but it seems that after clipping a few walls or cabinet corners, it will crack.  Also, the hose, as others' reviews pointed out, is very flimsy.  If you step on it, it seems like it will crimp or break.  But it is replaceable according to the parts order form within the owners manual.  But if you search the Eureka site for this part number (60289-6), it isn't found. 60289-1, 2, etc. are there for approximately $20... and they claim to be suitable for this series of vacuum.
The reason for the 4 stars is the couple of issues that I have had with the vacuum.  The attachment designed for the floor is not as effective as I would like it to be for picking things up.  I have a local vacuum store nearby, though, which had an attachment especially for hardwood floors for only a few dollars that has worked excellent.  Typically, the vacuum is very powerful at picking things up, but at times it can get clogged particularly in the part where the hard plastic part attaching to the hose is bent.

3348	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down. As others have recently stated, it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws, making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws, and how tight I, or my husband, try to get them, they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle, but both handles! I tried this item for a week, which required retightening the handles about a dozen times, and I have given up.
8957	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I really like this pie server. It is the best one I own. The handle provides good grip and is comfortable to hold and doesn't slip when your hands are dirty.

With its extra battery and handy "dock" fastened to the wall, the Eureka hangs up nicely and is quite light and easy to handle. The handle detaches when you hang it up - too bad they didn't have a clip on the dock to hold the handle - it has to be stored separately, a minor complaint.

I feel like the purple color is darker than the online picture represents too. Very nice. Buy an extra floor BRUSH attachment to complete the package.
This new version of Mighty Mite is truly a disappointment if you had plans to use the blower function.  If I had to take a wild guess as to why the blower is useless, it would be that possibly the motors were burning up and the manufacter had to unseal the back end of the case to allow more air flow around the motor.  The outgoing air seems twice as hot as previous Mighty Mites.  Maybe it was a bargain motor.

On high speed, I find this fan to be less noisy than the average 19" box fan on high speed. It runs smoothly and I've been using it for a few weeks now.  The shipping box was left on my porch with the corners crushed and I was initially concerned about whether I'd find the unit itself damaged and happily that was not an issue.  As some other reviewers have written, the knob to adjust the speed was not put on very securely by the manufacturer, but for a fan that performs like this at a price under $70, I'm willing to pull out the crazy glue.  I'm very glad I bought this unit; my central air doesn't reach this room very well, I didn't want to deal with the noise of the window a/c unit this year and with as well as this performs, I'm very happy with this purchase.

She also used it for a few minutes without the bag, and we just opened it and shook out the loose dirt, and put in the bag.  It was completely unfazed.  Her children have a tendency to kink the hose, and this new one seems just as forgiving as my old one.  I'm glad to find this out, since I loaned my old Mighty Mite to my neighbor, and she loved it and wants to get one like it.  I am happy to be able to tell her that she can still get a new one as good as the old one.  It has only one flaw--my old one has a rubber flap which closes off the opening to the bag when the hose is not attached.  The new one can spill out dirt if you turn it on end with the hose off.  It is great for bare floors or very low pile carpet.  If you need to vacuum rugs, you need a heavier (and more expensive) machine.

2411	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods, when people smoke in the place, etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8" window fan setup, and after several months of use, they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets, is giant, and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off, the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it, but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market.

`Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and `Hallie's Song' have their moments, but they don't quite get it completely.  Still, they are nice additions and don't feel like filler here.  In fact, the only track I didn't really care for (outside of the abomination that was `Drips') was `Say What U Say', Eminem's collaboration with Dr. Dre.  It just lacks the real spark that comes from Shady's music.  It felt like a rejected Dre track, not a refurbished Eminem track.

This knife is terrible at slicing butter from the refrigerator.  A regular silverware table knife does a much better job.
It's also made sturdy, has an attractive design for a pie cutter and can probably take some good pie abuse.
This little gizmo will not replace my Steel Pig, but I would be up to my knees in dust bunnies without it.  In fact, as soon as I finish this review, I'm ordering another one just for upstairs.
+  Note that the cooking rack included is aluminum, I'm sure as a money saver for Presto.  The rack (for me) is a hardly used item, but some customers may wish to stay clear of any use of aluminum. If that's the case, and you consider a rack essential, I would suggest buying an inexpensive round stainless rack from any store which sells cookware - baking racks, steamers and the like will probably do the job. I'm not sure if even the top dollar pressure cookers use stainless for their racks either but it doesn't seem worth spending 50 to 200 dollars more just to get an inexpensive, stainless steel rack!
Another thing I like is the fact that the dirt container is bagless and easily accessible.  Once in a while, I lose something that is small and important or valuable.  When that happens, I am afraid to vacuum until I find it.  Now, I think I could actually use this vacuum to find things, because it would be easy to sort them out of the canister.  How many of you have have nearly suffocated sorting throught the contents of a vacuum cleaner bag for a ring or a coin or a small part?

1254	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I received my Mini-Prep about two weeks ago, and I have used it everyday 2 or 3 times a day to make homemade baby food for my daughter. It is GREAT! It is easy to clean and I love that you can switch the blade from sharp to grind mode! I do recommend looking over the user guide for which blade side and speed for optimal chopping/processing. I had been using my full size Cuisinart to make her baby food prior to getting this, which as any one with the full size Cuisinart knows is a pain to drag out and I couldn't make just small portions for her. So, the Mini-Prep was the perfect solution for me! I have processed just about anything and everything in this so far and it has worked beautifully! I highly recommend this for any small job in the kitchen. Another plus is you are able to buy extra bowls so if you want to use it for coffee or spice grinding you can have a bowl specifically for those uses so other foods do not absorb the flavors of coffee or spices.
After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new.

Owned for 4 months. I purchased these because they match the black, stainless, and espresso theme of my kitchen. As far as rubber spatulas go, I look for 3 things: durability, rigidity, and stain resistance. This set performs all 3 functions to my expectations.

Tonight I just saved an hour of time doing brown rice in 20 minutes and broccoli in 2 minutes, served with oven roasted chicken. I use one more for cooking the side dishes quickly, or for fast stews. But as you can tell from recipes you will find on the net, a pressure cooker, any brand, is a great addition to the kitchen.
I would think that the whole idea behind it's being made from plastic.

I was in Berlin last winter when I was struck with the idea that the absolute coolest thing I could bring back would be German word poetry magnets for the refridgerater. (I'm pretty fluent and I love playing around with the language :) I went into every shop in the Mall near Potsdamer Platz and all of the little airport kiosks - and I found nothing! Ugh! Germany?!? So naturally when I came back to the land of the free and the home of the brave, I immediately went on Amazon and found these magnetic poetry stickers. They. are. awesome. I had about 200 floating around my fridge for a week but I started looking like a German magnet hoarder so now I keep them in a bowl on my kitchen bar and play with the words and only allow myself to place one sentence on the refridgerator at a time.

I would guess that this has the most suction for the money that you will ever find in a vacuum. I think it was a great buy. If you have a 2-story house, it would be worth having this just for the stairs.

There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description, thus the review may no longer be accurate.
Meat is really tender and can cook a lot in a short time without heating up the kitchen. Cheap cuts come out butter soft.
5229	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	It's not strong enough for light weight cleaning and the battery doesn't last long enough. The extra battery solves the latter problem. But since it doesn't do what a vacuum it's size should do, light weight cleaning, I don't recommend this product.
6901	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Fit my hoover perfectly, great price.
626	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a large (400 sf) room. Based on reviews that said it worked well in large rooms I ordered it. The fact that it was so small made me nervous, bc I had guests about to stay in the previously unheated room, but this little Lasko heater proved itself!  It's super easy to figure out and works quietly. I'm now using it in my 2 car garage to warm up the space for my dogs at night. It's keeping the insulated garage at exactly the 60 degrees I have it set to, even though it's 10 degrees outside. I love it!
It gets dirty (smudged) quickly, even if your hands are clean (and you MUST be careful to use a good cleaner or it will get scratched - I use the spray I clean my eyeglasses with along with a special cloth and it works just fine).

Oxo is the brand to buy for most household/kitchen tools. They are well priced,and always well made. You can depend upon this brand. I found this brand after reading Jessica Seinfeld's blog. You can either hand wash the masher or put it in your dishwasher, it is your choice.
5506	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We have laminate floors throughout our house.  I use to use a dust mop twice a day, then have to get out the little dust buster to collect what the mop swept up.  Now, I run the Eureka Quick Up Cordless 96JZ throughout the main floor (about 1,500 sq. ft.), flipping on the rotating brush when I get to an area rug.  Using the rotating brush, it does draw a bit more on the battery, but I can still make it all over the main floor on one battery.
For what it is, I highly recommend this product.

Cleaning the machine - why is this an issue for people?  It literally takes seconds to rinse the parts off under the tap.  You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.  We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.  Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.
In the garage, I have a large car mat under the car - looks like carpeting - I was so happy with the Eureka I vacuumed the mat effortlessly.
3723	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to use on my new induction cooker and it works great.  I like the 4-Quart size because it is shorter than the 6-Quart and fits in my crowded cabinet.  It replaces my inherited Mirror-matic that is solid aluminum.  Consider the 6-Quart if you are cooking for more than 4 people.
9898	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this peeler when I received a huge bunch of apples from a co-worker and wanted to make apple butter. I had previously purchased an electric apple peeler but because some of the apples were quite small, I decided it would be easier to peel them by hand. This is by far the best peeler I have ever used - it peeled the apples so fast and clean. I've also used it on cucumbers and potatoes and was equally impressed. Time will tell about its durability but so far it is definitely an excellent value.

8769	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I originally went with a cheap set of three strainers for $10-$12. You can find a dozen different deals here on Amazon for a 3", 6", and 8" strainer in that price range and I believe they are all pretty much the same. They worked well enough but the handle on the little one arrived broken and the handle on the big one broke on the second use. Still technically functional, but annoying so I returned them. I was just frustrated that even something that cheap would arrive broken and/or not even survive intact for two uses. I had this Oxo Strainer in my wishlist from the start anyway so when my wife received a $5 off couplon for BB&B which sells this for $23 I asked her to pick it up for me. Night and day. The handle is definitely much sturdier on this. The double weave basket is more effective for small grains such as quinoa and a lot more solid. And the downward slant of the tab on the other side of the handle is a nice ergonomic touch. So while the cheap ones do work, I definitely believe this is worth the price, especially for as much as it gets used (nearly everytime we cook).
3534	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Rather large for what I was looking for but works great. Would buy it again.
Look, it's a low price machine and so instead of making it cheapo, they gave it power and cut out the bells and whistles.  So there's no hepa filters, or bagless, or retractable cord or fancy light or carpet beating head.  Actually you don't need a carpet attachment with this because it has so much suction.
4595	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought two replacement batteries for an older model Quick Up. They didn't fit very well. When I was reviewing my old purchase I discovered this newer model with TWO BATTERIES. This newer unit has much better suction & picks up dog hair (Great Pyrennes/Yellow Lab mix = long yellow fur) so much better than old unit. I've ordered a second one.
9251	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the pizza wheel to own. I use it for all kinds of baked goods, bread dough, quesadillas and yes, even pizza. The large grip handle makes it easy to grip, the sharp wheel just plows through even thick crusts easily. Don't know why I waited so long to buy it! Do wish it came with a cover as the wheel is so sharp though.

I have 2 sets, one black & one white, and I just ordered a 3rd set in multicolor. They're great for all kinds of food bags: coffee, cat food, cereal, pasta, rice, anything that comes in a bag. I have one on my front door to hold notes or letters to be mailed. I have one on my refrigerator for notes & grocery lists. I use them in my home office as giant paperclips to hold stacks of papers. I use them in the bathroom on bags of cotton balls & other supplies. There seems to be no end to the uses!
3084	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Very good for those that don't or can't take out their AC's for the winter months. I bought this for my 24,000 BTU AC that is a massive pain to take in and out. You definitely don't want to just rely on the somewhat flimsy strap and clip that comes with it though. It would not stay on the AC during a very windy storm. But if you use duct tape or bungee cords around it, it will definitely stay on. It's pretty thick too, and it's doing a great job keeping air out of the house and also helps keep the unit reasonably dry. If you use this on the outside and then use the shrink wrap plastic kits from 3M on the inside, you'll be in great shape to keep the cold air out during the winter months.
5729	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Nice little vacuum, pretty powerful too.  If you don't have a lot of heavy/shaggy rugs this could actually be your only vacuum.  No need to buy a full size one.

When I got home, I looked on Amazon and found out they were. The only difference now is the tools can be stored on the vacuum. It's very light so it isn't hard to drag around like the other vacuums, and it's made mostly for hard floors. Since I have no carpeting of any kind this vacuum is perfect. It says the floor part can to adjusted to carpeting but knowing this vacuum it would work only on the pile of an oriental carpet. It's so light weight with such a strong suction that this vacuum is also ideal for cleaning the inside of the car. It has a very long cord and I don't have to use extension cords anymore. The price wasn't bad either. I think I paid just about that much for a might mite vacuum 30 yrs ago. .
3 weeks later:  The batteries are not charging so I'm going to send it back ... but will try ordering another one in case this one was just defective.

4116	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We bought this machine in 1996 and it worked like a faithful friend. This is living with 5 kids, 3 dogs, and a nasty cat. These people and animals were slobs! The machine always worked. It is cumbersome to empty and splashy gross. The spongy filter on the dirty water is disgusting. It does not slide across the floor so it can actually tip over when you give it a tug. It is almost impossible to store neatly because the hose is like a wild snake possessed of the devil. It still gets 5 stars. Ran like a champ and worked like a dog. I replaced it with a Bissell green machine this year. Why? Becuase it stores neatly and complactly. Will I be sorry? Will review it in a year.

By the way, I realized after I bought the Eureka canister vacuum that my dad has the same model in the house, and he's had it for many years. It still works great.
When the fan got here, I took it out of the box and read the owners manual from front to back.  Then, I looked at the window and then back at the fan and wondered if it was going to fit.  It looked BIG!  And the window looked, well...NOT big.  So I opened the window as far as it would go and simply popped the unit right in except for a half inch gap on the top.  So I carefully pulled the window down until there was sort of a nice snug fit.

It's been 6 months since I bought this vac and I'm very pleased with it. There's no retractable cord, and it's kinda hard to stow in a corner because the big gangly wand and floor attachment don't secure to the canister in any way - but I can live with these issues and have no regrets about my purchase. It's pretty loud, but if my bunnies aren't scared of it when I'm pushing it around (and they're scared of the espresso machine, garbage truck, etc...) then it can't be that bad.

The cooker is pretty much what you need to cook with little more, no basket you might find convenient for jars used for canning.  Other models specifically for canning have this.  It is, however, well designed for cooking and the design well executed.  The handles (there are three) are not attached but are easily assembled using 5 phillips screws.  I used some heat resistant anti-seize compound sparingly on the threads.  The same as I use on the spark plugs in my car.  The handles on my old 4 quart cooker are slightly loose but the screws are hopelessly seized, despite being made from stainless steel.
I guess being called "Eureka" is right - because all I could think was "Eureka - that didn't last long at all!"  The longest I think this has ever run on a fully charged battery for us is about 2 minutes.
5959	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this vacuum. It is light weight but very powerful. It works OK on carpet with a few passes. It works great for removing cobwebs from walls and ceiling.

So on a whim, and without broadcasting it, since let's face it, it almost sounds cruel - I came up with a plan to lock up the snacks he would eat. I paired this with a set your own combo lock I found here (Master Lock 653D Set-Your-Own-Combination 2-inch Padlock) so there were no keys needed and the rest of the family had access if needed.

As to the Can Opener - It is almost perfect.  It will open any sized can quickly and easily.  The grips are great, the gears and handle provide maximum results for minimum effort.

Monster is premium quality at a premium price. Musicians will pay more for a Monster patch cord than some folks would pay for an electric piano. But on closer inspection, this power strip is competitively priced.  I recently purchased a 12-outlet Belkin strip at only several dollars below this Monster strip.  But the Belkin would accommodate only 8 of my plugs because 6 of the receptacles are in a vertical row (with the ground holes on the inside, not the outside as is the case with Monster).  Consequently, a right-angle plug took up the space of 3 receptacles, in effect reducing me to the same number outlets as this Monster.

- The unit is very easy to get ready to use (just add hot water and the detergent that comes with the machine into one opening).
6689	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Still running.  Been a few years now.  I stuck an allergy furnace filter of the same size as the fan on it.  Works great.

I recommend that the fan stand on a flat surface about three or four feet high so that the air current it creates reaches you whether you're lying down or walking around the room. It is economical in that it won't make your electric bill spike upward, too.

1676	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought these to plant in my organic garden for the winter months to prevent winter weeds from taking over, and to help prevent soil erosion while also providing nitrogen to the soil in the spring when I till them over.
Pressure cookers can be dangerous, so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock, but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.
2097	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	not much to say about this one.  It fits my sweeper and I wish the bags were cheaper lol
3214	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Worked great for about a month, then it started leaking a little around the seal and the main handle screw stripped inside the handle and the handle fell off. Not going to bother with seeing if Presto will fix it, seems like more hassle than it's worth and I can only imagine it will keep having the same troubles, or new ones with time. I'm just going to buy a different pressure cooker.
The only real drawback is that it's a rather flimsy construction. But once it's in place, there's really no need to worry about such things.
6761	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like these brackets but they are in principal just assembly helpers.  I made a scaffold using them and for this purpose they worked well for me.  By using the brackets I will be able to take apart the scaffold and re-assemble it easily.  I used Kreg wood screws to assemble and added robust cross bracing and OSB decking so the stability issue was resolved.  Without cross bracing the stability of the assembly was poor.  Also the holding power of the Kreg screws and the easy disassembly they make possible are the key factor in making my project possible.  If all you need is a static assembly to hold firewood then spend the money on treated 4 by 4's, 2X6's and bolts and forget the brackets.

5693	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this vacuum to replace my 10 y.o. Sanitaire. I decided on this one because of the reviews and lower price. The vacuum itself is as good as the Sanitaire. I don't like the floor brush as well, but I bought the add-on DELUXE FLOOR BRUSH, which works out very nicely with this vacuum. The 2-part hose extension wand is a pain; I plan to keep the telescoping wand that came with the Sanitaire. The dual dusting brush/upholstery tool is kind of a joke; I'll keep the separate ones from the Sanitaire. The hose is rather stiff and kinks easily; that was also a problem with the Sanitaire. If I were buying this without having bought the Sanitaire first, I'd probably be ok with it; I'd adjust to some of the inconveniences. I do think the Sanitaire is overall a better product- basically the same as this vacuum, but with a few refinements.
8092	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Great little zester, as I expected from OXO. My biggest gripe is that it is definitely biased against the right-brained among us (left-handed), but as we're also good at adapting we can still make it work. I also wish the channel knife was a little sharper, but that's easily remedied with a metal needle file. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend it.

But I won't stop there.  Thought maybe I could find the problem or use the motor for another project, since I couldn't return the unit, took it apart and was absolutely flabbergasted with what I found.  I'm an electrical engineer and have been involved with designing and building all sorts of things through my life... but this takes the cake for poor design and unsafe practices.  The motor is mounted using a paper (not plastic, not cardboard) tube that fits into a plastic ridge at the top.  It rests on the bottom of the housing on a rubber grommet and is not anchored in place except for this PAPER tube, shaped like a toilet paper center.  So I threw the bottom half away, put a mason jar lid on the bottom of the nice glass jar and thought I'd use it as an orange juice container... bad idea... it won't pour without slopping down the front and all over the table.
3480	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Awesome.  It is worth every penny I  invested. Moderately priced and cleans up well I hand wash this. I highly recommend this product!
The only flaw I really found with the vacuum is the suction reducer collar on the handle... I'm sure it is a great feature if you want to vacuum delicate draperies or whatnot, but its placement on the handle is very inconvenient. There is no way to lock the position so if your thumb accidentally bumps it while you are vacuuming you will suddenly hear a loud sucking noise and have to turn it to the "off" position to regain the full suction of the vacuum. This is by no means a huge issue, just a minor inconvenience.

This model is stainless steel so it can be used to cook things that you would not want to cook in an aluminum pan, such as leafy greens. I make turnip greens and chopped turnip with only 1 minute of pressure cooking! Chili cooks in 6 minutes. Go ahead and keep your slow cooker, but get one of these in case you forget to put what you need/want into the slow cooker 4 to 10 hours ahead of time and just do it in 10 minutes.
I fully expect this replacement to last another 3+ years.  Other than this issue (which we now understand), it has been bar-quality and always mixed crushed-ice drinks perfectly, provided you don't over-load the amount of ice (which is improper mixing, not the blender's fault; you have to find and remember the ratio of liquid to ice that works; even commercial machines will seize up if you use too much ice).

If I were to buy another cordless vacuum, I'd probably look for something without the beater brush. I know I don't have to turn it on but then it's just in the way and blocks debris from getting past it. For now I may splurge for the Miele s194 because of the bag and hepa filter.

I like the way if you snag them on something they will disconnect.  They eventually do wear out at the ear buds (only get sound from one ear), but that is after months of abuse.  I always buy two just in case.  For the price, you can't beat these!!
2441	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best thing I ever got for my kitchen! Nice and heavy, even heating, no electronic parts to fail. I use it nearly everyday!
Attachments are unwieldy. There's no place to store the tube; I recommend draping it over a hook on the wall. If you unhook the tube from the canister, you're looking straight into the bag from an 1.5" hole, so it's best to do this when the unit is vertical or risk dumping dirt on your floor. The main body is also somewhat larger than expected.

Second, the circular slide, which covers/uncovers the drapery vent, does not stay in place when closed. I have to constantly close it, and my hand gets pinched. I thought about using duct tape but don't want the sticky residue. I may try wedging something to keep it closed.
6797	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best water cooler out there. Use it for camping. Will keep cold water for 4 days in 80 degree heat without a problem.
Just to be clear; the poor rating I gave is for the item itself, not the level of service that was afforded me throughout the process; for that, I would say 4-stars.
The best part of using silicone spatuals is their ability to withstand high heat, up to 450 degrees.  That means that nothing on the stove will ruin them.  They are dishwasher-safe, although the complete silicone construction means that they are entirely non-stick and therefore easy to wash by hand.  Mine arrived with a few small chunks at some of the seams, but it is not noticeable at first.  These flaws also don't undermine the usefulness of the utensils themselves, thus earning only a 1/2 star deduction.

1401	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This potato ricer has two discs. There is a disc with small holes, and a disc with large holes so that I can choose which size I need for the task at hand. I find this ricer really does help make wonderful mashed potatoes. After I have cooked the potatoes, I can push them through the ricer and this helps mash them easily.  In addition to making mashed potatoes, this ricer would also be handy for making homemade spaghetti or other noodles. A little bit of the pasta dough could be put inside the ricer and then the noodles could be extruded out of it. This potato ricer would also be good for making baby food as well. I also like using this ricer for squeezing out excess water from spinach or other greens if I am using them in a dish where the excess moisture could be a problem. My potato ricer is white on the outside so it would go well with any kind of kitchen color scheme. I typically keep mine stored in a drawer and do not leave it out, but it would look fine in a tool caddy if it is a kitchen item that is used frequently. It has enough weight and heft to easily handled the foods that I use it for. I also think it's very easy to clean. I will rinse off any big particles of potatoes or other food that left in the chamber or on the discs. I will  then usually put it in the dishwasher, or wash it by hand if I already have a sink full of hot soapy water ready.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.
The product is great and I highly recommend it! I am so grateful I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion. Thank you Delwip and Amazon for the amazing and timely service as always.
2263	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Does what is supposed to, cooks food very quickly . It does leave a stain after usage that won't go away, because of the aluminum. But it does not bother me. The size is good for 2-4 people.
For someone that wants a higher quality pressure cooker that will likely survive a lifetime or two, you may want to spend a few more dollars.  For me personally, I really love this one and will likely buy the exact same model again for the low price and high functionality if it ever breaks in a few more years.  It's so inexpensive and works very well for me.
Love love love it.

6073	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I read all the reviews on this one before purchasing it, they were very helpful. This is a great vac, I have tile throughout the first floor of the house and it works great on tile. As in other reviews it is ok on carpeting, and they are right.

5157	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this product since 2012 and it still going.  Better than the upright vacuum that I have that I have to replace at least once a year and it cost more.  I use this to vacuum the stairs and upstairs bedrooms as they are all carpeted and we have 2 mutts that sheds so much. I can vacuum all corners, hidden/hard to reach places, blinds and annoying cobwebs. The vacuum bags are also reasonable. I think that this is an excellent product overall.
449	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like this mat however I far prefer the silicone variety. This mat is durable when wiped and my 2 year old loves the colors and pictures. The mat does slip on our wood table and therefore does little to protect the table itself as it is always moving. While I am happy with the purchase, I would recommend a silicone type mat if you are worried about it moving when your child is eating
Noise is very subjective so the best I can think of to get my point across is that if you were in a room talking to someone, and this fan was then turned on and set to slow speed, you would need to raise your voice to be heard.
I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its box

What good is a stainless pot when you're still using aluminum to steam the veggies? Dishonest, deceptive description. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew about the aluminum part.
1251	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances, specifically Cuisinart. Even though I have two other Cuisinart food processors that work perfectly well, I thought this would be good for small jobs and I couldn't resist the look. Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance. I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks. It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors. There are some culinary batches that you would ordinarily need to process, but are too small for a full-sized processor - this item is your answer. I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts (a quite difficult task) to your liking. The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality, same original design that has worked for years. I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.

3839	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	OK, I use my pressure cooker A LOT and although this one has no bells or whistles, it works quite well. I've had this one for a number of years and I used it at least once a month.  The lid attaches and comes off easily all the time, and the parts are easy to clean.  The one drawback is that the handle (which is attached to the pot by a screw) became loose, and although I can tighten it up by tightening the screw head inside the handle, it becomes loose again after a few more uses (it's still tight after using it 4 times more), so I'm pretty sure sooner or later it's going to become stripped (one star off for that). But so far overall, it's been holding up (4 years) and it really is a workhorse. Although it's no longer shiny on the inside or out (just like my favorite heavy duty aluminum cooking pot I bought in Chinatown 15 years ago......), I really love cooking with this.
5525	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile.  We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device.  It's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little.  When done, we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it.  It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries, but it's not really  a problem, since we don't use it every day.  The extra battery should come in handy over time, since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.  I suspect that it will take a year or two (or more) before we have to buy a new battery, which is available for purchase through Eureka.  This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase.

The handle and helper handle on the opposing side is just right for managing it on the range.  The low aluminum rack, called a trivet, has not changed at all, it allows the food to sit above the water in the bottom and prevents it from burning. The pressure regulator has changed little and the over-pressure emergency relief plug is the same, except that the poppet valve is now incorporated with the lid pressure interlock.  The poppet valve allows steam to escape until the rate is high enough to close the valve and seal the cooker allowing the pressure to begin building.  The lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized.  This strikes me as a redundant feature since it is almost impossible to open the lid when even it is under even a small amount of pressure, but I guess someone has done it.  Consequently, with the safety interlock, closing the lid must be done with a little more care than on my old cooker which did not have it.  It just takes a little more attention to alignment.  The lid sealing ring is thinner, but is actually easier to grease and install in the lid.  Finally, the gauge of the stainless steal is exactly as thick as my older 4 quart cooker although it appears thinner.  The sides, lid, and bottom of the older models are uniform thickness and are heavy enough to spread heat evenly.  This cooker now has a layer of aluminum to help spread the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot.  This layer is clad in stainless steel, so all exposed surfaces, most importantly, the bottom, are stainless steel.  The pot and lid are highly polished, but the bar code sticker was a little difficult to get off the side.  There are indented markings at the levels of 1/2 and 2/3 capacity which are visible on the inside and outside of the pot, a nice addition.

So things to know: it does look cheap. The plastic parts are clunky. But, it is light-weight and easy to carry around the house, and it seems to be picking up everything efficiently. I was able to maneuver it under furniture more easily than the canister. Unlike other reviewers, I don't find it to be particularly noisy (at least, no more so then the Kenmore that cost 4x as much!).  It also did a good job on cat hair in high usage areas.
3089	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great pressure cooker. We use it every day. It's amazing how good a roast comes out in just an hour. Most other dishes are much faster!
Okay, now onto the comparison..
It is well-constructed and durable.  I can't even remember when I bought mine.  Suffice it to say that it was more than ten years ago.  I have never had a problem of any kind with it in all that time.

After submitting this product to over three years of normal use, mine is still just like new.
As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect. First off is a little bit of assembly. That went quickly and smoothly. Second is READING the instruction booklet. This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that. It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure. And pressure can be dangerous. After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast. It was super easy and delicious. We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic. It was quick but something to keep in mind is cooking time does not usually include the time to heat it up and the time to cool it down. Also you can't just walk away. Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat. But it really isn't that much oversight.
7001	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works great with my pull behind vacuum.
7176	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Does exactly what I purchased it for. Powerrs several devices from one plug. The Monster name is well known and trusted, so the slight extra expense was worth it.

1352	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Exactly what I was looking for!  Couldn't even find one of these in any of the big box stores!  Glad I had to order instead.  Great item!
8534	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The sides are serrated to make cutting with this a possibility as well! It even come with a little safety cover to keep your fingers safe when reaching into the drawer for it.
The Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between.
5939	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	yes it's light and have good suction power but seriously how hard is it to make it well enough so that the pipes and pieces stay in place and don't get detached? older ones had buttons to hold them together. I'm sure they're not that hard to make if you're not trying to cut all the corners. Plus, it's super loud; so loud that makes my toddler cry (and my older vacuum doesn't).
6749	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Will bring your vacuum back to life!  The belt was stretched on our Hoover Tempo (cheap but very good vacuum) and the brush was no longer rotating.  Put one of these new belts on & now it vacuums like new!
6039	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The vacuum is very light.  Easy to handle on stairways.  As I purchased it for vacuuming stairways I am pleased.  The hose and attachments are very "cheap" in feel and appearance but work exactly as the previous reviews indicated.  Great power and easy to handle.
5920	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've used this for about 2 years, maybe longer.  It works great on my hardwood floors and I've had no problems with it.
My house is a 900 sq. ft. brick ranch, 1950's built with original windows (wooden sash/panels), and no central A/C.  This is truly a whole-house fan for me!  Completely turns over the entire house air in a matter of seconds. The direction of air flow (intake/exhaust) changes with a simple manual turn-knob.  There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.  Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.  While I'm readily technically competent, I HATE it when simple things are un-necessarily complicated, & therefore prone to electro/digital malfunction.  This is a purely simple, incredibly well designed, powerful window fan.
8236	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Excellent peeler.

5388	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This stick vacuum works very well on hard floors. We have purchased several over the years because the batteries do not last more than 2 years. When you compare the cost of a new vacuum with the cost of the batteries we go for the new vacuum with batteries included.
4652	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Really like it!
5474	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best and easiest little vac for kitty litter and short carpet areas ever.  I now own 4 of these, one for bedroom, kitchen, garage and our garden shed.  Saves your back compared to the old dustbusters.  The brush roller works great (I always use it, even on flat surfaces).  I can't think of anything to improve it.
5138	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is one badass little vac. It's not as cool as the purple pet Eureka (similar in price), but it does a decent job. Cheers.
3946	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I won't say I love it because I doubt any vacuum I can afford rates that high. However its small and compact & does clean well. The big reason for 4 stars is the limp hose. The hose is flexible - to flexible and it kinks. Other than that I like it.
9598	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use this weekly to core fruit for my juicer. No problems. Works as advertised.
When 'boiling' food in a traditional pot, the food cannot exceed 212 degrees F (the temperature at which water boils).  Under pressure, the boiling point rises...  in this pressure cooker to about 250 degrees F.  This means, of course, that food cooks faster (the reason people normally think to buy a pressure cooker), but the higher temperature also allows other 'reactions' to take place while cooking... For instance, the tougher fibers in meat will convert to gelatin, making the meat more tender.  As a result,  pressure cookers are great for braised dishes with tough meats, such as chili.  For these purposes, this pressure cooker rocks.
IMO this is more of a plus than something negative, but one has to check out proper sizes before buying it.
6450	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Fit my vacuum.
A thing of safety first. DO NOT PLUG INTO EXTENSION CORD OF ANY KIND> plug into wall outlet or you will blow a fuse. I learned this the hard way. This thing pours out the heat. The remote control is great, because I don't have to leave bed to change the temperature. The oscillating feature is great also.
2009	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Seemingly good build compared to aftermarket comparable belts. They last and don't crack as easily after use.

1150	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I just threw this away after having it for two years. I think I used it 5-6 times, and nearly every time, it either made the veggies into pulp or got stuck and wouldn't chop. It's too small for most jobs, but won't work with tiny quantities of herbs, either. The last time I tried to use it, it just stopped spinning.

5088	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	What can I say? Its a vacuum bag.  It does its job and their is nothing more to say.  How can you critic a vacuum bag?
This fan fills the gap of the window opening allowing it to efficiently move rather large amounts of air.  This is a bonus over regular box fans as without sealing the opening, you're not really moving air as effectively as possible.

 deserves 3 3/4 stars because of flimsy accessories.
I am very pleased and already have cooked numerous different food types with great results. Excellent product quality and as far as the rusting screws so many have complained about, either it is too soon for me to see this happen, or I do believe the screws for my handles are stainless steel or some non-rusting metal (though maybe I'm wrong). Anyway, if they do start to rust, I'll just do like others and buy non-rusting screws for a few bucks and solve the issue.
3445	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Pressure cookers are great.  They are real time savers.  The only caution is if you are cooking for more than 2-3 people you may want to get a 6 or 8 quart.  You can only fill 2/3 of the pot up and it limits how much you can cook.
Using my full sized vacuum for this specific task means setting up the hose, hooking up the special floor attachment and hauling the upright vacuum cleaner around after hose while I get under things. It's not actually that much work unless, like me, you do this every two days.
7728	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Small, compact, and not as cumbersome as a box grater, I love the curve as it let's me zest citrus with a little pocket to keep from crushing it.
I also have a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OXO-Good-Grips-Box-Grater/dp/B0007VO0CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OXO Good Grips Box Grater</a>&nbsp;which is great because you can separate the sides and put on top of bowls to do huge grating jobs.... but this one could have been the perfect companion, if it was curved the right way, it cuts on the outside of the curve.... duh
I bought this for my parents recently, as they are having difficulty lugging around the bulky canisters they still have from the 1950s and 1970s.  I read over the reviews of the Mighty Mite, and I thought this would provide enough cleaning power for them without breaking their backs.

The not great:
The thing I like about this specific towel holder is the design (wall or under cabinet mounting is at your option) which allows the roll to be slipped onto the central retaining spindle without requiring support at both ends, making for a secure towel holder that will not allow the roll of towels to fly out of the holder which is common in some holders which retain the towel roll by pressure on opposite ends of the roll. Another nice feature of this holder is the slightly upturned end of the roll retaining bar to prevent the roll from slipping off the rod when towels are aggressively pulled off the roll, especially with one handed operation. Overall this has been a great paper towel holder.
4342	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is our first pressure cooker and we think it works great! No more all day slow cooking, this takes far less time.  The only down fall is I like to cook BIG meals and this doesn't have the capacity.
8489	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Good quality. Heavy and large. I have a smaller OXO one, however, that gets the lettuce dryer.

OXO is well known for their ergonomic grips. This one looks most unlikely
1745	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I hate being unclean. I hate not having a shower in the morning. So when I took the Trans-Siberian Railway and got to experience days on end of not showering, I was a mess for not feeling warm water all over me and just the general good feeling that a shower brings.
P.S.  Get your genuine bags right here on Amazon, and get any spare parts from the OEM, as they're cheaper and they won't nail you on the shipping costs like so many parts houses will.
4105	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	There's not a lot I can say about how great boxes for putting things in are at sitting around having things put in them. This box, though, contains things quite admirably, and it is sturdy and heavy-duty enough that it is definitely difficult to take said things out once they have been put in and the box has been locked. The one frustration I have with it, however, is that the locking can be a bit of a chore, as the holes through which you are supposed to insert your lock are situated such that its a bit tricky to get said lock in.
6095	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I received this right before the Christmas cleaning frenzie. I told my 18 yr old daughter to unpack it and get to work....which she did quickly. The next thing I knew she was declaring her love for this vacuum! She said it was awesome as she zoomed through the house vacuuming areas I hadn't even asked her to do! She changed attachments and started going up the sides of the piano to clean off some dust! It was crazy! She even put the intake hose up to her sister's pant leg to show her how powerful the suction was! ha ha ha  So, this gets at least a 4 star rating right off the bat. Once I use it some more it may even go up to a five star! Big thumbs up!
7906	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great pie server!  I like that it can cut so easily too.

8589	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This is crap.  I bought this because it looked sturdy and the OXO name.  It bent the first time I used it on a relatively light piece of pie.  It is just a flimsy piece of steel stuck in an OXO handle.

5505	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am glad to have it  as a replacement for my old one my daughter now has. I'm still trying to figure out when to have the brushed out or not. Sometimes I wish the head moved more easily across the low pile carpet.

7335	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great spreader.  It has a serrated edge which is great for cutting sandwiches with.  The spreader is made of the usual high quality OXO materials you have come to expect.  The knife has a nice weight to it and the handle makes it very easy and comfortable to use.  It is perfect for making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, buttering toast and english muffins and looks great when you are hosting a brunch!  The spreader came nicely packaged and in perfect condition.  I am very happy with my purchase.
9763	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This replaced a similar opener that became dull after too much use.  This was an improvement over the previous opener because the handle has a more ergonomic design alone with OXO's rubbery coating that makes everything feel just a bit grippier. My young sons love to help in the kitchen by using this tool, so that's a good indicator that it works for smaller hands as well.

During the day, I turn this off and shut the window and leave a small crack just to have some air.  The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk.  When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature, I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan.  This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money.  This paid for itself after only 2 weeks. You have to love that.

3829	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I have used pressure cooker for 3 years. This has never happened before. I received my Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker yesterday. Rice cooked with this cooker looks wierd. It taste normal, but looks a little dark and gray. I cleaned the cooker for a second time, carefully. In order to kill bacteria, I also boiled a whole pot of water with it and hold for 20 minutes. Then I cook rice with it, and got gray rice again!!! Anyone can explain this? Someone had same experience online said this might caused by fake stainless steel, and probably heavy metal from the cooker goes into my rice!! So scary!!! Is that true? What's wrong with this cooker?
813	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This could not be worse. It holds so little. Lettuce must be cut up before you put it inside.  The sides are too high. Save your money. Flimsy junk.


To deal with simple vibration, we devised a system involving thin strips of wood for the bottoms and 2x6s on the sides to provide a solid, semi-permanent gap fillers.  I painted the wood to match the room paint and it seems to work well.  Our windows are of the cheap variety (drywall with alum. windows wedged into place, no frames).

I would advise anyone to goto your local store and try the same, it costed me less than $70 to try the models I was interested in.  The only problem is the hassle of boxing up the ones that didn't perform well and the cost of gas for returning it.

This cheese grater is none of that. First, its very simple to clean, since it comes apart in 2 pieces, very easy to hand wash. Its also nice and stable when grating cheese, no flex or movement in it at all, just a nice stable grater. And the ability to split it in 2 and use each half is cool!

9671	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The item does what it's supposed to. It seems very well constructed and is a more sturdy piece than many others. With a cutter like this, you worry about longevity of rust, etc, especially right around the center and under the "spokes" attaching the wheel to the handle. But given Oxo's track record on other items I've owned, this shouldn't be a problem. Highly recommended!

My favorite thing about this vacuum is the availability and affordability of replacement bags.  I have had quite a few vacuums over the years where models have been discontinued and it becomes virtually impossible to find bags.  Eureka, fortunately, has kept the same MM bags standard across the various model changes.

8993	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A pizza wheel should be a simple thing.  It should not break where the wheel connects to the handle.  It should be sharp so that it does not smash the heck out of whatever you are cutting and does not require repeated back and forth cutting, and the handle should be comfortable to hold.  I cannot explain how many pizza cutters fail these simple premises.
459	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very cute placemat, my son loves to play while he's eating.
4405	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	We purchased one of these Eureka Mighty Mite canister vacs several years ago (same model), and it's still going strong. It's very lightweight, has a long enough cord, and provides sufficient suction for most jobs. You can buy the bags cheaply, as MM-style are produced by a number of manufacturers. One thing I would mention is that you'll probably want to buy some noise-isolating headphones or a pair of foam earplugs as this vacuum is loud. The other thing I would obtain is a better bare floor brush attachment, as the floor/rug combination tool is a compromise for both. But the vacuum is inexpensive and gets the job done.

9773	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great masher.  I always hated all the other mashers and how you had to hold them.  With the handle horizontal vs. vertical it is easier to mash with less effort.  The only thing I would change on it would be to have the distance between the handle and the masher end farther apart.  Making mashed potatoes for a family of 8 my fingers would dip into the hot potatoes every once and a while.  But still love it

1344	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I look at the craft stores at paint brushes and they can be so expensive. But they don't always look like quality. I paint signs just for a hobby, and I hate when you get a piece of brush in the paint. I have not had that problem with these brushes. I'm very happy with them. I am just a hobbyist, so I only use them occasionally. But they have worked great for my signs.
BTW:  Many comments regarding the "flimsy" hose bending and getting tangled.  It is true that it is lightweight and thin and can bend/fold, however, I have not had this happen.  I am careful/patient as I move around and watch the hose as I move.

3552	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use this for COOKING and it can't be beat.  Old Mirro gasket gave up the ghost and decided it was time for a new pot.  Never used a Presto before and was leery of having only one pressure setting, but it's okay.  Not crazy about the handle, but it does have two, and I've been very happy with it.  6 qt offers some added possibilities over 4 qt and corn is no longer a problem.  Got stainless for the price of aluminum.  Can't be beat.

Stopped using it
My house is all hard wood.  I've been sweeping several times a day for years and honestly, I'm sick of pushing dust and dog hair around.  The mighty mite has a surprisingly strong suction that will devour just about anything in its path.  I'm talking about coins, a sock, dog food and Timothy hay.  All of these have been accidentally sucked up with ease so you can imagine how well it takes on every day dust and dirt.  If I had to wish for an improvement it would be some type of clips or built in straps for containing the hoses when not in use.  The only concern I have is the motor runs quite hot even with a clean bag.  I think the design might need a bit more air flow to accommodate the powerful motor.
9159	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I love OXO products and this one does a good job at slicing pizza, with the additional features of OXO products: soft grip areas and a thumb guard. It's not too easy, and not too hard to clean, it just requires a lot of care not to slice fingers.

I have dozens of photos of myself standing on top of the freezer at that point, while someone else cranks. It is not that big a deal. Also, you can't just look around for another freezer like the White Mountain, because there are none. This is by far the most durable and reliable of any, and spare parts are sold. I have owned, used, and given as gifts over the years. There's no comparison. Electric motors in any freezer, by the way, will never freezer as hard as hand cranked and a strong arm. The ice cream will be more like soft-freeze, though you can ripen it in the freezer for a few hours, or pack it down in ice and salt (of course take the paddle out first! otherwise it will freeze into it) with a rug over it.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/White-Mountain-Ice-Cream-Freezer-6-Qt-Pine/dp/B008FSO8CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer 6 Qt.

This one draws about 100 watts at high speed, and about 70 watts at low speed.  I used a Kill-a-watt to measure the power needed.  This is more energy-efficient than my smaller, twin 8" Honeywell fan, which uses about 125 watts and doesn't move nearly as much air.
The only problem I've ever had with this cooker is that people will hassle you a lot to cook them their favorite soups.

Primarily for hardwood floors that I could carry up and down stairs easily. Was very excited about this vacuum. It is lightweight. It has decent suction when you take the head off and test. Unfortunately there is a bend in the handle before it connects to the hose that kept clogging with dog hair. I would have to disconnect it and blow out the fur to start vacuuming again. The other problem is that the lower segment of the handle is metal which would be great except it is too heavy and keeps disconnecting. Works pretty well if do not extend it but then you are vacuuming with a short arm. Overall not very functional. I would absolutely not buy again. Maybe if you don't have dogs or cats and used duct tape on the handle it would be ok.

Also, I just don't LIKE those ones, they feel funny in your hand, and I also feel like that piece of metal bends in the long run so it's not as effective as a grater... THIS one... it's not like that. It's the one that has the indentation in the metal, and the metal isn't that thin crap that's a step away from tin foil, this is some sturdy metal. Handle seems sturdy as well. The sides where the mtal loops over the frame, it doesn't hide bits like some others do, so it's super easy on the clean up.

It has a nice handle length.  The only thing I don't like is the grip, but I can live with it.  I would have preferred a solid round grip, rather than the thin rectangle.  It doesn't give as much padding tot the hand and it feels a bit awkward.  But overall, I like it and will keep it.

It was needless worry. The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws. I grabbed 4 1"long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window. Use some washers to reinforce the plastic. It does feel flimsy at the mount point. The pressure holds the unit in place. The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.

I was disappointed to find out that it uses bags instead of a canister that can be emptied. That was my own fault for missing that info in the description. I did knock off a star due to the fact that the head keeps falling off....multiple times during a vacuuming session.

This model is noticeably less sturdy and comes with the most flimsy attachments, including the wand that that actually bends when you use it. It's also extremely loud and puts out lots of heat.

But to humor my favorite guy I bought the 10 pack as it was most cost effective and who cares what color you peel your oranges with.  What a big surprise for me!!!

1082	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased my Mini-Prep from a beloved local store because I was given a $25 gift certificate, and the price ($29.99) was comparable to amazon's and fit nicely with my gift certificate.  I purchased my first Robot-Coupe in, I'm pretty sure, 1983, and have used it and its successors constantly,  I bought my first Mini in probably the mid-1990's, and  I purchased this new Mini because mine died years ago after very heavy duty.  So I'm no stranger to food processors, full-sized and mini.  After reading David Lebovitz's blog about minis, I thought "this is exactly what I'm going to do with my gift certificate!"  However,  I'm so disappointed in this Mini-Prep.  The first thing I asked it to do was to chop up a Ghirardelli 60% chocolate bar (for brownies, so it didn't have to be perfect)--but it wouldn't even begin to do this even with only half of the bar inside.  So I hauled out the big Cuisinart,  and the chocolate bar instantly turned into chocolate chips.  Next task:  1 ounce of dried shiitake mushrooms which I wanted to turn into a powder for a stew.  Half of the mushrooms turned into a powder.  I dumped those into the stew, returning the chunks to the Mini.  Some powder, but still big chunks.  I pulsed, I tried low and high, I tried continuous, but no luck.  So I broke up the big chunks with my fingers and, eventually, the full ounce of  the mushrooms made its way into the stew.  Third task: almonds.  Similar result:  1/4 of the nuts turned to powder but 3/4 of the nuts remained almost whole almonds.  Again, I broke out the Big Cuisinart and made the chunks go away.  I'm so disappointed:  I was hoping to use the Mini for very small amounts of the kind of things that are hard to keep under control on the cutting board:  Nuts, chocolate, dried stuff.  Not to mention avoiding hand-washing a knife and cutting board as opposed to the easy cleanup with itty-bitty Mini parts on the top shelf of the dishwasher.  I guess I can use this Mini only for things that I could easily crush with my fingers anyway--perhaps Feta cheese?  I should have paid at least $10 more and bought a Mini-Prep with more firepower.  I definitely wasted my $29.99.
Btw, Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.

NOT only do they work they work marvelously well!  I love that they have magnets on them so I am never looking for them in my kitchen drawer.  They hold fast and never let go.  I am buying five sets today from Amazon for less than the supermarket charges and their in pretty colors to boot.  The ones I bought previously were only in white.

It easily vacuums up the course dog hair and the fluffy downy persian cat hair.  Also gets up dust and dirt, and even ice melt salt that is tracked in from our front porch.  It even works fairly well on the rug in the nursery, removing the surface dirt and hair quite well.  Oh!  And I now vacuum my couches with it every day!  Turn on the brush roller and quickly go over the cushions to remove pet hair.  It will not replace your big vacuum for deep cleaning.

Well, I lost my squeezer and finally gave up on finding it, so to Amazon I go.  And I cam across the Squeezmo squeezer.  This little thing is awesome!  I can drop my bag right in there from the cup and squeeze without burning my fingers.  Then I can pour the tea back into the cup and set the squeezer to the side.  I haven't made one mess or burned one finger since using this thing!  I just wish I'd have lost that old squeezer a long time ago!

I can do things with a pressure cooker which cannot be done with a microwave!

The problem is the short lifetime of the machine.  Twice burned, we will not purchase this model again.

9804	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I own their smaller spinner for quite a few years and its sturdy and works great. But this larger spinner from OXO is a big disappointment. The plastic is flimsy, but the big dproblem is that it doesnt work. No matter how long or how many time you spin it, the water remains in the basket with the greens, never makes it to the enclosing container - so your salad is just as wet as when you started. A total waste of money and a surprising disappointment from a company whose higher price points are generally warranted by the quality and performance of their products. This one doesnt succeed on either level.

It does an amazing job, is very light weight, has a super long cord, and all of the attachments are great and easy to store on the vacuum's body.  I only have one large area rug and several small children's throw play rugs, so I can't comment on how it does on actual carpet, but for hardwood floors it's amazing.  Because it's yellow, I can get my daughter who's three to help me out with her 'Big Bird vacuum'.  :)  The wand is light enough that she can actually hold it and do some vacuuming (although I have to go over it later, but good learning tool!).

I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean. I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.  The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister. No overheat problems with a clean filter. The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool. Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet.

Then I have to deal with all the left overs. This cooker is the right size for two with plenty of left overs for the week. My first recipe was with dried beans (black, pinto) for chili. The booklet said only cook for 3 min. after the quick soak (one hour). I did't believe that was possible. Because I have tried to cook dried bean on the stove top and it took hours and hours.

I haven't mounted the charger yet, but I have it attached with the extra battery charging also.  One light on the charger is solid red and the other is flashing red.  I am not sure if this is correct or not.  I didn't see anything in the instructions about how the lights should be during charging or when fully charged.  I am thinking I may not mount the charger since it works fine and I would be able to move it if need be.  About how long does the battery take to recharge after use?
2) Because of the way they nest, where the front of each hose is smaller than the previous, sometimes things get stuck on the way up the hose. I opened the thing up to find the middle hose piece completely full of pine needles after taking out my Christmas tree.

2985	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	While it's an 8 quart pot you really can't pressure cook 6 quarts because of the fill line, which prevents the boiling liquids from clogging up the vent pipe. Cause, yeah they will clog up. My complaint is that I would have bought a bigger pot had i known I had a filling line to contend with. It works great and I am very happy with my pressure cooker.

The price is right for what you get: it works strong and hard to create good air flow. The box fan also cools the room down on days when you can't use an air conditioner or when you simply don't want to use one. Moreover, like other reviewers have noted, it blocks out sounds and it's even nice to have it on while I'm sleeping!

Frankly, they are messy and add dust, hair, dirt,  pollen, in your face and air as you empty the compartment. What bugs me is there isn't a way to store the pet hair attachment, it is like an afterthought. The vacuum is priced reasonably and cleans well. The floor and carpet attachment wand is forever detaching, the handheld cleaning dusting tool, located above the filter falls off with any movement. I wrapped tape around the holder and now the attachment stays in place. The air flow ring is too loose to stay in place and will pinch skin as it opens and closes. I placed a rubber band around the ring to keep it from twisting open and closing so easily.  Now I have the almost perfect product.

671	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I have a Lasko 5160 Ceramic Oscillating Heater in my office at work. If you rely on the built in thermostat, the room is either too hot or too cold. The room cools off faster than the temperature sensor which is inside the heater and is slow to cool off; the heater fan only comes on at the same time as the heater. You must manually turn the heater on to keep the room temperature from dropping too low though it will shut off when the room reaches the set temperature. A heater that requires babysitting  is a very troublesome appliance.

Just a little piece of advice. Do not wash this pot in the dishwasher, no matter what the pamphlet says.

It does not feel very sharp, so you have to go deep into the white pith to make a twist longer than an inch. The result is very thick and does not look elegant enough to garnish a cocktail. I am now using a sharp knife instead.
The wand attachments give plenty of reach, but I'd recommend upgrading the "dusting brush" to a horse hair bristle model, to avoid marking up painted walls, etc.
3044	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	It's hard to close the handle because the pressure valve is in the way so I had to take an ice pick and center it.

935	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I just installed this today for a room divider in a small room. I used about 9ft of the wire that came with the kit and I have several feet left. The description states that you need to supply your own fasteners/hardware, so unless this addition was just made to the item description, no one can complain about this. I bought some #12 1 1/2" wood screws so that the heads fit into the pre-countersunk holes in the metal plates that you attach to the walls. One plate and three screws went into a stud and the other into a very smooth masonry wall with some Gorilla Glue. This Gorilla Glue works in *my* case - I must have put about 15 lbs of downward pressure on it and for *me* it was fine, especially since less than 3 pounds will be hanging from it. I hate drilling through masonry walls in a rented house, and so this alternative works fine for me. The fact that the installation instructions are all pictorial was not a problem, the assembly was easy. If you're used to putting things together yourself, this is a simple project. The hardest thing is positiong the wire plates at either wall exactly where you want them if no studs are present. I don't want the wire to sag, so I checked for stud locations *before* ordering this, knowing that I might also have to use masonry anchors and screws. If you can't attach this to wall studs, you might just want to go with ceiling curtain rod brackets ad a very lightweight curtain rod (all of which Ikea happens to have for a lot, lot less than Home Depot).

I always buy 4 when I replace them, so I will have 2 extras to make a quick replacement and then order 2 more. They are not cheaply made, I am not sure what some reviewers are expecting for 17 or so dollars. One tip: when you mount it, take it to a local hardware store and ask them to size the proper size of type of screw (head diameter, length, and threads) and then buy 10 or so of these screws. Using the proper screws is very important for a nice tight fit against the bottom of the cabinet.

It is double meshed so it keeps even tiniest of particles out of my infused oil. ( I do run the oil through cheesecloth after I strain but that may be because I'm obsessive! LOL).

I purchased this vac solely for use in vacuuming my automobiles and it is perfect for that.  The unit is extremely light - perhaps only four pounds or so - meaning that it can easily be lifted and moved around.  It is small - about 16 inches long by 6 inches wide by 8 inches tall - so it will easily sit on a car seat while being used.  Alternately, the hose in long enough so that the "canister" unit can be left on the ground outside the car.
Pros-Lightweight, easy to maneuver, hose extends a good distance and there are many attachments available to purchase for the hose.

Why doesn't this old, old, old company have a check-list of problems to avoid, and then make sure they avoid those problems in every vacuum they design?  I'm never going to buy one of their machines again.  If they can't get it right after 100 years, they never will.

Your are obviously not going to get quiet, super cyclone, bagless, blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud, takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.
6009	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased this from Amazon at a great price. The price of this vacuum varies widely  from place to place and this was the best price.  This little vacuum  could suck the paint off of walls.  It's powerful!  It's light and well build for the price.  The only thing I would  have wanted additionally is a retractable cord. My guess is that I'll have this little workhorse for some time.  I'm a 64 year old female who owns 4 dogs and a cat and I live in a two story house.  The effectiveness and weight of the vacuum are important features for me and this one delivers in both categories. I wrote a previous review on this item but it wasn't detailed enough.  I depend greatly on the reviews of others who have purchased and used products I'm considering buying.  I hope this helps you.

Worked perfectly on my induction stove top and, surprisingly, found the top (lid cover) of the pot very easy to open and close (usually at beginning it can be quite stiff).

7306	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The design,mfg. and usage are excellent but the choice of material is not. Since when is it OK to use recycled stainless steel in food products, this means the stainless steel they used contained scrap iron,steel, aluminum, motor oil,etc. This is indicated by rusty spot and staining on the blades. Why does made in USA have to follow USDA,NSF guide lines for our health but made in China does not, once again high profit margins are more important than our health.

2815	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I have had this unit for perhaps 10 years, finding replacement filters has become a problem, but they are available at a much higher cost. Leaks after filter replacement has always been an issue. The wrench itself does not work satisfactorily and I have to remove the entire filter housing and place it in a vice then beat the wrench with a hammer to get it loosened or tightened. In addition , when I take out the old filter at six month intervals I find the inside of the housing has traces of slime and mold - this is not good, and thorough washing and a final bleach rinse is necessary before inserting the replacement filter.

Pros: -not too loud, even on high (but then I grew up with a large metal box fan in my window)
-It's enormous, so if you have an older dishwasher, likely you'll be washing it by hand.  Finding storage space in small apartments for that size may be an issue as well.  You might want to consider your actual use needs before getting one this large (I needed large).

Of the 3 models I tested, I kept the Feature Comforts model which moves about 3000 CFM of air.  I live in a 4000 sq ft home and bought these to flush out the hot air when I get home from work so I can cool the house w/AC faster.  I tested the fans by setting them up in the windows on the same wall and stepped back from the windows as far as I could till I could no longer feel the air being moved by each fan.

The efficiency of a fan depends on how large a cross section of air it moves.  Holding my hand in front of the Lasko and the Holmes, I found that most of the draft was only 14" wide.  They don't really function as 20" fans.  I was fooled twice!

I didn't have the tiny plastic cover for it, so putting it in my utilities drawer was a mistake because I often got my fingers poked. I had to just set it aside by itself inside it's own plastic bag.  I finally just tossed it because never before has a kitchen utensil made me so frustrated.

You may filter microscopic dust but then you have to shake it out in the garbage while that microscopic dust floats away in the wind and swirls around your trash bin and house. Isn't that what you were just trying to vacuum up? Then you have to wash those filters. CRAZY. These Z bags do all the work for you. Keeps all that microscopic dust CONTAINED. When full, remove from vacuum, cover the hole with some tape, and deposit in trash. And they are made of biodegradable paper at that. It may seem "old school" or from "back in the day" but it is a VERY VERY SMART WAY to vacuum and it is environmentally sound. Your choice.

1242	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought two of these and gave one as a gift.  Mine has come in very handy obviously for small jobs that get lost in my big processor.  I do a lot of cooking  have not yet used it for a wide variety of things but am imagining I will need it for limited applications anyway. I get very tired of washing out my big processor after little jobs.  This is very quick to clean.  The price was very attractive.  MAH

294	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like this, but it's not what I anticipated. I have the original magnetic poetry; based on the picture showing the use of words on the tin, I thought it was larger. The tin is considerably smaller: 2.5" x 2", instead of *Altoids* tin size (what I expected). That is why I have deducted a star.

For those who are concerned with cost, I bought each of mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond with a 20% off coupon.  This made them a bit more affordable, and quick if you need one right away.  I shop at Whole Foods, but I would never, ever by OXO products there as one reviewer mentioned.  Not with B B & B around nearby, where the price is lower even without the 20% off coupon.  Hope this information helps.

3248	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We got this pressure cooker about 4 and half years ago, and I realize that given how much we have used it- I should probably write a review. It's been great. We make beans with it all the time- so it's been in almost continuous use for the past few years- like every other day or so. Now I'm branching out to make other "fancy" dishes like coq au vin or lamb curry and it's still working out really well. I expect one can always get a more expensive cooker, but why? This one does the job and it does it really well. It's not beautiful (after 4.5 years, it's certainly not as shiny as the image shown on Amazon)- but I don't care as long as the food is good and the pressure cooker is sturdy.

4507	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Being a "handyman" - of sorts, when I go to the summer cottage or to see the grandkids, I need to have my tools and their accessories with me. Rusty, my faithful hound takes up the cargo area of the SUV, so I needed weather-resistant containers.  I have a trailer-hitch carrier which readily accommodates these containers- on either side of the license plate - and allows the tailgate to open while they are still on the carrier. Perfect.

3643	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it, but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight, great heat distribution, NOT aluminium, and sturdy. As a pressure cooker, I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month, I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days, I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version.
Don't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.

9234	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Recently I was in the market for a new meat tenderizer.  I'm a down home country girl, and I like to prepare my meat properly prior to devouring.  I have found that the best way to seal in the juices on a nice thick premium cut of meat is to pound the hell out of it repeatedly while screaming in German.  This not only tenderizes the meat but terrorizes it in to submission.  Note: This works esspecially well on meat from a KOSHER deli.  The OXO Good Grips Meat Tenderizer lives up to its name, don't be fooled by naysayers.  The violence with which I wield this heavenly instrument of meat rivals that of the Norse gods of yore, and yet nary a time has my grip slipped.  It holds up well to blood spatter, vitreole, and even the occasional lymphatic fluid bursting from my tasty nemesis: meat.
I also have the 4-quart Mirror-pressure-cooker (aluminum).  Pros 1) enough for 4 servings  2) Small enough to fit into any sink, to pour cold water to lower pressure  3)  Build up pressure much faster  4)  Wider bottom for browning, plus pot is lighter & safer.  I used the Mirror-4-quart for many years .. never injure myself, except when I left it on the stove on high heat too long and the pressure knock off the trivet, and squirt the stew way up the ceiling.  The Mirror brand is a safer design, because the trivet is more stable, and doesn't release steam when tilted like the Presto.

My only complaint is the cord, which is stored/wrapped on the bottom of the machine. I find this location to be quite inconvenient, but since the tools are stored in the back, and there is a handle on top, I guess this was the only location left.

Easy.
2004	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	No issues whatsoever. The last time I bought these was years ago.
About 30 years ago it was suspected that aluminum was unhealthy to cook in so I replaced my aluminum cooker with the 6 quart Presto model 0135001 stainless steel pressure cooker from Service Merchandise now out of business. The only draw back is it's weight at 5.15 pounds, a couple pounds of meat added and liquid and it gets really heavy, hence the need for the helper handle. I have been able to replace the pot handle in the past and the long ago broken pot helper handle this year for this old cooker from Presto.
DURABLE: As mentioned above, I dropped this fan numerous times (not because it's not stable, it's near impossible to accidentally drop the fan backwards actually,  but b/c of my tendency to use it at weird angles without stable support underneath).

8817	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	i have many utensils from this line, and just like the rest, this piece work beautifully. my only advise is don't wait for food to get stuck before washing, instead giving it a rinse as soon as your done with it, as food tends to stick really well to it, requiring a soak later. there is also a real nice looking stainless bucket for these to set on your counter top for around $20, and the bottom(oxo plastic) comes off for easy cleaning. i love my set!

Only complaint, and it's a VERY minor one, is that the interlock pin which pops up when there's pressure isn't visible from the side.  Have to walk over and look down on it to check it when waiting for the cooker to cool.

4468	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I put this in the dishwasher and it turned black.  The inside looks like it was severely burnt and scratched. I will probably toss it out. Wish I would have bought stainless steel as I cannot return it because I pitched the box. Maybe I should have known that you cannot put aluminum in a dishwasher?! Other than that it worked fine for the one time that I used it. It should have come with a warning about the dishwasher.
The design makes the fan more efficient at circulating air through your house: I added some removable weatherstripping (rope caulk) around the fan to seal the window.  Installation was easy.  It seems well-made, but I am a little concerned about durability based on other reviews; I will update my review if it dies.
8528	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works great for quinoa and rinsing rice. Perfect size. I had a small strainer like this and it was SO aggravating to prepare a decent amount of quinoa. Rinsing quinoa is essential to keep it from being bitter.

5990	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this Mighty Mite to replace one I had over 15 years.  The only things on this new one that even comes close in comparrison are the power of the motor - which is good, and the extension wands.  The hose is so poor quality that it folded and cut off the air flow on my first use!! the housing feels like it will crack if you bump it into something, the wheels are not much better.  The motor makes for good suction, that is really the only positive I can give on this unit.  The old gray model I had since the late 80's was wonderful! I replaced that one with an Oreck, but wanted to go back to something with wheels on the floor for touch-ups, baseboards, overhead cleaning, etc.
6972	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	These wands do not fit perfectly the accessories I got with the vac nor the ones I purchased separately.  They do not hold the attachment well.  I have to put a piece of masking tape around the narrow section so the connection will fit tighter and hold.

I leave them running at the lowest speed when I am at home and only turn them off when I leave my apartment. They have never overheated or stopped working. They do move some air at the highest speed, shakes a little (the feet really help to stabilize them), and make a bit of noise on the highest speed but at the lowest speed (which I have them at) you can watch tv without having to raise the volume too high.

I replaced the existing room duplex wall receptacles with the Leviton 688 recessed receptacle and modified the fan by removing all but about 20 inches of power cord and drilling a 1.75 inch hole in the back of the fan allowing the remainder of the cord and the rear of the plug to recess into the fan. The end result is that there is no power cord showing (just like in the picture (where the power cord must have been removed)). The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other. Naturally, I tested the fans before making the modifications which were not difficult at all.

1970	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These fit my vacuum perfectly and are a quality build. Don't hesitate to purchase them as they are exactly as described.
First off, the vacuum does very well on hardwood floors whether it is picking up pet hair, crumbs, etc.  The hose and crevice attachment help to get hard to reach areas.  The suction level is very high which is great.  The vacuum is light weight and easy to carry if needed, but it also has wheels and easily just follows along behind you while using the hose.  The bags are easy to change without making a mess.  Since the vacuum is small it is easy to store which is important to me because I have a small home.

Larger pressure cookers can also be used for canning (because the higher temperatures can kill more bad things.  This pressure cooker really is not large enough for this task.  If you are not a canner though, compare the prices of this against those larger models... I think you will be back looking at this one.

4737	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I like it.  The two battery set up is the one you want hands down.  It picks up that annoying dust that happens on a regular basis, but remember it is powered by a NiCad battery.  So you are not going to clean carpet.  This is perfect for daily sweeping and picking up dist.  I bought two of these to give one as a gift, and my friend also loves it too.  For the price, you will love it too.  See demonstrations on YouTube.
In a way, I am glad.  I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it  and the coffee tastes much better!
Still, it is a happy addition to our lives. After using this for some months, and following the directions, it burned a pot of beans. I had put in the listed amount of water, oil, under the line, etc. so I ignored the smell of burning. Never do that. The inside was burned on beans. It seemed a disaster. Then a friend spent 15 minutes and scrubbed it back to its shiny original shape.

8799	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	read the other reviews its that nice. i have only ever used the cheap metal ones that hurt your hands, this one won't.
This is a really nice 3 piece silicone spatula set, and include one with a scoop shape, one small flat paddle (for scraping out narrow containers) and one flat, angled version for getting the sides of bowls. These are made from BPA free, food grade silicone. The description says they are heat resistant up to 450 degrees, which is definitely higher than my other set will safely go to. There are several things that I really like about these silicone spatulas. They come in varying sizes, allowing you to choose the right one for your needs at any given time. They're non-stick, non-scratch, and a nice graphite gray color. I don't worry about the kids damaging the cookware when they're using these. Each spatula is reinforced with metal so the handle doesn't bend, yet the head of the spatula retains it's flexibility for getting in the pan like you need it to. They're a one piece design, which I like (another one I loved was two pieces, and it was constantly coming apart).  There's a little hold in the handle so you can hang them up, if you like. These are very durable, and easy to clean (Dishwasher safe.). Overall, I'm very pleased with these spatulas and have been using them a LOT!
6878	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I own three of these MODEL 3733..Two of them run nearly 24/7 during the long hot Vegas summer..I purchased them at walgreens for much less...I read the one star reviews and decided to write a review...Pros--With minimal care, they run (for me) 4 years nearly non stop...They are inexpensive...They STONGLY blow air...my model has three speeds. The low speed is fairly quiet and still moves plenty of air, nice for winter months...On high they move alot of air and are loud and block all noise. Good for condos or townhomes and for bad sleepers that need loud white noise to sleep...They are inexpensive to run. About 50 cents for 24 hours of use..they are light weight.. If I tilt it just right it will turn my ceiling fan that is 6ft away, slowly, but OMG for free....CONS----They must lean against something, like door way or wall..The stand is not strong enough to hold them up on high speed and short cord....I could not get through a summer without this product and A/C.......and three ceiling fans...and a fan on that hot a*s 52 inch plasma and smaller fans for windows------UPDATE-------I PURCHASED MY FANS YEARS AGO...I SAW THE FAN LASKO IS SELLING NOW AT MY LOCAL WALGREENS...SAME BOX, SAME STYLE  BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, SMALLER.

I thought that maybe I should get a window fan or two to get some of that air moving.  That's when I stumbled onto this 16" fan from Lasko.  I did as much research as I could and finally decided to make the purchase.  As it turned out, it was one of my better decisions!

This is large enough to supply room for a nice roast. I do not like the ones with no handles so this is great!
5646	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this vacuum cleaner at the beginning of September on the basis of good reviews from Amazon purchasers. I planned to use it as a quick pick-up on my kitchen's tile floor (crumbs etc.). It has proved to be a great disappointment. The batteries don't hold a charge at all, so after less than 5 minutes you find yourself pushing around a vacuum that makes a low moaning sound & picks up nothing. There's $60 down the drain.  My advice to would-be purchasers: caveat emptor, & hold on to the packaging so you can return it if your experience is like mine
I'd definitely buy another one of these in a heartbeat. It's the closest you can get to buying a whole house fan without having to cut a hole in your roof!
3979	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great little vacuum. Have had 2. No rotating brush so it picks up everything w/out beating up a carpet. A definite recommendation.
5262	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This product worked fairly well for about 2 to 3 weeks.  All of a sudden, I can't seem to get a full charge now. After being on the charger for days, when I turn on the Eureka, it sounds like it is dying.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

If discolored aluminum bothers you, get the stainless steel variety. Or wash it in a slightly acidic mix (lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda, etc). Don't cook acidic food in it while discolored though of the pot will be shiny and the food will become dingy.

281	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great for the fridge. Makes a boring appliance a great drinking past time.
2626	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This was my first pressure cooker.  I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the "jiggler valve" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.
One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.

1743	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I read a lot of reviews on rockwell, Dremmel and Fien... I bought the Rockwell as a more durrable but less expensive solution for my occassional DIY needs.  If I were a pro I would consider a Fien.  I do not have great expectations for speed with the sonicraft...I have used this form of vibrating technology with other tools... none are very quick. But lets not set the bar to low.  The speed is reasonable and it is acceptable if it saves any time in excess of available alternatives.  I find the tool usefill for tight jobs or those jobs where considerable deomolition and rebuilding is relatively greater than the actual outcome deserves.  Others I know who own ths tool think it does a great job on grout and tile work.  This blade is most usefull for some cuts, especially if the straighter blades won't reach the job properly. I have several of each in my tool kit and use what is most appropriate.

3663	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker.  However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!
This unit has very good vacuum pull and uses the same MM bags (readily available) as the older units.  It's light enough to carry or pull around and has all the accessories you need for typical cleaning jobs.  The paper bag does a good job of capturing dust and dog hair and has a large capacity for a machine this size.  As with most vacuums, it is noisy.  If you need 100% filtering, there is a HEPA version of this vacuum.
Update: I've been meaning to update this for about a year now, and am just getting around to it.  After one year of ownership and using it approximately 2 times per week for about 5 minutes each usage, the batteries on this thing are dead, they won't hold a charge, they won't even charge enough to provide any semblance of proper vacuuming.  I would NOT buy this again, in fact, if it weren't well past the time, I would return it.

6127	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	We have owned an older version of the mighty mite for over 10 years. It was starting to have issues from use so I decided I liked the original might mite so much to buy a new one. The head on this might mite is a bit different. You have to push a piece down to raise it up so it glides easily over the floor. Its a feature I always forget about and have issues when I first start to vacuum. The head is a lot bigger than the last but I am not sure more efficient. It makes it harder to get into some areas the old one fit perfectly.
I gave away my little Shark vacuum after getting the Mighty Mite. Shark makes good vacuums but that particular one was too small to be useful, and the Mighty Mite fills the bill.

1013	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Replaced a slightly larger roasting pan with vertical handles. Handles that drove me crazy when attempting to tent foil over it. It also was nonstick. Which some see as a selling point. After seeing a number of reviews for nonstick roasting complaining about flaking and my dislike of having to handle nonstick with kid gloves I decided on this one. It's cheaper elsewhere but it would have cost me more in terms of gas/shipping. Only concern is how well the hinge on the handles will last as they seem to be welded instead of riveted on. Overall it's construction is on the cheaper side of things but I don't foresee a problem with it's longevity (especially considering how often I use it).

On further looking at the fan, there is a sticker on the top, like it's been a floor model(?) someplace, and sort of this sticky stuff along the bottom edge of it that try as I might, I could not remove.  This all coupled with the fact that I ran it a good three hours with NO marked drop in temperature and clearly no air being pulled into the house via the six inch open windows well, folks, this puppy is getting itself returned and it's back to the whole house fan drawing board.  Too bad...I had such high hopes for it.

However, tight is a good thing, which is why we bought these over the eco-friendly metal containers. We value them not leaking EVER no matter what they are put through.

6178	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like this vacuum and am glad I purchased it.  The price was good and for hard floors it it easy to use and is quite powerful.  One complaint that I do have is that because of the bend in the hose handle sometimes clogs occur if you accidentally vacuum up something like paper or large pieces of something.  It is hard to clear it but the suction hole in the handle helps enable you to "fish out" whatever is in there.  I wish that the handle was not bent.  It may make it easy to hold but the tendency for clogging is greatly increased.  Other than that I have no complaints.  You cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright I have owned.  For the carpet in my bedrooms I do use an upright for so I would not suggest using this for plush carpet. However it does work well on area rugs and low pile carpets.
5125	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I use these for my Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum.  They're pretty standard/easy to replace.  I've been told they're a little small for  vacuum cleaner bag, but I've had no problems.
The aluminum used is soft and scratches and stains easily and is not hardened i.e anodized.  I wish it was but the cost would go higher too.  But the manual gives a way to remove stains.  Have not tried it as the light stains don't bother me.  I also did NOT detect any aluminum taste with dishes that contain acidic ingredients.  A well-known site tested for aluminum and said it leeches .0025 of aluminum, but said when you take an antacid, one tablet contains 250 mg of aluminum!  Drinking from soda cans can give you 1 or 2 mg of it.

The fact that it's got a horizontal handle is also nice; for me, the grip is a good size and I prefer the mashing motion that is possible with the horizontal handle to the motion of any of the vertical mashers with the S-shaped wire bases.
With that said, I love them and love leaving my husband messages.  We've had quite a bit of fun with them.

Still loud as hell - let's not deny it, on all settings.  I love it. 5/5
I am quite happy with the heater.  I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.  The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.  It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.  It is very nice to have a remote so I'm not jumping up and down to change the settings.  I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given.  I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.
9958	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Nicely designed, good safety guard.  Best stored on a magnetic bar, too large for many drawers.  The one I received is dull, alas, won't cut a thing.  Bought because of  Cook's Illustrated praise.  I see others have had this problem, so back this goes and I'll use a knife again, or try scissors.

The suction power on this vac is awesome.  It picks up dirt, lint, and dust with no problem.  I have not found the length of the cord to be a problem.  For a larger home, you will probably have to switch electric outlets.
6720	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The brackets I received were made well but I had to shim the upright pieces C to keep them from wobbling in the bracket. I also cut the pieces marked A, which I also had to shim, about 18 inches longer to give the wood rack more stability. The lumber I used was a cheap grade of 2x4 not pressure treated which accounts for the shimming.  Personally I'd rather have the slots in the bracket this size than too small.
1288	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	It worked for few days and then stopped working. It works intermittently and the seller was nice and was agreable to replace it or refund the money.

2797	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The size and actual material of the pot are decent. My main issue with this pressure cooker is that it leaks steam and the pressure cooker does not whistle as it should. As this can be dangerous, I will be returning the pressure cooker.  The lid was also hard to close. I think the elastic inside the lid either does not fit properly which could be the reason why it is leaking steam/water.

The freezer itself looks great and has the nice smell of wood. The pieces look sturdy. It suggests in the book to check those screws and tighten every once in a while when they work loose. They are not supposed to be sunk flush because the flappers need to move. You can tell that the screws are not threaded all the way to the top. I would suggest that if you see any threading to then screw it in a little.

2368	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Already owned the 8qt one, but wanted a 4qt one also. It's extremely important that you read all instructions  Pressure cookers operate at 15lbs pressure (250+ degrees F). You really don't want to come in contact with this stuff. Operated properly these are great cookers.
I use the large grater side and rarely take it apart because it balances so well. I use it to grate onions, cucumbers, radishes, pickles, and whatever else I need in relatively small amounts. I especially like grating onions on it because I often need only a TBS or so and am not going to use my food processor for that amount. I grate until I have the amount I need, then wash the grater and am done!
4865	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I live in an apartment and it gets super hot sometimes.

I have no complaints about these, I will probably get another for the living room when it gets warmer outside.

On/Off Brushroll Switch
What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the "low" settings, but when you set it on "high," it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.
3566	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A very nice pressure cooker. The screws that attach the handles to the main body get rusty after a bit, but you can get replacements somewhere.

This leaves these to choose from:
2545	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works very well.  It builds steam/pressure in very short time hence cooking time reduces significantly. Cleaning it is relatively easier as compared to Aluminum one from same brand, Presto. I love to cook in it!
The ability to close the window while the fan is on, and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan.

7346	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	These good grips kitchen tools are well made for the money. This grater is great for hard cheeses. The rubberized handle has a very professional feel.
The smallest spatula is small enough and pliable enough to fit into the inside curves of jars.  The larger spatula is a perfect mix of size, pliability at the tip and sides, and sturdiness for heft, thick frostings, potato salads and such.  The spoonula has a nice curved, bowl shape for scooping.
334	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my new apartment to jazz up my fridge. I bought this in addition to some of the other sets to add some words. I would suggest this for a gift for someone for sure or your own fridge!

1. Amazing suction power

4126	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I like the size as it is larger than the 24 gallon container.  This is definitely not something to easily move around when it is full.  It is best as a storage container in a trunk or bed of a truck.  The lid is well constructed, however, I don't think I would sit on it.
6839	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.
If you already know you want a pressure cooker but are trying to decide what type to get, I would say that I don't mind the simplicity of this cooker. Normally the justification to get a product that is the "latest and greatest" is that you are certain it will get a lot of use so you might as well spend the extra money for extra features that possibly save you time. This basic model is fine for weekly use in my household. I am definitely curious about newer types of cookers, but personally wasn't ready to pay more money for something I wasn't sure I would need.

1238	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel, isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender, there are better choices.
9840	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have the 3" (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OXO-Good-Grips-3-Inch-Mini-Strainer/dp/B001713L84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OXO Good Grips 3-Inch Mini Strainer</a>), 6" and 8" strainers in this design.  The 3" is extremely small so personally I would recommend buying only the 6 & 8" sizes unless you have something in particular you would use the 3" strainer for.  Overall these strainers are very sturdy, the handle is solidly fixed to the strainer, and the mesh is very rigid and keeps it's shape well (you can't poke it and make it deform).  The holes are very small which allows you to strain almost anything without losing part of what you're straining.  These may be a bit more expensive than your average strainer but the quality makes them worth the extra money and I'm confident they will hold up for a long long time.

8084	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Awesome peeler! To think how much time I wasted peeling potatoes with my cheap Wal-Mart one. Huge time saver but super sharp and I've  cut myself twice on it. So be careful.
I bought this as an alternative to a safe, although not exactly to keep valuables in it. I use it to keep important documents, photos, an autographed book that is only valuable to me, etc. and so I don't have to worry about those things getting damaged in case of leaks, mild flooding (although I live on a 9th floor), and to keep those things organized and in one place. The 8-gallon box is perfect for my needs and I love that I can put locks on it so that I'm the only one with access to what's inside. In my case the chances of the box being stolen are slim to none, which is what makes it a perfect alternative to a heavy safe.

After trying some of the 'cheaper' models, I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream, and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up, and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!

I also ordered the "Telling Time with the Judy Clock" workbook. The little booklet that comes with the Judy clock has a lot of the same pages as the workbook, but it's a lot smaller.

Note:  The zester renders thin "strips" of lemon rather than "grated" lemon zest which is what most recipes call for.  I just chopped up the strips to make it what I needed it to be.  Use a cheese grater for grated lemon zest.

"Cleanin' Out My Closet" is one of the most heartbreaking songs I've ever listened to. You can hear Eminem's anguish in the line to his mother "I never meant to hurt you." "Halie's Song" is surprisingly tender, a great song that still has the artist's distinctive stamp. "White America" makes for biting social commentary, and the often-played "Without Me" is hilarious. Eminem has constructed a diverse CD that is never boring.  Buy it - you won't regret it.

6864	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This fan was... sort of acceptable? I'm a student in New York and I lived on the sixth floor of a pre-war dorm building, where it got so hot that sitting in the room was unbearable without a fan. I bought this fan to help cool down, but it honestly did little to nothing to cool my little shoebox of a room. I suppose I can't blame a $20 fan for being weak, but I will say that after only about a month of use (two weeks in the beginning of September, and two weeks in May), one of the blades just fell off. I have no idea what happened, it just dropped off as if someone had sliced it off with a knife. I unscrewed the whole casing and managed to reattach the blade with crazy glue and copious amounts of tape, but I have to say it's a pretty shoddy fan if you have to McGyver it after only a few weeks of use. I'll give it two stars because perhaps the blade thing was a fluke. All in all, it doesn't cool very effectively and it broke very quickly; perhaps invest in something a little bit more durable.
- It is large. I mean really big. But I'll cut it slack on this one, as it needs to be big.

Everything was evenly cooked with lots of liquid still in the pot when opening. It did not take long for the pressure to build up or come down once you take it off the burner.

I still love this vacuum a lot but one of the batteries never would hold a charge. I disregarded it since the other battery was more than enough to vacuum our fist floor. When we refinished our hardwoods on our second floor I definitely needed that second battery to hold a charge to finish the whole house. When I contacted Eureka about the problem with the second battery never charging, they were kind enough to send me a replacement battery. I was so amazed at the great customer service provided by them I had to give them another 5 star updated review on here. After almost two years with this vacuum is it by far the best little sweep vac I've owned. I would totally recommend this.

2420	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I live in LA and summer can get to the low 100s. In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s.  So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air, at night and early morning. I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house.  The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan.  So at night, I turn this on and vent out the hot indoor air, and it creates a negative pressure in the house so it sucks air through my front door and windows of the other bedrooms. It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.  I have not turned on my Air Conditioner since I installed this.

Even with 100 pounds of feed in the container, it is easy for either me or my wife to move.  The twist locking base also prevents the container from tipping or falling off the dolly.  The dolly is also wide enough with the 5 wheels to be very stable even with a full can of feed.  It works so well, we're going to get a second container and dolly for dog food.

Because the oil is more expensive than the turkey, I limited the experience to special occasions. The Eastman pump is so easy to use and filters so thoroughly, I can reuse the oil many times over and use my deep fryer more often.  This tool is really an essential item for people who like to deep fry their turkey or chickens outdoors.  It doesn't require a lot of time and it eliminates the messy disposal of oil.  Needless to say, it will pay for itself in 2-3 uses, as peanut oil can cost up to twenty dollars for a five gallon container.  Replacement filters are easily obtained at [an online source].

Why 4 stars instead of 5? The Presto cookers are no long made in America. This is a sad thing.
On the negative side, as others have noted, it would be easier to use if the cutting portion was straight instead of curved.  Also, I really can't understand the intended use for this coarseness.  Be aware that it is not a very fine grate, such as for zest, although it can be used for that.  And it is not coarse enough to grate a large amount of cheese such cheddar for topping a dish, although it can be used for that if you have long enough to waste doing it.  The grated cheese comes out about the size you usually see at a salad bar.  I guess as a middle of the range, perfect for nothing, but usable for everything grater, it does its job.

414	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	When I ordered this, I fully expected it would get three or four stars. That is the way most follow-up albums go. The first was best. The second was great (and awfully popular). Not much hope for the third, but it is a surprise. Yes, Marshall has grown up. His lyric roll, like, non-stop (mix of Dr. Dre and David Lee Roth). The album is full at 77 minutes. Much pain shows, more so than anger of the first two albums. Actually sounds like he will make a good dad. Be fore-warned, "Drips" is probably one of the most sexually explicit songs on the charts (and probably one of the worst on the album, unfortunately).  I really like "Sing for the Moment", "Hailee's Song" and "When the Music Stops". Much like David Bowie and Elton John, there is more there than you hear at first.

4199	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased several of these in various sizes while on an extended "deal of the day".... Unfortunately several of these arrived with "bent" edges along the top edge of the container that the lid goes on.... As a result the tops do not set / sit properly. I am disappointed with this purchase and also disappointed that the product was shipped in that condition. Since there was no damage to the shipping containers I can safely assume that this was a manufacturing defect - so the quality control by rubbermade and also the Amazon team that allowed it to ship are lacking. So... I'm not pleased, but can't be bothered trying to make a return.... Just "live and learn".....

UPDATE: It's October 9th 2017, and I'm still using it with no problems, burn the bottom several more times, did a lot of canning, countless more stews and soups. the good thing about these reviews is you get to see your own true-world product test and I have to say - good job Presto!  I kindda wish I splurged for the larger canning model, I can only do two 22oz-ish masons at a time in my current model, which isn't a true canner anyway but now - I think I'm ready!

The power of the motor is about 1300 Watts, but I very seriously doubt that even half of that power works to clean dirt. Air leaks are really bad: hose to canister connection, hose to tube connection, tube interconnection, tube to brush connection.

That is what I tend to use.  You do have a higher Pie drop ratio with a fork and a butter knife or spatula but it won't matter unless you're in a social setting where a "Pie Server" utensil is deemed absolutely necessary.

4516	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased a previous model and it was amazing. It only came with one battery but it held enough charge to do most of my tile floor house. It picked up dog hair from the floor and stubborn fuzzies off of my the area rugs and the fabric couch. The only minor drawback was having to empty the dust cup after each use. That is easy enough to do so I LOVED this vac. It  outperformed many other expensive tools I bought to clean my floors. The charger is defective on the new model. Two batteries that don't charge equals 0 batteries. It charges one in twenty times so it's worthless.
You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.

5960	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This was my first canister vacuum, I love the concept and it can get in corners like a regular stand up vacuum can't.  However, this product had many flaws.  The attachments kept coming apart with normal use (I used it twice), the hose and tube came apart, the tube and the floor attachment came apart.  Also there is an air flow control that is right where you hold the vacuum so I was inadvertently opening it and the vacuum wouldn't work as well.  It is now boxed up, ready to return.

3463	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Strong words for a pressure cooker, I know, but this thing has been such a disappointment.  I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years.  I'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what.  This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap.  The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly.  The pressure hole doesn't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds.  If you are looking for a solid, reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking!  This is not the one!

Not only have I been using this pizza wheel to slice homemade pizza (yum!) but it's also great for slicing cheesecakes, flans, quesadillas, etc. - anything that needs a steady hand and a sharp edge for cutting a straight line. The grip is comfortable and the blade stays sharp with really minimal maintenance (it rinses clean quickly and hasn't needed to be sharpened even once). The only thing I'd change is I'd make the guard between the blade and the grip bigger and closer to the blade to protect your hand while slicing. Other than that, this is a perfectly-made product that I'd gladly buy again and again. Luckily, I think this is the last pizza cutter I'll ever need!

Best choice I've made. The arrival was within a few days. The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals. We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast, chicken with veggies, and a hard to cook oxtail stew. There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use. I did it without my husband my assistance. (he's better with gagets). I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals.
Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its injury-free, elegant, stylized, standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar.

But if you are looking for tiny little containers, they're great. I use them for tons of things--for travel-size amounts of cosmetics and toiletries when travelling, for pills/medication, for small pieces of jewelry (especially when travelling), and for salad dressings and such in my lunch boxes. As others have noted, the lids are a bit of a challenge to get on in the beginning, but I find that as I have broken them in, they get easier and easier to close, and they provide a REALLY tight seal--no need to worry about stuff spilling out everywhere. The difficulty in closing them in the beginning is really the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5--it seems to me like this is a fixable problem, and it is a bit of a nuisance. Overall I really love them, though.

On the plus side, the vacuum is light and easily portable from indoors to the garage to clean the car.  The suction is impressive for its size.  The crevice tool and combination dust brush/upholstery tool are functional.  The two extension wands provide a long reach.  Those who complain of the pieces coming uncoupled easily are probably not twisting them together.  The wands and attachments are joined by tension fits, and you have to twist slightly while pushing them together.  I do this and haven't experienced any issues.

My mom used the old fashioned kind while I was growing up, the kind without the newer safety feature of the handle interlock that keeps you from opening the cooker before the pressure drops. The jiggler on top is different now, it only allows 15 pounds of pressure rather than the 3 settings mom could use, but it's doing the job. I've done pork chops, beef barley soup, Greek stifado, venison stew, and others in the first couple weeks I've owned this and the time it saves is awesome. I no longer have to start meat cooking at 1 pm for dinner at 5.

It's stainless steel and not coated with anything icky that is likely to come off in your food.  I like the weight and feel of this product and it cleaned up in the dishwasher like a breeze.

I had an OXO spreader for years and am just about to order another one.  All their small cutlery (they used to sell a mini knfe block set) is great, and the spreader is no exception.
- The handle curves in a way that it catches any dripping liquid, I've hurt myself once when I wasn't careful at opening the cover.
Also keep in mind, the non-stick coating on the Simply Calphalon line is not as thick as the Commercial, Professional II, and One non-stick lines.  So it will wear out in four or five years with regular use.  But all non-stick, no matter how expensive, does wear out in about 10 years and since this pan is a fifth the cost of some of the others, you can just replace it when it's time comes.

Update #3 - After posting several nasty comments on their Facebook page - I got to the head of the line and was able to talk to a real person.  Waiting to see if they will replace the unit now. So, in the meantime, I've bought a new fan to replace the one they wouldn't.
2811	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great value. There were other pressure cookers that cost more. This one does everything needed. The advantage of pressure cooking is flavors infuse and ingredients break down much more quickly than traditional methods. I made bone broth in 3 hours instead of overnight. I made chili in an hour that tasted like it had simmered for much longer. I admit I didn't like that I had to assemble the handles where a mistake could be dangerous. But I had no problems. The pressure indicator got stuck the first time, but I tapped it with a knife tip as instructed and the next time it worked without intervention.

After marrying we bought an electric can opener which broke soon thereafter. While waiting for the day when it was to be repaired (which ended up being never), I bought this OXO manual can opener thinking it would be a temporary and inexpensive solution. It is awesome. We have been using ours for about 5 years and it is still going strong. It is fast, easy to use, and comfortable. There is no pain or discomfort when holding it. It cuts the can cleanly and is just plain easier to use than electric can openers. We are sticking with the OXO can opener and not going back to electric openers.

I didn't give this little guy 5 stars because it doesn't have an automatic cord rewind. I've been spoiled by my other vacs which had them. The cord is much longer than the one on the Bosch I just got rid of. It's long enough to enable me to do two rooms, however, it's cumbersome to wrap underneath the vacuum when done. That's the ONLY fault I have with this unit.

What with the cooking, this filter and, for esthetics, the inside grill are also removed & cleaned in the bath tub 3 or 4 times a year. The grills are a pain as soaps are only partly effective & brushes don't quite serve for the tiny grill opening.

Understand this Bissell is a hard floor expert so if someone tries to bash it because it does not have a beater brush for carpeting understand why. This brush head depends on the vacuuming air pressure to make the brush head spin. On a non-resistant slick shiny floor it works great, but it would get snagged on plush carpet. So a separate vacuum cleaner designed for that purpose is advisable if you want to beat/brush the deep dirt out of carpeting. The carpet head on the BMC is a passive vacuum head only.
The color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is "pink" isn't even as accurate as saying that "aquamarine" is "green" or "blue."  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table.

There are three tools in the packages. The largest is, as mentioned above, a larger and heavier scraper that works very well as a mixing spoon.

9136	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this to replace a box grater that was taking up too much space.  The best features of this are that it can fold into a small form factor, and you can take it apart to clean it.  There is also a rubber grip at the bottom to prevent it from sliding, which is nice.
One word of caution though!!!...  When cooking with this, make sure after you hear it whistle, turn down your heat to a low medium to a medium!!!..  All you want is a soft whistle.  It's compared to having a roll boil and a boiling water; it's just a waste of energy. Violent whistling means, too much pressure is building up, not good coz, the food can only take a certain pressure to still be recognizable, and the pot can only take so much pressure.  I've heard form a couple of users who neglected this "alarm", actually had their "tops" blow up.  A couple of users also reported, they actually got burned by the steam.  Also, if you have to move the pot while is hot and still whistling, do it carefully, make sure it level and place it down carefully or the pressure might burst the top off.  But, don't let this scare you!!!  Like any other tools, you have to know how to use them properly.  A knife should be used with care.  A pressure cooker!!!  A LOT of care and common sense.

The finish is super polished, Looks like stainless steel not aluminum. add photo does not do it justice.
With two dogs, we needed a decent machine. This isn't that machine by any stretch.  Pet attachments, they say? Why have an attachment when the silly thing can't pick up the hair dependably.
5109	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I'm not a vaccuum cleaner expert so I'm not sure what real choices I have in the bag area. I know some people believe any vaccuum that uses a bag is inferior. I personally like vaccuum cleaners WITH bags. But I'm not crazy about this particular bag. Most that I've used before have a little rubber gasket around the hole to sort of seal the opening. This one does not have that and even though I haven't noticed a huge amount of dust inside the cover of the machine, I don't feel like the bag is containing everything it should without a seal on the opening. Since I'm not an engineer I don't know the science involved. Maybe the rubber is there just to make gullible consumers like me think it's sealed. Either way, I prefer a bag with a seal. The bag itself seems otherwise well made and the seams on the ends are well-sealed. The paper is several layers thick and seems to have some kind of treatment or coating to keep the dust inside. Add a rubber gasket to the opening and I'll raise my rating.

I especially like how the cover and pan lock with a very satisfying click that you can feel thru the handle as you position the lid to close. Using this pressure cooker is easy and it cleans up very well. I did some research before buying this model as I wanted a stainless steel cooker and not aluminum. This cooker came in at the bare minimum I had set for spec's vs. price and has exceeded my expectations as of this date.
Anyway, I realized that there was a belt in the vacuum that had stopped doing the belt thing between the fusion reactor and the mach 5 brushes that would pulverize dirt unless it surrendered peacefully.

5187	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	CHEAPLY MADE! I bought this vac based on reviews on Amazon and Walmart. SORRY I DID! All parts are of cheap plastic components. I work harder with this vac than I do with a Swiffer Sweeper. Can't keep the hose in position and wand in position. Wand constantly disconnects from floor part. The 2 in 1 brush drape tool is designed poorly.  Manually having to wind the power cord is a pain, especially having to do underneath unit.  Would not recommend this unit to the elderly.

5180	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum is perfect for my needs. I don't have pets, and my children are grown, so we're talking human hair and basic grime here.  It is lightweight, has a lot of suction, does a great job on my small bedroom wall-to-wall carpeting as well as area rugs elsewhere.  Will still use Swiffer dry mops on my wood floor from time to time; the "floor" setting does a great job getting up bits of dust and grit that the Swiffer sometimes misses.  I don't like scraping the gunk off the dust cup filter - ever so gently - but that's a small thing. Don't shake it, as the instructions say, unless you are fond of inhaling dust and want another mess to clean up.  Dust gets in the air even when shaking it out inside a large garbage bag.  So far, the charge holds long enough for me to do the rugs, the wood floor and the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom - but my apartment is fairly small.  The controls work easily, and I love being able to turn it into a hand-held tool.  I agree with other reviewers that the handle could be longer.  I'm 5'5" and have to bend a little, but it's not that uncomfortable.  A very minor complaint.  A good buy, I'd say.

I've only owned it for approximately 10 months and already BOTH batteries are good for absolutely nothing. I usually dust/dry mop my floors and then use the vacuum instead of a dust pan & broom for pickup. That's all I get out of it now is enough power to pick up a small pile of dust and dirt and the battery dies.  What a let down.

The treatments I hung were very light, but I bought the center support piece and while I didn't try it without, I am sure it's as necessary as they say for my long runs. This system was VERY easy to install, but you do have to provide your own screws. You'd want to anyway to match them to the material to which you are mounting. For me that was wood, so it was easy. I was skeptical trusting IKEA (yeah, I have or have had some of their furniture) with the tensioning mechanism, but it is really solid and very easy to use. Make sure you have good wire snips and as the pictographs in the directions imply, don't try and use scissors to cut the wire as the cut end will need to be inserted into a whole that is just the right size and if you mess the cut up it will be VERY hard to insert. My first cut was with some cheap snips and I had to make another cut with better snips that cut more clean.

This vac is much improved over my previous one, and the extra battery definitely comes in handy.  Broke my ankle a few months ago and couldn't use a regular vacuum until just a few weeks ago.  I have two medium to large size dogs that shed like crazy.  Normally I vacuum my family room and kitchen with a full size vacuum cleaner every day because I can't stand the dog hair.  This cordless vac works great on the dog hair and anything else that gets on the carpet or floor.  I've been quite shocked at how much dog hair is in the dust cup when I go to empty it after every use.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
How does this compare to the Eureka 370G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum, the one I had purchased earlier and is the number one seller here at Amazon? No comparison. This Bissel Hard Floor Expert Multi-Cyclonic Bagless Canister Vacuum, 1547 hereinafter referred to as the BMC has just that, a cyclonic dirt collector whereas the Eureka has on the other hand an ongoing bag replacement requirement. You can easily see when the BMC is filling up with its transparent removable canister, but the Eureka you have to guess; as in when it stops picking up dirt you have to disassemble the filter portion and give it a poke in order to see if it is full.

4678	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Like the title says, I found this pressure cooker to be just perfect. I have a 4 qt and a 8 qt one, they are both presto, same model, and I could not say one single bad thing about these cookers. Definitively worth the money. Also, you can use them as normal cookers, and they are almost less expensive than good quality normal cookers.
We're converting toward pressure cooking (it uses a lot less electricity cooking due to the faster cooking times on lower heat) because you can take inferior products and make gourmet-tasting meals.
The steamvac is light and easy to carry around, even when full of water.  It has an easy-access fill port on top for putting in the cleaning solution and hot water (which I heated in a glass pitcher in my microwave).  There is an auto shutoff feature when the separate recovery tank (which holds the used water) gets full, and a spout on the side through which you empty out the dirty water.  When I dumped out the recovery tank I was astonished at how much dirt had been in my carpet, even though I'd vacuumed thoroughly before using the steamvac!

I highly recommend trying to find one "used" (Amazon Warehouse Deals) as I did-- get even more of a deal on one with a couple scuffs-- the way these things are built, they're designed to get quite a lot of abuse and hold up.

I was not disappointed with this OXO peeler. It is exceptionally good as a fruit peeler. It peels off a thin layer, including just the skin and not much beyond it. The cutting edge is also extremely high quality, to the point that the fruit surface after being peeled looks smooth like a pearl. It's easy to peel an apple in one continuous loop with this peeler because it's so well made. I hope that OXO continue to make this peeler so that I can buy more in case this one gets dull or gets lost. On additional though, I think I need a spare...

We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer "service" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).
I bought this to clean the cars. It works for that purpose. However, I wouldn't recommend it for use inside the house due to the noise. I would also be concerned with using it for extended periods of time due to the heat it generates.
  All in all a great buy for $50.

Main complaint:  The section where the plastic part of the hose goes into the metal extension rod can easily come undone during use.  I would consider gluing these together if not for the fact that I don't always use the metal extension rod.  I wish this were a tighter fit...maybe some dots of silicone / rubber or something could help.

One burnt out because the person using it was trying to save on bags and repeatedly let it get too full.  Another one lost a wheel, but it is so light it is easy to carry. Most of all the light weight makes it so that I am never reluctant to take it out and use it as I might be with a heavier vacuum.  It has a surprising amount of power, but I am not sure you would want it as your only vacuum for rugs. It is certainly not the vacuum you would buy for extensive wall-to-wall carpeting.  The previous ones I've owned have lasted for very many years.

This is not a canner. You could (and I have) use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars. I have used it as a canner for about 4-5 pints. The instructions do not say this is a canner, and you probably should know what you're doing if you plan to can with this. It takes about the same amount of time whether you can in this or in the giant cooker, so why not do a large load, I say.

Certainly this vacuum has plenty of power and suction for the size and the price.  That is not the issue.  What is so disappointing is that the product itself is so overly flimsy.  The wand is multi-piece for easy breakdown but the plastic is so thin that there is an overall sense of weakness when maneuvering the wand even on a smooth tile floor.  When vacuuming carpet or rugs, the weakness really becomes apparent and if you are using all the pieces of the wand for its full length, there is so much flex that there is no sense of control.  If you have fine furniture, be especially careful when vacuuming around it.

Finally, in desperation, decided to try a new American made Presto since they were now made of Stainless steel and had good ratings with Amazon. Got one on sale from Amazon with free shipping and received it lickety-split in great shape (thanks Amazon). Read the user's guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans. Wow! Such simplicity and everything worked great. Straight forward simplicity and as well engineered as one could ever expect and as a bonus, much easier to clean. Can't see what could possibly go wrong. One more thing that I was highly impressed with is the users guide for the Presto; it is super clear and easy to understand with nothing left to chance. Kudos to current American products for a now great cooker. If you like pressure cookers, give the Presto a try!!!

From my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.

3998	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This scrub was recommended to me by a facialist years and years ago. I used it for a long time, then had trouble finding it, and tried to find a decent substitute. But after finding it on Amazon, I'm back.  The facialist years ago told me to use it also on my elbows and upper arms to keep them smooth, which I do.  It really is a face and body scrub.  I know it seems odd to think of using the same product on your face that you use on tougher parts of your body, but I've been doing it for years with great results and no plan to switch.  Now, in the interest of full disclosure, another facialist told me that she thinks this product is a little tough for the face, which I told the first facialist, who said that it was fine for my skin because, while I'm fair, I don't have issues with sensitivity or really "thin" skin.  The granules are very fine, and there's little or no scent.  Plus, I think it's a decent price for a premium product. Basically, I'm a lifer, and I'm thinking about trying other MD Formulations products.

They hold a bunch of stuff, are stack able, and just the right size to not overload and make them too heavy.  Latches are quite sturdy, and offer a facility to lock, by using two padlocks.  However, they are getting harder to find.  It'll be a pity when they're no longer available.

I now take the gasket out each time I put it in the cabinet(after being washed and dried) and wet the gasket with water before put it back in the lid before cooking. The gasket lost some pliability but it keeps the pressure as it should. It may last forever.

2 - my personal pet peeve: that little rubber nob in the lid, opposite of the handle, that could easily be pushed out while cleaning and be lost in your drain/dishes in sink. or worse yet, not properly placed after cleaning and be the reason why your cooker has to be taken off the stove for cool-off period to make that little rubber nipple be repositioned properly ... ugh! - totally the ultimate design flaw.

6219	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	What I loved MOST about this product was actually how thoroughly they described it's dimensions.  Not just the overall... but the internal measurements (subtracting out the width of the rim).  I bought this little guy to hold woodchips inside a smoker instead of wasting foil by rewrapping wood chips each time we had to trade them out.  The spot for it in the pan is a curved rectangular divot, the edges of which were steep so if it didn't fit, the pan would tip.
I bought these containers to use as portable salt and pepper shakers.  My plan was to carry them back and forth between work and home (on public transportation) so I needed something that would be small, light, and unbreakable.

This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs.

3696	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is apparently a very basic pressure cooker, but it does a great job and is easy to use.  I bought a portion of a cow from a local farm, and the stew beef was so tough after being cooked in the crock pot that we couldn't eat it. I thought I was going to have to give the remaining packs to the dog, but I tried it in the pressure cooker, and this meat was fork tender after 20 minutes. That was enough to sell both my husband and me. I can't wait to dry brown rice and black beans in there! You can't beat the price.

This surge bar is rated to 1480 Joules. What does this mean? Well, it means that it can provide up to 1480 joules of power before it 'pops', or protects your electronics. That is equivalent to 1480 watt-seconds, or on 110-v AC, about 13.5 amps of current.  What does this mean to you, the user? Well, it means that it will 'break' the circuit if more power than 1480-watt-seconds are sent through the line (normally, because of a storm, or a car-wreck into your local utility poles, etc.) What it will not do, is protect your electronics from mildly varying voltage swings...those that may even be deadly to your electonics. Why? because most day-to-day power spikes come in the form of voltage swings above 125-volts. For desktops and direct-ac monitors, 130-volts is the executioner's axe for them...and if you only have 5-amps drawn through your surge bar, a swing from 120-v AC to 130-v AC is not enough to trip the protection features of the surge bar...keep in mind, until you demand more than 13-amps at 110-v,(or more than a sum of 1480 watts are used or supplied), this bar will not stop it.

9522	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The idea of paying more than $10 for a can opener took a while for me to wrap my head around.  Until one day I went to open a can.  I had 3 (yes, THREE) can openers and none of them worked.  They ranged in price from $5 - $8 each.  Finally I read reviews of this and closed my eyes and hit "add to cart".  It seems overdramatic to say a can opener has changed my life, but this thing is awesome.  It works the first time, every time.  It leaves a smooth cut and no jagged edges.  I've had it for about 5 months now and it works just as well as the day I got it.  It was a great feeling to throw my other 3 can openers away.  Those 3 cost more than this one, and I anticipate this one lasting longer than those did!  Welcome to adulthood, when you are excited about a can opener!
I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15, & is built just a solidly as the former.
the only slight drawback is the hose kinks sometimes. but the motor sound changes, so it's easy to know, when you need to jiggle the hose a bit, to get out the kink, which fortunately comes out easily.

If there is any downside it is that there is no place to put the attachments and extenders.

It does not come with a heating element, which means that one must put in hot hot tap water. Often, there is hot-water left over. One has to either dump the left-over detergent solution, or use it next time cold or luke warm. We've done both. And it does not seem to have made a major different in its effectiveness, though I feel that with hot water the cleaned spot dries up faster. I do have to regularly use bleach to clean up the interior of the machine (the hose, the filter, as well as the dirty water container), esp. in the summer time. I also ordered spare filters, as the filter gets yellow quickly (we do clean quite a bit of cat vomit). Overall, we are glad we have it.
We've also noticed the vacuum cleaner works much better when one uses a bag. :-)  Old socks just don't filter as well.

2806	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This works good just like my previous model but did not fit as a replacement  part.  Looks  sort of the same in the picture but is a different size and configuration and difficult to  tell from description and model #.  Ordered one to see if just the clear housing would fit the existing top.  No match. Since  I use several in a series  it was obvious that the whole setup would need change. After some  plumbing and piping adjustments, it is working just fine.  I'm happy with the system. It filters out much of the SoCal water "stuff" that the aquarium fish and humans don't like.

Here is the problem:  It is not the mixer, it is the container.  What changed in 3 years is, we finally replaced our old noisy dishwasher and instead of hand-washing the container as we'd done in the past 3 years, we put it in the new, quiet dishwasher.  THAT RUINED IT.  What happens is, the spinning blade mechanism seizes up.  Maybe there is something in there, a gasket or metal part, that cannot handle the high heat of a dishwasher.  It seizes up to the point where you can't freely spin it.  (Go to the store, check a new one; when you lift the container off, spin the bottom part from underneath, that also spins the blade.  It spins freely.  That's the way it is supposed to operate.)

Therefore, I am labeling this fan a total LEMON. I did everything possible to prevent damage occurring to them, like going to a enclosed room to hairspray my hair. The biggest complaint of all (the only one that I will mention now) is that you can't open the thing up and do minor surgery. Remember the old days when you could do that? I have a little fan from those days that still works! Today, they are probably made so that you have to buy a new motor every 5 years, AT A COST HIGHER THAN THE FAN ITSELF (inc. shipping.).

I rated the vac as a 4.  The crevice attachment was fine, but the combined brush and flat attachment was an odd configuration.

If you feel like maybe you can't put your understanding of telling time into words, don't worry! The little booklet that comes with the clock gives you step-by-step teaching sentences you can repeat to your child and even covers what 'quarter hour' means. The booklet is about 5x7 inches with some small coloring pages, a few short question worksheets and time telling challenges, etc. I started to use the booklet and got to the part about where I explain quarter hours (the clock is like a pizza and you can slice the time into 4 equal parts of 15 minutes each) and my son was hushing me up because he suddenly understood telling time and wanted to make the clock read the same time as our digital microwave clock. This was in the first five minutes of the thing being in his hands and he did it!

6614	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The belts I received were not the ones I thought I ordered.  I searched for belts to fit a model of self-propelled Hoover upright.  I made the unfortunate  assumption that Amazon's search engine would produce the proper belt.  When these popped up I ordered them.  It turns out that the belts are for a Hoover that is not self propelled.  As I was the one who made the mistake, I would have to pay shipping charges that amount to more than 50 percent of the purchase price of the items to return them.  So I didn't return them.  I'll just pick some up at my local Walmart and consider that this order was part of my education on the limits of trusting a website search engine.  Lesson learned.
I think its very poor quality and would recomend no one purchase.. THE VACUUM cleaner bags are fine.

With the brush bristles extended it works great for getting up crumbs and dirt from kitchen mats.  The adjustable air hole in the hose handle is great for reducing suction when needed.  I love the long hose for getting cobwebs off ceiling corners and cat hair from stair corners.  It has the right attachments also.  The two tools I must have, a crevice tool and a brush tool, are stored out of the way and yet are easily accessed.  Windup for the cord is convenient also.  Affordable, light, and efficient.  I only wish it was bagless.

I read the reviews that were mixed on whether it was good for carpets but trust Eureka as a good brand and decided to give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did.  It is so lightweight you can vacuum so quickly and easily in 1/10 of the time it would take to drag a heavy, corded vacuum around.  It picked up everything.  EVERYTHING.  Again, I have low pile carpet so I can't speak to it's other capabilities (except that it worked equally well on the linoleum in my dime-sized kitchen and bathroom) but for me, this is absolutely wonderful.

I would really appreciate a helpful hint
8180	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If you do a lot of zesting, then this is the zester for you. It has an extremely comfortable handle and makes great zest. It is sturdy and should last a long time. Great buy.
My plan is to use my old floor attachment with the new vacuum... and when this one dies someday, I guess I'll be shopping around and trying out a few different models.

2336	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window, but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house.

Unfortunately, I had to return the two I purchased from Amazon; the "like new" description was NOT accurate!!!  I purchased two from another site.

Small footnote: I did try ordering one from another good online store, but when that one arrived, the control knob fell off in shipment and wouldn't stay on.  Seemed cheaply made.  The one from amazon.com that arrive recently is intact and running smoothly, oddly with no vibration.
PRODUCT IS VERY WELL MADE AND SO STURDY; SUCH A WELCOME ADDITION TO MY KITCHEN;
3001	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Used my pressure cooker for the 1st time a couple weeks ago - made spaghetti sauce. It did a super job!! What normally takes all day in the crockpot and always tastes even better the next day, only took 2 hours (counting preparation time, pressure cooking, uncovered thickening time & cooling -- cooking time was only 10-12 minutes! -- less than 5 minutes to become pressurized, 8 minutes to cook). I was MORE than impressed! Can't wait to use it for its main purpose - to make bone broth.

Within a few uses, the handle became loose, because the screws that hold it on are too small. Every time I use the cooker, I tighten the handle. Next, the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape. So as the pot heats up, I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.
3126	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is very nice.  It makes the meat sooo tender. The less expensive cuts become tender. It seems to be a decent quality.  It certainly cuts down on cooking time.
6513	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	works as expected and for a great price.
2653	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love it

5145	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works well and arrived very fast. Still have the real old Mighty Mite from 1973 still running. This one has a bigger bag and all the cleaning tools to get the job done. Easy to pull along and can reach in tall places to get the cob webs down. Don't be fooled about the size. Seems much better and convenient then any of the uprights. Plus the longer reach for those high places.
1819	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Just like the ones in Lowes, but at a much better price.
603	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice product.  The design is minimalistic and it works very well.  I installed this above the tile backsplash of my utility sink in my garage.  The only thing that you should keep in mind is that since the mount supports the towel roll from one side only, it hangs a little to one side.  This is in spite of the fact that the support bracket is perfectly level.  If I had known this I might have slanted the support bracket and NOT made it level (so it would offset the weight of the towel roll).  However, only I notice that it is not level, I'm a perfectionist.

8992	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I like it!
1167	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Not for me. It's so small (of course) and it's really only good for nuts. It pulverizes other products. I returned it with no problem.
3353	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I had a fancy electric pressure cooker with a timer to turn off the cooking and a non stick interior but I returned it because I wanted a stainless steel cooker. So I found one just like my mother had of years ago. Presto has been making this model it seems for eons and it's very simple to operate and clean. Presto is a company that has been around for ages so, that is why I returned the other one.

3622	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker. It's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn't even sure if I would use it often, but the Presto has won me over. I use it multiple times each week - it's a fantastic convenience. Note that there is some minor assembly required.
2514	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation. I am really pleased with my purchase, this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you don't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in. It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and doesn't shake in the window like the older model does. I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend.

2458	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great little cooker.  We are glad we got it.  Be aware though that being aluminum, it will get a darkened stain to the inside when cooking items like potatoes.  It heats quickly, vents like a cooker should and works beautifully.
5861	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is  a good small vacume.  AIt gets it hard to rach places well and doesnt take too much storage space.  For a little vav it does a great job.
9839	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent, sturdy strainer with generous capacity. I actually own two of them. Pops in the dishwasher to clean. The handle is of a good size. If you have a hanging rack (I don't), you'll probably like the clip at the top.
The size is perfect for most household tasks...it fits over a large bowl or pyrex container. It is dishwasher safe.

I'm here to tell you how Eureka's Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum sucks up cat hair. It does a great job....I should know. They can't walk past me without dropping their hair. I was at my wits' end. I live in a small condo, no carpet and most vacuum cleaners just clogged up after a few minutes and I'd have to clear the filter. The Mighty Mite is fabulous, easy to move around and was a good price. I'm very happy with this purchase...Wish the cats would let me vacuum them, but they just run when I turn it on. I just have to be happy to vacuum the floor after they go by. It's easy to store and has a very long cord. All positive qualities.

2621	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Never tried pressure cooker before, by my goodness if I didn't know what I was missing.  Still solid today, cooks in 1/4 the time of what I used to have to do in hours the regular way.  Hubby likes lots of international foods/meats that just take time to cook, and often paced the kitchen as if I could do anything about the food cooking any faster.  A relative asked me to try this and what a pleasant surprise!

8524	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Super solid meat tenderizer. We like to use this to make chicken breasts a little bit more even for grilling so the thinner parts don't dry out before the thicker parts cook. This tool is perfect for that along with other things that require tenderization.

9838	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm not even sure what prompted me to buy this but I use it all the time so now I'm wondering how I got along without it.  I use it to wash rice and beans or anything else I want to strain the liquid from to make sauces.  Under the heading of too much information my garbage disposal recently died and my sink has always been slow draining so I've been using it to strain out the dredges from soaking pans.  It's disgusting but it helps keep the drain running.  Fairly easy clean up.

2137	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Good product for the dough.  A bit tricky to put together, tube to the water dispenser didn't fit right, but I rigged it up and it works fine.  No other alternative in this price range, I'm overall happy.
4018	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome storage box! I wasn't expecting the plastic to be as sturdy and hard as it is. A lot of storage containers have too much give to them and feel like they could dent in easily; this one is rigid and ready to take some hits. The locking handles on the side are awesome too and create a snug fit; they're not flimsy. The inside of the box is nice too. A lot of storage containers have bulges of plastic inside that take up space, sort of like the inside of a cooler, but this is completely open. Additionally, the lid has a groove in which you can install weather-proof stripping if you desire to make this container water and dust resistant. Perfect for fragile things inside your home or for throwing in the back of a pickup! Great all around!

There are detailed instructions for some of the techniques. I felt that some were explained very well, and a few were missing important details, but for the most part, I felt confident about being able to replicate some of the things in the book.

3222	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This was my first pressure cooker, and everything has been very easy to figure out and use.  The one aspect that I don't like very much is the odd pressure regulator on the top.  It just sits on top of the hole, using it's weight to keep the pressure in, and it vibrates when the pressure reaches 15 psi.  I feel like it makes it very easy to lose an essential piece of the cooker, and it could be done much better.  It stills works, but it just seems like something that was jury rigged into place.

Don't get me wrong, many of the pops are gorgeous and I will definitely be using some of the techniques, even the ones using fondant, but it is unlikely a beginner will be able to make these pops the first time.  Instead, buy Bakerella's book, which isn't perfect, but is better for beginners and has photos of the decorating elements, makes different shaped pops, talks about candy temperature and cake pop temperature.  It will at least give beginners a fighting change to make a recognizable pop the first time.
2736	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very nice quality. Great price!
I needed another fan, so I decided to buy another brand, to see if it was any better or quieter (see the link below of the bad fan).  The Holmes fan was bad in every way.  So I returned the Holmes and repurchased the Lasko...

If I don't give it a fifth star it is for the simple reason that I would prefer an all metal handle. I really don't understand the point of a plastic handle for a strainer...I have one with an attractive metal handle by another company (a pricey Euro brand I can't find any more of) and it never gets hot even when using it to strain pasta right out of the pot or other hot food.

1461	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love this simple silicone spatula set. I use it for everything, getting mayonnaise out of the jar, scooping ice cream out of my Teflon coated ice cream maker, stirring sauces in my ceramic nonstick pan, and scraping out the last bits of gravy or sauce when reheating a dish. The ones with the sharper corner on them are particularly handy because they can be used very well as a spatula, while the other one that just has rounded edges is more of a stirrer or shallow spoon, which I generally only use in cooking. I like silicone because it is stable at higher heats and so I don't have to worry about releasing toxic chemicals into my food or scratching my cookware. Though I received a sample for review, the opinions are my own.

If you pay attention to the hose and untwist it if it starts to kink  you won't have a problem and it will not create a permanent kink if you  do not store it inappropriately. Also, the accessory parts go on perfectly and if you add a little pressure then twist, they stay on and do not fall off. It has great suction and it reaches to high ceilings .

3229	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This pressure cooker works well, once you get used to it.  it takes a lot of heat to get the weight rocking, and then you need to figure out how low to turn down the heat to just keep it rocking gently, as there is no gauge.  The small hard rubber pressure relief valve can fall out a bit too easily, but that's fairly minor.  I like the fact that you cannot open the lid until the pressure inside is safe to do so.
3734	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything. I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins, pot roast in 50 mins, veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.
Overall I find this vacuum an suitable replacement for a stick vacuum.  I bought this on sale from Amazon.  If you and your animals do not mind the noise you will like this vacuum.

1112	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Can't say enough good things about this mini-processor. I bought this one as an exact replacement for the same on I'd had for some years (inherited from my ex-wife) that I dropped or otherwise damaged. It's compact, simple to use, and the blades are so sharp they could cut fine silk (as Cuisinart warns you repeatedly; you really need to be careful removing and washing the blade fixture). The processor has very good safety features: you can't turn it on unless everything is clicked into place, including the lid. Two small holes in the lid allow you to slowly drizzle in liquid such as olive oil, making it the perfect item to make killer Caesar salad dressing.

2267	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We used this window fan for the first time last spring, through the fall.  I have never seen a window fan this powerful in 40 years.  The most wonderful thing is when this fan pulls in the cool night air into our bedroom.  When we are sleeping. And in the morning we wake to coolfresh morning air.  When you have the fan in a window in one room, and you crack the window open in another room.  This fan causes a nice flow of air thought the first or second floor of our house.  This Dan has also cut down on our air conditioner use substantially.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RHIS PRODUCT.

1074	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Makes short work of mincing an onion (once you've cut it up into smaller pieces.)  Perfect for chopping and mincing small amounts (such as one onion, garlic cloves, berries, etc.)  It is good for making mayonnaise (recipe included.)  It's rather easy to assemble and learn how to use, but you MUST read the instruction manual very carefully because the blade should go on a certain way depending on what you want to chop.  The blade is VERY sharp, extreme care must be taken, especially when washing by hand (recommend since the dishwasher would ruin the blade eventually.).  The motor is very strong.  I love this thing a lot.
I bought this to replace my nut milk bag (too difficult to clean well) and cheesecloth (not reusable.)  It is an ideal size and easy to clean.  Because it is stainless steel, after a good rinse under the faucet, it can be placed in the dishwasher.
2571	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a very good quality pressure cooker. I am glad I paid extra for stainless steel. Maintains pressure for quite some time after turning the heat off
2297	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have had many pressure cookers over the years.  My mom used to cook with them when I was a kid and they are awesome.  this is no exception at all.  Works perfectly!
5386	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I was disappointed that there is not an on/off switch on the top of the handle. You have to bend over to turn it on and off. The suction is not that good and it goes not glide very smoothly. It is a good think it comes with a backup battery because it takes both to do a light cleaning over a 2000 sq. ft. house. I guess you get what you pay for and I will probably be buying a better one soon.

1103	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We love it! Mini is larger than other mini processors, which is a plus!
4224	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have found this cooker is very simple to operate, just crank the lid on, pop on the weight, and heat it.  As soon as the weight starts bobbling around and hissing, it's quite obvious it's pressure cooking so I turn down the heat.  Quiet it's not, but that's OK because I have a tendency to forget things so I like knowing it's doing it's job when it's doing it.  I also have a different Presto pressure canner I got used off of Craigslist and even though it was old and the rubber was shot, it was cheap and easy to get all the parts I needed.  Since the rubber seals wear out in a few years, I like that this company makes replacement parts immediately available, cheap, and ships them fast.  Support for legacy products leads me to believe Presto cares about it's customers for the long haul.  I got the glass lid option so I can use it as an ordinary saucepan too.  The glass lid is just as good as the one I have for my LeCrueset pot.  The base of the Pressure Cooker is thick and solid enough to dissipate heat wall.  The stainless cleans up well and there aren't any hidden steamways which get clogged so that's great for me.
I use them for everything.  I've stopped using those chip clips which slide off, and you also have to fiddle with them to get them on.  Someone mentioned Binder Clips...yes, but they are harder to get on and off, ugly, and very tight; sometimes you want a clip that holds things together well but doesn't crush them---this is hard to explain, but I'll just say that I find the amount of tension on the OXO Clips ideal.

5279	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We borrowed it once from a friend for our apartment. The results were great! This vacuum will clean the dirt out of your carpet and leave it fresh and like new. Not sure how it does on bare floor. Compared to the three Dare Devils and one Shark we have owned in the past, I think this vacuum gave much better results. The only vacuum I found better than this one is the BISSELL CleanView Bagless Upright Vacuum with OnePass technology (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KR5UJP4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2), largely because the latter has more floor settings, a very useful turbobrush tool, and does not have a canister build which you need to carry around.
4239	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We are living at 6,000 feet elevation, and this pressure cooker has made cooking dried beans and grains a snap.  The delivery was prompt, packaging excellent, and product quality also excellent.  Wouldn't want to do without it now.

POWERFUL:Used this for the whole summer, and even at the lowest setting and on hot days, you have to keep the fan a good 10 feet away from yourself in order not to feel cold, actually a lower setting than the 1st could have been useful.

6055	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I rated this very poorly and was going to throw it away, but then I got a wire hanger and some needle nose pliers and tried to see if the vacuum hose was plugged up.  To my surprise, it was!  I see from some of the reviews others have had the same issue, so here is how I was able to solve it.  I have the suction back!
1210	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Wow! I was so shocked at the poor reviews!  Maybe they got a bad batch from the factory or something...  We've had ours for 3 years and make protein smoothies with ice and frozen bananas every day and it is great.  We've never had a problem with it- it blends everything, including ice, nice and smooth.

In short, you can spend several times as much and not get much of value for the additional investment. Works perfectly, easy to clean, and replacement parts are widely available if needed. I wish Presto sold it in a kit with the glass cover and vegetable basket, but...it gets an easy five stars anyway. No regrets and I feel all warm and fuzzy over the money I saved.

1219	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items, but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use, the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender, I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs.
5493	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is my third one--need I say more? A great quick clean up tool--surprisingly efficient--super dog hair pick-up and light weight too!
9112	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Everything you could ever ask for in a salad spinner. Plain and simple. Way better than the last 2 I owned.
Despite what I've said about noise and vibration, the fan is nicely balanced and not prone to excess vibration. You have to do some work mounting it correctly, but it's simple work for anyone if you relax and do it right. Get a level and a glass of wine, and you'll be fine.

I will be extremely disappointed the day I can't get my hands on this fella anymore!
I had bought this for my basement floors, but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs, and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive, but it would be worth it.

2/10/2013 Edit
6154	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The Mighty Mite has great suction, it's light weight and I like it, EXCEPT that the wand needs to be re-designed to have some sort of detent to keep it attached to the hand-held portion. No matter how hard I push it on and twist it, if I don't re-do it every few minutes, it slips off. Another lesser complaint is that the cord is too stiff. Rather tnan wrap it around the keepers on the bottom of the machine, I prefer to coil it and have made a little Velcro strap to keep it tidy when not in use. It's so stiff it's like trying to coil wire.
577	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product, arrived on time and as described.
1237	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I'd lower my number of stars, but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.

5681	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum is small and lightweight enough that I can actually vacuum my front stairs by myself, without an extension cord. My previous vacuum was so large and heavy that I would go downstairs backwards, placing the vacuum on the steps one by one while my cleaning lady followed with the wand and brush, doing the vacuuming. Neither of us could vacuum the steps alone. But the Mighty Mite does the job! It is so light that I use it much more often than I did the big heavy old one (also a Eureka, and with excellent suction, but HEAVY!).
8241	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I thought I was getting the same one (as a gift for someone) as the one l already have. It's actually a bit smaller (and lighter-weight) than mine, but it's still nice, and more than adequate. I just didn't realize that OXO made them in different sizes.
SHOPPING NOTE:
6303	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	PERFECT
Overall, this is a great vacuum. I would recommend it to those that don't mind ordering other attachments to make this vacuum top notch.
This thing made alot of really crappy pulled pork.  It's at goodwill now.  LOL.
On the old Mighty Mite, you included two long hard plastic tubes to create the 'wand' that allowed you to stand and vacuum.  I liked that if I needed to vacuum something nearer, I could pop off one (or both) of the tubes to use it for things like stairs or cobwebs in the basement ceiling, etc.

3454	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	After making the purchase and using a few times, decided the Cooker was too much of a challenge.  Purchased one that was electric that does not need me to watch the timer.
So you know, bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00, and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days, even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)

120	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I've used a paperback-size Light Wedge for years and love it. However, when I first used the Lumos, I found the light to be very dim. Before throwing the thing away, I checked the manufacturer's web site. It said that if one of the batteries is facing the wrong direction, the light will work, but it will be very dim. I thought I had been very careful in loading the batteries, but what do you know, one of them was facing the wrong way. Once that was fixed, the thing lit up much brighter. I almost wish it had two settings like the smaller model so I could dim it. The only negative is the inevitable scratches (which I don't even notice once I'm reading). I don't mind lifting the light up to turn pages. Once you get used to it, it's no problem at all. The even coverage of light on the page is so much better than the clip-on light I had been using for hardcover reading. And the price is a steal.

So if you are a PC newbee like me I say give it a try. As long as you read the instructions and respect the pressure it is a pretty easy way to cook with excellent tasty results in a quick amount of time. Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks. We picked up a well regarded cookbook on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pressure-Perfect-Two-Hour-Taste-in-Twenty-Minutes-Using-Your-Pressure-Cooker/dp/0060505346/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cooker</a>&nbsp;and so far so good. This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use. What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time. I can't see many other ways that you can maximize your cooking effort and cooking time than a PC.

5179	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	What can I say...I've bought four of these...two for us and two as gifts.  The oldest one is about twelve years old, and still working great with a replacement battery.  For many years it was basically our only vacuum.  Use it with or without the brush revolving...it works great either way depending on the surface.  Batteries hold their charge well and recharge fairly quickly (and they can stay on the charger all the time); the vacuum is extremely light weight and comfortable to use (at six feet tall, the handle is plenty long for me), and the company keeps making small refinements to an already excellent product that make it even more pleasant to use!  I love that you can use the charger on a table top to charge the battery pack by itself (it just pops out of the vacuum), or you can hang it on a wall and hang the vacuum on the charger without ever removing the battery (or even charge the vac with the battery still in and an extra battery at the same time!).  You can vacuum for days without having to clean out the holding box, but when you do, cleaning is quick and easy (if not slightly messy, but then you can't have everything...and what vacuum isn't a bit messy at cleaning time?).
5539	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Does the job perfectly, picks up everything with at most 3 times running over what you're picking up!  Small and light can fit just about anywhere and can vacuum up the heavy things.  Based on reviews for this vacuum cleaner it does what i expected and more, It even works on linoleum floors perfectly!  The only downside is that sometimes when turning off the vacuum cleaner it can release the larger items that wouldn't fit through the rollers into the vacuum cleaner itself, that and the short life from the battery charge.  Great pricing wonderful little vacuum cleaner i love mine!

6114	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs.  It works great on the floors, and is easy to move around, with a very long cord.  I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile, but not well on high piles, and has a very hard time getting cat hair up.  The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate, and so I have duct-taped them together.

4488	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I just have to add my review of this great product. I bought it to quickly and cordlessly clean up all the pet hair balls that accumulate on our hardwood and tile floors. Sure, it was relatively easy to get the real vac out, but plugs, and cords and hoses later...it was annoying for a quick job. I got this to just quickly vac up those spots you always see and cant do much about at the time you see them. It easily picks up all my nasty dog hair balls that hang out in the corners of the room, and the charge has lasted more than 15 minutes each time I've used it (more than enough time to vac up all the spots I needed to). I don't use it on carpet, and the only downside I can see so far is that some hair gets caught on the brush roller that you will eventually have to clean out. Other than that, the rechargeability and good suction make it a winner in my house!

6324	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Excellent jewelry organizer, all the necklaces are neat and arranged, so easy now to pick one to wear.  It comes with some screws in case you want to rigidize it to the door;  the screws go into the top of the door, where you can't seem them.  This probably is a good idea if it's a guy using the rack for ties and/or belts.  I really am pleased about rounding up my accessories, it seemed they were everywhere all the time, one mess after another, irritating and unsightly, and a tangle, which is even more exasperating.  I paid $15.81, and believe me, I was more interested in getting my stuff cleaned up than worrying about the price.  Maybe it could be a few dollars less, but so what?  The main thing is it helps enormously to tidy up.  Also, at my house the door to the powder room where the rack is installed is one where the door is open all the time, and no guests go there, so I don't even see the stuff, it's effectively on the back of the door, and since it's white, the tabs on the top don't even catch your eye from the other side of the door.

Now it doesn't kink if you look at it wrong.

8118	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff, and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife, wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives, you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest, least-attractive lemon twists ever, and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK, it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane, or maybe a different zester, but this one is a turd. Finally, the handle is not "comfortable," it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy.

5912	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Our Kenmore canister vacuum broke down after only a few years, and we were pretty frustrated. We figured that if every vacuum we buy is going to break down after a year or two, we might as well buy something more affordable! So far, I think this vacuum is working well for us. (I'll update if it breaks down).
2186	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	for the price, its pretty good. Its rather traditional in its design (tried and true i guess), my friend had the Fagor DUO 8 Quart which i tried for awhile and in truth I liked that better BUT when I went to amazon it was like $40 more expensive than what she bought it for so I opted for this. I might have been able to find that fagor for cheaper or floor model or something... later perhaps but for now this works well enough.
OUT OF THE BOX: Extremely easy to put together.  There is very little to actually assemble.  The vacuum came with a bag already installed and a extra one in the box.  The hose is one piece with a locking attachment which means it will not fall off the unit.  The wands are like every other vacuum wands.  The head is attaches to the wands and does not fall off.

I can buy a Wind Machine for $25-$35 and have it last for 2-3 years of constant use without oiling it at all. Same company(Lasko)but the fans are worlds apart in quality. I now rate this thing as low as I can and would go to negative stars if I could!..It is going to be  garbage canned and I will replace it with a Wind Machine and make a shroud to fit the window myself. It will be a bit of light work but my money will go MUCH FARTHER! I suggest you stay away from this junk,,far away!
4121	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought one of these several years ago and it's held up very well.  I needed to repay a bunch of favors a friend did for me recently, so I bought her one of these.  She tells me she really likes it and uses it all the time.  The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that these are a little light weight.  People who would be using a pressure cooker more than my friend and I may want to go to a stainless model.  They cost more, but would probably give longer service.  However, there's NOTHING wrong with these units.  They do everything you'd expect them to do.  One thing though . . .when cleaning them, be careful to not drop or traumatize the edges as they ARE a bit fragile.

3944	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love it.
I bought two of these fans, prior to the summer. One to blow and the other to suck. Not kidding...
Boy, was I wrong!!  This thing is horrible. The blades sit on almost the very bottom of the bowl, and they spins while chunks sit on top of them.  I even cut items in 1 inch cubes first to no avail. There is nothing that is chopped well.  Big chunks and pulverized pieces are what always remain after using it.  Every time I attempt, I say under my breath,"Yep,this never disappoints me.  It always does what I think it will do...fail!!."
4007	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've owned this pressure cooker for many years and loved it so much, I purchased this one as a gift for my daughter.  People need to make sure they use it properly with the cover closed securely and jiggler attached... and turn down the heat when it begins jiggling.  The nice thing about using a pressure cooker is that it will continue to cook after the pressure has built up and the cover is left on, but the heat is turned way down or off.  So nice for exceptionally moist meats that would normally be tough when cooked...pork chops or a cheap roast will be so tender and fall off the bone!
5. Square Dance
I also like the substantially larger diameter hose on the BMC and the way it is configured makes for a much more easily maneuverable device that is not always banging into walls and marring up your trim when going from room to room. The Eureka has a smaller diameter hose that is stiff and comes straight out the front so it has more of a mind of its own when tagging along.
I have the 2nd in my studio - It is great setting on the work table to pick up those tiny pieces of glass that can get imbedded in the palm of my hand - before I used a studio brush to clear my work surface - that always left a few stray pieces on the table and floor - with this small machine I can leave it under the worktable plugged in and ready.
Finally, the cat furniture.  We have 6' tall condo combinations (check out Molly and Friends cat furniture here on Amazon-that's what we have) and 3' cat trees with baskets.  Embedded cat hair on all of them.  One, in particular, a big cat gym - the top was covered in cat hair.  I used the Pet Tool on the wand and could not believe the hair that was removed the first time around.  I was impressed!
Eureka's Mighty Mite offers outstanding suction in a handy vacuum that is a great accompaniment to an upright vacuum cleaner (dedicated for deep-cleaning your carpets).  In fact, the Mighty Mite is more than up to most other dry vacuuming tasks, with its huge 12.0 Amp suction motor, and versatile attachment/tool set.
325	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I got this as a gift along with the original magnetic refrigerator poetry kit. There were more words in it than I expected and they were the same size as the regular set, even though the box was very tiny.

4348	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I have another Mighty Mite that's at least 20 years old so I purchased this one as a backup. The vacuum makes a really loud whining noise. I hoped it would go away after a few uses but it has not. I love my old mighty mite, that's why I bought another one, but I can't recommend this new one.
9821	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	As always nice product
2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.
This is by far the best handling, feeling, working peeler I have used. The handle is wide enough to make it comfortable to hold but not so wide that its too large for people like my wife who have much smaller hands. When wet its still easy to keep a grip on it, something that's important when moving around a sharp object in close proximity to your hands. The "grips" near the blade on either side are flexible allowing your thumb and forefinger to really press down somewhat and get a good grip. For me the hole at the end thats used to hang it up lines right up where my little finger sits so I get even better control over the thing.

6887	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a fine, basic box fan.  I don't want the fan to be too quiet, and this one isn't.  The low is low, and the high blocks out other noises. I use the fan both to move air into the house and to block out white noise, and this one does the trick.

8894	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Good size.
Anyway, this peeler is comfortable and very sharp.  Does a nice job on carrots and potatoes.
Works great for pizza, works great to cut fresh herbs fast, sometimes I even use it to slice grilled chicken breasts into chunks for pasta dishs at the same time I'm doing the herbs. I use it to cut fresh pasta dough for ravioli, and to cut bread dough into portions when I'm shaping rolls. It's a great multi-purpose tool.
Note also that I do not like electric can openers. They are hard to clean. The don't work if the electricity goes out. And, the ones I've used did not work all that well either.

1469	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These are excellent spatulas. Of course, they function as any set of spatulas would, but they do not present the problems that my old spatulas have over the years. This is good, solid construction and they do not get misshapen when you use an edge to clear off a pan. Food does not get stuck to it -- residue removes easily as they are being used in my experience. The reinforcement is obvious, and I do like these kitchen tools. Luckily, I received a set in exchange for an honest review. I perceive that these will be in service for years to come. Recommended!
I used it so much that the original gasket didn't last very long, less than 6 month I would say. It stopped building up the pressure, which means the steam kept escaping forever. I tried different ways to stop the steal loss. Coating the gasket with cooking oil seemed to work but left oily tasting to the food being cooked, and messy. So I decided to get a new one at the local hardware store(about $10.-). Comparing the new and old one, the new silicone gasket is much softer and the lips of the gasket is wider, which means the old gasket lips are compressed and stiffened by the heat. Now I take the gasket out each time to relieve the compression hoping to prolong the life of the gasket. If you are reading this and about to get the new cooker for the first time, you may want to try this from the beginning.

I highly recommend it especially if you're looking for a simple, easy to use, multi-surface vacuum!
Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.

The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.  Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.
Unlike the other OXO opener, the grips are permanently attached to the metal & will not slide off - a plus
My wife loves this vacuum because it doesn't take up much space, yet it gets the job done for our 400 sq ft space.  Sometimes one battery won't cover the whole place so the second battery is nice to finish up with.

5882	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I chose this vacuum to replace one I had just like it that finally quit after many years of use.  It really is a mighty mite as it has a very powerful suction, though kind of noisy.  I originally bought one for my motor home, and then realized I liked it better than the upright I had in the house, so it got moved into the  house and was used until it quit.  I tried another brand but didn't like it so searched on the internet and was so happy to find this one.  The reason for the four stars is because of the noise, but I would recommend the vacuum.
7343	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This OXO product is another winner. I like the padded handle, and it really remains straight while grating a hard hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The cheese does not fly all over the place either. It washes up easily in hot soapy water. Take a few seconds after you wash it to towel dry it. Cheese graters are famous for rusting, and I don't think even the OXO brand is immune to that.
PRICE - very reasonable!
It takes very little experience to get to know the proper pressure without a guage. It makes a rythmic rocking noise, not too fast,not too slow.

3009	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm very pleased with this pressure cooker.  My purpose in buying it was to upgrade from aluminum to Stainless Steel.  Presto has been making pressure cookers forever, and they have a good reputation.  Mine is a 6 qt.

6783	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Works ok but kind of noisy.
2730	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a decent pressure cooker. If this is all you can afford you will do just fine. I find waiting for the pin to rise on these Prestos somewhat annoying, but no brand is perfect. There is an art to using pressure cookers.
Please make sure when assembling pressure cooker, to screw on handles securely. I noticed that my bottom handle that is screwed to the pot itself is a bit loose after the first use so make sure it is secure and tight.

2188	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I used this same model back in the eighties, before it had the safety device.  I worked fine, as long as I remembered not to open it until the excess pressure had evacuated!  So the safety device is a good idea.  However, when the manufacturer RETO-FITTED this older model with the safety device, it didn't execute the change properly; this one won't work on a hot plate, but has to have a full-power stove burner.  Sorry: cannot recommend.  Buy a modern design with the safety device INTEGRAL FROM THE START.
5553	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Have owned this for many years and have had no problems at all with it. It does a good job on bare floors. It is made of heavy plastic and is reasonably sturdy. The suction is powerful and the vacuum is lightweight and easy to wheel around. There is a wand and a cleverly designed multitask tool that fit snugly onto the canister and don't fall off. One of the underneath brackets for the cord wind swivels, allowing you to release the cord instantaneously. It uses inexpensive foam filters and disposable bags, the easiest, cheapest way to get rid of all that dust and debris. A few minor drawbacks: it is very noisy; the hose tends to kink easily (just unwind it) and there is a suction regulator on the wand that you can close for maximum suction or open to varying degrees, at which point it will go after your long hair or loose clothing with gusto. All in all a good vacuum at a great price.
The "pot holder top" is just a weight, so no worries about popping your cooker as long as you don't jam something in it. Easy to use, easy to clean (aluminum discoloration inside aside with alkaline food/water) and cooks an 12oz inch thick steak in ten minutes of steam (~15 mins total) from solid ice brick to tender, moist and with a tiny hint of pink with about 4 oz of water.
4758	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	So I decided on getting the 15 amp version of the Mighty Mite and let me tell you, this thing is as BEAST! It punches well above it's weight and just keeps on performing. The bags aren't expensive and they keep the air clean as well. Kudos to Eureka for making an incredibly simple and robust vacuum. It has all the features I need to get things done around the house. You can be sure the 15 amp motor isn't being stressed whatsoever and therefore will last much longer than an 8 amp motor. Don't think twice, get this model and be happy.

4840	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This fan was just installed and works fine.  It appears sturdy and of good quality, but since we just got it, we can't provide a true assessement of durability and longevity.  We bought this to put in our small gym area of our basement.  I didn't want to cannibalize the limited floor space.  Nothing negative to say about the fan except it seems a bit pricey for a fan, if it lasts a long time, then it's worth it.

5062	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	These are the "paper" version vs. the cloth version.  The paper version is less expensive so I purchased both to determine which I want to use going forward.  Both are recommended by Hoover but the cloth version (that came with the vacuum) is better.  With the paper version the vacuum seems to indicate far more "red light" micro debris false alarms.

6072	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This vacuum has a lot of power for being so small.  The noise level is akin to a baby crying on an airplane, so wear some noise cancelling headphones or some earplugs while you clean.  The vacuum does a remarkable job of picking up small particles, dust, and even larger/heavier items on the floor.  It has many attachments, many of which I don't use, but as for the one pictured (the long extension arm with the roller head in the front) it rolls/sucks great!  I have 900 sq. ft. of wood flooring in my apartment which I clean about once a week and I haven't had an issue with this product since I purchased it 6 months ago.  You will work up a sweat, however, while you clean since it's manual.  This vacuum uses a bag, and it's very easy to pull out and install a new one.  I highly recommend this item for it's utility, but I'm downgrading one star based on the noise factor.
4753	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Does very well but dust gets into the compartment that holds the bag.  This doesn't happen with my antique Mighty Mite by Eureka.
Couldn't find a customer service number anywhere on this purchase, not liking this transaction. A number of people tried to figure out a way to fix the handle, so we didn't return it. This is one item best checked before purchase.
5835	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I have used a Eureka for years, so didn't hesitate to buy this one.

8129	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Before I bought these clips I used generic blue clippers that were given to me as a promotion for AARP.  I didn't know there was a commercial product I could buy to close bags and anything else I needed closed.  Well I saw these at the supermarket and bought them to see if they worked.  NOT only do they work they work marvelously well!  I love that they have magnets on them so I am never looking for them in my kitchen drawer.  They hold fast and never let go.  I am buying five sets today from Amazon for less than the supermarket charges and their in pretty colors to boot.  The ones I bought previously were only in white.  These work so well to close bags within their boxes like cracker and cereal bags. I am giving a set to each of my daughters and daughter in laws.
2405	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I have never in my life seen such a poorly constructed item. I never  knew they made plastic so flimsy, it bends coming out of the box didn't try it, was afraid it wouldn't make it to the window.

2490	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I just installed this- drilled holes into my window frame and everything! I am concerned that the plastic is flimsy- the fan is tilting out from the window because of its own weight. The high speed is hardly better than the box fan it's replacing if at all. The switch is plastic and doesn't seem like it will last too long. I am really concerned for those with small children who might buy this as I believe a tug on the cord could bring it crashing in on them. Also, if you don't have screens and are depending on this to block the window off when expanded, don't! Once it gets out to about 34", it has hole cutouts that allow air through when the unit is not expanded.
While I usually like to save my five star ratings for things I really love, I just don't know what they could have done any different with this... so, it gets my coveted five star rating.

Pressure cooking doesn't necessarily save time depending on what you're cooking, when you consider it takes a while to build the pressure. This takes some practice, and knowing your food and your stove. I like it because it cooks meat really tender quicker than any other method.
It even sort of works on other fruits, like kiwi (although it does make a mess and I wouldn't really suggest it). But hey, experiment with this on tomatoes, potatoes, whatever. Who knows what else this will work on. Give one to each of your family members while you're at it, because you'll get 6 of them.

7762	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this specifically for my husband so he could use the channel knife to put a lemon strip in his cocktails. But I find myself using it more often than he does. The trick to getting this tool to work perfectly is to use very hard lemon or limes or whatever you're trying to zest. The softer the item the more you will have to work. The zester is very well made and the handle is non slip. I saw that some people have also used it to julienne vegetables, which is something I definitely will try soon.
[Added Jan 27, 2016... wow, 5 months later and I'm already having to buy a new vacuum.  The cheap hose started to kink more and more frequently, until it was literally kinking right by the handle every single time I pulled back on it.  This became SO aggravating that I pressed down hard on the power switch (the same one no one in my family liked) and apparently broke it.  BUYER BEWARE -- the reviews from years past where this was a GOOD product no longer apply since Eureka has changed so many of the parts to cheaper pieces of junk!]
2884	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a cook by any definition of the word, unless zapping frozen dinners in a microwave counts. I had a need to start cooking real food, and eating real meals, so after seeing a friend use a pressure cooker to easily cook acorn squash, I broke down and bought this pressure cooker. Did I say I'm not a cook? I was initially intimidated at the idea of using a pressure cooker. Did I mention I'm not very mechanical either? I was afraid it would be too complicated for me - and I'm not overstating my inability to follow instructions past Step 3. I followed all of the instructions carefully. They are clear and easily understood. Even I wasn't able to screw this up. Voila, I had fully cooked tender chicken breasts in less than 20 minutes, and that includes all the prep work I did using the chicken recipe I found online. Easy cleanup afterwards. I can't give an opinion on aluminum vs. stainless steel. I'm amateur enough to have no opinion about the superiority of stainless steel. It works just fine for me.

645	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	It smells like melting plastic when you run it for very long even on low heat. It defeats the purpose of using a space heater to warm a room because you are afraid something might catch on fire.  We used multiple times thinking it might get better but it still smells after a month. Also the remote is very touchy and has to be pointed just so or it won't work, so don't buy this one for the convenience of turning it on or off from across the room

3780	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and a 6-qt also. Now I use all 3 cookers for everything.  I am very happy about "stainless steel" because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it).  This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others.

My basement holds 4 vacuum cleaners, bought over 7 years, ALL of whom have been taken off the field of action. The 2 German ones, which never were that great to begin with-- are awaiting costly repairs. Two others were too heavy or clumsy to live with-- and were not nearly as effective as this little Eureka. The other 2 do not bear mention.
I wanted something quick and easy that I could pull out in 10 seconds get the job done it and then stick it back in the laundry room, and all of this in the time it would have taken me to to get out and plug in the other vacuum cleaner.

I use them for everything.  I've stopped using those chip clips which slide off, and you also have to fiddle with them to get them on.  Someone mentioned Binder Clips...yes, but they are harder to get on and off, ugly, and very tight; sometimes you want a clip that holds things together well but doesn't crush them---this is hard to explain, but I'll just say that I find the amount of tension on the OXO Clips ideal.

The on/off switch is hard to move.  The hose was almost impossible to remove from the vacuum body.

The eureka is fantastic. We have a dog and a cat. Needless to say, pet hair all over. Regardless of how many times I vacuumed with a regular vacuum, the pet hair was still there. With the Eureka 3670G, you can actually see the hair being sucked up. It has great suction and a added plus, it's a bagged vacuum! Do you realize how dirty and dusty it is when you empty a 'bag-less' vacuum? It's a gross job, with dust and dirt going all over. And you can NEVER get the container clean because of the static electricity. With a bag, you just throw it away. No dirt, dust, etc. A heads-up. Buy the Eureka with a HEPA filter.

1260	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.  I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.

6755	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I used these brackets to build a firewood rack.  These brackets are very easy to use, however I found it rather difficult to make sure the vertical 2x4's were in fact plumb. This required some clamping (etc) before drilling holes for the bolts.  I haven't yet stacked wood on the rack, but I'm certain the weight of the wood will cause the vertical 2x4's to lean out.  To counter that I added a frame of 2x4s on top that will provide much more support as well as a pitched "roof."  For the price this is a good value, although, like I said, it does require some extra work if you want something really solid.
5449	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	For a number of years, I've used the Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner, and it really does have the suction force of some of the larger vacuum cleaners.  However, with 9 cats and 3 dogs, all of whom shed, I found that not only would that vacuum become very clogged with pet hair and other debris, it was very difficult to clean out all of the residue that remained, after vacuuming.  It's now gotten to the point where the machine needs to be taken apart, and professionally cleaned.  I decided to try another type of cordless vacuum, and chose the Eureka Quick Up Cordless, after doing a fair amount of research.  I will say that, for the most part, it works well.  I like the idea of having an extra battery pack.  The suction with this vacuum is adequate for what I need, and pulling excess pet hair out of the brushes, after vacuuming, is much less problematic than with the Hoover Linx.  The cleaning head has a much more open design, and has easy access for cleaning it out.  In my household, there is absolutely no getting around this last step, after I have vacuumed.  For the time being, I think this little vacuum will serve the purpose for my needs.  There is no question, however, that it will never take the place of the larger, more powerful vacuum cleaners.  But, for quick pick-ups, it does the trick.

Like many heaters though the thermostat seems a bit too easily fooled by its own heat output so it can sometimes go into a mode where it keeps quickly switching on and off.

4139	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica, they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well, but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.

Cleaned tile, wood, carpet, rugs, couch, broken glass jar of dry bean and veggie soup mix!  It just about filled up the bag, but definitely worth it!  Cleaned both carpet and wood stairs also.  You do have to get used to the rug or flat surface button on the flat blade attachment, just remember to push it with your foot when you change surfaces.  Also, there is a valve cover near the angle piece that connects to the hose.  Make sure it is closed if you want full suction.  This slides easily, so if your suction changes, check the valve first.  Simple to put together and use all over the house!  A little noisy, like a shop vac, but much better moving around corners and changing from carpet to tile or wood, rolls great!

Not is it ergonomically constructed, it also works fabulously, without the need to press on the blade.

Not only does one of these cookers greatly reduce your cooking time, they also save you energy as a well.  So far I have prepared beans and ham soup, a clone recipe of KFC fried chicken and savory pot roast in my unit and the food has been delicious.  This unit comes with a very basic cook book but Presto offers a large cook book for $19.95.  I have found many delicious pressure cooker recipes on line by using Google for "Pressure Cooker Recipes", including the savory pot roast recipe that I just tried and the KFC clone fried chicken recipe that came out moist and tender. Where it normally took me all day to cook a pot roast in my crock pot, this unit did it in just at one hour and the roast was fall apart tender with a rich and tasty broth.  This allows you to use less expensive cuts of meat that you can catch on sale like chicken leg quarters, chuck roast, ham and beans or any lentils for that matter.  All at greatly reduced cooking times and resultant less energy consumption on your electric or gas range.

Of course youll want to have a good can opener like this on hand if you have no electricity (for camping and off the grid living), and for times when you loose electricity (great for your in-home emergency preparedness kit), or if you just don't want to spend $30 to $40 or more on a really good electric can opener. But I prefer a manual can opener in my kitchen for regular daily use because I don't like the idea of using an electric can opener  an electric can opener cant be easily and quickly rinsed under the facet or sterilized in hot water. I do use an electric can opener when I visit family and friends and cook in their kitchens, and Ive seen the yuk that so easily builds up on electric can openers, even if you wipe it clean with every use. Theres just no comparison between rinsing and wiping. Rinsing wins every time with an openers.

Except, not.  My house has bare floors and large (9x12) wool or cotton rugs, and 3 cats.  After going over the kitchen, I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me.  Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug, and afterwards it looked like only I'd crawled around picking lint by hand.  Other gripes: the flexible hose kinks flat/closed (doesn't self correct), the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions (and must be cleared WITH FINGERS, the debris doesn't suck off by the pipe alone).
3278	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought the 6-quart Presto since I cook large amount to freeze, but I would recommend the 4-quart, it's safer & faster to build up the pressure.  For the 6-quart stainless steel Presto:  Pros  1) enough for 6 servings.  Cons:  1) smaller bottom & takes longer to build up to pressure  2)  Takes longer to heat, due to large size  3) More dangerous, it's heavier, plus doesn't fit into sink without tilting over, releasing hot steam from the trivet (pressure regulator knob).
Would love to say it's a great tool because most of the OXO stuff is great, but this one is absolute junk and a waste of your money.

Capacity lines are a part of the steel so they won't rub off, and aren't indented or stamped (many come with no lines or cheaply printed lines). The most dishwasher safe pressure cooker I've looked into (though I don't have a DW and wouldn't bother to use one).

Just in case you haven't thought about this subject before, it's a lot easier to suck hot air out of a room with an exhaust fan than it is to push cool air in to the room. Using an exhaust fan works much better than just opening a window wide and hoping cool air will blow in eventually.

The size and weight are reasonable and it will probably make it through a trip in the luggage compartment on a plane without any problem, although I doubt if I will ever need it for that.

6075	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I needed a lightweight vacuum to clean my hardwood floors upstairs, on the stairs, and downstairs. The suction power is great, and the price is perfect. I do wish that the cord was retractable because it is obnoxious to have to wind and unwind it every time I use. And it's kind of lame for carpets and rugs since it doesn't have a spinning roller brush, so we'll hang onto our regular vacuum for the one room in our house that has carpet.
562	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I would like to say that these are great.  The quality is definitely there and the lids are great to stack them and not worry about tilting them and having them spill.  The little door to open and fill the ice cube tray is a nice idea but not functional enough to use reliably.  If you fill it from there you can not see the evenness of the water in the tray, you can also possibly fill it to much.  If you flip the ice cube tray over it will leak out of the door.  The other thing is that they are over priced for what they are.
Addendum: Seller made good by offering a discount.  Seller stated they had it drop shipped from another supplier.  At their alternate web-site they do not sell any Rubbermaid products. (mvtradingonline.com)

The suction on this little guy is amazing!  It was very difficult for me to use my upright to vacuum the steep set of carpeted stairs in my home and the little hand-held didn't work well at all, so I decided to give the Mighty Mite a shot.  It was very inexpensive so I figured I'd go for it.  So glad I did!  Got the steps done in no time at all and it was so easy!  The cord is quite long and the hose and extensions have a long reach, as well, so I only had to move the canister (which is very light-weight) a few times to get the job done.  So far so good!

I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!

When the hot season arrives, I put a fan in my LR and another in my office. I stand the fan in the window and hold it in place with a piece of plywood to block the space above the fan. I use one drywall screw on each side. The same holes for 20 years. I reverse the process in September or October. My bedroom is in the middle with an open window. About 9 PM, the day's heat has dropped to 80. When I go to bed, I set both fans for low speed exhaust. The replacement air is cool and welcome as it wafts over my bed. 3 or 4 hours later, I'm prompted to get up and go pee-pee. I then set the fans to blow in at medium speed. When I get up in the morning, I turn the fans off because the place is chilly.

Because it is behind the door and once all of the items are hung it does not really stick out too much.  It does what is intended.

He latched on to the gear concept instantly so explaining to him that each gear tooth represented one minute made learning to tell time a SNAP.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

2138	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	If you are looking for an old fashioned hand crack ice cream maker that uses salt and ice - this is the only choice I have been able to find.  Unfortunately, I was only able to make ice cream about 5 times before I noticed the gears were stripping. I then took a closer look at the hand crank system - and it is made very cheaply. Additionally, even though I have been diligent about rinsing out the bucket when I am done, it is still rusting on the inside.  This is presumedly from the salt water needed to freeze the ice cream.  Still, since I very much like hand cranking, I am now looking for a replacement piece for the hand crank system and hoping it will last more than a season.

4141	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	With microwave ovens being the staple of most American homes, it is nice to see pressure cookers making a comeback. This product is ideal for meats, lentils, corn..... things that take a long time to cook. When cooking meats, I usually brown the meat in a skillet first and then put it in the pressure cooker for about 10 minutes - the resulting liquid can be used for soups or as a broth for other dishes. Lentils and beans cook very quickly and the clean up is easy as well. I also found that because it cooks with steam, one can reduce the amount of oil or fat that is used while reducing the cooking time. Good product that I can strongly recommend
Also great in the kitchen.  Sucks up the freshly ground pepper that finds its way onto the floor, and the fresh ground coffee.  I love to cook, but the floor shows it.

4159	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've had this vacuum for over 5 years now, and as I was hosing it out again to clean off/out drywall dust, I fell in love all over again. I have abused this little machine, even dropping it off a ladder recently. I wiggled the innards back together again, and it works like a charm. But where it really shines is in cleaning up drywall dust! I brought this into the remodel job (a bathroom) and used it to clean up the horrible aftermath of an evening of sanding new drywall mud--there is fine dust everywhere. My Mighty Mite stood up to any Shop Vac, but took up a lot less room. The HEPA filters are MONEY! The bags themselves are a dream and catch most of the dust, but the HEPA filter on the back of the vacuum really kept the job fully contained--no blowing dust out the back into my relatively clean bedroom. When the vacuum stopped sucking, I changed disposable bags--which are affordable--and was back in business. I'm buying a couple more filters--also affordable--just to have on hand.

6056	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	There has been a lot written on this vac so I won't repeat what I have already read.  The main things I can add are that 1) to beware that the inlet where the hose attachment is has no one way valve.  Most vacs have a flap valve between the hose and the bag so when the hose is removed, the bag contents don't fall out the hole.  (the bag is right on the other side of the hose connection)  This has about a 2" hole where you can see straight into the bag contents which means if you take off the hose there is nothing keeping the dirt in the bag from pouring back out, especially if you tip the vac nose down.  If you stand it on it's rear no problem.  2) the power switch is under a plastic bar which bends when you press it.  That means that some day the bending will eventually break the plastic bar and the switch will be exposed.  It is recessed and you would have to poke your finger into the hole once this breaks and it will.  Plastic only bends so many times before breaking.  Bad design, but for about $65 how can you complain.  My last Mighty Mite lasted 20 years.

I also put some brick under to help support the wood, since my rack is 10 feet long and it just will need it. This to me is not an issue.

2445	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall, and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust, the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows, because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted, because they have a "lip" at the bottom, that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window, to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place, so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene, for instance!)  Even so, the fan is easily removed, once the screws are in place.
My quest began as not all belts are the same. No siree, they have many names and many numbers and most would not work for my machine, nor come in time to save my marriage.
definitely recommended. very pleased.
Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.  I feel it should have lasted longer and even then, for two of those years, we were limping along having to coax it into operation most mornings.  After a while some water or something got into the computer and we could no longer set the time or use any of the computerized controls, but still we pressed on.  Eventually even our tricks to bypass the quirks stopped working and we threw it out.  We plan to buy another very soon but are debating the thermal carafe version vs this one.

I don't have rugs with higher pile, so don't know how well it would work on those.  The battery lasts for enough time for me to sweep up my kitchen, family room, bathroom, and hall, with just enough juice to do the stairs, which is all I want.  Emptying the dirt cup isn't difficult, but I find that cleaning the filter every time I've used it to the point the battery needs recharging is a good idea.  Just clean it in your kitchen sink. Dries fairly quickly. I actually have 2 of these.  My older model has been fine, but I now need to get it a new battery.  I've had it for several years though, so I'm not surprised the battery needs replacing.  This happens on all of the stick vacs and handhelds that I've had.  Overall, if you don't want to get out the big vacuum but want to do a quick job, this is great.
I am looking forward to my next batch.

anyone looking for this size of pressure cooker.
My own strainer wouldn't work and I couldn't find a better one in any local store.  This strainer is large enough and filters well enough to do this task.
My son had been placing the dishes away, and decided to take the lid and the pot should be connected in a way that he should see fit.  Since it didn't work his way, he decided to use a hammer and pound on the lid handle where he bent the teeth and chipped the handle in the process.  Words of advice:  If it isn't meshing together properly, you HAVE IT ON WRONG.  Disconnect the lid from the pot, and try again.  Good news, we ordered another one, and its on the way, and yes, he's paying for the replacement entirely.  He now knows, its a costly mistake, and since he has a job, he knows the value of taking care of other people's things.

I had heard horror stories of pressure cookers and people getting hurt, but the instructions were clear, headed warnings, and included pictures, which was great for a beginner like me. I cook mostly pakistani food, so this thing is a necessity; idk what the heck took so long for me to get on the bandwagon, but this purchase was a good one.

I have found the blade to be sufficient if you apply a reasonable amount of pressure it can cut most pizza cleanly in one cut. As far as pizza wheels go this one is a great wheel for a good price.

UPDATE: 5/5/2014 - Did I say how much I loved this? I was able to cook/prep butternut squash in less than 10 mins to puree and store for my baby's food. I've been buying organic veggies and pureeing them for storage cubes for the nanny and I use the cooker for the harder veggies to boil. Before the squash would have taken much longer and it would be stringy due to the fibers not being cooked enough...so I would get soft squash with some stringiness when I would scoop it out and into the Magic bullet which of course the baby would find and get angry about. Now with the cooker it ALL comes out fall off the fork tender in much less time and gas usage. Definitely using this for the tougher veggies, baby food or what not.

She was so interested being a pressure cooking newbie herself and kept saying she wanted to get one too. I couldn't wait for her to try it, so I bought her this cheaper 6 qt Presto and had it shipped directly to her. She loves it and uses it all the time. She says she uses it almost every day. She used to cook pinto beans (for example) from dry all day in a stock pot, but now she cooks them so fast in the pressure cooker and says the taste is so much better. She said it was like tasting a pinto bean for the first time, it was so much more flavorful. I don't know what I'd do without mine either!

The only actual shortcoming of the unit is the fact that the handles on both sides are held on with only one screw so they are never quite tight.  But, it's OK because they never really come very loose either.  Also, the screws are steel so they leave rust stains.  I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult to find stainless screws to replace them with but it's kinda crappy that it didn't come with the correct screws from the factory or enough of them to keep the handles on snugly, but that's a nit that few will probably even notice so I'm not going to ding Presto for that here.

I have it set up facing my vornado fan (Which arrived from Amazon just today) and the nice cross -breeze is unbelievable. For a small,cheap fan, the output is pretty impressive. I have purchased this same fan a few times over the past several years(gave a few away and left two behind in a move)and had them for at least 3-4 years with no issues whatsoever. It's noisy on the medium and high settings but still an okay trade-off as my comfort level has gone up a few notches. All of this for only $17.00. I'm very happy with this fan!

Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new "touch pads" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.  I was very disappointed in the blender, but more in Cusinart, a brand I have trusted for years who makes the best food processor imaginable.  So much for trusted brands. I'm refurbishing my Waring blender with new parts, at least I know it works well.
When put in perspective and for the price point, it is a good value.
I hope this helps someone :).

I"ve had it about a year and I use this little wonder everywhere:  the stairs, the rugs, the porch, the bathrooms.  It picks up bird seed, kitty litter, downy feathers, bunny fluff, small bits of hay, dirt, dust, and hair, hair, hair!  Angora-fine cat hair, long, coarse dog hair, my hair.  It picks up amazingly well in corners and along the wall.  I do have to make multiple passes sometimes to pick up some things (or just go a little slower), but it usually gets the job done in a swipe or two.
This product would be awesome if it cut in the inside of the curve.... it's almost useless as is

The only thing I would change is to have a longer cord and additional head for hardwood/laminate/tile surfaces. A friend told me about a large brush attachment that works for laminate floors that fits the Mighty Mite. It glides smoothly across the floor and picks up hair better than the regular one that comes with the Mighty Mite. I found one locally at a vacuum store but they sell one of Amazon as well.
5664	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	So far this is a powerful and sturdy little friend.  I put my own brush attachement on it for other jobs.  Works great and it's not too heavy.  Easy to use.  I prefer buying a couple of these lighter smaller units and keeping them in different parts of the house rather than those big, expensive, heavy ones.  If they last a couple of years, I don't get all nuts about it and have to run back and forth to service it, I just buy another one.  It will take 10 years to end up costing as much as my former $$ vacuum, which I had to lug to the bedroom from the garage.  Now I store them in closets.
4877	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This fan is pretty awesome for my exercise room.  I like how there are different settings:  high, medium, and low.  I also like how it doesn't take up much space.  It keeps the room cool when I am running... otherwise being in this room would feel like a sauna.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it looks cheap.  I'm not counting on it lasting more than a year or two, so if it does, I will be happy.

7560	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Literally 1/16 of an inch smaller bowl, but the basket is noticeably smaller by at least a 1/2 inch. (It fits inside the old basket) We use this spinner every day, and it was starting to disintegrate and was severely discolored. The new "redesigned by China" model spins smoothly and as fast as expected. Seems a bit easier to pump, and quieter - but that could just be the age of our old one.

2236	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great size.  I had the larger size but exchanged it for this 4 quart.  It's big enough to make a 6 person entree - and I don't need anything bigger than that.  I like that this is not aluminum ... stainless steel is healthier to use and sturdier.  Be sure to read the instructions.... you have to press two areas to put the lid on for the first few times.  Pressure cookers keep the nutrients, are FAST, and everything is so tender.  I love this and use it at least 3 times a week.
These are all reinforced with a metal rod inside to give them strength and rigidity. So, they do stand up to serious mixing and stirring. A good application in my case is in bread making. Certain breads are better suited to being made by hand with hand tools instead of using a stand mixer. The largest of this set is a shovel-shaped scraper that is perfect for this task and it holds up very well under the load. The end does flex and bend but so far has not shown any signs of fatigue.

6286	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This will be short, it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums, it's OEM, it works, no manufacturing or quality issues. If your vacuum uses this size, I see no reason not to get it. As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run, and it has been running for over a decade, I will get these replacements.

One thing that is a little strange is that there is a coupling on the back which implies that it should be able to blow well, but it cannot. There are exhaust vents behind the wheels and air comes out several other places, too. As a result, trying to use this as a blower will end up disappointing. That was the only strange thing I saw about it.
1399	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My SO has wanted a ricer for a long time. I kept offering to get him one but he couldn't decide on a brand and told me to wait. The opportunity to check this one out came up and I had to take it. This came around 8 o'clock at night and my SO was packing for an upcoming trip. I told him that this came and he dropped everything and went into the kitchen to make mashed potatoes. As a lover of this food, I couldn't complain. He said the insert fit in perfectly and it was really ease to use. He said he didn't have to use much pressure at all to press down and even thought I could do it without aggravating my wrist (which later proved correct). He said it cut down enormously on the time it took to make the potatoes which I noticed too as I thought maybe he'd already done something ahead like cleaned and boiled the potatoes, but he'd done no such thing. The potatoes were delicious with no lumps. He said clean-up was easy as well, that it took less time than ensuring beaters are clean.
3841	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Nice quality for the price!

6782	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Picked one of these up at my local hardware store for $16. It would easily be worth $30, it is a large strong fan. The only sound you hear is the air moving, virtually no motor sounds. It creates an excellent air current through my entire 650 square foot apartment; going from the bedroom, through the kitchen, and out the living room. The fan is actually made in America too.
The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4" hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off, again. Is the bolt the problem? No, it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE, if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.

5916	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great little vacuum. I use it to clean up small areas.  Excellent for picking up tracked in dirt or pet hair.
2609	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	As always, pressure cooker works great. Cuts down cooking time & makes tough meat tender. Been using this kind of cooker for 50 years since my Mom showed me how it works in the 60s.

I would recommend to anyone looking for a modern-day pressure cooker.  Well worth the price.

1878	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Thank you
5617	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this vacuum to keep bedroom and bathroom floors tidy.  All three people living in my house have long, brown hair and I can't stand when it gets on the floor!  The vacuum works well for touch up jobs, but it wouldn't work for heavy duty clean ups (like our pet rabbits room which gets covered with hay and fur..).  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was that the hair got wrapped around the roller of the vacuum instead of being sucked up into the compartment and was very gross and tedious to remove!  It's perfect for use on the stairs, however, because it only weighs about 4 pounds!  As for the battery life-- I can vacuum about 2 medium sized rooms and a hallway before the battery wears out.  Definitely glad this one came with an extra battery so it can be switched out if you need to vacuum more.

9610	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The quality is really nice and the bowl and basket are nice and thick so they seem like they will last.  The biggest issue I have, and I didn't think about this when buying it, is that there is a large housing under the lid for the piston/pump thing.  If you fill up the bowl with salad, this will press down into the middle of it, making it difficult to close.  If I buy another one of these, I will buy one with a lever or pull string so it does not take up room in the actual bowl.
993	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Pros: Handles fold down to save space; nice size for a roast, a turkey, chicken, lasagne, stuffing; the inside rack can be used high or low; excellent quality for the price (paid around $21).

8865	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my mother in law and she loves it.  I have also used this whenever I visit and it's wide enough for a good sized slice-dieters beware! ;) The serrated edges help you get through thick crusts.  The rubber handle gives it a nice touch. I recently added it to my wishlist so I can get one too!
No electric / computer parts to fail and leave you with a pile of junk (this should last a lifetime aside from some affordable replacement parts like gasket and safety plug). Higher pressure than electric models. No toxic Teflon or shady/ reactive aluminum. Not dependent on electricity or any particular heat source: you could use candles, camp fire, solar, induction, etc.
Buying one for mom as a gift. Hope it makes her life easier! :)
2935	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Very nice pressure cooker. Stainless is the only way to go.  Heats so much better that the aluminum versions.
12	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I purchased one for each of my children instead of just a single large clock because my kids LOVE playing with them! They are small enough to sit beside their beds so at night time we can review bed time and what time they can get up in the morning (an actual working clock is in their room for reference). Makes learning time fun and easy for them and will be a great supplement to future homework as my oldest begins kindergarten this year.
-Powerful suction, even with the crevice tool attached.  (great for top of the baseboards along wall)
strong
6185	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this small vac for my bare floors.  It is a bit loud but most vacuums are so that's not an issue for me.  It does a great job and is light weight, easy to carry up and downstairs.  All in all, a great little vacuum cleaner for the money.  Time will tell about durability.

9507	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use for many mashing jobs (traditional mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, etc.). The handle is very comfortable. The little square holes that you press into the food seem to mimic a ricer which is sometimes suggested for mashed potatoes but this tool is so much easier to clean! I used to have a masher with a zig-zaggy design for the masher part because I liked the way it looked but think this one works much better.
There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description, thus the review may no longer be accurate.
9472	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great to use over a big barbecue grill. They grip food very well, usually without tearing it.
5261	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Mines a little hard to push when the stick is straight up and down and brush roller isn't engaged.  The removable debris basket latch isn't perfect, it works, but doesn't seem to slide down as far as its suppose to.  It's ok for quick pick ups.  Battery runs good and i like having two batteries. If your wanting to replace a decent corded vacuum with a cordless vacuum, this isn't the answer.  Update 2015, the charger stopped charger, I'm guessing the cord wiring is separated inside the charger.
Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.

The good news is that my parents had an assortment of attachments from other vacuums (or purchased separately) that fit the Mighty Mite, including floor nozzles, dust brushes and upholstery tools.  When used with those higher quality tools, I was impressed by its performance on tasks expected of a canister vac: bare floor cleaning, dusting, cleaning upholstery.  It was even OK for light duty carpet cleaning; just don't expect miracles on carpets from a suction-only canister.
5137	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	this is my 3rd yellow Mighty Might vacuum cleaner in 20 years.  I think it has a life of about 6.5 years (with continuous, near daily use).  A great machine if you live in a small condo or apartment.  I love it and would purchase it again (in about 6 years!).  Well worth the money.
8248	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have been peeling potatoes (and other things) wrong my whole life clearly. I was in a rush for dinner and thinking "okay peeling the potatoes will take about 7 minutes" because with my old peeler.. it did. We received one of these for the wedding, and it. is. a. game. changer. it took me less than  45 seconds to peel 3 large sweet potatoes. i know it seems silly, but this is seriously one of the best things in my kitchen.


I should meantion that the length, grip and overall balance is good - my primary gripe is the blade rusting and discoloring.  Another thing I don't like: the blade is certainly not full tang and wiggles quite a bit if you torque the handle
  As well as a 25 foot power cord.
6147	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	For the price, this convenient little vac works great! This is my third one only because my 2 kids took the others.

There was not a drop of water or wet feeling inside the box. It has several of my electric and hand tools. All were dry.  This box was in the back of my pickup parked in the drive way.  A lot of the time the wind was blowing from the West and the pickup was parked outside on the East side of the garage.  Thus it was somewhat shielded - BUT not that much.  I didn't think the 1 latch would hold the lid tight enough but it did.  I have a larger box in a trailer and water got into it a few weeks ago.  There was only 1 of the 2 latches closed so that could be the reason.
To close the lid hold the handle and then level out the side with your hand while placing it on top- it definately helped us get it on correctly.

Most of my results are pluses, but one is just outstanding: We have 4 cats. This vacuum is just super in picking up cat hair. One charge's use, the cup is filled. Every day! I don't know whether I'm glad, or revoltingly embarrassed that there is that much cat fur lurking in the house.

You also need the shelf (not included) and the other clips that attach to the wall (not included).
In my opinion, OXO should have designed the lever so that it doesn't go all the way back inside the recessed back of the scoop and instead rested just above the back of the scoop so it isn't such a hassle to clean.

4788	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I am returning this after 2 frustrating days of use. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the suction is great and if I could get the attachments to stay on it would be fabulous, but sadly the engineering of this vacuum is way off. The extender rod and sweeper attachments will not stay on. Every time it sucks onto the floor or carpet just a bit the pole pulls out of the attachment. It makes no sense, the sweeper part just fits into the pole without anything to grip it there. Same thing with the extender.  My husband can force the pieces hard enough to stay together, but after he does that I can't get them apart so have to wait for him to change any tools. The vacuum is useless for someone with arthritis like me.

Update 2010:  I never found a way to replace the handle so we now have a very expensive wooden bucket.  Since more recent reviews say that the gears are still stripping, I would stay away from this product.

Yes, the handle is a bit short, but it still works very well, especially since I never have to carry it full to the sink to run cold water to release pressure.  I've never had a problem with this pressure cooker (buy the stainless and not the aluminum!)

9615	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Do not buy this opener.  Our old OXO opener finally gave out after twenty years of use.  This replacement is almost identical with handles that are redesigned a little.  At first we were very happy with the quality but a little frustrated with the opening process.  In fact it seemed to be already worn out.  We expected another twenty years of service, but no.  Regret to say that after 10 weeks of operation, opening perhaps 20 can, we find it worse than useless.  Hard to get it started, that initial clamping onto the can.  It seems to move the can sideways or causes the can to tip over.  You need to hold both the can and the opener then press down firmly.  Even then you may have to repeat this operation several times as the opener slips off the can easily.  We like the handles.  We like the black knob to turn the opener.  What we do not like is the very poor and frustrating process needed to open a can.  I have included pictures showing the components that grasp and move the cutter forward.  Notice the poor quality of the ratchet wheel and how dull the cutter appears.

Prior to its introduction, Hoover dominated this niche with their excellent Porta Power vacuum.  The Eureka was an improvement in almost every way.

2859	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Just love it, value for money.
Look do I hate the Eureka Mighty Mite? Not really, but it is a good example of you get what you pay for. There is no way they can make something as integrally well built with the features of the BMC for less than half of the price. So for the money it is a bargain, but like I mentioned in the long run you are going to eat up the difference having to replace the filters all of the time on the Eureka as well as having to replace the bags. So in the long run you are going to spend the same amount of money and have an inferior unit in the Eureka. All of the filters in the BMC can be hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent, and then thoroughly dried before returning them to the vacuum. I am sure after a while it would be a good idea to replace them, but that is a supposition on my part. I have the Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Upright and emptying out the dirt has to be the easiest job going. It is the same as this Bissell. All you do it push one button and the completely enclosed canister lifts right out. I go outside to my plastic trash can, release the lid on the bottom, give it a few light taps on the side of the can, snap the lid back on and I am ready to go. Comparing that to replacing bags at a cost and having to get them of the closet, install them after expanding them, and making sure the collar is properly inserted etc, not to mention the risk of breaking or even getting a little tear in the bag and then the entire inside of the vac is a mess; there is no comparison. I have both and I will take the bagless every time.


7472	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Oxo has a winner with these. Small and convenient. There is a size or two up that I like the best from Oxo however. These work well for small bags and notes stuck to the fridge. The only beef I have with them is that the magnet strength is too weak. Bump this while walking past your fridge and they'll fall to the floor. Otherwise, a good overall clip.

But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.

The 5 star rating is provisional though because when delivered it is damn near impossible to get the lids on. Somebody posted about using hot water to loosen them up and help them fit. I filled up a tupperware container with water as hoot as it could come out of the faucet and let the containers and lids sit in the water for 15 minutes. I then pulled them out, put the lids on, which was not difficult and let them set for a few days. It might have taken less time but I didn't need them right away.

Like all stove top pressure cookers, they have to be respected as a potentially dangerous tool and should never be left on a burner unattended, especially if children are around.  I have used it for beans, split peas, and sterilizing canning containers. It is easy to clean and the gasket comes out easily for cleaning or replacement.
2957	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Really love my pressure cooker! We use it a lot for beans, legume, sweet potato, soups and lentils. It cut down the amount of cooking time significantly. Pressure cookers had a bad rep from back in the days, but the safety features of the latest model make it so much safer. You do still need to keep an eye on it, but with everything cooked within 10 mins, I don't mind staying in the kitchen for that. Did I mention that this also saves energy by using less stove time? This is a must-have in our kitchen. The 6-quart pot is the perfect size for our family of 4.

I can stir light foods or heavy foods and it has a good grip on it with the design on the sides of it.

9540	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this masher after my potato masher that had a similar head design but a typical longer handle failed at one side of the welds.  It is great.  I really like this style of masher head because it sort of rices potatoes rather than mashes them.  The plastic rubbery handle is wide and the short handle design allows for more leverage when mashing.  It does sink into the potatoes a lot for a very big pot of potatoes - I prefer to use an 8-qt stockpot for mashing for less depth of potatoes and easier mashing.  This masher also works great for bananas and even crushing graham crackers for a pie crust.
6673	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	These box fans are life savers. I find they last a good 4-7 years. I bought 2 new ones this time, and was happy to see that the feet have been engineered to be more more stable and to stay attached to the fan much better than they used to. I did a test of the sound level at the lowest setting, and found one fan was significantly quieter than the other. Upon close inspection, there didn't appear to be any differences in construction, etc. Just the luck of the draw, I guess. I am super-sensitive to sound and vibration, but I can easily sleep with this fan running on the lowest setting while positioned on a stool at the bottom of my bed. I've had many Laskos over the years. At one point I bought an Aerospeed box fan, and it is much quieter than the Laskos; the cost was greater as well.

2. Disobeys. Ok, I'm being funny but it doesn't turn corners or doorways well. You have to pull on the hose and the minute there's a slight turn, the hose bends all the way and blocks the air, letting out a very LOUD noise that scared the neighbor's dogs.

I suppose if you put oil or animal product, cleaning can require more detargent and scrabbing, but since I use it only with vegetables and nuts, I don't even have to use detargent.

2384	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another, so here's my brief take: my fan is well balanced, no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed.  The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.  I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e., installing the four screws that come with it).  That's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed, then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all.  My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium (very quiet at both low and medium speeds) and about 110W on high (noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view).  If my house were bigger I'd buy another.  Good stuff.

Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years, and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.

A touch pricey for a simple screw, but much better performance than the Screw Pull brand and the T performance should last a decent amount of time. I simply prefer this hand style of pulls vs the Rabbit, et al. YMMV...GL,motordavid
Two things: 1. Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan. Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary. (Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.
The machine is noisy, but it's not as bad as I expected. The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it. The brush washed away even old ink stains (I soaked them in alcohol for a few minutes before cleaning)

They are, of course, perfect for invalids or convalescents.  But they are also great for camping trips and to keep in the glove compartment or at work to use for a quick, refreshing "wash up" anytime, on the go.  This brand has a pleasant but very mild, clean scent (not at all perfume-y), suitable for anyone.  They're a generous size and thickness, too, and very soft.  The package reseals fairly well, if it is opened carefully, but I also toss the entire thing into a plastic zippee bag once opened just to be sure the wipes stay nice and moist.

3) The shoulder strap - Eureka makes the strap, mostly for it's Sanitaire version of this vac, but it fits this one just fine. You'll find the part number in the accessories catalog with the vac, but oddly, good luck finding it online.

The song White America is my favorite (for now, it's only been 2 days).  The song poses the question of whether he would be so controversial, or indeed so successful if he were black.

My oldest, still work, an old aluminum, electric Presto acquired in 1960.  This one is my most recent purchase which is used in our new Summer home.

My only complaint is, there is only one screw holding one of the handles on. You need to press against the handle to open and close the cooker. Eventually it will loosen. Not hard to figure out, put two screws in the handle!

The main reason to buy the 4 qt steel cooker was to have a size between the ones I already owned, suitable for a family of four, and also the reason that stainless steel doesn't react with the food, which is important to me because I often marinate the meat before cooking certain dishes.

I did de-burr the inside edge of the safety relief valve hole (in the lid), as the edge was sharp and would eventually cut the neoprene button that plugs the hole as it is removed and re-installed for cleaning.

I do like the new hose. It seems to be made of a stronger plastic so it doesn't bend as easily. And this cord is shorter than our original might mite. Other than those differences I really like our new mighty mite and would recommend it as a great canister vac. We have hard word floors only and it came with a few attachments which makes cleaning cat hair off the couch a lot easier. I used one of the attachments to clean the ceiling fans and it did a great job. Very pleased and I would buy this same vac again.
So, I am quite happy with these!
4665	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Living in an apartment and not having much storage, I appreciate the compact size. Hose doesn't have a tight seal making the suction suck (in a bad way), and am needing to remove the attachment when vacuuming corners.

4380	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I was so disappointed in this vacuum after reading all the good reviews. The product description said this vacuum came with a roller brush for carpets, and it absolutely does not. It also claimed to work well on carpets and it most certainly does not (although it did note that where the vacuum really "shined" was hard flooring). In addition, it promotes the rear exhaust as a "blower" capable of blowing debris from your garage floor, etc., and it definitely is not strong enough to do that whatsoever. In all, the entire description of this vacuum is, without question, misleading. I'm sure it works okay on hard flooring surfaces, but in all honesty, the suction leaves a lot to be desired. I am returning this for something better.

9033	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Lasted TWO years, But....  nice and sharp and shredded well, but since I freeze some of my cheese, especially parmesan, it's a little hard still when i grate it.  Today the plastic top snapped so it will be difficult to hold and use it any longer.  I think a grater should last much longer than two years, especially if it rates so many stars.......

5783	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Initially I thought this was a good little machine for an apartment, even though it was very plastic and not solidly built. But then it started picking up less and less. I changed the bag--it started making a funny noise--and then quit, overheated. I fear trying to start it up again. I wonder if anyone else has had this happen.
6855	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I, like many people, have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep. I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted. I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new. I use mine and my son uses his, every night on low when we sleep. All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be. According to my kill-a-watt, this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low. You can calculate more from there if you would like. My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually. The only problem is like all my other fans, the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago. I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home.
Update (about 6 months later, from 3 stars down to 1 star)...
2809	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	It did not come with an owner' manual or a rack. Apparently they don't MAKE a rack for this size cooker (found that out AFTER I bought it).

5458	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I was excited about getting this vacuum cleaner as the reviews were good. Here is my take on it now I have owned it for a couple of months:
1214	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Having owned and used both the next size up mini-processor and the very big brother, when the motor failed on my old dlc-2, i immediately ordered this as a good replacement...well, that was wrong!!  First, this unit is smaller, and even a little smaller makes a big difference as you cant really fill these to the top. Second, this unit lacks the convenient bi-directional rotation of the next model up...this one has two speeds, but only turns in one direction.  To change from chop to grind, you have to remove the blade completely, turn it over and then reinsert it in the machine.  Finally, while this unit does nice work on very soft and very small items, it is not very good with any item of any size or hardness.  So, if you work mostly in small quantities with very small or soft ingredients, this is probably OK.  If not, spend a few more bucks and save yourself a lot of grief.  For $10 more, you get double the machine!!

1626	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great product
8153	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I really love these.  They really are all-purpose.  You can use them for chip bags, notes on the fridge, or just about anything else you may need a clip for.  I like the heavy plastic because cheaper versions tend to break it there is too much tension.
-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!

4050	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is my 2nd purchase of this vacuum, the first was 2007 and it only gave out because my new puppy chewed the cord. For the price, there is no better vacuum.  I have two dogs that seem to shed a third dog every week. It picks up everything and stands up to dragging it around the house, ripping the cord out of the wall and just general tough wear. I prefer vacuum bags over the new bagless vacuums since I use this to clean up absolutely everything.
7474	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We recently ordered and received another batch of these high-performance clips from Oxo.  We already had a set from years back.  I came to write a review and started scanning reviews and was startled at how many less-than-fair star ratings are accumulating and read them.  Well, almost all are of the nature of "you can buy binder clips for less" and one is from a consumer who was unhappy that the clips would not support kitchen TOWELS, another unhappy because they roll their snack bags and the clips couldn't accommodate the "girth" of the roll, if you will. DON'T be concerned about purchasing these clips, just look forward to receiving them.. they would make a nice small gift or a great little addition to a gift basket, we've had the first set for more than four years and they still look NEW, their grip is still secure, they brighten up the kitchen, they are easy to use, I've never had to clean them except for occasional "wipe-off", we already have our second set purchased very recently and they are just as outstanding as the old ones, let me put it this way:  The OLD ones are EQUAL to the NEW ones in EVERY way...how many times can you say that about an additional purchase of a favored item?? Buy without remorse, concern or guilt.  Especially if you prefer kitchen items that cheer up you and your kitchen rather than binder clips (which I despise unless forced to use binder clips for an inch or more of paper, I've been "snapped" by them countless times and furthermore they're not intended for kitchen use where moisture could occur (i.e., rust), also small children can't handle binder clips easily and the smaller ones could pose a problem..esp. for toddlers. I'm not for binder clips in the kitchen).  If there were a higher rating than five-stars I would give the highest rating possible to this product.  I just don't like to see product ratings that are low due to unrelated issues of the product.

Sure, you get something similar from Revere or Farber for a bit less money, but the all metal construction has a number of advantages.  First, the anonized aluminum heats quickly and evenly.  Actually, unlike most non-stick pans, this allows you to get it hot enough to properly brown ingredients.  Also, since it has metal handles, you can also put it in the oven or under the broiler.  Cheaper pans have plastic or rubberized handles that can melt.
4418	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this pressure canner specifically to cut my cooking time in the summer to keep the heat down inside my house.  The first thing I made was a batch of Garbanzo Beans/Chick Peas.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It was very easy to do.  The beans came out great and they tasted so fresh.  Next I made a pot roast.  Normally my pot roast takes 3 hours to cook.  Using the pressure cooker it only took 45 minutes of cooking time which is great for summer cooking.  I didn't care for the roast as much as my usual way of cooking it because it was a little tougher.  I'm not sure if that was because of the pressure cooker or because of the quality of the meat.  Either way I will do it again and just extend my cooking time.
Additional Comment:

It's not a full-fledged carpet vacuum, but it doesn't pretend to be.  If you have laminate, tile, hard wood floors, with maybe a few area rugs, you will love this machine.
Any Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on.

I had bought a stack of them, one for each house occupant's bedroom window. As it turns out I will return them all except for the one I opened which will be used downstairs. I'll be searching for another brand of fan that lets you choose quietness when you want it over maximum airflow. Frankly I can't believe they sent this product to market. Apparently Lasko DOES make a bad product sometimes.

This is your classic Rubiks cube but it is only about two thirds as big as your standard one. It also feels a bit different as well, the pieces flex a lot more than the real one as you manipulate them.
1360	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These worked great for my son's 12th birthday party. The boys had a blast with these in the pool. Quite a few were destroyed, but due to misuse (12 year old boys!!). The ones that are left have been used several times by my younger kids and are providing continuing entertainment. It was a good purchase for me.
Watch out for shipping though, I bought 6 packs and 3 of them leaked. Luckily they shipped fast so minimal liquid was lost, otherwise totally worth it when they're on sale.

6738	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	No, this fan won't cool your entire house during the summer months. It's a very basic, low-end fan - but it does provide substantial relief from the heat. I keep it on overnight in the bedroom which allows me to reduce reliance on the air conditioner. If it's pointed directly on you, you feel a huge difference. It won't drop temperatures too much on a room overall, but even if you aren't standing next to it, the air circulation is worth the price. I was able to get it for under $20 at a local store. I would definitely recommend this ultra-basic Lasko fan for anyone who wants to save money on the electric bill.
As far as style, it looks like almost every other one, but it does cook evenly, I use it often and like it. It arrived quickly and was used the next day. If you are looking for a good pressure cooker, try this one.

You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top, and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down, indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!

*they are cheaper than virtually any other option (except a few other similar clones.. they all are basically identical

5140	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The belt slipped off where it belongs fairly quickly, which happens with vaccums but when I opened it up to slip the belt back on everything sprang out and I couldn't get it back together. A professional vaccum fix it shop fixed it. Don't know if belt slipping was unusual or typical. It was a nicely powerful little vaccum as a 2nd vaccum for hardwood floors, which is why I bought it, before the belt popped off 2) Addition : The belt immediately popped off again rendering it useless. The 1st repair cost me $30, Doing that again I might as well replace it. Very disappointed.

It works well and makes beans much much faster than just plain old stovetop cooking. For a 1 pound bag of beans, presoaked, it takes about 10 minutes on my electric ceramic glass stovetop to build up to pressure, 5-10 minutes of cooking at-pressure, and then 5-10 minutes to let the pressure decrease on its own before opening. It makes delicious soft black beans and chickpeas. About the same amount of time for melt-in-the-mouth curry potatoes as well.  For rice, following the instructions in the manual, which involve using the included steamer rack, a ceramic or metal bowl, and aluminum foil to cover the bowl, it is about 30 minutes total, which is faster than my standalone electric rice cooker.
I can't recommend them enough, we wish we got them years ago!!!  Just make sure you open another window in the house so the air has somewhere to go.

If you use screws, use the template included with the fan, and try hard to be precise, leaving about 1/16 of an inch of space at the bottom when the fan is set in. The fan has a clever keyhole scheme for hanging it in the window, similar to the keyhole opening you use when hanging a picture on a single nail. Take the keyhole length into account when using the template or be ready to put paper towels or felt/foam rubber under the fan to stop rattle.

My second lasted only 3 years but that was because my child broke a wheel off of it (long story).  So when I had to find a replacement, I immediately just looked for another Mighty Mite.

7246	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm a bit of a geek about this stuff but this is everything you would want in a power strip. It's got both cable and phone cord protection, wide spaced plugs on one side for off shape plugs and color coded plugs on the other side. It comes with little color coded tags you put on the cords of your appliances so you know what you're unplugging when it's time to change something in the entertainment center. Extra long chord is just icing on the cake. Will be buying more of these later.
I recommend both of these products highly as they are a staple in our home!

5928	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Overall I like it, it does a great job cleaning the carpet and tile floors of my apartment. The cord is long and the long handle makes it easy to get cob webs or in narrow spaces. One only complaint is that it is a bit loud, but for the price and performance it is a small complaint.

1828	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I got the identical system, but a 6' shelf. The cupping of the brackets/braces (over the top, not under for support) means the shelf falls down after you add weight.  Makes no sense to me. Unusable, sadly.
4740	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love this little vacuum. Works great for quick small clean up jobs in kitchen. Over time the battery the battery doesnt hold charge
So, in conclusion, if you are looking for a strainer I recommend this one.  Granted it may be a bit pricey but it will definitely replace any need to buy different mesh strainers or for that matter a flour sifter.  The size is also ideal because you can do so many things with it without it being way to large or way to small.

3005	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Good enough for canning. Fits 6 pint sized mason jars. The knob on top is only a weighted vent cap that does not permanently fix to the lid. So if you're as unorganized as me be cautious to the possibility of losing this piece.

5086	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	After  initially loving this little vacuum cleaner, I am now very disappointed. The extender tube got stuck and remains closed, making it very difficult to vacuum since I have to bend over to reach difficult places.

It moves a lot of air. My biggest challenge is getting my wife to buy into the idea that opening one window 6 inches will cool the room faster than opening it all the way. The idea is to get a breeze sucked into the house, instead of having cool air just mill around at window boundaries.

I would highly recommend this vacuum for those of us that are getting up in years and don't want to be exhausted after doing vacuuming. The only 2 negatives are  that it doesn't come with  1) a power attachment for carpets and 2) the attachment hard plastic hoses are a little "chinzy" but I guess that would make a bit heavier to pull.

7082	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I was given the machine by a customer who wanted to throw out with some old appliances. Glad I kept this for myself after looking at pricing. I broke a $30 dollar blender while remodeling his home and had to replacce, not a bad trade! Easy to use, find a recipe, pour it in, add ice and salt in layers, plug in and leave it alone for 30 minutes. Wow, how hard was that and the kids love it for anytime 'I'm bored, theres nothing to do' days. Yes, I'd rather that more people buy only American made products, but this is almost impossible. And you have to have people who want to work to make all these products.  The maker I have was made in the USA and I am proud to say that I would have paid $200 plus or minus for it because of its original company location.  I would recommend this product to anyone with doubts about the 'cheap stuff'. Those trying to save money, you wouldn't have made it to this review anyway simply because the price would have scared you away.  Happy shopping and ice cream freezing yo!

I purchased the 'package' that includes a second battery, but I see that might not be needed.

The floor attachment is a little awkward to move around (especially in corners) and it only has a small opening, but the suction power is very good. The blower feature is not what I expected. Using it requires detaching the hose and the HEPA filter and reattaching the hose to the back of the unit. After all that it doesn't expel enough power to dust or do anything significant.

Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.

5549	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this vacuum!  When I first got it, I realized that it was picking up pet hair and dust that my fancy-schmancy canister vac with power brush had left behind.  My carpets are cleaner than ever, because instead of putting off getting out the heavy canister vac and lugging it around, Oh! My aching back! , I whip the Eureka out and clean small areas, often. Because it is light-weight and fun to use, I usually vacuum a larger area than I intended, take it to another room, etc..  So my entire house gets done and it seems effortless.  The run-time is great in my opinion, although I haven't run the battery down in a single use to see how long it actually lasts before needing a recharge.  The extra battery is sufficient for my needs, and the stand-by time seems to be good as well.
Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to move back and forth between the kitchen and the dinner table.

I supported the woodrack on a couple of thin concrete blocks about an inch or two off the ground so the rack and firewood stayed off the wet ground.  My wood rack has lasted over a year now in rain, snow, and sun and it's as solid and strong as the day I built it.  TIP:  I bought a small tarp and some bungee cords from the local DIY store to cover the top of my firewood rack; I screwed in some eye bolts directly into the lumber frame of my wood rack to hold the bungee cords in place.  The DIY solution was a lot cheaper than purchasing one of the larger 8-foot-long firewood rack covers available online.)

2997	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I was reluctant to buy a pressure cooker with a separate pressure rocker after having used one with a one-piece lid and pressure adjustment by only one hand. But I wanted stainless steel, big enough to make a batch of chili yet small enough to be frugal with shelf space. Another consideration was the weight of the kettle -- both empty and full. Though a larger size might seem more versatile, I decided I would use it less if it were heavy to "drag out." Budget was another consideration. I am very happy with the 4 qt Presto and would not change my mind about it at this juncture. I did also order a stainless steel basket and trivet to be able to cook more than one food without blending flavors. The insert that came with the pot was aluminum.

Update:  OK, not going back.  All the other yogurt strainers on the market aren't big enough or are too delicate.  This holds enough that I can strain 2 qts. of yogurt at a time in about 20 min. It allows some white thru but like I said above, I'm straining that thru the gold coffee filter into "cream cheese."  As far as storing it, I haven't had a chance to!

The light doesn't bother me since I only use it during the day.  I understand people's problem with them in the bedroom, though.

Long story short - this blade on this thing rusted and discolored badly the first time we put it through the dishwasher.  It's been through the dishwasher now probably 15 or 20 times and the blade is very discolored and continues to rust.  Given the cost and the brand name involved here I expected much more - I mean come on - what would a more premium stainless steel material have really added to the manufacturing cost here - 25 cents?...

This peeler is easy to handle, has a firm grip and takes off just enough cucumber, carrot, beet peel so that you're not throwing half the produce away.  I've shaved cheese with it and by golly it does a pretty good job.

I hope the stew recipe is in the new owner's manual. It was some of the best stew we've ever had. I love meals from a pressure cooker way more than meals from a crock pot anyway.
It's likely that over time, new versions of this machine will be marketed that improve on this one. In the meantime, this is a good, affordable, and reasonably reliable unit that exhibits how clever engineering can help to move us ever closer to that "perfect home-brewed cup of coffee."

* I built 2 sizes of wood racks 6 foot long by 4 foot high by 16 inch wide, and 8 foot long by 6 foot high by 16 inch wide. The brackets seemed best designed for the smaller 6'x4' wood racks.  I'm considering adding some wire cable to the top of the larger 8'x6' racks to help keep them square.
Highly recommended.
In terms of noise, this fan is as loud (no more, no less) as other whole house fans when run on high speed. You're going to get this loud hum with any unit that can move the air out of a whole house very quickly. On low, it's a mere whisper yet creates a noticeable air flow.

5520	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Hi. Let me start off by saying I was looking for a vacuum for the garage. It seemed to me that vacuuming is the most thorough way of removing dirt, sand, and debris from the garage as opposed to sweeping or using a compressor for blowing air. Of course, using our in house Dyson was not something that impressed my wife, and the shop-vac with the 6 foot cord and 5 foot hose didn't cut it. So I looked around a bit at cheaper upright vacuums, but ended up settling on this one for a couple of reasons- price, has a bag, the suction based on reviews.
5095	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love my vacuum, it has good pick up and helps to make my house work allot easier.
4995	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Arrived on time and as described!!
The handles are attached to the cooker with screws which can show early signs of rust if not taken care properly.

7100	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for my Mother who has an old canister vacuum from the 80s that needed this type of bags.  She could not find them in her small town and was told they could no longer be ordered.  She called me.  I found them here and ordered them.  Says they fit her vacuum perfectly.  As long as Mom is happy,.... :)
1149	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I wore out my original one, so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads, and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad, I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor, and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you, and I like small pieces of carrot in salads, not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces, dressing, and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one, except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking.

Without Me, probably the most popular song on the album (excepting possibly Cleaning Out My Closet which got a lot of airplay for the cleaned-up version), is my favorite.  But all the songs, with a few expeptions, are very entertaining.  This is not a CD for  which I find myself reaching for the skip button after every other song.
Makes my meat tender and flat ;)
If that was all, then i wouldn't be writing this review, but not only did some of the rice burn, but the bottom of the cooker BOWED OUT!  PErhaps it is the nature of the very dry climate I live in, but there directions didn't call for enough water, which allowed for the potentially dangerous situation that occurred. I have not felt that it was safe to use for pressure cooking since, so it has just become a regular pot.

The suction is average. The wheels on the part that is the floor/carpet attachment are such poor quality they leave marks on my hardwood. I often have to run over a scrap of paper 2-3 times before it is suctioned in.
5375	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The box looked taped up, the parts were all loose, the hose is so cheap it seems like it will constantly almost tear when it folds in half, it's hard to store in my pantry due to size/shape, the suction is not amazing, it does an ok job on my rugs, not great, perhaps I received a damaged item, but working in a hospice nursing bedside for months at a time, I had no way to cope with the return.

does a decent job for it size  more for light pickup then heavy cleaning but works well enough on my floors that I pull out the big vacuum half as much and my floors look cleaner like that the brush can be turned off for my tile floors  and have that the handle become detached for use in car ect

I use it mainly for kare kare(a Filipino dish), to ensure tender results with the oxtail. I just make sure to pan brown the meat before using the pressure cooker. I used it ribs and then broiled later for nice results. no need to have the perfect grill fire or spend hours with a slow cooker to achieve good results.

I am happy about "stainless steel" because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others.

581	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I waited to post this to ensure I would be accurate.  These have been in use since May 2014, on a timer where they come on at 8 pm and go off at 2 am.  I got them to run around the inside perimeter of my tiled porch, solely as a visual aid in checking for rattlesnakes (yes, they love our porch).  The bonus is the lights are soft and make sort of a lovely nightlight effect through our sliding glass doors, and provide sufficient  illumination when family members come home late at night, that they can see to put their key in the lock.  The lights have all stayed on, as near as I can tell, I have had no problems, the setup is 1) timer in wall outlet inside the house; 2) short extension cord from the outlet, out through the dog door, and to the light strand; 3) light strand looping along the walls of the porch.  The package came much more promptly than I expected, and I have had no problems with this product at all.  Oh yeah, there are sticky snake traps under the dog door and the barbecue grill, and these lights help me keep an eye on them, as well!
6011	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This piece of junk began well enough, actually cleaning as well as larger, earlier models.  After 2 months, however, the plastic snaps block so the heap filter sits ajar and does nothing.  Update: the POS died after a year, and I had to replace it, having already gotten a big supply of the bags.  The switch of the REPLACEMENT failed in a month or so. I used the switch from the first to repair the second.  Here is what I learned. The Communist slave labor camp further cheapened the vacuum by replacing the older switch (labeled in one photo here) with a smaller, cheaper switch (shown in a second photo here).  A C-ring held the older switch.  Plastic clips THAT DO NO FIT THE SWITCH are supposed to hold the newer switch.  I settled for using museum putty to hold the replacement switch in.

I use water from my Brita to fill this and also make 8 sizeable blocks of Brita ice from the disposable plastic containers that lunch meats come in.  I took it on a 3 night trip recently and the blocks of ice were still nearly 1/2 intact at the end of the trip.  I will fairly state though that the weather was a bit cooler than normal for the season and my campsite had complete shade.  As far as it being in a warmer environment for a 3 night trip I doubt the ice blocks would still be maintained, but am reasonably sure that the water would remain at least on the cooler side if kept out of the sun as much as possible.  If being used for a day trip on a very hot day you'd be fine with having the water ice cold all day with already cold water going into it with a few ice blocks.  I have a hitch mounted bike rack on my Jeep and when the bikes were removed it made a dandy place to hang it so that it could be easily accessed.

4065	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this pressure cooker to replace a 27 year-old Mirro 6 qt.  The Mirro still worked fine, but I have a flat top electric stove now, and after buying 2 pressure cookers for friends, I thought it might be time for me to update.  The Mirro had warped so that the bottom didn't sit flat on the cooktop.  I bought Warever for my friends, so I have 3 brands to compare now.  The Mirro, when under pressure, jiggled consistantly, to let you know there was pressure.  The Warever model builds pressure and then gives a little burst as it releases slightly.  This occurs every 20 seconds or so.  With the Presto cooker, the pressure indicator is the blue buttom on top which has 2 lines.  The first line indicates "low" pressure, and when you can see two rings there is "high" pressure.  I like that you have two settings of pressure.  It's easy and quiet.  At first I was waiting for the jiggle, but then I got to the part in the book that mentioned the blue button.  This cooker is HEAVY!!  Some people might have trouble holding it up with one hand.  I couldn't pour my food out while scraping to get the last goodness out. I really like the steaming basket.  You set a wire trivet in the bottom of the pan and set the steaming basket on the trivet.  I did cauliflower and broccoli on low pressure for 2 minutes.  I don't know how much I'll use the steaming basket, but it's a nice feature.  The first meal I made was sirloin steak, browned first and then cooked with carrots and potatoes in Golden Mushroom soup.  I did it for 17 minutes, and it was wonderful!  I browned the meat in the pressure cooker first, but I had a lot of meat so it took 3 batches to brown it all. Maybe I wouldn't have had to, but I felt that I should wash the cooker before I added the vegetables as there was cooked meat stuck to the bottom.  I have found that the cookbook for pressure cookers is a little light on the time for meats.  I do pork chops for 20 minutes, no less.  All in all, I think I will be very happy with this cooker.  I am looking forward to trying some new recipes as I pretty much do the same meals in my cooker.  I paid $39 at a closeout store.  READ THE BOOK, even if you're replacing a pressure cooker and think you know it all.  Each one is very different.
BTW:  To deaden vibration noise, etc. I hang the fan from 2 springs at the top of the window.  I noted that with the fan running I could feel air being sucked in from outside around the sides of the fan so I've made a clear plastic shroud to block these areas for greater efficiency.  I've also taped bits of this plastic on the 4 corners of the inside grill wher some more air circled in & out.

-absinthe or absinthe substitute
After using the cup for a few days I decided that I didn't want the nylon handle. I simply used a heat gun (on low) to gently heat it up and just pulled it down and off of the cup.
In practice, however, this scoop is just a pain in the butt. Whatever you're scooping ends up under the lever, which goes back down after you've ejected the food from the scoop. So, when you take it out of the dishwasher, the food under the lever has turned into a pretty disgusting blob.
5697	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great vacuum for the price. We replaced a $500 Dyson with this and like it a lot better. The Dyson always smelled bad (we have 2 short haired dogs). We hated the bag less design which means always we always need to touch and handle the dirt. This vacuum is smaller, lighter, and just as powerful as the Dyson but cost $50. I added a telescoping wand and a sanataire heavier duty hose after about three months. My kids use the vacuum and abuse it so the standard hose was getting bent up and crimped. With the extra parts this cost about $120. Have had it for about 6 months and still love it. The bags are really large and super cheap, no more smell and dirt handling. We have all hardwood floors. This would not be a good option for carpet.

By the way: it does its scooping job just fine, but the lever problem is so glaring that it isn't worth it.

Eminem blasts several people, from President Bush, to Moby. Even Elvis doesn't go unnoticed. ofcourse, that's the fun of having a new Eminem Cd, is to see who, and how many people get slammed.

I gave this holder four stars for one reason only, which is that being exclusively plastic it is vulnerable to fatigue cracking of the mounting cylinder, which requires replacement of the unit.

The first feeling you get as you assemble the vacuum is that it feels cheap, however it's simple to put together and has very good suction.. enough for the vacuum head to stick to the floor! I use it on my laminate floor and on rugs (a push of a button will switch it to rug mode). All the functions are simple.. I just step on the power button to start and it will click on or off. Overall the vacuum is very light.. the parts are light and easy to pull around and easy to maneuver. Wish it had a self winding function but you can only be so lazy. I use it on a daily basis since I have laminate flooring covering most of the house and sweeping will take forever.. and I'm very glad I bought this item!

But one day in the doctor's office, I saw a clip of an asthma prevention program in California and they were recommending Eureka because unlike other vacuums, it doesn't blow the dust back out. Although this is not the exact same model, I like the portability of a cordless and it's a strong vacuum.  I have two dogs and I can get the whole apartment clean and it doesn't even lose its charge so I haven't used the spare battery yet.  It's easy to maneuver and there are two settings, one for carpet and one for bare floors.  It's also relatively quiet.

I love this fan and may even buy another one
November 2012 Update:  This server is still going strong, 5 years later (and many times through the dishwasher), and it was just top-rated AGAIN by the folks at Cook's Illustrated!  Can't go wrong with this server, and at such a good price, too.
When it first arrived and I removed it from the box, I was a bit disappointed in how flimsy it looked. The wheels are small, hard plastic and I was worried that they might scuff up the new floor. After assembling it (which literally took like one minute) we put it to the test. The floors turned out fine... spotless and with NO scuff marks! The Mighty Mite packs a punch and has great suction, especially for something so small. I don't know what I was really expecting from it (I mean it IS a vacuum and the primary job of a vacuum IS to suck), but it certainly delivered.
At this price this thing is a STEAL.  Thinking about buying a second one so I can cook two things at once. badda bing!

Unlike the breakdown of the different BMC models the check sheet on this listing page only has the one foot tool that comes with this BMC 1547 but in reality it has both right in the box. You have one that is made for rugs that is vacuum only, and a second one that is made for hard floors such as tile and hardwoods and that one contains a beater brush to pick up the stuff that may be minimally attached to the floor. The bristles are very fine, almost silk like so as to not scratch your polished/shiny floor surfaces. They interchange very simply. The Eureka has two heads as well; one they call the bare floor nozzle and the other that they call the deluxe floor brush is really an open rectangle at the bottom with a brush material around the circumference that does not act like a beater spinning head like the BMC has.

3183	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The Presto 6 qt. pressure cooker is a timeless piece of kitchen equipment. This is a simply constructed appliance: the simplicity is a strong point for this product.  The pressure controller is a weight that sits on a small tube on the center of the lid. As long as the opening is intact it will always keep the correct pressure. The safety plug is a small rubber insert that sits to the side. If the cooker over-pressures this safety will pop out.  When the pressure cooker is pressurized the little plug protrudes, showing there is still pressure in the pot. An interlock, a small metal plug that internal pressure pushes up, prevents the top from being removed if there is pressure in the pot.  Therefore the mechanics of this unit are drop dead reliable.

If your window opens side to side, the height of the window on the inside ledge should be at least 26.5 inches and less than 34 inches. You need to be able to open the window at least 18 inches wide, preferably 20. They say this is a 16 inch fan, but that's the blade width. The basket is a little over 18 inches. You can screw the fan into the window, if your wife will let you. For some reason wives seem to object more to screw heads sticking out in the horizontal plane of a window than the vertical. It will work just fine to wedge the fan by turning it 90 degrees and extending the side panels appropriately. The side panels can be precisely set--they have two screws on each side. You may want to put some foam rubber or other soft material along the edge of the panels to reduce vibration--I didn't find it necessary.

3700	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've owned and used a 4 quart pressure cooker for 38 years and have been delighted that parts are still easy to get for it.  So when I decided that I needed increased cooking capacity, I was happy to see that the current models are similar to the one that I bought in 1974.

5361	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Could not be more satisfied.  Purchased two of them so that we always have one "at the ready."  Easy to use, no need to look for where to plug something in.  Keeps our place clean of the residue from our beloved cats.  Excellent product.
4554	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time,  and based on its performance,  I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well.  We are very pleased.  This is a good product,  but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results. I was raised with Presto pressure cookers, and have used others.  None have performed better, in my opinion.  The reasonable price is an added bonus.

7971	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A nice little zester to have in the kitchen.  I'm not a bartender- I use it to garnish desserts.  This little guy is capable of making two kinds of ribbons of zest- and makes both kinds very well and easily.  I especially appreciate that when I give it to novice cook it doesn't allow them to dig into the white pith of the citrus- this zester stays on the surface so you only get the colored (not bitter) zest.
370	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love them!
7217	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Love the color coding and labeling.  Has three widely separated outlets for adapters and five color coded outlets.  A little difficult to mount and no screws included.  Should have come with a mounting template.  Great price.  Hope I never find out if it works during a surge.  I replaced all my battery backups with surge protectors as power failures or brownouts caused the alarms to drive my dogs crazy and I realized that I had nothing that I would need to save.  Now that we have smartphones, having wifi available during a power failure is less necessary and the battery backups only last 10 to 15 minutes.
2843	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Assembled easily, looks to be good and strong but lighter in weight than the last stainless steel pressure cooker I had ~ many years back. Very happy so far! I cooked once with it and was pleased.
3874	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto, missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks.
8728	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Serrated edges so don't need to dirty a knife.  Very flexible to easily remove that first slice. Overall sturdy kitchen tool.  Bought this one for a friend who loved mine!  Hard to find these in stores.
Great value and nice looking. Easy to clean. So far, durable (3 months).
Now I have bought another 6- quart Presto pressure cooker. It is a breeze to use. I only took off one star because after using it, there was a dark mark left on the inside which took quite a bit of elbow grease and still hadn't come off. So while it doesn't affect the cooking, it is not easy to clean completely. Otherwise I love it.

7272	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My great-aunt in Texas called me to complain that she could no longer buy vacuum bags for her old hoover CANISTER vacuum cleaner. Like low flat circle. Not upright. Like bought in the seventies. Her last technological update was the microwave- no dvd player, no computer, no cell phone. I suggested she buy a new one but she said she did and she hates it so she went back to her still powerful hoover CANISTER. Being the wonderful great-neice that I am, I put her on speaker phone on my cell phone and looked they bag type up on amazon. And then ordered the bags and sent them to her with free 2 day shipping. My aunt was impressed, stunned and now feels like she owes me a lot of money for the sorcery that I performed. Thank you hoover for still making these old bags and thank you amazon for making this order possible and for making my great-aunt's day :)

4287	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a very basic, yet powerful vacuum cleaner...I find it a little hard to maneuver sometimes, as the hose is a little cheap.  But, I wanted a hepa filter on my vacuum without spending tons of money.  There is a weird flow adjusting hole that hurts if your finger gets sucked into it, but I covered it with several layers of black electrical tape, which has worked fine.  The pet paw works well on upholsterey and some rugs.  I wish it had a retractable cord, but it is such a good vacuum cleaner, I can overlook it not having bells and whistles.  I like the compact size too...stands on end in the closet.  I've had it for about 3 years now with no issues...one of my siblings has a $600 Miele, and I honestly don't like it as much as my Might Mite, fwiw.  The hepa filter is barely showing any dust, so the bags I ordered are working well too.
5987	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The suction on this little machine is unreal.  Sure, the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around, parts will break.  But if you are careful and don't step on the hose, you'll find this is a gem.  I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.  The 'carpet' feature totally cleans these rugs.  The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.  And the price?  OMG, if it quits in 2 years, I will have gotten my money's worth.

1989	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	They work.
8523	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A quality item.
lid fits nice and snug. metal thickness is not like an old pressure cooker I used to have which seemed to have a little over 1/8"+ thickness for both the lid and the pot. the handles are plastic and feel somewhat light for the size and weight of the pot their attached to. you can tighten the attachment screws more, but don't want to risk cracking the plastic. additionally, you gotta remember the intended purpose of this pot is "pressure cooking", so some heat and PRESSURE expansion is to be expected.  works as advertised and follow the instructions.
I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.
4269	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We use these in the pantry and garage kitchenette and they are wonderful and strong, but really cost way too much.
Also important, these colanders are finely-meshed, so even small items (including the tiny ball bearings I use to clean glass bottles) won't fall through. Because they dry quickly, I can leave nectarines or other fruit in them after rinsing without worrying.
6401	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this with the vacuum, just in case. So far I haven't needed to use it, but glad to have it on hand.

4307	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I would have given it five stars, but the handle feels just a little flimsy, seeing as how you have to lift the not-insubstantial-weight of the pot with it.  I'm hoping it will hold up, despite my misgivings...  Aside from that, I love this cooker.  In my experience, the little cooking guide that comes with it is useful, but you'll have to mess around with times a bit to figure out what works best.  Though the guide doesn't give cooking times for most unsoaked beans, you CAN cook them that way...however, the resulting gas will make you pay wretchedly for skipping that step!  I've decided not to cook lima beans in this cooker...the foaming out past the regulator was too nerve-wracking.  Cooking potatoes for mashing is a five minute snap (after the initial pressure-build time), and sweet potatoes cooked in this pot were especially flavorful.  Would I buy this again?  Sure would.

7831	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	For years Ive been using vegetable peelers that I now know were junk!  I was visiting my sister and she had this peeler and I couldn't believe the difference. I had to order it right away. The blade is very sharp and it takes little effort to peel the veggies. In fact the first carrot I did I took off twice as much as I needed because I was so use to pressing down hard as I peeled with my former peelers.  Oxo has done a great job on another kitchen tool.  Bonus is that it also comes with a blade guard which is good since the blade is so sharp,
The blower function, while not super powerful, can be used for light duty needs, especially if you hook the crevice tool to concentrate the flow.  Hey, its amazing it even has a blower function at this price, so be happy!

5782	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Small, powerful, convenient, simple.  This is a great vacuum!  True, there's no beater brush, so you don't get a 'deep' clean, but for everyday cleaning, it's great for carpets, hard floors, and convenient for everything from stairs to vehicles.

Bottom line...surge bars are great for lightning protection...but if you think you have varying electrical voltage that is causing electronics damage on your system, get a plug-in voltage meter and check your provider's supply throughout the day for a few days.  If it goes over 130-volts at any time, notify them of this, and start looking for a regulated power supply or voltage regulator. These surge bars are NOT voltage regulators.

5447	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Works for bare flooring.  I was hoping to use it for quick pet hair pick up but it is really weak for that.  Basically it is a dust-buster with a handle and flimsy brush attached.  Takes a LONG TIME to charge.  Not worth it.

504	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	They cost more than they should: Limited availability on Amazon  -- I'll be d4mned if I'll go to a 'party' to get them -- but they're a pretty solid solution for dressings and other small condiments for lunch bags. I've used two sets of them over the last 5-6 years. Other then 'losing' them to school lunches, they haven't failed yet.
The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.
they are remarkably cheap and if you amortize the cost over-let's say-
3458	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works like a charm, easy to clean and quiet but loud enough to hear the jiggling weight. Just the right size for the 2 or us and a guest too.

Also, after thoroughly washing the thing, it still left heavy duty staining in the pot after the not so boiling boil... I think it may have been manufacturing oil leftover but it seemed like it just came out of the bottom of the thing, as if it seeped out of the metal.
So, before my only 2 fans die, I have to go out and find another one, but I have a hunch that most of the stuff out there is crap anyway.

I have been buying body scrub from my local nail care place because I switch around scrubs to get a different scent for different times of the year.  But I have been using this for brand and scent for almost 9 months.  The scent is not overwhelming, but nice to get a hint of oranges all day.  I use the scrub every other day or so and especially after I get out of the pool...helps rid of the chlorine smell even after showering.  It is not harsh at all.  Paired with the lotion and oil, I get extra hydration and the scent all day long. (PS...my skin type is generally dry in the summer and normal to oily in the winter months.  I don't have sensitive skin either, so I have had no issues).

2356	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Worst pressure cooker I ever  bought. Bottom does not tolerate high heat, food burns to bottom which is too thin. I had to give it away since I had to throw out burnt food three times. I will never buy this item again. I would actually like to get a refund, since it cost me a lot of time to clean the burnt bottom and money to replace the burnt food. When recipe asks for 2 cups of water, you actually need 4 cups to avoid burning of bottom.

Though it's not billed as a quick release PC or commonly reviewed as one; you can fairly safely lift the weight off with a silicon mit (safer I dare say than I've seen some that are considered quick release). I'd even dare to do it bare handed as the metal under it is hot (don't touch), but the plastic part of it hasn't gotten too hot to touch. I have the fingers of a professional cook and have touched the metal part w/o getting burned, but it is freaking hot. It's not like the handles get too hot to carry it to the sink anyway (if it's available).

2457	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love how fast you can cook things in pressure cookers!  I keep hearing about electric ones, but this one works great for me!  I've been looking up recipes and just continue to be amazed.  I can't say I've lost all my fears using it, but I haven't had any problems and this is my first one.  I think I got a too big one for me and my needs, but oh, well. I do have staining in the bottom after using it, but apparently that's normal and doesn't bother me.  I live in a place with hard water and maybe that's contributing to it also.  I really like cooking potatoes in here and am just beginning to learn all the things this can do.

It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.

Used on exhaust, this fan can pull a lot of air though the house overnight, in fact it is usually downright chilly before dawn!  I'm home most days, so if it's going to be warmer than mid seventies during the day, I let the house cool off as much as it can overnight and just dress warmly in the morning, then change into something cooler as the house warms up later in the day.  The $$ I've saved in electric bills more than makes up for the trouble of changing clothes or taking off a fleece cardigan.

6107	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	UPDATE at 3/8/13:  I'm still disappointed with the function of the accessories, but the suction is really good.  So I've decided to make do until the bags I purchased are used up.  I still had the floor tools from my deceased Dirt Devil canister, and they work okay with this vacuum. I only use the Eureka floor tool in the storage room and garage where my cats spend the night. It works okay on the vinyl/concrete/utility rugs, and on the carpeted cat scratcher.
If you are trying to decide whether to get a pressure cooker in general, I would encourage you to go for it. Most weeknights, I am too impatient to wait for time-intensive things like tomato sauce, stew meat, root veggies cut into chunks, lentils, risotto, or even just tender cabbage. Pressure cookers prepare these things quickly and make them taste like they've been cooking forever. Most of the pressure cooker recipes I use take 30-40 minutes total for prep and cook (I usually make soup in this cooker), so it's become a life saver when I come home from work late.

I have 2 sets, one black & one white, and I just ordered a 3rd set in multicolor. They're great for all kinds of food bags: coffee, cat food, cereal, pasta, rice, anything that comes in a bag. I have one on my front door to hold notes or letters to be mailed. I have one on my refrigerator for notes & grocery lists. I use them in my home office as giant paperclips to hold stacks of papers. I use them in the bathroom on bags of cotton balls & other supplies. There seems to be no end to the uses!
9198	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love this thing! So much easier than trying to dry salad with paper towels as I'd been doing previously. To get best results, I've found it helps to only fill it partway and to do a couple of spins. That's still way easier than paper towels in my opinion. The brake mechanism works well, and it's handy to be able to serve the salad out of the main bowl once you're done spinning.

It's simple to use, works well and while I considered buying another so I'd be able to pressure cook more than one food at a time, I'm able to cool most foods so quickly that I just put them in another dish and pressure cook the next thing - all in minutes!

5169	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I gave it two stars because the suction was great, and I loved how lightweight the canister vacuum was compared to others, but I am going to end up donating this one. The attachments have a poor design, and I am constantly having to reattach the tubes because the slightest twist causes them to come out. The ring that adjusts the power of the suction keeps sucking in my shirt, which I also have to keep pulling away from the vacuum. I wanted to really love this, and I gave it an honest try. I even tried duct taping the tubes together. This vacuum has made me hate this chore even more than I already do though. I will have to try something else.
I might have sprung for the next size up, but I couldn't afford the 100 bucks, not to mention, the motors wouldn't match up with the one's I'd purchased so far, IMO.  I just waited until amazon.com was selling this and pounced on it (due to the low price). I'm happy with these and will probably continue to purchase these if they are still made.  These fans really move the air in our house and I firmly believe they do work better when at least two are involved (one in, one on out or sometimes both on out with other windows in the house open) I'm lucky to have double doors in the "two fans room" that open up to allow a wide birth for the air to flow through.

The size and functionality really looked like it would fit the bill but it has failed an most counts.  It is louder than most vacs, it puts out heat like a heater!.  The hose is obnoxious because of the amount of care it takes to fool with it.  Worst hose I've ever used because it pinches closed easily. The attachments are singular visions.  Someone has thought up attachments that could be revolutionary but are just harder to use. And the wand.  When I use it I get scratched walls.

We gave this to our son for Christmas at 2.5 years old.  He got some flashier toys but he instantly wanted to play with this.  It's been great fine motor work as he learns how to screw/unscrew the caps, squeeze the dropper to squirt water or puffs of air, etc.  We haven't used food coloring yet but that's up next.

As other customers have already stated, the cost of these extensions other places is utterly ridiculous. I found this to be so true; to the point where it became nothing short of price gouging.

The built in channel knife for garnishing is a convenient addition you can use on chocolate and other foods to produce the perfect decoration every time. Its sharp blades never seem to need sharpening, and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional zesters do.
8920	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the second time I've bought this exact grater, I think it does a good job. I particularly like the flexibility of being able to use just one side over a bowl. The feet don't slide, and being able to break it down and store flat is a huge plus in my book. The first one lasted apx 5 years and got very heavy use as I buy my cheese in big blocks, then grate and freeze in portion sizes. It handled both softer cheese like cheddar, and harder such as parmesan with equal ease. The first one eventually snapped where the bottom of the grating grid attaches to the plastic, which is a design weakness I feel. But, considering even graters dull over time and the amount of use it got, it was probably time for a new one anyway. I was pleased to be able to find the exact same product to replace the one that served me so well and confidently expect years of use out of it.

The later half of the album contains a few tracks that really deserve to be singled out.  `Sing for the Moment' is one of Eminem's better tracks to use samples.  The Aerosmith sampling is perfectly suited for the song and it elevates Eminem's message.  `When the Music Stops' is insanely fierce from start to finish.  `Till I Collapse' is also very strong, and Nate Dogg's chorus lines give the song an almost vintage feel.  I love his voice and the way he lends a touch of class to every track he inhabits.  `My Dad's Gone Crazy' is a great way to close out the album.  Having Hallie on the track seems a tad odd, especially when you consider the things he says in this song, but it's a playful song that is slathered with humor, so don't take this track too seriously.

The pressure valve that sets on the top is different than what I am used to because I have always had the adjustable kind- 5, 10 and 15lbs of pressure. This one says it is preset but I cant find any information about what it is preset to!

The hose does tend to become flimsy with a lot of bending and usage at the part right beneath where you grab it, so it pinches sometimes now. Whoever wrote a review that it has weak suction probably hasn't noticed the 'suction power' control by the handle, where you can 'vent' or open by sliding to reduce or increase suction power. I find this as a useful function when I do area rugs.

We bought this Eureka Mighty Mite based on reviews on Amazon and received it yesterday.  I am in shock, literally, at how well it cleaned.  First, the throw rugs, of which we have many, on the Pergo flooring.  It cleaned them without sucking them off the floor or 'inhaling' a strand of carpet fiber which then stops the vacuum as our larger one does. It actually balled up so much cat hair (that I had not seen), that I had to remove the floor tool and suck it off the carpet with the wand.  Then, it was a breeze getting all of the cat litter off the floor that had been tracked out of the two big litterboxs.
6808	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This cooler not only looks good, but is very well made.

  The containers are solid, hold more than you would think and keep your belongings dry if outside in the rain or snow when inside the container.  The latch to close seems solid, I am very rough on stuff, I work in construction and often have tools rolling about the bed of truck, I intend on buying two more of these, one to hold emergency supplies and the other for camping supplies this summer.  The money spent on these is reasonable, one of these is equal to 10 of the average plastic containers with the cheap lids that never fit right. I highly recommend these for a variety of uses. On long road trips, I will tie it down with a bungee cord to hold it in place better. It is also very solid and makes a good makeshift seat when outside.

For a vacuum that is supposedly for pet clean up, it's inability to handle cat hair without clogging is a major fail.  IMO this is a waste of money.  They could have rounded that angle so that it doesn't cause that problem, but it's a relatively sharp angle, so it clogs.

I have learned that I need to move the vacuum more slowly than is my wont, to give the brushes plenty of time to sweep up the pet hair.  This vac does not do corners and edges well, but one can't have everything.
Considering the OXO version is more expensive than other options, I would request my money back, but I spent so much time trying got get it to work, it is even more dull and useless than when I started.

I have zero worries about damaging this box while strapping down for travel.  The only thing lacking is better handles.  Moving this box around when full is difficult to do along because there are no true handles on the 30 gallon model.

3896	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Just received this unit, and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design, on the other hand, is much more simplistic, which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage), and is a preferable design.

Now here is a super biggie for me; the auto rewind cord. This is where the two really are on a separate planet. The BMC has a cord that is spring wound to wind up IN the housing instead of wrapped around it. So at any time you can extend the cord to as much as you need, and when you are done, and this is huge you simply step on the large silver auto-retract knob and the BMC automatically sucks the cord up into its body. I have found from experience with the Eureka that has one of those two paddles on the bottom that you have to manually wind the cord up with it. Most often I find it with the cord wrapped around the body, or not wrapped at all strewn all over the closet. Did I mention that the BMC not only has a retractable wand but the cord storage is a lot better?

Cooking with this is a breeze.  I searched on-line for instructions and made up some great beef stew first try.  I tried a different set up on my second try- and had the best beef stew I ever had.  I have made a number of other dishes and everyone has been great and cooked fast.
Good points

I went for this 16" and it does the job just as quietly as the 20". Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS.

So, I would not stretch it any, but I do recommend this gasket. Now, I just need to get a few more...for backup!

1853	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I suspect that Amazon is mashing a bunch of our reviews for slightly different products into one list of reviews, so take this with a grain of salt- you may be looking at gasket XYZ, and I intended it to be written for gasket 123. But, I bought the Mirro 9882 gasket to go with a 1983ish Mirro Pressure Cooker, style M-0622. When it arrived, I was concerned because it seemed to be too big to fit properly by about an inch. I was mad. I had followed instructions exactly, and it seemed way too big to work. But, the packaging all swore it was the right thing, and I had some time to kill so I did a pressure trial. It did leak in the beginning stages and seemed to take a long time to get to pressure, but it eventually totally stopped leaking and did get up to the 15 lbs pressure I was aiming for. I let it depressurize normally. When I took the lid off, I was shocked and amazing to find that now the gasket fit perfectly. It works great and comes up to pressure much more quickly than it did the first time.
8386	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We had for a long time a very thin, cheap flexible stainless pie server. It has disappeared and maybe we'll find it when we move. Trying to serve pie without a pie server was messy and frustrating. I saw the Test Kitchen recommended this one and I like OXO, so I went for it. It works very well. It does have the advantage of serrated edges, so you don't need a knife to cut the pie like with our old one. I would like it to be a little more flexible to slide under the pie like our old one, but it does work very well and it does have the serrated edge so it's a good trade-off.

This little "mighty mite" packs a big punch.  Superb suction, compact and light weight, but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful, and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum.
Ok sounds like I don't like this Vac. BUT I love it so far. Yes it has all the cons above but the suction on this is fantastic and that is all I really need and want anyways.

I began using this in mid/late July, and from the beginning it did not expel the cork smoothly at all; I've had to "unwind" it to get the cork off after each use. Then a few weeks ago, it became very jammed and won't easily open bottles either. The corkscrew has been stored safely on a shelf, not dropped or messed with in any way. For a $90 corkscrew, that's just not good. I've reached out to their customer service to see if they think this is a defective product I got, or if this is more common. I'd previously had a corkscrew (may even have been a Screwpull) that was amazing and lasted 10+ years.

I use it all the time.  I like to make my tomato sauces from canned whole tomatoes and I want to get a better texture than just chopping would do.  I use this masher and essentially cream the tomatoes to the texture I want depending on the recipe.  I use it for chili, for soups, pretty much anything I use tomatoes with.  I use it to mash beans and other vegetables, too.  I especially like it for twice cooked potatoes.  I use small red potatoes and parboil them.  I then put them on a baking sheet, mash them down slightly with this masher, and sprinkle with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper and then bake them at 375 until they start turning golden brown (around ten minutes.)  Top with chopped parsley and they are really yummy.

We recently installed brand new hardwood floors in the first level of our house and our original vacuum was beginning to damage the finish (and has since been banished to the carpeted upstairs) so we had to look in to buying a new vacuum good for hardwood floors. After quite a bit of searching and comparing different brands and models we settled on the Mighty Mite.

But while I appreciate the implied durability of steel, it's also been easily scratched, which mars the picture-perfect smoothness that Oxo uses at the onset to appeal to purchasers. Yes, I can scour out the blemishes, but hello, that's down around #231 on my list of things to do with my time. More importantly, I find the handle awfully short in proportion to the spoon-ish part. With such a deep bowl to it, I'm not sure what the spoon's function is actually intended to be. It kind of wants to be a ladle but is relegated to subbing for a wooden spoon. I bought this while I was living with my parents and left it there when I moved out. Haven't missed it. But then again, four stars because, hey, it's a spoon.

2226	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Was a great fan....but totally died when we tried to use it for the third summer.  Totally disappointed!
Since the nozzle on this unit is only four inches wide, it took a while to do the whole area by the door (maybe 30 minutes for 20 square feet), but the smaller spots took no time.  Once I got used to the motion of cleaning it went more quickly.  You do two 'wet' passes while holding the trigger, which squirts out the hot water and cleaning solution in a fan pattern; then a few 'dry' passes (sans trigger) to suction up the water...you can see through the clear nozzle when there is no more water being taken up. The suction is quite powerful and leaves the carpet just a tad damp... my carpet dried in about an hour.
This is a winner.

Also looks like they improved airflow through the motor, widened the commutator so it has less of a load on it, and put periodic groves in it, presumably to lengthen its life. I'm impressed that they continue to improve the product. The unit is Very serviceable, opening with 4 easily accessible Philips screws.

Yes the tubes do come apart once in a while but it's not a problem.  I take them off to use as tubes to get behind things anyway.  The package was a Eureka box within a Amazon box and there was no damage. The vacuum head is actually an improved version with a carpet/bare floor foot pedal now, which is really great.  This vacuum may seem loud but it has the greatest suction which is adjustable by a cut out sliding valve on the elbow tube handle (good for reducing suction to keep from sucking a throw rug off the floor). I use this on my tile and wood floors along with the rugs I have laid out.  I use a Sanitaire upright for my wall to wall carpet since it has a beater bar and more suction.  The cord is Loooong which is a good thing.  The power on and off switch is durable so you can use your foot to turn it on and off.  I will now use the older one as a garage/car vacuum so I don't have to lug the new one around.

As another reviewer stated, the easiest way to clean rugs is to start further away from where you are standing and pull the floor piece toward you, rather than trying to push it like a conventional upright vac. Other than the rug, I have all hardwood floors and it did amazingly well getting on them as well as the walls, blinds, windowsills etc. I would not recommend for large wall to wall carpeted areas as that would be far too much work for you and the vac.

5277	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I got this to use on hard surfaces to replace a stick vac I wasn't completely happy with.  It works surprisingly well, much better than its predecessor.  Suction on hard surfaces is very good.  You can vacuum upholstery with it although it takes a bit more work than an upright.  The upholstery attachment is not as good as the one that came with our upright.  Fortunately they're interchangeable. The floor attachment is articulated so it can get under cabinets easily.  It's a bit more cumbersome than a stick vac but it's light enough to carry when doing stairs.  Like almost every non upright I've ever used the cord is not quite long enough to cover each story of a 1600 sq ft 2 story house without using an extension cord.  I find myself opening the shutter that you can use to moderate the suction accidentally because it's in a place where it's most natural for me to grip the wand.  I'm 5' 10" with long arms and may not fit the human factors profile the designers used.  I may tape it shut if I can't train myself not to open it.
9733	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this awhile ago. It was great, while it lasted. But then it started to break. The plastic piece at the ends of the arms is the failure point.

Here's what I don't like. Everything about a bagless design is horrible. Don't even think about removing the dust cup indoors. March the entire vacuum outside and take note of wind direction before you remove it. Another issue is the amount of dust this kicks up. Remember, for fifty bucks this isn't sucking up fur balls that are 4 inches away, so it's not sucking up everything the beater brush kicks up.

This is a good quality tea and will last a long long time. You brew 2 tsp of this loose tea in a pot of boiling water.

I would highlight the Sing for the Moment track as a standout as I believe it is the first time that Em used a classic rock track as the foundation of a song, an awesome trend he would continue in the future.

While it is a little shy of the MMLP standard, it is still a tremendous cd and well worth the listen if you are an Eminem fan.

I tried it on short nap carpet tiles, and it does fine; you can maneuver around ok, but would not be suitable for regular cleaning since it doesn't brush the pile.  On medium plush and thick oriental rugs, you can pull it toward you, but sweeping it around would take more energy than I care to put into housework, and again, since it doesn't have a rotating brush, it would not be suitable for regular cleaning.
5936	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I recommend this vacumm for anyone with bare floors.  Over the years I've bought several combo over priced vacuums.  Enough!  This one is light, compact and with a very strong suction power.  I don't like the brush that comes with it because the opening at the bottom is very small so one might think the vacuum is not good but in reality the design of the brush is poor.  I bought one of the hairy brushes that was suggested when I bought the vacuum.  This wills make your experience with this vacuum incredible.  I now vacuum my house in less that 15 min and love seeing my floors without dust bunnies (and hair) all over.

1050	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My husband and I received the Screwpull as a wedding gift, but if we ever lost if, we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one! I have always had a hard time with traditional corkscrews (eg. twisting the screw in crooked, so that the cork is sure to crumble), so the addition of the Screwpull to our home was most welcome! This device is wonderfully easy to use -- uncorking a bottle of wine takes little more than a second or two! It comes with a handy foil cutter, which removes foil neatly and cleanly, so that the screw has no trouble getting into the cork (wax-topped corks are no problem!) We have a friend who thought the Screwpull was so great, she insisted on opening the wine whenever she was visiting! This is a perfect gift for the wine enthusiast.

After a spell of not being able to find a new Mighty Mite, I was pleased to see that a new model, less sleek in design, and yellow in color was available in the current 2010 market.  I bought it.  Today was it's test run.  Vacuumed fine, plenty of suction.  But when I went to try the blower I was in a panic.  It has about 1/5th the blow power that my previous Mighty Mites had.  Surely enough to blow out a candle, but that's about it.  Probably less air flow than a hair drier.  I spent some time to see if maybe I connected it wrong. No.  What I did notice is that much of the air was escaping from the back end before it even got to the blower connection.  exactly where all the escape holes were I could not tell, but my first suspect was someplace in the area of the large wheels.

5182	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a terrific little vacuum that does exactly what I wanted. No, it's not going to be your primary vacuum unless you live in a tiny apartment with all hardwood floors, but as a tool for a quick clean-up, it just can't be beat. I live in a large house with hardwood and stone tile floors, and several long-haired cats, so I pretty much have to do a quick clean-up every day, and for that, the Eureka Quick-Up is perfect. It's surprisingly powerful for such a small device, and its 10-inch head is large enough to make short work of a decent-sized room, but small enough to fit under dining room chairs, so you don't have to be moving any furniture. And with two batteries, you don't have to worry about running out of power. For the price, this little vacuum is a winner, outperforming models that cost several times as much in any number of online tests. Highly recommended.

I use this several times a day. We have three long haired cats and when I empty the cup once a week I get several inches of fur on the filter and it was still picking up. It's used on rug and bare floor surfaces and it does an admirable job on both. If I had a wish list - 1. that the beater bar came off and it was just the nozzle at the end to use it to clean the car, etc. 2. That the filter was a little easier to get back together. There is a rubber seal that just has to be really pushed down hard to get the cup/filter to snap back in. Other than that this is a terrific little very lightweight vac that this disabled woman is happy to have available until hubby can pull out the big vac on the weekend. This one has the extra battery pack. This is essentially a necessity as it takes quite a long time for the battery to charge and one only lasts about 20 min of run time with the brush roll running (which for me ends up being all the time).

Plus, putting that much pressure on the plastic housing of the sweeper tool every time it needs to be removed or attached is bound to break it in no time. ( when I say pressure, imagine this: when the sweeper tool pulls off, if I leave it there on the floor and stick the pole back in and lean on it with my full body weight to make the 2 pieces stay attached, it STILL  comes easily apart. ) We discussed trying to add duct tape inside the pole so the sweeper fit more snugly without having to cram it on there, then sanity returned and I realized it was better to send it back.

Minor negatives is that the light weight accordion hose sometimes kinks and because the vac is light weight, it will may tip about when you are moving around with it.

Worth a few listens if you are an Eminem fan (ie, listen more than once so you really get a feel for the album).
That said, defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER (or author) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do. Again though, I wouldn't use them to filter out a model entirely.

1201	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Seems to be a solid blender. I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors.

Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.

Since I got the Presto, have used it nearly every day for a quick cook method for meals and a bonus is how tender meat comes out! It has been so great. I really enjoy using it.
I've never even seen a Comfort Zone box fan. CVS, Home Depot, Safeway, and Target only ever displayed this awesome fan. I'm on my second unit. My first 20-or so dollars lasted 3 years. It was used quite often.

One way to test the suction on your vacuum, to check whether or not it is indeed the hose, is to remove the hose and turn on the vacuum.  You can put your hand over the opening where the hose usually sits and if you feel suction there, you know that the hose is the issue.
4879	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a LIFESAVER for anyone with 2 YELLOW labradors and BLACK furniture. I love the 3 heads it comes with. I misread and thought this was bagless. I was going to return the entire box because it wasn't bagless. My husband got it when I was home, opened it and put it together and used it before I could return it un-used. I am so glad he gave it a chance. I was super impressed. The suction is so powerful, and picked up all the yellow labrador hair everywhere!!! You need this if you have fur babies like I do. The only downfall is that the cord is slightly bulky so its hard to stand the cord/pole on its own somewhere. You have to weirdly strategically place it so that the cord with extension do not fall. I just wish it had a hook to hold the vacuum cord/pole. Other than that I am one happy camper! I have had this since the beginning of January and I haven't replaced the first bag that we put in.

There are a few annoyances however.  1) the tubes just 'press' together, which means often they 'fall' apart.  Drives my wife crazy... I just press them in firmly and don't have an issue.  2)  the hose is fairly 'thin' plastic, so I'm not super confident in how long it's going to really last.

It all started with the Armadillo, and how cute it was. Each one is as cute as the next. This mouse was adorable. Love the unique animal options. They are soft and cuddly and perfectly sized. Well worth the price for what you get. The design is more mature then most plush animals out there, so it works perfectly as room dcor for a nursery, as well. My only complaint is that I had children first, and I didn't know about these then.
4681	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm a complete pressure-cooking novice, never owned one or cooked with one until I bought this.  First day I had it I decided to make the pot roast per the instructions in the booklet.  Browned it in the pot, added the liquid, some onion and one of those pot roast seasoning packets from the store, brought it up to pressure, and 45 minutes later it was done.  I have made roasts in the slow-cooker and my oven before, and never ever have they been as good as the one from the pressure cooker.  Fall-apart tender, absolutely perfect.  I'll sheepishly admit it was even better than my grandma used to make and she made a roast every Sunday for 40+ years.  Once the meat was done I removed it and added some cut up carrots and potatoes and they cooked in less than five minutes.  You'd never know they weren't cooked all day in a slow-cooker.  I told myself that if I really liked pressure-cooking that I'd eventually upgrade to a more expensive one but I like this one so much I don't see that happening any time soon.

Figure $65 for two years, that's about $32/yr plus bags.  Never had it serviced, because you can't -- once it dies, it dies.  We'll see if the Miele gives a similar value, as I paid $500 for it.  If it lasts 15 years it will be a break even.  One thing I'm already conscious of is that the Miele wand and brush are heavy although the canister itself is light.  One reason I got the more substantial canister is so that when my upright is being serviced the canister will do the whole house, and the Mighty Mite is not up to that task.

Also, I burned several roasts before I figured out this pot's dumb secret: Pressure can't build inside unless the red lock-button on the handle pops up, but the red button will never pop up without assistance from *you.* You have to babysit this puppy; when water starts bubbling from underneath the lid and running down the sides to fizzle on the burner, it's time to start poking and prodding that stupid button again. I use a toothpick for this chore, but YMMV. (And, yes, I've used compressed air to blow around this button after washing. Nothing works. It just sticks.)
I looked at several different mashers and realized that ergonomically I needed the downward push. And this masher more than meets my expectations.  And shortened the time in the process.
I am happy with this purchase of the aluminum version vs the steel, the heat spreads evenly and is lighter. Costs a bit more but is worth it not to have burnt food at the bottom!

His first couple albums were pretty harsh and unapologetic but they were masterful in many ways.  The Eminem Show is a culmination of this Detroit-raised hip-hop lyricist angst met with an incredible production element that gives every song huge legs.  It's not just about the rhymes Em is spitting on each track, it's about the hook in the music.  The Marhsal Mathers LP might be looked at as his biggest turning step forward as a rapper, but as an artist with enormous reach The Eminem Show is perhaps the most classic album he's ever put forth.  On a personal note, this album was and still is one of my favorites of all time.  I spent considerable time in high school and college playing the album from start to end.  "Business" "Sing For The Moment", "Till I Collapse", and "Cleaning Out My Closet" are masterpieces without all relying on "hype-ism" or a cheap catchy hook.

Today with so many instructions written in China often they are difficult to read or not very worthwhile.  The instructions with this cooker are quite different. They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.  If you are someone who seldom reads instructions or is not willing to spend an hour or so learning about this cooking method or who will not take the time to follow the safety instructions then you probably should consider a different method of cooking.  But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating. I ordered a second cooker for my busy career oriented daughter but then cancelled the order after reading the instructions as I am not sure as busy as she is that she would read and follow them.  I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.  If so will order again for her.  Or give her mine and buy second for myself. To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.  It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.  But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience. And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.  For those willing to invest a little time, bon appetite!

I purchased 2 of the older models of the U25. I used the Carbon impregnated filters.....WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!! The reason for 2 was one to the hot water supply (cold side) and one for the entire house. They lasted 17 years without a hitch. I replaced the older one with the newer model 5 years ago, still no problems. As for leaks, INSTALL IT CORRECTLY, or have someone with a little knowledge do it for you. Use Teflon tape, use the proper tools, Install unions in the pipe for easy unit replacement, replace the "O" rings annually (that way the canister does not have to be over-torqued). The provided wrench works fine if the canister is not over-torqued, don't use the wrench to tighten the canister, if the O-ring is fresh, hand tightening is sufficient. This is a great product, but as with anything, used incorrectly it will not function properly.

If you want food quickly, and don't want to use your oven, this is great.  As long as you follow directions, it'll be fine.  I have an electric stove and heat the first burner to high, and the other to medium, so when the pressure begins to rich, just lift it to the rear one and turns out great.

I can't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you've just mopped - get this! It's a two minute swish through the house and it's all picked up - it's amazing. My son actually loves it because it's 'just his size' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well, if you insist! :)  I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you're taller then 5"5' you will be scrunching yourself to use this. Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg. should man up and make it up to par.

6069	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Since I have mostly tile floors, I like the fact that the floor tool is not motorized (and so doesn't throw bits around the room rather than sucking them up).  I'm very happy going back to a bagged machine -- cleaning the filters and canisters in my no-bag hepa vacuum was getting to be a real pain.  On hard surfaces I have had no problems with the unit turning over while dragging it around as some folks have complained about.  In fact it is light enough that sometimes I just pick it up and carry it.  The only thing I really don't like is the combination tool.  I use the brush and find that the hard nozzle tool on the back side gets in the way when I'm trying to get into a tight spot.  The hard nozzle side is a bit redundant as well -- I find the longer and thinner crevice tool more useful.  I always have trouble with black plastic and/or rubber bumpers from machines marking things up, so I generally wrap the tools with a bit of masking tape.  This unit will mark if you aren't careful, but not nearly as bad as some, especially the ones with rubber bumpers.
It's a great solution for us and I'm on my second year of using it.

How on earth do you choose a box fan? Well really they mostly choose us don't they, we choose the first box we see. The product descriptions aren't much help, they mostly all say they are quiet, powerful, low cost to operate, etc. Are they really all that different from each other?
In addition today I have discovered that some of the air bypasses optional HEPA filter attached to the back. If you take a wheel off you will see 16 holes on each side where air escapes bypassing HEPA filter. Considering HEPA filter path is more restrictive it is likely that most of the exhaust air is not filtered at all. I am planning to replace it with different one once last few bags are used up.

2772	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I grew up in England and used a rather primitive aluminum Prestige pressure cooker for years without incident. Therefore I was surprised at the common American conviction that pressure cookers blow up. I imagine that American pressure cookers have become so fancy in order to address these fears. So I was relieved to find this simple stainless steel Presto one. Since pressure cookers aren't supposed to be more than 2/3 full I bought the 6qt one, which has plenty of room for making stock or containing a bowl in which to cook rice, etc. The Presto works just as it should and is a delight. Quieter than my English one, and it has a valve that enables you to see when there is pressure in the pot. The stay-cool handles do. Don't be afraid to try it!

5273	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I had one like this years ago and loved it.  I hated it when it went "belly-up".  I have since had other brands and do not like them nearly as much as this brand.  I like the idea of having the additional battery so you can change it if you need to and I it is already charged and ready to go.  Have used it on both carpeting and on bare floors and was surprised at the amount of dog hair and general dust and debris it picked up after using it only twice.  I really like this product.  It is much more stable feeling than the one I was using prior to getting this.
9183	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Never disappointed with OXO products.  Excellent peeler!  Very comfortable and easy to use for big or small peeling jobs.  Really easy to clean as well; rinse off and throw in the dishwasher.

And then you have `Soldier', which is like one of the best rap songs of the decade.  The track is perfect, containing one of the best beats on the album and the way Eminem struts his swagger, slinging verbal assaults like it was dirt in your eye; it just all screams authentic angst which helps sell this as one of the more poignant tracks on the album.  The anger here is perfectly situated to elevate the track into something so dark it feels raw and real.  Unlike the times when Eminem tries to make his murderistic (yes I made that word up for this review) rampages seem playful or humorous, Eminem shrugs humor to the side and delivers something unlike him yet completely comfortable.
It was less obvious to me that belts are also a normal wear and tear part, and that the vacuum clearly lists - on the little "specifications" sticker it has right on the motor - what is the part number for the vacuum bags, as well as the part number for the agitator belts.

1133	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The website and the box of the product both state that the capacity of the bowl is 21 ounces, but it is barely 16 ounces.  In fact, when I put 16 ounces of liquid inside to measure it, the bowl was not only filled to the line but overflowed the middle section where the blade goes, and liquid was spilling out onto the base.  While a solid, pulverized ingredient may or may not spill out through the center if overfilled, I can say that this will not hold 21 ounces by any stretch of the imagination.

I use the juicing attachment when I need to squeeze more than one lemon or orange, but I do agree with the reviewer who expressed concern over the safety of this attachment.  I've never injured myself with it, but its easy to see how you could and I'm VERY careful when I use it.  With all of its other functions, moving parts are completely enclosed and perfectly safe.

- I keep some water bottles in my freezer, and when I need to cool this off in a hurry, I can make a bath of cold water in my sink, put the hot pot inside, and throw the froze water bottles in. This usually cools it down very fast, great when I want to refrigerate it overnight to skim off the fat, and didn't want to wait too long for it to cool down.

8050	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I know this zester is a simple little kitchen item to have and shouldn't much matter, but it does. I already had a zester but in a moment of weakness I ordered this one and found that it walked circles around the one I had been using for quite a number of years. I know it sounds silly but if you use this item frequently it is worth the purchase.
6825	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this 2 years ago, it did what a fan should for about a year, then as the plastic aged, the Lasko logo piece that covers the spindle of the fan started rubbing against the fan's pivot point.  I cut out the logo on the fan which temporarily removed the noise but the grate eventually started rubbing against the fan as well. I've basically had to cut out the entire center grate around the fan to eliminate the noise. I'll have to replace the fan eventually for a reason other than it just wearing out which is rather annoying. Lasko needs to engineer better fans.
That said, defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER (or author) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do. Again though, I wouldn't use them to filter out a model entirely.

3838	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The Presto pressure cooker with the rocker-weight pressure regulator has been manufactured for at least 50 years, and in all that time, the design has hardly changed at all. The overpressure relief plug and the lid-lock plunger have been moved to different locations in the lid and handle, and the design of the plunger has changed slightly, but other than that, my new 8 quart cooker is identical to my parent's 6 quart model that was made sometime in the early 1970's. The product hasn't changed because it doesn't need to; it does exactly what it is designed to do, and does it simply and efficiently. I only bought this new one because my old one was so stained, scratched, and ugly that I was embarassed to have guests see it in my kitchen. The old one still worked perfectly. I use mine almost exclusively for pot roasts, but there are hundreds of other recipes for pressure cookers. This model is set to operate at 15 pounds per square inch steam pressure, which yields an internal temperature of about 250F. It cooks 5 pound pot roasts in about 1 hour, and will reduce even the cheapest, toughest chuck roast to fall-apart tenderness. If your cooker starts leaking after a few years, replace the seal ring, the overpressure plug, and the gasket on the lid-lock plunger. These three items are all available as a kit from Presto for about $10 and will extend the life of your cooker indefinitely.  CAUTION: If your cooker is ever accidentally overheated (by allowing it to run out of water), or dropped on a hard surface and dented or damaged, it must be replaced. The aluminum metal of the pot or the lid could fail catastrophically (explode) on a subsequent use if weakened by overheating or physical damage.


3580	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The handle on the pot won't stay tightened.  You have to get the lid positioned just soooo before it will go on.  And, if you don't have the gasket in with the two little notches in front of the handle, forget it.

3569	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use this to cook mostly my meal consisting of a vegetable & fish mixture.  It works well.  I use 1/2 cup of distilled water (which in my opinion is the bare minimum).  You must always start by adding at least a 1/2 cup of water before adding any vegetables.  My veggies & fish cook in about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes, after which i run cold water over the cooker to cool it down.  The only problem i have had is getting the lid to go on sometimes.  I think it gives me problems if the black rubber gasket inside the lid is not positioned correctly, then it is impossible to get the lid on, probably because the cooker is new to me and needs to be "broken in" a little, especially the lid gasket.  If you have a problem with  the lid not shutting closed, then try rotating the black gasket a little or maybe remove it and turn it over on it's other side.  But these pressure cookers are really good, you can cook some really healthy food quickly in them.

Good price.
We've used it on cat vomit (we've got two cats and the long-haired one always stays indoors), dog accidents, all sorts of stains from children and grownups alike. We use it exclusively on carpeted areas of the house. It does clean and does a better job, in my mind, than the spot-cleaners that come in pressurized cans, because this machine leaves little residue and requires less scrubbing than SpotShot.

I used these primarily after surgery when showering was not something that could occur frequently. They work better than other wipes I've tried and were kind of a lifesaver. I now like to have them on hand for travel and camping. If only I could find a decent dry shampoo I'd be set.

2910	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have never used a pressure cooker before buying this one. I decided to buy a small one to see how I liked cooking in it. I absolutely LOVE it! Living in the southern US during the HOT summer months is not conducive to use the kitchen oven so this pressure cooker comes in handy. I have made numerous roasts in it and they all came out juicy; NOT DRY! I highly recommend this product. In other reviews some people complained about the hard time they were having with the handle. I have not experienced this issue at all. I've owned this 4-quart pressure cooker for about a year now and I am extremely satisfied with it.

Easy also is the little dirt container that pops on and off swiftly and into the garbage can. (the one that opens hand free...maybe i already reviewed that treasure)
5642	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum is excellent for my purposes!  I have 2 cats and 4 grandchildren and my kitchen tile floor gets pretty messy with crumbs cat hair, etc.  This vacuum is handy, lightweight and the suction is adequate for the quick pickups I need.  I don't expect it to perform like a regular vacuum because it is not designed that way.  As the name states, it is a Quick and efficient for the price.  I did buy an extra battery to insure I had enough power when I needed it.  It's performance meets my expectations.
It doesnt blow steam in clean, clearly audible whistles. So you have no means of estimating how much cooking has been completed. Instead it keeps on letting out steam like an angry old man wheezing at the neighborhood kids. EXTREMELY ANNOYING. Its like while this unit is being used, forget the TV and radio or anything that requires us to hear anything. This cooker's loud wheezing will dominate the spectrum of sounds in your house and drown out everything else.
4659	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	It's a decent lightweight vacuum.  The charge does not last long.  I can get a few rooms done, and then I need to switch batteries.  Pet hair gets stuck badly in the rollers, but it still seems to work alright.  Not terrible for the price.
Not only did it clean like a whiz....but it was so easy and smooth to direct it was almost like using a magic wand to scrub the floor!  It got right up next to the wall and pulled out hair and yuck...without splashing the wall!  It was amazing!
1440	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Got it two hours ago, used it with the decantor and let wine sit for an hour, really opened and smoothed out the Zin.  Great value, my neighbors got on for a present and it cost 2.5 times more.
4458	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating, & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter, too.  Tonight, I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago.
1284	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Our child wanted to do something 'sciency' and picked this kit, along with a few other more science filled toys. This was amazing! He sat down, read the instructions and got started right away. Making his own root beer took more time than we had thought though, so be prepared for that! It takes a couple days from start to finish. Overall though, an awesome kit.

3518	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	At first I hated the heavy metal cap that sits on top of the steam valve.  I always forgot to take it off before opening the lid, and one time it fell down hard on the floor, almost hitting my toes.  Turns out there's a purpose.  It's a visual/audio indicator of how much steam is coming out.  If it rocks too fast then I'd need to lower the fire.  On a pressure cooker, more heat doesn't cook any faster.  It only wastes gas/electricity and drains out the liquid inside faster.

We enjoy making pizzas together at home and wanted the tools to do it well and more frequently.  The last touch was the right pizza wheel to slice the final product.  I've had some wobbly and dull cheap pizza wheels in the past, so this time I went with a brand I trust in OXO.  I haven't been disappointed.  The wheel has a good weight and balance in the hand.  Grip is good, thumb rests nicely, and it's sharp enough to cut through pizza with only moderate pressure.  It's larger in size than some of my previous wheels, but not so large that it clutters up a kitchen drawer.  Dishwasher safe and the brushed stainless steel is a nice touch.  Think I'm set for a good many pizzas!

2866	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	We use this pan multiple times per week to cook beans. The pressure regulator has darkened and rusted and it no longer allows any steam to escape. This led to the rubber safety value popping last week, spraying our entire kitchen with boiling hot black bean juice. A lot of damage resulted from this incident. Without the regulator, steam escapes normally through the valve stem, it is not clogged. The regulator / valve opening must be defective. I tried scrubbing the regulator, no luck. It no longer allows steam to escape unless it is held in a tilted position. Be very careful when using this pan, always make sure steam is venting properly.

I feel compelled to inform those few readers who will ever come across this revised review that my initial commentary on this Cuisinart grind and brew unit was overly generous.  No, it wasn't the cleaning process that got to me; I was always willing to accept a little routine maintenance in order to end up with great coffee.  The problem is that this unit simply isn't designed to stand up to everyday use over any extended period of time.  I've already mentioned the disappearing labels for the various buttons.  But after ten months or so of daily use, the machine stopped doing a trustworthy job of sending the ground coffee on to the brewing basket.  No matter how thoroughly we cleaned and prepared the unit, every morning we would find a large percentage of the ground coffee still stuck in the grinder.  The result was weak coffee and frayed tempers. We still use the machine, but only for brewing already-ground coffee, and there certainly are cheaper machines that will perform this task adequately.

1023	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	You most definitely get what you pay for, these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife, they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one.

4219	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I like this vacuum cleaner very much. It's much lighter weight than my previous vacuum cleaners, which means I can carry it around, and up the stairs, more easily. It does a very good job picking up dog fur, which is always my main issue. The floor attachment has a switch which let's you move from carpeting to bare floors--works very easily. It's noisy, but not any more so than others I have had in the past. I have attached the HEPA filter, which I hope will do the job it's supposed to. The only negative for me is that the hose kinks occasionally, so you have to keep an eye on it--don't let it get twisted. Not a big deal.

The slippage is slight (about half an inch to an inch for each can) but it happens every time I use it. It doesn't really interfere with its performance but I find it annoying, always have to push the handle grip back on (like my bicycle when I was a child), which is why I spend just a little more and replaced the OXO Soft Handled can opener with the OXO Steel can opener.

The ugly: possibly the most annoying feature of this machine is that normal cleaning of the unit caused the lettering that labels the various buttons to disappear.

As I was washing the cooker, it really became clear that the handle was loose.  The screw was as tight as possible (the instructions warn against screwing it too tight lest the plastic break), and the handle itself was clearly loose.  So. . .

Mine won't get daily ice crushing duties...only occasional...and I have no plans to try and crush seeds/nuts/cinnamon sticks (that's what my spice grinder and food processor are for), so that doesn't really concern me.

It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances. Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer.

I guess there has been people ordering the wrong bags so Amazon automatically makes suggestions but do read a little more to make sure to get the right ones.  The vacuum only comes with one extra bag.  Save yourself the trouble and stock up by changing the bag and filter periodically will ensure your vacuum will work great for years to come!

I own an older Presto cooker and it is a wonderful cooker to own...guess I'm going to have to monitor these two new cookers just received.
If you want to be really cheap, twist two screw eye hooks into the wall studs (I hope they're directly opposite one another) and get some wire. But I do like the simple tension system with this set. The 17mm spacing they indicate you should use is good, especially if you're doing a long room and the wire tends to sag more during installation. With my 9ft room, I only needed about 10mm because my cut wire length was fairly tight to start. Better to cut off too little than too much - you can always cut more off later.
I don't recommend it.  Don't waste your money.

3621	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking.  The only drawback is the pressure is fixed at 15 psi (my old pressure cooker had 3 different weight rings that you used individually or in combination to vary the cooking pressure).  However, unlike my old one, this one works on my induction plate which makes it much more economical to cook by using so much less electricity.

Original review:
4543	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I am a daily user of pressure cooker, lived with pressure cookers my whole life. works good. I waited for a month to write this review to see if there is any problem I could spot. I have found only one issue with this model - the vent pipe in the side near the handles doesnt sit properly or go loose often, so if you see steam leaking for more than few minutes, it is time to give a poke with a fork or sharp object so that the vent is closed.
accessories are a bit flimsy -

Cons: The only real con is the hose. It's not the most rugged hose, and it's rather narrow, so if you live in a house with pets and kids, odds are you'll suck something up into it that will get stuck more often than you'd like.

They are truly bath wipes, I have used hundreds of these and still love them.  I have used other brands but they are inferior, this is by far the best brand out there.  The towels are big and durable.  I often take one towel and cut it into smaller ones as you don't always need to waste a full one.  You systematically use these for different parts of your body.  They leave no sticky residue and are non-scented, so they are nice if you are a hunter.  I would buy these by the case if I could.  Store them in a gallon size zip-lok to keep them moist.

(It was a 4 quart Presto).  I swear it heats faster.  Scrubs clean more easily than aluminum.  Handle on the off side makes it safer to lift and carry when full (and hot).  And of course no worries about ingesting aluminum, which is not a minor issue for folks with Alzheimers in the family.  Why anyone even makes aluminum cookers anymore is beyond me.

I've also owned my fair share of Eurekas, Hoovers, Panasonics, Sears, Dirt Devils, etc in both uprights and canisters. Not one of them was perfect nor "did it all", despite their claims. No one really wants to do bare floors with an upright. So keep in mind, this review is within the scope of the typically defined tasks for canisters with non powered heads.

I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto.

9930	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This strainer is pretty small.  I bought this to replace my large strainer that's many years old.  The pictures of this one make it seem bigger than it is.  First of all it's pretty shallow, it maybe holds 2 pounds of hamburger to be strained, but likely it would tip on its own (if you had it resting on the sink like I do.)  I wouldn't use this for pasta as it would overflow easily.  It does have a great handle, and the opposing loop helps it sit in a sink.  But I was hoping for something larger.  Our old strainer easily holds double what this one does and had two prongs on the other side so that it wouldn't tip when rested on a bowl or the sink.

Based on that, and the fairly good reviews on Amazon, I purchased this vacuum. I'm a little disappointed. The hose constantly twists while I'm using it and I have to bend all the way down to the cannister and untwist the hose from that level.  That gets old after 10 or more times of having to do this, and my home isn't large. My vacuum also makes this high-pitched whistling sound when I use it. I'm not sure what's up with that. I do like the fact that it's very lightweight. It's good for stairs. The suction power seems to be decent.  For the price, I should be happy. I actually bought this vacuum to replace my Dyson--now, that's a way over-rated, majorly over-priced piece of equipment! I'm so glad the Eureka has a disposable bag--I don't want to see the gross stuff that has been vacuumed off the floor ever again!
5046	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like this Quick Up very much.  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold a charge long enough to vacuum all my floors.

Having never used a real masher before, I expected the process to be a bit time-consuming and hard on my arms.  Not so!  The consistency was much better than whipped potatoes, which of course have their own fans. Smashed, mashed -- this OXO Good Grips utensil will serve me well for a long time.
4605	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this as a replacement for an older Eureka Mighty Mite that has been in the family for 30 years. The old one still works, but I was expecting something better. The price was unbeatable through Amazon Warehouse Deals, but this really performs no better than my 30 year old Might Mite. I can definitely say that the blowing feature is much more powerful on the older Mighty Mite. As for suction, they are neck and neck. If you don't have one, it's still a fabulous, lightweight vacuum with more suction than many full-scale canister vacuums. If you already have a Mighty Mite, keep it going because they still haven't been able to improve upon it, even after 30 years.

When I wash it right away, I can get them out, rinse the blade and handle well, then dry it.  I also give it a little shake to get water out of those ridges.  I tried to use this for icing cookies, however, it did not make a smooth streak, so I use another offset spatula.

Only problem with it is you need to track time to turn it off.(Indian pressure cookers come with sounds at regular intervals).
Yes, they are made in China.  Only All Clad, which now makes their handles and lids off-shore too (they don't tell you where) and Vollrath are made in the US.  All Clad is no better than Cuisinart (which would be my second choice, and a lot cheaper) or Calphalon, now discontinued, in the clad cookware category.  And All Clad is ridiculously expensive, which in my opinion is completely unjustifiable, not to mention that their handles are as uncomfortable as they come.

After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual, as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds, less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat, which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:"Brown Food tastes Good".

6136	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this as a classroom vacuum, but ended up using it in the art studio.  It's light, powerful, and gets the job done.  I would have given it 5 stars if the hose were better quality -- it's thin and cheap and twists easily -- I can't see it lasting long at all.
The minuses include a hose that can kink easily and cut off suction, if you aren't careful with how you are twisting it.  The floor nozzle leaves much to be desired compared to others Ive used.  It has bristles that are raised to clean carpets and lowered to clean bare floors.  However, the nozzle tends to skip over the carpet while pushing forward.  When cleaning bare floors, the nozzle tends to suction itself to the floor, even when the bristles are lowered to provide air channels to prevent this from happening.

I have a very tiny house (575 sq ft) with hardwood floors, ceramic tile and area/throw rugs in the living room, hallway and my bedroom. My 3 small dogs are always tracking in dirt, etc from outside and my Persian cat, sheds year-round. This little vac picks up every bit of pet hair from my rugs and dirt in corners, along the baseboards and even cobwebs outside, on the overhang over my front door and around the outdoor light fixtures, too, effortlessly. I also used it outside on my front and back door mats and in the corners of the stairs that lead up to my front door--I never was able to clean those before properly, without spraying with a hose. I had been using an ancient Hoover canister, that quit working, so I bought this and am so glad I did. My house is really clean now, inside and out. And at a fantastic price, too.
In one of the reviews I read of this salad spinner a reviewer commented that when she puts left over salad away in the spinner in the refrigerator at last much longer. That turned out to be really helpful tip since we often throw left over salad away after a day or so in the refrigerator despite the fact that we have a pretty high end refrigerator. Storing leftover salad in the spinner in the refrigerator the next day comes up still crisp and fresh.

This isn't a quiet fan on it's high setting, but any fan moving this much air is going to be noisy.  On low I consider it a nice white noise loudness level for sleeping.  The fan is all plastic, and are perhaps a bit pricey for such, but it does move much, much more air than the box fans I've had in windows in the past, and as I've said, it can quickly more than pay for itself in power savings.  I'm seriously considering purchasing a third one to keep on hand for future use if/when one of mine breaks down, as the second was supposed to be mostly a backup but it's made enough of a difference that it's being used regularly with the first fan; if I'd thought the second would be such a difference I'd have purchased it long ago.

My mom had a unit she must have bought in 1960 or so, with a similar design, but without the lid interlock.  I have gone 10 years with this newer model, and replacement parts are available because the design was so good that the parts are being made unchanged years later.  My mom had the 4 qt version of this and lasted her a lifetime.  I expect mine will last that long as well.

This pressure cooker works well, but the handle mounting hardware seems barely up to the task.  The handle is a highly tensioned part and while the handle itself is sturdy, the mounting screws seem flimsy.  I can tighten the hardware almost to the limit of the tensile strength (until the screws are about to break) and the handles are barely tight enough not to work loose in a use or two.  When they inevitably loosen, I'll use blue Loctite on them to hopefully secure them when reassembling.  If Presto used a beefier mounting for the handles, I'd give this pressure cooker five stars instead of four.

This three speed, five blade, box fan, although inexpensive, has been faithfully doing its job on the lowest speed setting for years, sitting on a card table, and keeping some air movement going in our basement, -preventing rust, mold, and mildew. It runs with very little air movement noise. The sides of the box are grey, and the fan blades, handle, selector knob and the blade grill covers are white. Five Amazon stars for this Lasko 3733 20" box fan.

4706	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I love this light vacuum for quick touch ups, instead of dragging out my big heavy electrical vacuum cleaner. I bought an extra battery so that I will always have one charged while I use the other. Some complain that it is only good for 10 minute jobs, but that all I need for a quickie use. I only graded it down because it was missing a handle screw that was needed. Also, it is a little difficult to see whether you are setting it to floor or rug which is something I will probably learn by touch soon. I chose to keep mine in a convenient secluded corner of the house where I can quickly grab it, not on the wall. Good price and looks nice too.

It is noisy (my cats vacate the room when I turn it on) but no more so than my 10 year old Mighty Mite which it replaces.  It works well on bare wood, tile or vinyl floors, upholstery, cobwebs, dusting, etc.  It does not work at all on carpet or rugs.  The hose, wands and attachments are all made of cheap plastic so be careful or they will crack.  (I wonder, how much more this item would cost if they put decent quality parts on it?  Considering the price of plastic it might add, $2 or maybe $4?  It would certainly be worth it that small price.)

ANYTHING you try to cook in it is going to stick at the bottom. And you are going to have a NIGHTMARE cleaning it. AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIFFIC NIGHTMARE. Its like the bottom of this cooker is fitted with super glue that is going to make the food stick, burn it thoroughly, thus making sure that there is an uneven spread of temperature in the food cooking above the burnt layer. And at the same time inundating the food with an extremely unappetizing "burnt" smell.

I have a young English Bulldog now, who basically lives in my room. He overheats easily, so I never leave him without level 1 going. I flip it to 3 after our walks, and he has knocked it over more than a few times. I prop it up/support it with whatever I think he won't try to gnaw on.
We waited two months before getting a replacement and settled on this one.  The Mighty Mite does work wonderfully on wood floors and couches... this thing will NOT do carpets to save its life.  Its a no frills connection, nothing to clip in place and nothing for the kids to break... I vacuumed under our couch and had to reconnect the floor brush three times.

403	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	First time I've listened to Eminem (besides Stan with Dido). I'm 60 years-old and I loved it! Listened to it in my truck on an hour drive (which wasn't long enough to listen in one sitting). I listen to all kinds of music...opera, rock, country. I don't dislike rap but I don't listen to it very much. Got this from the library and thought I would give it a try. I can understand why he is liked so much. Great beat...could hardly stop bobbing my head. I listened to it while driving...windows down...bass beating. Felt like a gangsta! The lyrics can certainly offend many people but I took it as a history lesson of what young people are up too. I think the guy is a genius. The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, "Cleaning out my Closet" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV. Every generation has somebody that they try to stop from getting messages to the young folk. It is his story and he is telling it his way. I've met people who think they shouldn't cuss on war shows...that they don't need it. It is because of that, that people think war is gallant and heroic (which sometimes it can be). Instead they need to be showing people screaming, cussing when their leg is blown off - that is real. Why would you want to edit it? Eminem is telling his story his way. It is his emotions pouring out in his song. If you don't like it then don't buy it. Don't ban it. This is a really good album. I just listened to it again yesterday whilst walking. I was able to really concentrate on the lyrics. Give it a chance older folks! To me this is every bit as classic "album" as Dark Side of the Moon, Days of Future Passed and Take Five. Loved it!

6203	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is actually the only style of vacuum I can own. Because of my pets and my long hair, a rotating style of vacuum is impossible. It just gets clogged with hair and has to be picked at with a knife or blade to undo the damage. This style, however, can just suck up everything. So, in that sense, it works amazing. I know I've used more powerful vacuums, but this one, for the money, does the job quite nicely. Also, I notice people care about the noise of the machine. I think this sounds about like any other vacuum. I guess some want it to be really quiet, but it's a vacuum, it's going to make noise. Get over it.

I had to attach the handles, so some assembly on this one is required.  My first recipe was, 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans', and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.  They turned out great, but had to guess at the cooking time, as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet, but in my head!  Since then, I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks.  I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.

My mother and grandmothers all usded Presto pressure cookers, so I grew up knowing their products really stand the test of time.  My mother in law also had several Presto cookers that she used frequently.  However the STAINLESS STEEL cookers are far superior to the aluminum cookers of yesteryear.  Well worth the extra money.  With the thick bottom plate,  it won't warp,  and the heat is more evenly distributed.  I have been a fan of pressure cooking for many years, but as my household shrank,  I found the need for one smaller than my 8-qt for everyday use.  This is perfect, and very attractive too.

9879	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This is my fifth different kitchen gadget made by OXO that has ultimately failed because it broke. Not a good track record, if you ask me. As a masher it worked fine on potatoes and whole tomatoes, the non-stick coating was a nice feature, the grip work fine. Recently I noticed the handle seemed a little loose. Then while we were cooking Thanksgiving dinner my husband was using it. He pushed down to mash and the whole thing came apart! The side pieces are inserted into the handle and appear to use tension and some type of bonding agent to hold it together. The repeated force of mashing things was too much for the masher, which misses the whole point, doesn't it? It was amazing my husband didn't cut himself on some of the pieces of exposed plastic, which were sharp. Could I glue it back together? Maybe. Is it worth it? No!

This is very good quality, just as have all my OXO products have been.  We own many OXO brand products and we love to cook and they make good quality products at good price.

Even with the top screw in place the lower part of the hanger would slide sideways when opening and closing the door.  Finally, I installed the four plastic mounts to the door with short screws and it stabilized the wire frame.  Time will tell if it holds up.

2 cons:
5902	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Let me say that I foster cats and dogs so there is always pet hair on my carpets and area rugs. I have 2 Hoover Windtunnel upright vacs that I love but they are so heavy and have taken a toll on my shoulders pushing them back and forth. They do however, pick up animal hair extremely well on both carpet and area rugs. Not so good on hardwood but I put up with that.
8740	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Easy use
5254	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This seemed okay at first. It seemed to pick stuff up, although it did not work well as a handheld in the car (one of the reasons I bought it) because the seats have indentations and it couldn't pick up stuff in those. After the batter started to die, I switched to the spare battery, and it never seemed to have anything but weak power. I tried recharging the first battery but it never the regained the power. Tried recharging the spare - still not good. Now I have a vacuum that literally picks nothing up. And what it does pick up isn't sucked into the canister, but sits in the outer part and just falls back out. I feel as if this was a complete waste of money.
2271	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great for small room. Moves a lot of air for its size! I would buy again

As the draft moves away from a fan, it expands because venturi effect draws surrounding air.  Hanging the Lasko two feet from the window increased the performance to 1300 cfm.

1205	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks, I'm good.

Ratings: CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album. Great songs get two stars, and good songs get one star. Songs that get no stars are those that I might like but not enough to give it a star or ones I find boring or actively dislike. CDs are not penalized for songs that I don't like because they are easy enough to skip over. There is no maximum number of stars a CD can get, but of course the more stars it gets, the better the CD.
4702	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this pressure cooker. I adore a good soup. Chicken soup, Pasta Fagiole soup( made with  dry beans) , Spit Pea soup,in minutes!  It has two pressure valves unlike old ones that only had one. It's stainless steel not aluminum so healthier to cook in . Who has time to stand over stove for 2 hours! Who would want to! Don't be afraid of pressure cookers. Just learn how to use them. All you have to do is make sure valve is open and not clogged before using by looking through the hole. And don't open lid until pressure is released. YOU can easily see if pressure is in pot by the 2 valves on pot. That's it so ENJOY this great pot!
7682	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Works just as expected. Although I wish It had a smaller handle. This one takes up a lot of space in the drawer. But it does provide a good grip.

First impression: It's loud, really loud,  but that's okay as it vacates the room I'm trying to clean without my tripping over Stanley Underfoot yet again. (Since meeting Stan, the tombstone in my head has read: Tripped over cat. Went splat.)
I appreciate the safety feature that does not allow users to turn the switch on without everything appropreately installed. The blade is very sharp and now I feel safe to use the processor even though I can often be absent-minded while I cook. I was worried about injuring myself as I do stupid things, but this processor is safe to use. You cannot operate without all the cover installed completely because it is designed that way.
9107	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	So delighted to have this and in a timely way.  Great product!
8259	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Very strong and well made.  My only concern is the steel itself is hard to get streak free.  Bad finish?  Not sure.  I do like it, and hope it lasts well.

This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made on amazon. I still cannot believe they sell this for $35! The pot does not feel cheap at all. It has very sturdy handles, and a thick, heavy bottom, which holds in heat well.  I like this pan so much that sometimes I use it instead of my skillet to sautee meat, because of the deeper pot + the cover, less cleaning up for me :-)

Now the bad news.  The carafe isn't so great.  We've replaced them five times now.  The tabs that hold the spill guard in place break off, the tabs for the lid then break, and then the handle.  It appears the problem is really just bad plastic.
6217	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	They worked as described.
This strainer is just fine enough to be useful for applications where you can't have big holes--such as draining couscous. But the holes aren't too small to make it generally useful. It is also my go to for everything else--washing blueberries, a small amount of pasta etc.

3169	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I keep seeing all these adds on TV for power pressure cooker so I had to try one.  Well this is a great value that will work perfectly on an induction cooktop.  I didn't understand the difference between pressure cookers until I got this one  The ones you see on TV have a "quick release"  pressure valve while this on has a weighted top.  The instructions tell you to cool it in cold water to remove the top.  That seems silly to me, I just use a pair of tongs to remove the weighted top.
5475	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Pretty bummed I'm a week late on returning it. It doesn't work well for me at all. Needed it for pet hair on area rugs. Just doesn't do the job.
It isn't perfect though. I have to go back over a cut sometimes. But maybe that's how it should be?
Still love it.  I focus on value shopping - doesn't have to be cheap, but must deliver value that justifies the price.  This delivers.

189	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I liked this "book", but as other reviewers mentioned, it is more of an idea magazine and not a step by step how to make cake pops book.  That said, it includes ideas for cookie pops, brownie pops and cake pops.  Though there is a section which covers making cake pop dough and different sizes of round pops, this book doesn't cover different flavors, different shapes (except pushing the dough through a tube) and decorating elements like candy, sprinkles, pretzels, etc. are not covered much at all. What is covered are cookie pops and brownie pops molded in Wilton molds, dipping pops into candy melted in a Wilton candy pro melting pot (microwaving not covered), pops dried in Wilton pop decorating stand (styrofoam not mentioned) and decorating using primarily Wilton candy sprinkles of all kinds and a lot of Wilton pre-rolled and tinted fondant.  Almost all the pops are round or molded in a Wilton mold. They also neglect to mention using a cookie scoop, a great way to get your cake pops all the same size.
9444	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love it. Heavy and cuts pizza very well. Sharp blade. Very professional looking.
8120	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I like it! I've been using a lot of oriential receipes and this zester works so much better than what I'd been using in the past. Works well. Gets the job done and is comfortable to hold and use.
