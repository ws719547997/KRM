2. ...because you're going to check the trap every day. EVERY DAY. If you don't have the discipline to do this, then just use the conventional wood and metal Victor snap traps. Otherwise, you're going to turn your well-intentioned live trap into a killing machine ... a very slow, torturous killing machine. A few things can happen if you neglect the traps more than 24 hours, including their painfully dying from lack of water, lack of food, hypothermia, or cannibalism. Mice have a very high metabolic rate, and will painfully perish after a day or two without food or water. Yes, your bait is in there, but if you've got more than one prisoner, it's party over, man, party over. Second, the metal floor of the trap is an excellent conductor of heat and will rapidly transfer the life out of a mouse if the trap is in a cold environment like a barn or garage. I put some cover in the trap, like dried grass or hay or leaves, enough to ensure that they'll be able to sit atop it yet not enough to make it not easy to see if someone's come to visit.

However, having reading the other reviews before I ordered, I didn't expect much, and this does the job at a low price. No leaks so far, even under full pressure with the nozzle turned off.

920	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It works! I'm still learning how to use it effectively. I was trying to cover the entire front yard in one pass but it turns out it is more effective if used on narrower strips so a portion can be watered thoroughly. My only gripe is that it can't really do more than one curve because the weight of the hose will derail it and send it straight to my neighbors!
7429	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I haven't used this yet, but it was reasonably priced, had good reviews,  and was just what I needed for my back yard.  The mosquito's eat us alive and citronella and other things I've used have failed.  I have large trees in my back yard and a stream at the bottom of my property ... mosquitos' playground.  So I have high hopes for this!
Update- I had one of these that lasted about two years before a large crack began to show in the area where the handle attaches to the shovel. Since it had a lifetime warranty and I still had the receipt, I emailed the company and they graciously shipped a replacement. After my first round of snow this past winter however, I was greatly disappointed to find cracks in the replacement shovel. I had been careful not to be too rough with it (just used it on my deck)but it had been a bitterly cold day so I'm thinking that maybe the plastic gets brittle in severe cold. I had stored it outside before using it. I've since applied epoxy to both shovels and hope that they will last another year or longer.
The price is excellent, highly recommended.

I was so very excited at the prospect of stopping those pesky bugs from continuing to lay eggs all of my beautifully stained patio. While this product is definitely working it's not getting as many bugs as I would have hoped it would. I've left this product on 24/7 since I got it, with the exception of days it's raining or when I watered the lawn, and it's killed a couple dozen bugs (that I've seen bodies of on the ground or stuck) but I've had this product for over a month now. Some users said that they'd have to clean out the zapper by blowing compressed air into it daily, or weekly, I haven't had to do it once. I've checked the ground below it and I have seen some bodies of bugs that got suckered into the pretty blue light, I'm still seeing new eggs on the patio daily.

4976	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This Push Reel Mower is managing the grass/weeds and rocks in our African house very well.  Arrived extremely sharp, not too hard to push, and back wheel gives it a bit more traction.  Heavy duty and nothing is bent yet.  will continue to monitor and change review if all collapses (like all the rest of the push mowers I have bought for the yard.)  Having a gas powered mower would be a nightmare unless you spent a lot of money (which I don't have) as the blades would bend in a minute.  Much better to have steel and use a bit more muscle.  Of course the tall weeds don't cut as well, but it is pretty good and definitely good for the money.
3813	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I did a lot of research before I purchased this model. I wanted to spend less than $150 for a reel mower and after exhaustive research I came to the conclusion that this one was my best bet in my price range. I think I chose wisely. (And it was also well under my max price!)

I've got a hint for those other reviewers who seem to go through blades.  All those sparks you are seeing demonstrate that you are not properly aligned.  Take your time, don't rush, you'll get a quality job, save your blades and your hardscape.
9598	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got tired of using plastic ones. They kept breaking, so I decided to switch to brass. Jury still out. It does need good water pressure to perform as required. I have a well and the water pressure is not as high as city provided water pressure, so this item is not performing as well as I would like it to, not the mfg. problem though. So, if your water pressure is around 35 psi or less, this sprinkler head may not work well for you.
If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.
I go back 40 years (I sound like an old codger) to Central California where Rain Birds were used by homeowners and farmers alike.

6. Deploy them correctly. You have to get your Tin Cat up against a wall or some structure that will lead edge-running mice into it. Place it out in the middle of a floor and the fat lady is never going to sing, brother. My traps reliably catch one to three+ mice every night that they are set out. I run three Tin Cats in my barn that is in a rural forested area with a perennial brook running just 50 feet from the garage ... lots of mouse potential. The traps are very reliable. If they stop producing, and you've followed the rules, then move them to a new location ... even if only a few feet away. You can also change bait ... mix it up a little bit. If you've had a mouse die in your trap, clean it out and spray with the 10% bleach and sage the darn thing to drive out the spirits of the departed Mickey Mouse.

6563	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've had this model for years and it continues to perform perfectly. In fact, I just bought two more because I have so many hummingbirds this year. This model hold 4 cups of nectar. You'll need a small funnel to fill it because the opening is small. The base screws off the glass jar allowing you to clean the inside. However, the opening is quite small, so it's doubtful you'll ever get a bottle brush in there. When I clean mine I pour a little bleach inside it and add some water and shake it around. Then I make sure that I rinse it many times to ensure that the bleach is gone.
This year our whole area (Northern Nevada) is having a major Army Moth problem. They are here in numbers that multiply any previous year. Is it the drought?

After several months of use, this is starting to rust. Although I love this nozzle, it's apparent that I will have to replace this at some point. I get that zinc isn't the same as stainless steel but if a nozzle can't survive outside in the summer under the deck for more than a few months, I think something is missing.

I am not dim, these instructions are the least possible amount of effort a company could put into this. Bad schematics, 72+ parts and likely many more nuts and bolts. Re-assign the person that wrote the instructions and hand someone of average intelligence the unopened box and film it. Repeat that process while re-writing the instructions until it is simple. After reading how poor the pole is and that the house isn't Starling resistant I realized I got what I paid for, not much.

Many reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT "Gilmour 572TF".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in "bargain bin" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a "Gilmour 572TF", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the "Gilmour 572TF", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.

9384	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the BK-80D for about 3 weeks now and so far I am impressed with its performance.  This model is bright and powerful and destroys every bug that is lured into it, it slays mosquitos.  I actually have a much smaller yard than 1.5 acres, however my theory is that at dusk when its slightly light out, I wanted the light to be bright enough to make the bugs choose the light and not me.  It is set up about 35 ft from our deck and that theory has worked great so far.  This design also has not clogged up at all with continuous nightly use.  Most bugs, especially mosquitos, fall to the ground after hitting it which is why many people don't think it works with mosquitos.  If they don't see them stuck to it, well it must not work.  I doubted it at first also until I stood next to it in the dark and saw the swarm around it.....which it continuously zapped.  Tiger mosquitos will not be attracted to the octenol bait but should still go after the light, at least mine do.
1522	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Best brand out there.
No tools were required and making it hand tight was enough to avoid any leaks. All i used was a thin flat head screwdriver to adjust the spray direction. I did get wet during the installation. It was a hassle to keep turing the system on and off to make the adjustments, so i just made them while the system was running.
2370	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So far I like this little sprayer.  I have been using it to spray a neem oil/soap mix on aphids and other pest that are invading my garden.  I read in the reviews some people have had the handle break off if you screw it closed by the handle so I have not done so.  But I can see how it can happen.  The handle is NOT strong enough to use to close the sprayer, only to hold it when you spray.  Other then that I am very happy with this product.  Works great and was a good value.
8830	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Weber grills are the best.  I have an old model with the three sets of 3 holes that must be shut individually, and the ash falls into a tray underneath.  I like to save my charcoal, so these little closing devices get hot.  the Weber grill I just bought (as a gift) is the "gold" model with a single lever that can shut all of the bottom vents, plus a built in ash catcher.  A great improvement on a great product.

9442	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Was very surprised to see this attracting and killing large numbers of south Texas mosquitos.  I figured without the bait it would be of little use in that area.  With the bait I did some counts (kill rate over 10 minutes) and estimate I am killing 10-12,000 mosquitos a night. This does not include all the moths and other pests that are being zapped.  There is a carpet of mosquito corpses under the unit every morning. I live near a swamp so I will never be able to eradicate them but I can now enjoy the pool which was impossible at dusk previously.  I am very happy with this purchase.

You have to hold your breath, but this system is convenient and helps a lot in reducing the pesky fly population. I learned the hard way a few years ago not to use a fly swatter outside....the more you swat them, the more they come in droves as they are attracted to any blood residue. This helps to divert them away.

Additionally, the lid can be "rockered" back onto the body of the grill.  This means that you don't have to look around for someplace to put a potentially very hot piece of metal *and* you can use it as a windshield if you want.

After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8", but this is 3/4".

We live in the country and have a lot of land so I was glad that they have one powerful to take care of 1.5 acres. Now we are able to enjoy our newly refurbished porch without being assaulted by mosquitos and nats. In order to eliminate mosquitoes, you should also order Flowtron MA-1000-6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant Cartridges, 6-Pack. The light by itself does not get the mosquitoes well so the mosquito attractant complements the light. The mosquito attractant is set up to fit well in a special area below the light. I feel as if we have our beautiful backyard back again!

943	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I hate using this sprayer.  It's difficult to fill - because of the very small opening, you need to use a funnel.  It's awkward attaching it to a hose - you need to spin the entire apparatus around and around until it's secure enough so it doesn't leak.

Nope.  If heavy .105 or .120 line won't cut it, this probably won't either.  And that's what you're trying to do, find a step up from the heavy line, isn't it?  Set the mower deck high or find an actual blade to go on the end of your trimmer, because this thing isn't up to the challenge.

417	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Purchased this back in 2014 and I have had two issues with it. First of all, it recently broke where the female coupling that attaches to the hose attaches to the nozzle body, for some reason it just separated. There are some threads on the piece right there where it somehow joins the two parts together and they just came apart. Impossible to put this back together correctly so it is junk at this point. Secondly, the spray pattern is weird when you turn it on. Rather than going from a nice spray to a more forceful one, it first goes into a pinpoint, hard spray pattern first, then to a nice open spray, and then to the full spray. I've never had a nozzle that did that and I really never liked that. Giving it one start since it lasted all of 2 years. Not sure what their warranty is but I am checking that out now.
9272	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	worked great! Kind of a pain to get apart and clean out though. this one you actually get to hear 'em FRY!

Also, ignore the 4:1 water:sugar ratio that so-called "experts" suggest you use.  Instead, use a more calorie-rich 2.5:1 range (about same calorie content as the sweetest natural nectars) - hummers prefer the most calorie-rich nectar available and will prefer your feeders vs your neighbor's.  AFAIK, th only reason "experts" suggest you provide relatively "weak" nectar is to encourage maximum visits to your feeders (because hummers need more consumption of "weak" nectar = more visits).  But if you increase the nectar content, your feeders soon become "the place" to feed and you'll have more hummers than all of your neighbors combined.
3195	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Received the item, put it together and it didn't work.  Changed outlets, power cords and it still didn't work.  The package looked like someone tossed it off a 3 story building.  Attempting to return it no reply yet.

8845	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Although I have only been using Weber grills for ten years, I feel that I can safely comment on the longevity and craftsmanship of the Weber One Touch Gold.  There are a lot of Weber charcoal grill imitations out there, but there is nothing quite like the original in terms of cooking surface, oxygen flow, temperature control, ash removal and durability.  I recently purchased the One Touch Gold to compliment my Weber Performer (The model before the disastrous makeover...IMHO).  The versatility and control that I have for grilling is second to none.  I also cannot say enough about Weber's customer service.  My Performer had two warranty replacements because of how much I used it...thus the reason for the second kettle.  Both times, the Weber CSR was able to ship me the parts needed to keep my grill going.  If you are looking at buying a charcoal grill, do not be fooled by the cheap imitations that fill the shelves at your local big box retailer.  Get a Weber.  In fact, get a 22 ? inch Weber and skip the 18 ? inch model.  You will regret it if you don't!  If you believe in buying the right tool for the right job and doing something right the first time, you cannot go wrong.  I'm a Weber devotee for life.
These have caught large rats with 9-10" bodies, not including tail. That's the size of a large squirrel. Very, very dead. I have not found any traps sprung without claiming its victim.

This thing is huge.  I mean it is almost as big as a Volkswagen.  You could use it as a shopping cart at Costco. Seriously.  And I say that in a good way.  I quickly loaded it  with 50 lbs. of granular material.  What a positive difference over the inferior Scott's plastic spreader.  This machine easily navigates the terrain with little effort.  Ergonomics are outstanding.  Start / stop lever is thoughtfully placed.  Spreading of material is superb.

Overall I have been pleased with this mower.  At the relatively low retail price on Amazon, these are a good value even if used as a specialty tool.  Even though I cannot use this as my sole lawnmower, I consider this model a good product because it does do a very good job under the appropriate conditions.  The easy storage and light weight are also considerable benefits for this mower.  Prospective buyers should keep in mind that these mowers are a specialty tool, though, and not something that will work well for everyone under all conditions.
Great for boxwood, raspberries, blackberries, junipers, arborvitae, probably all other softer bushes.

6302	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	You can't go wrong here, took just 20 minutes and I have 10 thumbs, all you need is a hammer and look at the pictures that come in the book.  For taste, you can't tell that even I, who can and does burn water, can cook mouth watering burgers and steaks that my family duplicates in their high priced, propane lugging grills. Same recipe-charcoal and light it without the propane burn.  One just need to be very generous with the non-stick spray or else your food sticks and breaks up on the grill.  Also the Kingford fast start charcoal is a marvel, if you cook just several burgers and a steak, because after about 20 minutes the charcoal burns out. Lastly, the bottom vent is quite cheesy, so for the grilling I did not open it and grilled with the top off, with no fear of hot ashes whipping around the yard.
6969	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've used water trap fly traps for years. Only issue is once they begin to fill the odor is awful - but surely better than letting the flies multiply. This works as advertised.
I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.
What else could I say.

2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible.

They are easy to understand, control 12 different stations.  Very good value.

I agree with other reviewers that the handle and connection could be re-engineered.  The wood handle is rough and poorly finished, so wear gloves.  The wood handle is held in place to the steel with the cheapest, worst screw known to man, so I pre-drilled and substituted and decent stainless steel screw.  Still this minor inconvenience isn't enough to delete a star from the rating.

6114	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was very skeptical, assumed this was a green gimmick, but I love it.  It's lightweight, easy to push and maneuver, quiet, zero gas, zero power plant emissions.  It is easy to adjust the height now that I found the levers (they were tipped forward by the other wheel).  However, this mower is for lawns only, and not everything we call "grass" counts.  Coarse grasses with thick rigid stalks do not cut well, if at all. Fescue and warm season lawn grasses do fine.  Sticks, even small ones, will jam.  I just toss those into the beds while I'm picking up doggie deposits.

The question that I felt needed answering was "Is it truly worth the extra $5.00 over the no-name brand" I believe so. I am a tight wad for sure, however we are hard on our gardening tools (We have 16 30x60 gardens) and are always willing to spend that little extra on any Fiskars brand as they truly are worth the extra cash every time. These pruners are always within arms reach. I absolutely love them for pruning. I've even used them on small trees and they keep on truckin threw.

3017	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Ineffective. Have to go over the same areas 3-4 times to get it to look right. The handle, though secured as instructed, is not stable at all and turns about. Needs a power switch rather than a trigger to power it-- I have arthritis and carpal tunnel and was in severe pain for 3 days following use. It's better than nothing I guess.., but should just spend a little more and get something with better quality. Its handling is comparable to pushing a toy truck with a broom handle. Kind of a pain in the a**.  Will be returning this after just one use.

**********UPDATE January 28, 2014************
8848	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I recently purchased this trap & began using it immediately, since I have had an infestation. It took a while to finally catch a mouse or two (a few times) but then all of a sudden, the bait was chewed up and no mouse inside. How on earth did they get out is what I would like to know? Does this mean that my trap is no longer working? I clean it after each use, since the mouse dung reeks and I am allergic to it if I touch it. This is now my second have a heart that has failed. I am giving it one more go ahead tonight. They love popcorn with nutritional yeast on it! I am considering buying another type. Any recommendations?

BTW, one additional request.  Unlike the Performer, the One Touch does not have a protective rubber tab on the top vent.  I of course found this out by burning myself while adjusting my air flow.  Along with a built-in thermometer, these would be simple additions in future models.

As soon as I planted a flower or bulb they would immediately dig it up for fun on their part.  They would climb into the flower pots and dig up the flowers.  I would put out an ear of corn for the squirrels and the chipmunks would eat the whole ear in one setting.  I have been baiting the trap with a sunflower seed under the tab on the trigger and adding a little chunky peanut butter.  Very effective.

A couple of notes of caution - If the soil is very hard or very dry use a piece of rebar to make the feeding hole and put the feeder in that. The feeder has a spear tip on it but I hesitate to pound it into the ground. Also, if the fertilizer  mix comes up out of the ground, slow the water to keep it at the root level where it does the most good. This fertilizer is a not intended to be a surface application.

2275	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I own a pasture sprayer, a couple 2 gallon sprayers and one Chapin Multi-Purpose Sprayer 1002. I bought it about 10 years ago and it is absolutely the best small multi-purpose sprayer I've ever owned. Chapin quality is high. When used as intended it's a champ. I dropped it a couple years ago and broke the nozzle. Amazingly Chapin sells repair parts. I'm about to buy two more one for weed killer and the other for fertilizer. They are so easy to pick up, pump, point and shoot. I feel compelled to empty and clean the 2 gallon ones after each use.
9452	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Flowtron seemed to be the zapper with the best reviews out there.  Consistently better than the other brands.  Some people seem to have issues with these, but I haven't had any.  It seems like with most reviews most of the negative comments are people just using the things incorrectly, others just have bad luck.  I installed this with the Flowtron pole.  It is like a beacon in the night.  Kind of neat and adds to the ambiance of a backyard BBQ.  It works great you hear it snapping a way, then occasionally you'll get a huge moth or something that gets in there and just lights that thing up. You'll see smoke and sometimes a little flame.  Sometimes they stink.  I'm not sure why some people don't notice hardly any kills.  After you plug it in, you don't get instant kills, it takes a bit for bugs to get confused and start heading toward it.  But after about 20 minutes of it being on you start getting kills.
7803	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Good for my needs
9373	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this a year ago and still rave about it. It kills and kills and keeps on killing--This is a great machine which will kill the crap out of bugs---just great
>> Bypass loppers have a sharp blade on the top and right, and a "dull" blade on the bottom and left.  If you rotate (or tilt)  the blades clockwise (relative to cutting a branch perpendicularly) to cut  through the branch at an angle, bypass loppers are likely to jam.  If you rotate (or tilt) the blades counterclockwise, the blades are likely flex apart and be bent or broken.  So, with bypass loppers,  it is best to cut thick branches perpendicular to the branch.  The angle doesn't matter much when using anvil loppers.
So I used the system for an entire summer and here are my observations further.  Again it didn't eliminate the problem 100% but made it significantly less.  It took a while for the zapper to catch up with the large amount of mosquitos but by the end of summer the zapping started to get less.  You have to clean it regularly which might take 20 or so minutes to complete.  Dirty job and maybe the tip of spraying it will aid in the removal. I am glad I bought the device.
7901	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works well, although I over estimated how long 15 feet of hose would get me (no fault of the product). Ended up ordering a 25' hose.

I am now pleasantly surprised.  The major sign of wear is some fading to the yellow paint due to sun exposure.  I don't put it away often enough.  Otherwise, no mechanical failures.

Its Economical on charcoal because of its small stature, but it still has enough room to fit several steaks and a chicken breast, or a rack of ribs and some kabobs. I keep putting off buying a bigger one, because this one hasn't let me down yet. Yes, I do have several other grills and smokers now, but many years and countless meals later, this little grill is by far used the most. There are not many things in life that only cost about 40 bucks and will give you this much trouble free use. Buy one and you too will be surprised.
If you are someone with little patience, or if you are not good with a wrench and a screwdriver, then steer clear of this unit.

5509	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I like this mower a lot.  The only problem is (as many have already said better than I could) it is not for the unmotivated or anyone with a big lawn.  When I bought this mower, I had visions of scoffing at gas prices, getting some quality time outdoors, and losing so much weight that my female neighbors would stare longingly at my rippling six-pack as I labored in my front yard.  What I ended up with was a mower that mainly pushed the blades of grass over, mocking my every effort and a wife who told me to "put your shirt back on" as she laughed at me from our front porch, sipping lemonade.  Reality sucks.  I did use it quite a bit in the front yard once I got the lawn under control and it was nice to not have to pick up grass and to be able to mow without ear protection on.  And the gas savings was a boost.  The mower is solid and does what it is supposed to do, but it truly is best for small areas and people who can mow their lawns pretty regularly.

Over all good product, but be prepared to purchase one every 2 years or so.  I have used propane based mosquito capturing system, but even that did nto last more than two seasons.  These devices must endure thunderstorms, hails, side way winds, high temperature, etc.  Investment of 100$ every year or so, is worthwhile investment for using my porch and being able to do some gardening in the summer time.

Disposal -you will either need to come up with a way to dispatch them or drive them far from home to drop them off.  Remember, if it's winter out - dropping them off may just be a cowardly way to kill them because they won't have shelter.  Until it got cold I took them for a ride.  Now it's tougher to figure out what to do with them so I've retired this trap for the winter.  A friend puts her trap outside in the snow to freeze the mice to death.  She thinks this is humane, I know someone else who rigged up a box to his muffler - probably dropping them into a water bucket would be the most pragmatic but I'm a little squeamish about that!
346	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works very well.  No real kinks, stands up to abuse and rolls up nicely.

- Put a few down in a row in strategic locations, like where the rats droppings lay.
The blades seem well sharpened from the manufacturer and are not inclined to bend or warp when tackling heavier pruning. They should be cleaned after each use and sharpened as needed.
Patience is a virtue in assembly.  The end product will make the investment of a few hours well worth it, but it does take time so don't plan on knocking this down in an hour unless you've assembled hundreds of these before.  The nuts and bolts are tiny and the assembly is awkward to handle while putting it all together.

9355	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We have a B&B and a farm.  We didn't want bugs on the deck while guests were out nor did we like all the flies that were in our barn this year.  We placed the unit, as directed, 25 feet from the deck and also in line with the barn door so it would pull the bugs out of it at night.  The first day we saw a lot of dead bugs.  Still, we had flies in the barn.  The next day, the unit was so full of bugs we thought it had burnt out! It hadn't.  The barn was almost cleared of flies!  By day three, we can actually stand in the yard and on our deck without being chased into the house!  Twilight is bug time, as we have ours on a dawn to dusk timer.  Once it goes on and is dark enough, the deck is virtually bug free.

We needed some relief if we wanted to enjoy the warm evenings unmolested. This baby rocks! I hung it off the eves about 6 feet from the ground between our house and our friends next door. After reading the instructions, warnings, and some of the other reviews, I did not use the attractant they supplied just to see what happened- I could always add it if needed. At first (May) it was getting just a few bugs, but now (July) holy moly!! I kid you not, in the morning (it's on a timer to run 5:30 PM to Midnight) the entire grid is totally packed with mosquitos. We couldn't believe it the first time it happened! We had no idea there were that many critters! The big plus is we can sit out side and enjoy it now, both on our side seating area as well as our neighbor's back patio. This thing is a keeper! Dead mosquitos by the thousands! I love it!

1268	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this sprinkler!  The arms adjust to sprinkle fairly narrow areas, maybe less than 20 feet wide.  It is slow moving even on the high speed.  It doesn't take sharp turns well.  It also "jumps" off the track sometimes, but don't sit there and watch it to see how/when it happens, but I have caught walking over in the neighbors yard before.  Also, when it approaches the ramp to turn off, it doesn't always make it up the ramp to turn off.  It just gets stuck there watering forever if unsupervised. But every other manual sprinkler requires constant supervision, this takes the constant moving the sprinkler out of the mix.  Is a great sprinkler to use in the wind as well.  Plus who doesn't love a walking tractor sprinkler!

8) Converter hose is available at Amazon & Home Depot to use with standard 20 lb. propane tank.
since my cutting season is over, my initial thoughts were correct. After the first trimming session, each time after was a piece of cake. The cut was very clean. I often get comments on my clean edged walkway. I think it adds nicely to the curb appeal.

So far, I'm very pleased!
My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.

No one sells this edger for the listed price of $168.  Lowes, Home Depot, etc offered it for the same price. But I like dealing through Amazon because the item shipped free.

This is my 8th or 10th  purchase of these bypass pruners over the past 25 years.  I gave them as gifts to gardener friends, have gone thru 3 pair myself (almost 10 years..not bad!) and even fixed a pair that spent the winter in rain and snow..I found it when I was putting in a new garden!.

So, we heard tons of bugs being zapped at our cabin in NH and numerous studies have shown that bug zappers are rather ineffective at killing female mosquitoes. What bugs were being killed then? One 1997 study (1) determined that the mosquitoes found in zapper collection trays were non biting midges (look like mosquitoes) that are attracted to light. I also recall giving my daughter a DEET-based product to spray the area surrounding the house to repel mosquitoes. Perhaps she used that in addition to the zapper and that is why she has noticed a difference.
5604	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Should have bought this sooner and helps a great deal on mosquitoes and kills lots of them every night.

>> Bypass loppers work well closed "slow and easy", like scissors. Anvil loppers work best snapped close (like using a cleaver on a cutting board).

3940	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I guess I could drive down to Lowe's and get a cheaper saucer, but this is great!  Put a large Norfolk on it that I always want to drain well.  Seems to me to be a very solid grade of plastic, but hey, that's for the experts.
In a pinch you can use this as a wood stove (works best with twigs and kindling type small wood pieces).

9078	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This filter and housing were a poor design that allows dust leakage. I had a craftsman with a dusted engine because of this filter design. Briggs stopped talking to me about it and quit returning my emails. If you have one of these engines and it isn't dusted consider yourself lucky. I sold that mower and bought the same model with a Kohler.

The fact that the food sits closer to the coals is a big plus! With a nice bed of hot coals I cooked a 1.5" steak 4 minutes with the cover on and the vents fully open, then 1 minute with the cover off to seer the steak and give it a nice char.

5843	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the third Weber Smokey Joe grill that I have owned. My first one was stolen (twice!), and my second one eventually succumbed to the rust caused by our harsh Chicago-are climate. I replaced that one with a similar model from Char-Broil. It wasn't a bad grill, but my wife and I really liked our former Weber Smokey Joe, better. She told me that when the time should come to replace it, we needed to get another Smokey Joe grill. Well, the Char-Broil's leg finally rusted through on one side and snapped off, so I am now the owner of a Smokey Joe once again. It's just a great little grill that is perfect for my family of five. I get the great taste of charcoal-grilled meats or veggies on a grill that has a very small footprint. I hope this one lasts a long time, and I'm certain that this is the model I will purchase, again, when the need arises.
926	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Wow! This worked exactly like it was supposed to! What a pleasant surprise! I used it all summer for my flower beds and my gardens, and it never failed to do its job. I would simply run clear water through for several minutes after each use, to clean the nozzle and tube. Thanks, Gilmour, for making a product that works!
5516	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is the first manual mower I ever used and I'm very happy with it. Lightweight and easy to push. Performs extremely well with "normal" grass. I bought mine used and will buy another one when/if it wears out.

The solutions stays fresh longer in this one than in the Hummzinger which molds very quickly.  Only down side is that they seem to drink off the back side so the bottle obscures your view.  Maybe just in my yard....  Buy this one though and you will be much happier than with the highly rated Hummzinger.
Would recommend it.

The first mow is a bit of a back and shoulder killer. This is because it takes a lot to push. Until you get used to it, it will keep killing you shoulders and back. Also at the beginning of each mowing season you will have to recondition your body to the mower.

2328	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Durable, lasts, works well with ROH, Oils, pepper suspensions.
It comes with a couple attractant stick-on dealies.  But you'll definitely want to buy more if you use it year-round like we do here.
8760	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Just follow the instructions carefully when installing the legs and they won't fall out on you.  I especially like the folding grill gates that open to allow the addition of more charcoal as needed.
3276	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this as a Father's gift for my husband.  It is made of heavy quality material and will last a long time.  The grip on the handle keeps the turner from slipping out of your hands.  The surface is large and has a sharp edge which makes removing food easy without pushing it around the grill.

this tool saves trees.  get it before you can't save yours.
Overall, a good value for a very small grill.
3575	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I'm very pleased with the lawn mower.  It's light weight enough for me to lift it in and out of my Jeep.  (I take it to mow around the family grave sites at our local cemetery.)  The only issue is that if there are twigs on the ground you need to rake them away first; otherwise the mower blades will get stuck on  them and not move.  Then you have to bend down & pull them out.  Other than this, I really like my new mower.

Besides the new, much-improved design, the angle of the feeder ports is perfect for the Anna's I have (the smaller Rufous have to crane in a bit to reach the feeder).  Other feeders (especially those that have nearly flat bases, are a lousy design - hummers have to really kink their necks downwards to feed - not ideal).

983	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product for my garden, no leaks, easy to manage as compared to other sprayers
3733	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Don't buy this! I bought three. One broke after two uses, and the second after two months. In both cases, the hose separated from the connection collar. I guess the only reason the third is still working is because I've only used it once so far. What a waste of money.
The only draw back is that the bottle is only 16oz.  I emailed the manufacturer to see if you could use a bigger bottle but they said no.  So, if you have a really large area, look somewhere else unless you don't mind stopping to refill.

819	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this a few years ago when I started doing my own lawn care again. I got tired of paying a company to pretend to put products in my yard and leave a sign. I use it for chelated iron, nitrogen, cross check insecticide, and fungicide. I've yet to have any issues with it. It has got to be the best hose sprayer on the market. I've actually tested the accuracy with a bucket and find the tablespoons per gallon to be spot on when using water to test with. I would assume it would do just as well with actual products.

5040	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	this was a disappointment. I does hold some of the grass, but not enough and it pops off too easily in the middle of mowing spilling the grass. The gap between the blades and catcher is too large and allows grass clippings to escape.

1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.
The only other option is to find an old used Thompson or Kees at a yard sale.
1390	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.

cons:
5519	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are the first (and, so far, only) parts to go on our hummers' most popular, old feeder.  I hated to buy a whole new feeder just because the bees had shredded these little plastic cages over the years, so I was thrilled to see them sold separately on Amazon.  I also find that little black spots, which I'm assuming to be mold, develop on these which I can't completely clean off, so now that I know where to get them, I can treat the birds to new ones every Spring.
If the grass is high enough, you can see where to cut. But you really don't want to manually cut tall grass with this. If the grass is shorter or sparse, you have a problem seeing where you've cut. So, you have to overlap a fair amount and end up with an effective path well less than 20 inches (more like about 16).

The blade is serrated so I cannot sharpen it. It is light so it won't move fast enough through the grass.

8821	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I love this grill. It cooks great and the food comes out delicious. The ash catcher is a real nice feature. The only dislike I have is the legs are very wobbly, they should have bolted them on. You have to be carefull when you move it around or the legs can fall out. I have a big Jenn Air gas grill but the food comes out much better on the Weber. This grill could use a thermometer on the lid but other then the legs  and thermometer it is fantastic.
My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.
69	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I generally buy metal fittings and couplers when I can but this was for a yard hose which I use and move around less frequently.

Metal is best but these cost less than half the price and have held up very well so far.

9564	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It does the job. At this price it does not have a manual flow adjustment so I had to buy a separate PVC valve for that. I like the low profile straight-through design.
The sprinkler housing is very heavy and feels strong and sturdy, made of cast iron.  There are some plastic components which worries me in the Texas sun, but they have performed okay so far.  The instructions were very detailed and easy to follow.  Basically there are 2 speed settings (hi=fast but less water, low=slower but more water), and you can twist the arms up or down to change the distance it throws.  Also, it has a bump button on the bottom that is supposed to work with the plastic stop ramp.  The stop ramp feels cheap and flimsy, not sure how long it will last.  The sprinkler itself feels like it will last at least several years.

My kids loved it this summer and we only had a few minor glitches. The pump is a little trooper. It was used to fill the pool from a creek as well as being allowed to run up to 3 days straight (oops).  One "glitch" - my kids let some of the air out of the upper ring. No one was in the pool and I just happened to remain outside. The water suddenly began flowing over the ring, pushing the side down - it was a problem that would have resulted in losing all of the water (and causing a flood in our basement as we have poor drainage), if I hadn't been there to hear the sudden rushing of water.  For the price just lasting this one summer makes it worth it.

7446	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These replacement grates, while stainless steel, are not solid rods of metal like most grates but are instead tented metal, with a dull finish.  At first I worried that they would not hold up, since my previous stainless, solid rod-type grill grates (more on that later) were completely ruined after a couple of years of use; however, these seem to be holding up well, much better than most.

I am amending the above review.  The hose broke and the company does not honor the lifetime warranty.  It lasted less than a year.  The end swelled up and leaked a steady stream only to get worse every day.  The company appears to be in some sort of transition or something since they do not answer to anyone that I can tell.  I think Amazon should remove this product since the warranty claim is outrageous and they have no intentions of honoring any claims.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

There is a unlabeled fuse that blew in the device and I can't seem to figure out what amperage it may be to replace it. It does not look like a serviceable part because it is soldered to the wires covered with tape. I'm not afraid to cut it out and replace it if I could just figure out what it was. Frustrating.

Now for the Earthway 2150.  Once assembled, the first thing I noticed was that it had 3 holes, not just 1, in the bottom of the hopper so that fertilizer dropped into the impeller more uniformly.  The impeller seemed to rotate faster for the same forward speed.  This would mean that when I am going slower uphill, it is still throwing fertilizer quite a distance (compared to the Scott's).  The pneumatic tires are tremendously easier to push up hill and even allowed me to travel faster than I could with the Scott's with the possible result that uniform application of the fertilizer will have improved.
First, I went over the edging with Edge Hog that I did before and I zoomed over and the edging came out more polished than I ever did before. Best edging on the block! It looked like it was professionally done. Then I went over the part where the edge had lots of overgrowth with tough dirt. Was I able to go over it in one pass? No. Did I expect to? No because this is tough overgrowth grass with tough roots where I was literally jumping and kicking the spade edger just to dig in. I went over the edge with Edge Hog, used the spade edger to help get a little dig and then went over it one more time with the Edge Hog again. Sure I wish I had a gas powered $300 edger that I can zoom everything in just one swipe but I don't want to spend that much money and this Edge Hog made my lawn job so much easier and quicker even if it takes multiple passes on the initial edging.... After that first tough dig, I am zooming over the edges in a couple minutes with no more multiple passes. You should be too. I heard some cons on here like that they felt the need to push hard against tough dirt (*Don't do that. Let the blade do the work. Slow and steady on the initial edging), Edge Hog not working nicely in wet dirt? (*manual says don't use it in moisture/wet environment), swerving? (*use the guide and the 2 black arrows that line up perfectly... lean to the side, aim the arrows like you are looking down a rifle or pool cue and you will get perfect edge line and won't accidentally get sparks), multiple passes on initial edging? (*unfortunately that is somewhat expected because it is electric and not the powerful and very expensive gas models... Is it worth to go over a couple times just on the initial edging to save like $200-300? I think so.). I can't comment about the durability as I haven't had it that long. And I can't comment about the trencher because I haven't tried it yet. If I have issues, I will update this review. I would give this Edge Hog a 4.5 out of 5 and recommend it but don't expect the performance of +$300 "full powered" gas powered edgers that has like double the HP of the Edge Hog and can go through the INITIAL edging quickly in one swipe. If someone wants all that power and wants easy one swipe on the initial edging, expect to pay like 5 times more with one of those huge rolling monster gasoline edgers. After that initial edging from the Edge Hog, the edging becomes very easy, very quickly and looks very polished.

> It is easy to punch yourself in the chest using them, especially when trying to cut thick branches, if you cannot step back (for example if standing on a ladder).  "Compound" means that a large movement of the arms moves the cutting blades only a little---giving you more leverage.  That also means that you have to spread the arms very far apart to grab a large limb.

Pros: Easy to clean and fill and a wonderful design for watching hummingbirds from the comfort of your living room.
Occasionally the sprinkler arms need to be tightened.  Even without such crashes, they typically require repositioning on nearly every use.  The reason is that its spring-loaded shut-off valve is located below the main body.  It stays closed once it has been triggered by the brake until all water pressure is out of the feeder line, or the hose has been disconnected.  Thus the act of reopening the spring valve generally requires that I turn the sprinkler on its side. The valve can be cranky. So the process is a mild annoyance.  This situation might be improved by putting in an extention to the hose attachment leaving my hand a little more room to manuever next to the body of the tractor.  I guess I have not been bothered enough to worry about it.

I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a "no-kink" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.
9684	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I do lots of gardening around my yard during the growing season, and found I needed a new transplanter to replace a couple I had that got either lost or broken. I found this one to work very well, and really liked the way it felt on my hands, especially when having to break through our soil, which has lots of clay. The blade is nice and thick, and doesn't get misshapened during use, which makes it well worth the money. The only small knock I might find with it is I'd like the blade to be a bit wider, but that certainly doesn't take away from it being a quality product overall.

Up until yesterday I was going to give this product a 3 or 4 star review because it does attract bugs and kill them. But for the amount of bugs in my yard, I was disappointed in how many were being zapped. I placed the zapper within 10 feet of two bushes where swarms of mosquitos are known to hide in my yard, and left the zapper on 24/7 for several weeks, but the mosquito swarms are still there. They are smaller, but they're still there. I find that odd since the zapper is supposed to attract them and at night around here there is no other light but the zapper to compete. I also don't like that the cord comes out of the top, so when it's plugged in to an extension cord it hangs crooked (the weight of the cord pulls it to one side) and this makes it look ugly.

I have over 16 placed around my property, and in my house (2 1/2 acres). First the ramp is NOT spring loaded lol lol (you won't see engineer next to that guys name). If you do NOT periodically clean these traps, you will get sand, leaves, spider webs, etc etc in them. This is a repeater mouse trap..mine are over 7 years old (recommended by a Feed Store owner (Ken Swapp)). I can only imagine that the negative reviews are members of PETA, or the Humane Society (which I donate to). If you negs. don't like your tin cats, email me and I will buy them from you (via Ebay). They last forever (I am surprised victor invented these) Like the saying goes it is better (more profitable) to TREAT a disease,than to CURE it. These CURE the disease (being mice).

I did use my hand saw to clear out the larger roots. & I did revert  to the old hole digger when I wanted to jam out some rocks. I also used a trench shovel to break lose some rocks out of reach and then pulled out the rocks with the old hole digger. It worked for this little old gray haired lady.

4488	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Good Cutters, but they have limitations.  Like any metal, cutting on rocks (like when stuff is on ground) will wreck them as rocks are sometimes harder than the metal (duh!).  The foam on the ends of the handles gradually over a year or two will fall apart/fall off, so don't expect them to last.  Yes, you can replace the cutting parts, but you might as well just buy a new one as the cost for both is almost the same as a new pair.  The cutting parts do come off so you can sharpen, smooth, whatever, and adjust them back in place.  Mine last for 3-4 years, depending on how much abuse I give them.  If I only used them for small limbs & branches ON THE TREE, they would last several years longer, as long as you take care of them--keep them oiled, out of the weather, adjust as necessary.

9456	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Starting early on in August, we began seeing a lot of flying insects getting into the house at night. Nothing major, maybe one or two at night. I always had wanted a bug zapper. But having the few stray bugs in the house was enough to get my wife to agree it was time to get one (she hates bugs).
I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought "how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free."  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.
We had used one years ago at our cabin in New Hampshire which was also surrounding by trees and foliage and mosquitoes were a particular problem since the region used to be a swamp. It seemed to be working since we could hear the zap sounds of insect victims. My daughter says that bugs seem to be a lot less prolific. Indeed, light-seeking insects, and other flying ones that happen to fly in its path) will be killed by this zapper (moths, et al). Still, zappers tend to be ineffective in killing biting mosquitoes even though other insects will be killed by the score.

After struggling at first to get the handle properly attached and not realizing that our strike plate was too low, I got the blades sharpened.  You will need to adjust the mower deck/ strike plate prior to sharpening the blades or they have nothing to strike against to sharpen themselves.  Once raised to the correct height (google it), the sharpening system works great.  I did struggle to get the handle to turn the blades to stay on as it didn't want to fit our mower very well.  I did follow the instructions and washed all the sharpening compound off the blades after use and sprayed WD40 over all the mechanisms of the mower.  The mower works great again and I will continue to use this product for the life of our mower.

Had a huge female mantis on mine eating the moths that were coming in. Price wise this was half the cost of one at the local hardware store.
1593	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great product
It stands about 1-3/4" tall (set screw max height) and just a little bit over 3" wide (drip arms width) and the drip emitter arms (90-degree elbows) are turnable so I can even have them pointing to the sky if I need too for areas where this could be right at ground level.

4117	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This works so well.  We have a fairly small yard and it only takes about an hour to do front and back.  It's easy to push, and no messy gasoline or trying to start a mower.  I love it!

It covers a really wide span of grass
1232	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I wish I had found this sprayer 20 years ago so I could have avoided all the frustration and wasted money I have spent over the years.  After using this, the three I had went in the trash because they were a constant problem and a big headache.  This is wise investment if you work in your yard as much as I do!  Absolutely a great product and especially for the price.
The Cover fit perfectly without any adjustments, looks great, and is made of a strong, heavy material. Pulling the cover on and off is simple, and it looks like it will do a great job of keeping my Weber shiny for years to come.
1514	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Not much to say, it's a hose nozzle.
Corona really makes quality products. The Corona FL 3420 Compound Action Anvil Lopper with Fiberglass Handles is a must for gardeners! It is easy to handle and cuts through pretty big branches, etc. The handle is soo comfortable, so even little hands can use this product successfully! The length of the handles makes it so easy to reach branches that seem out of reach.

391	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great tool, wouldn't garden without it. I've been using one of these for about 7-8 years and it makes gardening easy. I have a large garden and raise a lot of sweet corn. It's especially good with corn and beans. I have two different size corn plates, one plants close and the other plants farther apart. The one plate takes garger grain than the other. The larger grain using the smaller plate is the reason why seed gets stuck in the holes and pops out or jams the seeder. It's also great for beans. I used it for the first time this year for cucumbers and it plants them very or too close but all you have to do is walk through and thin them out. It's kinda hard to use in sod ground because the shoe keeps picking up the sod. Ground needs to be well tilled. I love mine ,in fact I have two of them.  I don't care for the marker that comes with it , I like to string off my rows and make them a little wider and straighter. Alan Bane

It was easy enough to assemble, the mower is already put together you just have to add the handle. Very easy to push. I only had two issues: 1. Even the tiniest twig can stop this puppy. I had to rake first and even still I found myself having to pick sticks out of the wheel. 2. It is hard to get the perimeter of a building mowed. The wheels stick out a few inches from the mower which left a line of un-mowed grass around the building.

I am a little nuts, so as someone else posted that he had dug a 30' deep well shaft, I decided to try something similar. As I mentioned I have HEAVY clay, so I wanted to drill a test borehole to see if I could do a dry well. I thought 10' would be enough, it wasn't. I hit super heavy hard sticky clay which is a PAIN to go through, but with steady turns & a constant downward pressure, this thing just gently drills away. My clay was wet, which sounds awful, but it actually digs into it better than dry clay which is like digging into concrete.

2975	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I have less than a 1/3 acre lot, so I figured this should be adequate since the box says for up to 1/2 acre.  The goods:  well built, string feed seems to work well.  No need for power cord, gas.  No battery memory (claimed)  Quiet, no exhaust.  The bad:  I'm 6 feet tall and find the handling real ackward.  The battery last less than 15 min on a full charge.  I do light trimming and edging and I find that I can only do 1/3 of my 9000 square feet lawn with each charge.  A two hour recharge bought me another 5-7 minutes.  The narrow 12" cutting path exacerbates the problem since sometimes I have to make 2 passes to finish the job.  There is not enough power to cut tall (6" or more) grass.  I returned mine and bought a gas powered, which I'm much happier with.  If you live in an arid area where grass never gets real tall, and your lot is very small, this may be perfect.  The reason for 1 star is that it is not appropriate for lot size anywhere near 1/2 acre as stated right on the box.
2101	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent axe. Very well made and it works great for chopping soft or hard woods.  Keeps a good edge when sharpened.

8937	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered two of these mousetraps in August of 2010. I chose the product because it was very similar to another brand I purchased months before. That product caught mice, but was made of plastic and after emptying the trap three times (It caught five mice for me) the little buggers managed to chew enough damage to render it useless.
If anything, having a reel mower and a gas mower would probably be the best for someone with a large lawn or grassy areas. Mow a few times a year with the gas mower to clear and compost, then maintain with the reel mower.

6928	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Caught 2 moles so far. Dont go by the directions as everyone else has said. Just find a tunnel and set your trap with the safety on. Use the claws to judge how far apart to cut into the dirt. Use a hand trowel or small shovel to cut into the dirt to make groove in the dirt for the claws to move through. Press the tunnel down in the middle of your 2 cuts and put the trap in place until its so far in that any movement will set it off. Get it to where it sits on top of the smashed in tunnel without going off and then release the safety. What does the trick for me was watering the lawn around the area. The worms will go for the water and the moles will start to move. I set 4 traps for better luck.

The lock is easy to use and very accessable, making one hand operations a breeze.  The best thing about these is that  they'll fit in your back pocket and stay locked.  I also have a ratcheting,  anvil style clipper that works much better on slightly larger twigs with  much less effort.
9614	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Now THIS is a GREAT SHOVEL!!!  It's so wonderfully made, great construction QUALITY!  Infinitely better than anything plastic!

With your knees between you and a bed that's more than a foot or two wide, you aren't close enough to garden, and it you try to, it stretches your back worse than bending.

It was fun to sit back and relax and not have bugs buzzing all around me. He is very happy with this and so am I.

1243	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Awesome hose sprayer! I was originally looking at some other models with different options since i thought this one might only be a jet stream, but that certainly isn't the case. Depending on the pressure that you place on the handle depends on the pressure stream being pushed out of the hose. So if you have the handle halfway pressed the stream will be more of a shower (good for plants). This is exactly what i was looking for, and i can tell that the build quality on this item is super high so it will last many years to come! Super happy with my purchase!

Why buy the post hole digger being reviewed here?  Well there are several reasons.  The first and probably most important is the fact that I am getting old...almost as old as the dirt I am digging in.  Hefting a tool of this weight over and over and over again has become a monumental task, one that haunts me for days after I use it.  Secondly, I have absolutely no intention of ever, for the rest of my life,  building a fence!  That is why I have large and strong grandsons.  I will keep the old monster for their use.

3734	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	They work great, but are a bit expensive for the amount of line you get on each one. For just a couple bucks more you can get 10 times more line and then all it takes is a few minutes to rewind the new string on the spool when it is empty. I did buy one of these so I always have a spare sitting on the shelf.
Extremely low maintenance

3348	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My Ryobi trimmer is a little old so the local hardware stores don't carry replacement parts; this bump knob works fine.

The light attracted tons of moths, but I didn't notice any mosquitoes at that particular moment. There were a few flies that died on it, but I had to unplug the zapper halfway through the night because of a storm. I still don't know if it's safe to keep it plugged in during rain.

It sounds like great idea, but it fades in the backyard. No way, it can help curbing blood thirsty mosquitoes.
7839	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good quality for a short piece of hose when you don't need a longer one.  I use it to extend my hose for the extra few feet it needs and don't want to put a 50 footer on the end to have to roll up.  Follow up after three months of use it's great, use them on the end of my hose next to the sprinkler, so when moving the sprinkler I just kink the hose (I know) I figured when the hose fails from so many bends no big deal just replace the hose instead of cutting of the last 5 feet and repairing the connection.  Well after 4 months of constant use in a tropical climate with lots of uv the hose shows no signs of deterioration .  The three sections I got with my order are better quality than the high end hose I purchased at costco.

9496	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Fist of all, they could add about 4 more foot on the AC cord, Never see anyone only have a 1 1/2 cord. Looks very cheaply made. Only 2 little screws to hold all the weight of this unit. The hanging ring is not solid, Had to weld the ring together so it won't let go in a strong wind. Could of use a On/Off switch on it too.
6385	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these for years. It's sturdy, and small, which makes it convenient for travel. Admittedly, it won't work well for backpackers, but if you're looking for a great little grill for camping or your small recreational vehicle, this is your answer. It will easily accommodate outdoor cooking for four people. Keep it clean, and it will last forever..

3509	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	These work good in places that are too thick for a string trimmer but not heavy enough to require a metal blade cutter. I really like them for medium duty brush cutting. They are the best of both worlds but also the worst of both (string and metal). Hitting rocks, rip rap, metal, thick wood, they will wear faster or just completely break. You'll know when you broke one, your unit will run wobbly. Easy enough to change out, though. With all that said, I give them 4 stars because they are great for certain applications and all-around pretty good. The company is top-notch, they are USA based and they will answer any of your questions.

2498	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	She said the hose kinked the first time she tried to use it. Perhaps that was more likely because I coiled it the opposite direction from how it was coiled in the package. We changed and coiled it the same way it had been, but in large circles. That helped a lot. After several weeks, it is now much better. It seems to be good quality.
It doesn't kill all the mosquitoes. They are small enough that they can fly through it. However, I placed this away from my patio. Therefore, the insects are attracted to it instead of me and my guests.
3167	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Works well.  Easy to handle
The grill is compact, yet large enough to cook 3 fair sized N.Y. steaks. It is light weight takes up little space and is easily stored. It is fairly efficient in propane us. The igniter is a great feature. The grill heats up quickly to cooking temperature. The flavor is good after having used it 10 or so times (I am a charcoal bigot). The quality of construction is good.

The color Saddle Shimmer does give fair warning, but even though it really is only a shimmer, it's still more then I like to wear (just a personal preference)  That being said, it does apply very smoothly and stays put.  I just wish this company would make a product that has no shimmer or glitter.

5815	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	We had put it up to keep the chickens out of the garden. It is fragile and tore easily. Also the holes were small enough for insects to get stuck! Bees couldn't figure it out. Maybe they couldn't see it well? Won't be using again.

3240	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I am coming from using a spade edger, rotary edger, B&D 18v trimmer (flips to edger) and a 27cc gas trimmer that I tried to edge in the past. Edge Hog easily wins and I will compare them all! Those hand tools actually work well but it takes a lot of time and work. With (1) spade edger, I am jumping on the spade edger like a pogo stick and moving a measly 6 inches at a time. With the (2) rotary edger, you get a tremendous workout but the rotary edger clogs and the wheels don't always spin. And edging with a string trimmer is good just for maintenance of the the edge but not with the first initial edging. And I actually like using my (3) black and decker 18v trimmer that flips to an edger and it is pretty comfortable but the nicad battery runs out way too quick for me to completely finish trimming and edging. String edging is still nowhere near as polished looking as metal blade edging because string power can't compete with metal blade power. My (4) 27cc gasoline trimmer isn't comfortable and it is pretty difficult to balance and see for the perfect edge. I can see lot of shoddy edging and wasted string by accidentally hitting the concrete. Flipping a trimmer over to use as an edger? Not for me. Shoddy looking compared to the Edge Hog perfect edging. With time and effort, those hand tools work and have pretty nice results but I needed an easier way and the Edge Hog was the answer.

9660	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The reel will hold 100 feet of 3/4 inch garden hose, but revinding and pulling the hose out is a challenge. The hose guide at the bottom of the reel acts like a brake. It would be better not to have this guide, or it should have rollers for allowing the hose to slip through.

882	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I am only giving this hose two stars because it is HEAVY and simply not easy to use.  Not only that but getting it stretched out to its full length is difficult due to its weight and the tightness of the coil that it was in in its packaging.  I do believe that the hose will last me a long time and maybe the fact that it is so heavy proves it is well-made, but, if you are a woman without much upperbody strength and you do not want to struggle to move a hose from place to place in your lawn or garden, then, this is not the hose for you.

4581	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So far, so great! Cuts beautifully...cross-cutting. Leaves the clippings right there. On lower settings, it cuts VERY close to the ground, too! It's quite even. No, it's not like a power mower... but it's easy to use, lightweight - when rolling, that is - and the blades cut well. It does make a bit of noise when the blades are turning. It's not horrible, but those sensitive to higher-pitched noises may not like it. NOTE: it does NOT cut certain things above a certain height. I don't recall what the cutoff is, but once the grass gets too high, this will NOT cut it! That's because of the way the blades work. I used a weed-whacker to chop things down, then it cut just fine. So...you have to keep up with it. What's the up-side? NO gas, NO electric, almost maintenance-free, doesn't take up much room, doesn't overheat... isn't hard to push, and has a nice, 20-inch cutting width! Even a good-sized lawn is no problem for this. However, it will not cut into corners. You'll need a weed-whacker afterwards. Still, it's the perfect choice for those who are trying to be eco-friendly, or who just don't want the extra cost and maintenance of a powered mower. REALLY could use a good grass catcher attachment. The one that's out there isn't made by Scotts, so it doesn't really fit correctly. I'm looking for a better solution.

These are sturdy and re-useable. If necessary rinse them off with a hose. I've had a pest control guy tell me that traces of blood on a trap actually help attract the next victim. They're omnivores, so maybe so.
6733	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I won't have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.
Holds good pressure and delivers a steady stream down to fine spray. Can not mist droplets.

Within a day or so, there was a dramatic disappearance of flies trying to muscle their way in, and an abundance of ones trying to get into that cup of doom. Disposing of the cup when you're done is the worst part. I wrapped that sucker three times in cling film, taped the cling film shut with shipping tape, put it in three different shopping bags, and then put that whole mess into a large paper bag (which was destined for the garbage anyway, as it wasn't useful as a bag anymore) so that the thing stays upright, and doesn't tip over and leak the disgusting smelling water into anything.
Actually cutting grass with the mower I quickly realized that unlike a rotary mower which cuts up to or beyond the wheels, the cutting path for this mower is about two inches in from where you see the wheel path. With a rotary mower you could follow the wheel path for your next pass but not with this mower.
140	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This Earthway 2150 Commercial Spreader is GREAT! Very sturdy and the large tires roll over roots, twigs and bumps very easy. Also easy to roll on inclines. I put 20-30 lbs at a time. When the material gets towards the end you have to shake it a bit as you walk to keep it flowing but that's not a problem. I noticed that the setting that the weed and feed bag gave for Earthway was 11.5, was not enough, it barely came out. I pushed the handle and closed the opening then reset it at 13 which was better, but I had to walk the area again to use the amount figured for the 10,000 sqft. Next time I'll set it at 14 (trial and error). I washed it really good and sprayed it with Fluid Film. I plan on using it 2-4 times a year. Hope it lasts for years. :)

When it gets real muddy, i hose it down, dry it off, and spray it with Ballistol.  Blades haven't dulled up to this point.  You have to keep an eye on the bolts.  They are similar to a wing nut.  If they fall out, you can easily upgrade to a hex wrench screw/locking nut from home depot for about $2.
1575	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This nozzle doesnt leak at all. It can spray in a mist or a focused jet. It has a small triangle you can clip into place and lock it in the on position if you are doing a bunch of watering. It is simple and great!
4333	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I thought this was a good idea.  It was obviously a little flimsy, but i figured it would work with my small orchard.

What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.

6117	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	the item pictured was the 209-6. We inherently were shipped the 209B. Two different type hummy feeders. now the 209B,s top is  not conducive for proper hanging and is not as stable as the 209-6 model. Also the base is split into two separate pieces. not stable in the Wind- all the liquid drools out thus attracting sugar type pests. Terrible design if one cant keep the liquid in it. the 209-6 has a one piece design  - a little tougher to clean- But at least it holds the hummy liquid in its base holder. So for the design team at perky pets. horrible design and not very functional. We returned them . The company was very cordial . So do your Home Work and ask, call, email to make sure if you want the Better style  209-6 the pictures are Not as advertised/sales. you will be disappointed.

9379	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot's of foliage and a koi pond.  I built a stand for it and placed it about 20' from our patio, on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well.  It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is "gone" to break the arc.

Killed zero animals other than rats (we have lots of wildlife here and I'm surprised we haven't killed any lizards yet.)  All clean kills to the neck so far.  No mess, no suffering.  Not much more one could ask for in a rat trap.  Easy to set and very powerful.  Using stale marshmellows covered with peanut butter as bait and killing far more rats than we'd like to see,

5. Clean it, clean it, clean it. Mice leave a mess, it's a fact of life. The amount of droppings a pair of mice can leave in these traps is nothing short of amazing. They have the market cornered on healthy bowels. Every time I clear the traps, I tap them a little against the ground to loosen the droppings ... some leave, but some are stuck, but it's OK because you're going to clean the traps every week. At least. I use a two-part cleaning process: first, I place the open-top traps on the lawn and spray them with a power stream of water from the hose. That blasts out a lot of the stuck stuff and starts to soften the droppings that are really adhering to the trap floor. Then, about a half-hour later, I hit them with the water stream again, and voila, perfectly clean. I let them sit out in the sun to dry, and then they are good to go. About every two weeks, I spray the traps using 1 part bleach to 10 parts water in a spray bottle to sanitize them. After a half hour, I hit them with water again and air dry. This may seem like a lot of trouble, but I want to the traps to stay serviceable, effective, and not become an undergraduate microbiology project that causes havoc and societal collapse as seen in the movie Outbreak.

I put plastic over the bin to hold them in but then you can't see if the seeds are being picked up by the plate.  I have tried it for two years and I'll have three seeds drop in one place and then none for eight feet or so.  The plate becomes loose and seeds get lodged behind the plate.

A tip to keep ants off the feeder: apply olive or another kind of oil to the red plastic cord.  It works 95% of the time.  Also, on other feeders I've painted the yellow "flowers" red (acrylic artists paint) to keep the bees and wasps away.  Also works 95% of the time.

We still get some bugs, but not like before and having them running across the TV screen.
I did reuse the trap.  I was careful to wear gloves and use paper towels to actually remove the rat and wipe down the components of the trap with soap and water.  It may not be as sanitary as straight out of the packaging but I'd say it's as clean as it's going to get having a dead and probably diseased animal laying on it for a few hours.  If I get some terrible disease through the experience I'll be sure to update the review.

Little did we know that the previous owners had put that pond in because of the excess water in the area. The trees were virtually always, except during summer, in puddles or swamp waters. With the recent turn-to-wet climate this problem got exacerbated. Net result: swarms and swarms of mosquitoes taking over our lot. Even the UPS guy and our postie complained when they had to deliver. We had the city come out but other than once a season spraying there was no solace.

For the trap itself:
PRO
CONS:
The reviews on Amazon were encouraging, but I did a lot more research than that. I looked at the Brill Luxus, but it has a maximum cutting height of 1.8". I don't know about you, but my lawn is definitely not a golf course. This Scotts mower is the only one with a maximum 3" cutting height, and I use it at about 2.5".
To make one tiny suggestion:  Most brass nozzles of this design have a small ridge at the tip.  This Gilmour tip is tapered and doesn't hold tubing well, especially under pressure.  If Gilmour were to run a new design, a small ridge around the tip would be most helpful.
4486	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great for the price.  These are a great tool to remove useless shrubs/small trees and dead wood.  Remember that anvil loppers should not be used to prune healthy wood on plants since it does not create a clean cut like bypass loppers.

2935	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have used these heads for over 15 years and they work just fine. The adjustment screw for the throwing distance is a pain to get to, requiring a small flathead screw driver but once they are set your good to go for several years. Setting the left side of the spay pattern requires a strong grip but again once it is set your good for many years of service. The spray pattern is adjustable to a full 360 degrees which requires fewer repair parts to stock if and when you do have a problem. The heads set flat to the ground which makes for a smoother appearance in the yard. The heads pop up 4 inches which clears the grass nicely and they retract all the way reliably. Once these are setup they are worry free for many years. I have tried other heads, and there is nothing worse than going around the yard knocking down spray heads that refuse to retract when the water shuts off. These heads are very reliable and are very versatile. With a good head to head coverage pattern you will have a beautiful yard using these sprinkler heads.

1012	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had a Gilmour 390 and struggled with it for a good year.  It sucked.  But it sucked because often it didn't suck.  Crappola, and all though the 390 is cheap, it is not worth the trouble.  Now, the 362. I could not stand the thought of buying another hose end sprayer from Gilmour after my experience with the 390, but I will say the 362 has worked perfectly.  I really have no way to check if the concentrated mixing is properly calibrated, but it seems okay.  If I had to guess, I may lean towards it being a little stronger than the setting.  Just speculation.

One reviewer complains that there is no "medium" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual "problem", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is "too good"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a "closed" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Melnor-390S-Hose-Shut-Off/dp/B00004SDYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Melnor 390S Hose Shut-Off</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gilmour-Brass-Garden-Hose-Connector-With-Shut-Off-Valve-03V/dp/B0006U66B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03V</a>&nbsp;just before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then "open 'er up" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.

7819	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This lasted part of one season before it completely stopped rotating. Waste of money!
. . . . . 1. You have four cutting lines instead of the usual two.
2) The pressure is even between both beds. Before, the water had to travel 25 feet before it started watering the second bed. Now that split is at the very beginning.
This spreader is an incredible tool.  It is well made and feature rich.  I absolutely "love" the large pneumatic tires for ease of use, and the accuracy of the spreading dry fertilizer.  The Side-Spread-Control is a very useful feature to avoid spreading fertilizer on hard-scape (patio, driveway, sidewalks, etc.).

8799	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	When conducting research on charcoal grills, it is impossible to avoid the Weber name and for good reason, they are of the utmost quality. I visited BassPro to look in person at these beauties and I was instantly sold on them.  I went home and amazon primed this baby.  When i got it, the assembly is very basic and the tools are easy to find.  Its fairly lightweight and the wheels work niceley for scooting it accross your patio or deck.  The charcoal grills give your food that smokey and rustic flavor most people enjoy.

6902	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We lost the nozzle to our big sprayer, and we were looking at a replacement cost of over $40. I clean-cut the end of the old wand, bought this inexpensive nozzle and glued it to the wand. I used super-glue to get the initial tack (welder's lingo), then I used gorilla-glue to fuse the old want to the new nozzle. It works very well. If you try this, make certain to disassemble the new nozzle before gluing and exercise restraint in applying the glue. Don't drip glue into the new nozzle, freezing it or clogging it. The entire repair took 1/2 day, most of the time was spent sitting undisturbed and drying. Price new sprayers and you will see why I resorted to the repair technique.
3650	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I used to see these things in cartoons and old TV shows and never having seen on "in person" before hesitated buying this.  I have a maintenance company that services my lawn.  Yet however, especially when it s rainy some areas need a quick touch up between lawn services - this is perfect for my purpose - I do not need to worry about having keeping gas, maintaining or storing a lawnmower.  This works well and it is virtually maintenance free.  I works well on the first pass, but if your lawn is particularly unruly, you will need a couple of passes to mulch the clippings or get a clipping attachment also available.  As a main mower, I think you could reasonably use this for 1/2 acre or less.  My kids get a kick of how low tech this is - but that is precisely the beauty of this product.
I use it mostly for volunteer work on the Appalachian Trail and elsewhere. It's great for removing large branches and small trees. It's good up to eight inches diameter. It barely fits in my day-hike pack. With the handle removed it fits in my lumbar pack.

9151	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've had these for years, running them 24/7 between April and October, and they typically last about 5 years or more. I unplug them and use a hose to spray off the bugs, with the bulb still in them (make sure it is cool). I have NEVER had a problem after doing this, so I continue to do it, usually at least once per week.
5338	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Husband bought said works great
BUT!!!! The lamp worked GREAT.
Pros- Killed lots more bugs, because it NEVER clogs up! The electric rods are straight up/down, so no cross wires to catch falling insects & clog. Dead insects fall out the bottom- Blow clean once a month.
135	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great gauge - can read at a distance.
6929	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Works very well so far (and I haven't used the attractant). Sometimes it takes more than one zap to kill the bug but the majority of them are toast after one hit. Fun to hear it at night (can be quite loud), and makes it a lot nicer in the morning when I get in my car (I have a "California garage" that is open to the backyard). Just wish it was more sturdy to stand up (it's meant to be hung).
4246	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We've used two of these until they're falling apart, it's been quite a few years of heavy use.  We just purchased two more of these to replace the old ones.
The hummers preferred this one BY FAR.
9309	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This kills bugs.  When larger insects, such as moths fly into this insect killer, it zaps the life out of them.  When the larger bugs fly into it, the zapping noise lasts for five or ten seconds.  I hate bugs, so I enjoy hearing the long zaps.  With each zap, that's one less bug flying around in my house.
1677	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These have a good grip and action.  The lock works well and the blades cut nicely.  I am happy with these shears.

3743	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great and great price. If you let the grass get to tall it can be a bit difficult to mow but if you keep up with it, it works really well.
293	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is solid hose for garden use.  It is more rugged than others I have had and the fittings are excellent.  Despite claims, it is not kink proof, but that is a small thing, as I don't think any hose really is kink proof.  And the quality here is clearly above ordinary garden hose.

6283	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	So much for Weber quality. The steel is thin, the handle is plastic now where it used to be wood, and the entire grill feels flimsy. The vent at the bottom is hard to move and it also has sharp edges. My older Weber grill, the 18" model, was better quality, no comparison.
it's not the same one.....we just have a lot of mice evidently.....which was a surprise.
9978	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The construction and material are sturdy, no complaints about that. All the settings work great. There is just a missing option I think. There's "Center" which does the center holes, "Shower" which does the outer - but not one that does both. Need more water for the plants!
So, what kind of bugs will this thing zap?
Tall stalks of grass get missed and since it does not have a suction crass that is bent over might get missed but this is more of problem where the grass is more fescue and yes weeds and crabgrass.
Would attach a video, but none of the rats have signed actor consent forms.
8315	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	useless
So to review, it waters, walks, and foes the job. It's too heavy for my wife. It can go off track, so make wide turns.
UPDATE 07/28/2013
8810	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Worked great. One dollop of peanut butter, and I caught two mice the first night - then three in the garage the second night. Picked up another stray one in the garage third night. These are California mice, really cute little creatures, so setting them back to the wild felt like the right thing to do...

9241	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I found that store-bought ones by a different manufacturer to have very short lives. They quit within about one year. I don't mean the bulbs--they can be replaced.  I mean the complete units. So I ordered two of these Flowtron units--and they failed in just under a year. When they work, they're great--they zap tons of bugs. But...then they quit.
4255	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The paint on these wears off in like 10 seconds...onto your hands. there were also some very very thin ones that would snap trying to hold up some of my plants.

9756	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	07Jul2013  This is a replacement for two 6-station controllers installed 12 years ago, whose rotary control printed markings had become obscured and irretrievable.  One of the two had lost control for one station.  There is simply no comparison.  This new unit is weatherproof, very simple to install, even simpler to program, and has considerable per-station versatility.  New features such as a master seasonal time adjustment are a real convenience.  It's about run on auto for the first time - I hope I don't have to come back with any negatives!

3137	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live in FL, so sometimes the St Augustine grass we have can get kind of thick if I don't do it regularly. I had a weed eater/edger combo and I think my yard has killed that thing. So I decided to go with a standalone edger again.
5889	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Worked well but was a little loose, i was hoping for a tighter fit (that's why only 4 stars).


3099	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This works pretty well.  Definitely gets the job done!  It was a little hard to figure out at first (the settings for the blade). After I figured it out, it was relatively easy to figure out where it was going to cut the side of the grass, but I think I still need practice. Gives a nice clean edge.

101	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	You can easily see how much rain you received from quite a distance.  I've placed only about 50 feet from the back door yet you could read this at twice the distance.  Using a couple of screws, I was able to attach this to our wood fence.
7250	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the best fly trap I have ever used.  The reason it works so well is the bait smells like a dead carcus.  The flies swarm to it.  I have had mine out for a month and it is FULL of flies.  The whole bottle fills up with dead flies.  I made the mistake of putting it outside a kitchen window and the whole kitchen smelled of dead carcus.  So put it so the smell doesn't get in the house.
I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out(three days after purchase) in my unit.  The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide.
The only thing I can say that I didn't like was the tank was really heavy to move around while full. It was easier for me to set it down and spray as much as I could before moving it. The spray is very powerful but the hose itself could be a little longer making it easier to reach spots without moving the cannister at all.
3016	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I have never needed an edge before. The wife and I purchase a new home and I noticed another lawn down the street whose driveway and walkway was edged. I liked it. I have own this home for 11 months and in the south you cut your grass on Christmas.  I noticed the grass was really creeping on to my concrete and looked horrible. I tried cutting is back with the trimmer no luck. This lays the ground work. my concrete edges have not been touched in years. I purchased this and went to work really digging in a edging my whole property and the edger was powerful enough to chop thru the grass and dirt. ( no rocks) and made my property  look well maintained. Now once done should be no issues keep up the beauty. ********NEW UPDATE.... MOTOR HAS LOST LOTS OF POWER AND MAKES  NOISE AND SMELLS....

I don't know about maintaining a first-class lawn.  There's no question of it replacing mow-and-blow type gardeners and their equipments.  I'm happy with it.  Because of the two wheels, you need some edgers to deal with the lawn edges, unless your lawn is level with landscape boundaries such as footpaths so the wheel can go over it without leaving edges uncut.  The size of lawn is immaterial as long as it's flat.  It just take me time to walk over the lawn to get the grass cut.  If the lawn is really large, I would do it in different days.

8567	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My goodness.  Last year I purchased two of the units that hold these sticky disks.  These Ultimate Flea Trap units come with a night light and plug in and you keep them plugged in 24/7.  The unit comes with 3 disks.  After that you buy the night lights as they burn out and purchase refill disks.  I'll tell you what!  The sticky disks have not only the stickiness of fly paper, but the instructions say there is an aroma that attracts insects.  We purchased them originally because last year was a terrible year for fleas and our poor dog was bringing them in every time he went outside.  We live on a farm and every time we went out and back in, our pant legs would bring in fleas.  Terrible.  I couldn't keep fleas out of our carpet, or floor.  After buying this product and placing them on the floor from one end to the other in the living/dining areas (and putting Frontline plus on the dog) you would be shocked at the number of little fleas that get caught on that paper!  Not only that, but in the night time it has caught crickets, house flyies, stink bugs, and a couple spiders.  It's amazing and I think you will not be disappointed if you tried these refills for your Ultimate flea trap unit which is made by the same company.  If I had trouble in every room of the house, I would have a trap in every room.  I purchased one for my daughter as well and she loves hers too.

6252	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I opened the box to begin assembling my Weber grill. I discovered that one of the legs is bent, and the body of the grill had three small areas that the black paint didn't cover. One area has a scratch which explains it, and the other two areas seem like they didn't paint over it.  I thought perhaps the shipping box was damaged, but the box is in good shape. This leads me to think, that Weber has poor quality control. I was surprise to see such poor quality in an American made product, yes, it was "Made in USA." I never seem such poor quality in ANY products that is made in China. I learned that just because it is made in American it doesn't mean the product is better made, matter of fact most American made products are worst than the ones made in China. I heard Americans complaint about manufacture jobs went oversea. When Americans (maybe they were actually illegals) made such a pis- poor product, they deserve to lose their job. I don't buy into this Made in America cr-p anymore; I am very unhappy.

I found out my ground is rockier than I expect, which made my work harder than it would have been without the rocks, but still this made steady progress and every stroke that didn't hit a large rock took up 4-6 inches of dirt and I had 2 feet deep holes in an hour of work, even digging around a wheel-barrow full of potato-sized rocks.

When I peek out the door at night, it's zapping away almost constantly, but it has done nothing it seems to cut down noticeably on the number of flies and mosquitos.  I wonder about those who say the unit actually attracts more insects to your yard from surrounding yards.  I need to put down some white poster board to see what's falling underneath.
7011	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The price is great, and keep in mind I am not much of a botanical whizzy, I ordered these to plant my extra seeds from my original ordering.  My fault I didn't think ahead as to where to keep these in the meantime.  So when they're wet and watered I have a mess.  If you are raising from seed and need to keep these indoors until sprouts emerge, be sure you have a place that can endure the drippy leakage that is normal.  They work great, which is why they drip well.

I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.

7122	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Every year starting in February the flies come swarming.  I have purchased the smaller versions of traps like these, but this year decided to get the gallon hoping it would keep me from having to empty it out as often.  I set it up today, and instead of waiting as the instructions said I stuck it outside on the ground where the flies are. Less than 5 minutes later there are already lots of flies in the jar and many more standing in line waiting to go in.

6976	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Size matters. This is the largest feeder I have yet to find. I mix up one cup of sugar in 30 oz of boiled water in a mayonnaise jar (6 at a time, actually) and fill my six feeders every day. They only need to be cleaned thoroughly about every 10 fillings. For that I use a bottle brush I got from a laboratory supply company. Same for base. If you let the feeders go empty for more than a few hours they will get yucky, sticky, and need more frequent cleanings. And, if you don't head off the ants at the pass you will have even a bigger mess. These problems plague all feeders I have ever owned. The 30 oz Perky Pet is the only one I use now. I am told that I have about 120-150 birds feeding on my six feeders. I would say that those people who don't have enough time to properly care for their feeders shouldn't tempt the birds. Who are they doing this for, anyway...the birds or themselves? Hope they don't have babies and then leave their diapers unchanged for two or three days. shame shame, no no

9134	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The light is per the manual supposed to some with a part that attaches to the bottom with a wing-nut that hold the chemical that attracts the bugs. Instead, this part is replaced with a snap in piece that has no bottom. Since it has no bottom the chemical came with a sticky bottom which is used to hold the chemical. The chemical has to be near the light so it heats up to release the chemical. With this new part the chemical is too far away from the light and once the sticky part heats up the chemical pack falls off and out the bottom.

As I mentioned earlier, these type mowers can be limited in scope, and they cannot handle everything.  Portions of my property have some fairly steep slopes, and even though I have a uniform (mostly weed-free) stand of Zoysia covering those spots, this reel mower is useless in those areas.  Keep in mind the mechanics of how these mowers function when considering the type of area you plan to mow - the continuous forward motion of the wheels turns the reel against the blade, which does the cutting.  I would love to be able to mow the steeper areas with the reel mower and avoid handling the much heavier motorized push mower, but the area is just too steep to allow for continuous equal pressure on the handles (and therefore down to the wheels), therefore the wheels just continually slip making cutting impossible.  I have a more gentle sloping area on another portion of the property, in which this mower works fairly well.  In fact, a smooth slope does not affect the mower too much, as long as it is actually smooth.
Would recommend.

The secret to baking in a Weber is to use the indirect heat charcoal baskets. You can keep a 350 degree oven temp with little effort. One thing to keep in mind though is when you add charcoal to the baskets, do so in between placing foods on the grill so that the charcoal oils can burn off. Alternately, you an start some charcoal about every 30 minutes and keep it in the chimney starter and add it as needed.

3229	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.

Commercial suet cakes leave behind a greasy deposit on the bottom of the feeder. I found the easiest way of to remove the grease is with Gojo hand cleaner and a plastic brush. Apply some Gojo to your plastic brush and then scrub your feeder. Finally, rinse with water and you are done. To avoid this greasy deposit you can make an aluminum boat for your feeder. Take a sheet of aluminum foil and fold it several times. Now start shaping the folded aluminum to make a boat that will fit in the bottom the feeder. Now when you want to use your feeder, the suet cake is placed in the aluminum boat where most of the grease will accumulate. At the end of your feeding system, you can throw the boat away.

3247	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live in a typical suburban subdivision with an HOA agreement. So I've got to stay on top of my yard if I don't want a "nasty-gram" from the lady who drives around and makes sure that all the grass is mowed and the shutters are painted. The B&D Edgehog and the replacement blades are a breeze to use. I've got about 200ft or so of paved surface to edge and I do it every other week during the mowing season (which in this part of georgia is from march to october basically). I have only had the edger for about 7 weeks and used it 3 times. Each time it performed really well. I did a test run of taking off the blade and replacing it as if it was this replacement blade that I ordered (but don't yet need to install as the original is still plenty sharp). It goes on easily enough and the wear indicators will let you know when to change it.

I haven't found any flaws in performance in two seasons of use. So far no issues with rust or other cosmetic issues but I keep it out of the elements under a small patio table when it's not in use.

Overall.  I feel like I indulged a childhood pleasure to purchase it.  No regrets.  There are clearly numerous creative opportunities for special effects and light shows.  Thus far, after nearly 2 seasons I don't see any need for a replacement.

But for our purposes, this paper really works. It's gross to handle because of how sticky it is, but that's what makes it so good.

Here's the deal: the picture looks as if you don't see the flies inside, but actually, that yellow label has all the instructions on it, and when you pull it out, you have a cup greatly resembling a plastic drinking cup that you might get at the movies or fast food places. You will still see all the flies. But the good news is that instead of hanging it by the cheesy, awkward little hanger on top, you can just set it somewhere--such as our dining room windowsill--when nobody is going to be there except those flies. Dinner time comes, I move the cup away. Dinner is over, I go put it back.

I would give this product 5 stars but there is one small issue. When I take the trap to the woods to release the mice they run into the little cubbies. This makes it impossible to scat the mice out and I sometimes have to stand there for long periods of time waiting for them to escape. Sometimes I open the trap and just leave it there, then return the next day to retrieve the empty trap. With the exception of this issue this product is 5 stars all the way...

However, the lid does have a couple little "hooks" for lack of a better word, inside on the ends of the lid. This allows you to slide the lid back until these "hooks" catch on the rim of the grill holding it propped open allowing you to use both hands to work with the food.

I tried it at different heights from the highest to the lowest going over the offending weed again and again and again and again, and tried other weeds again and again and again and that remained true, as a matter of fact, they're still there right now.  Plus, it's pretty noisy not to have a motor, you won't be listening to the birds mowing, more like a loud clicking.

The cutter bar has to be adjusted so that the reel blades slide against it evenly. There are two screws on each side of the cutter bar that adjust this. Basically they tilt the cutter bar against or away from the blades. Too close and the mower is hard to push, and too far away and the mower won't scissor the blades of grass. It takes about 10 mins to get it just right the first time and that adjustment should be good for a long, long time.

Not I bough the 40W, 1 acre model for about 3/4 acre I have and it works great.  Also, follow the direction and place the unit AWAY from the house approximately 20-30 ft.  I ran UF power cable with GFI outlet so it' safe.  The bugs will gravitate toward it instead of heading for your house with lit up windows.  Every few days or at least once a week, I blow the unit down with a compressor to clean it.  If you don't clean this thing, next rain storm, it'll start zapping away the moisture that arcs across the dead bugs so clean it often.  I also don't bother with the Octenol packet.  Just leave the light on all night and you'll put a dent in the bug population.

Our soil has quite a bit of clay and if it gets between the jaws, the trap will not close.  Also, moles abandon a tunnel if it is disturbed too much or dig around the trap.

However, when you've been bitten by them for most of your life, you kind of get tired of the jokes, the buzz, and the bugs.  I finally decided to try to do something about them and ordered this bug zapper.  We've been running it for a couple of weeks now and have noticed less biting insects.  I may order more of the mosquito attractant to keep them coming to their zappy death, but I want to see how effective it is when the little pad it shipped with runs out.  The unit does make a zapping noise, but it's nothing alarming.  It just zaps and then moves on with its work.

I used them on a green tree branch of approximately max width (4-5/8") and the blades separated sideways causing the pruner to twist in my hand.  This force caused the back bar (ie: not the sharp blade but the piece it cuts against) to bend outward.  I used a rock to press against and bend it back to continue cutting more branches but this happened a couple times and I gave up.  If your 'light' duty means you'll only ever cut fairly soft and small things, these may work for you.  But I doubt it.  Eventually, your're going to attempt something stiff and they're going to bend.

It's flexible so I can target the water in any direction. I have several of these sprinkler hoses for my large yard (1/2 acre + of garden.) Living in Seattle it only needs watering a couple months of the year. If we had a longer watering season it might make sense to install an official system. But with our rain these hoses are perfect for watering my beds.
Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did.

Despite all those negatives, I can report that I still have a fondness for this grill. I wish it would get a little hotter to really sear steaks, but it does an adequate job for what it is, and if you give it enough time, it will get whatever you're cooking, even thick steaks, done..... as long as your bottle of propane doesn't run out, which it will, sometimes at just the wrong time, if, like myself, you use the gas bottles designed for camping.

Why would you take the chance?? The Hummers are attracted to the anything red! Since all Hummer feeders have a red plastic base
With all hand tools please remember to use and wear hand gloves to reduce the chance of blisters. I still prefer the heavier Bow Arch weed whip I owned before this and misplaced while moving from the farm to the city. But for a lighter tool it aint bad, just twists too much when it meets resistance. For a light amount of work in an area already being maintained it works. My hands are tough but I nearly got blisters from a lite amount of growth in narrow 110 foot rain ditch/valley along the front yard. 100-200 feet should be double without going for my gloves so long as my hands are steady. Hot spots on my hand made me wonder was it the twisting of the feather balance or yanking from plants.... prefer a little more heft. If I had a stick welder, I'd weld a small weight on both ends to improve this purchase.

6375	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Yup, it is doing great. We have had a lot of rain in central Texas and as a result, I needed to eliminate mosquitoes. I have had to clean it every other day for the first two weeks.

758	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great item, it sees heavy duty use at the house and a lot of dragging over sharp rocks and concrete. Best hose I have ever bought, period!

Cooking surface is not large; but, can easily accommodate three steaks and a couple of veggie skewers.
5542	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Unfortunately, the product is not a rugged, reliable piece of equipment.  The material composing the hose itself is extremely fragile!  Not a quality you look for in a garden hose - especially where I live in the southwest desert.  The first hose I ordered sprung a leak within two days.  It was located in a protected spot, not subject to any disturbance other than sun and wind.  Why it started leaking is a complete mystery.  The seller rushed a second hose to me when I requested a replacment which was great, however, upon opening the package, I noticed the end fitting (not sure what it's called: the part that attaches to the spigot or another hose) had completely seperated from the hose end before even taking it out of the package.  Put it right back in the box and sent back for a refund.  Very disappointed!

9469	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Like the instructions say, you don't want to put this thing near where your sitting because it attracts a ton of bugs.  It took it a few days to cut down on the mosquito population - mosquitoes aren't attracted to the light but to a small thing that attaches to the bottom.  Also it does a wonderful job getting rid of the pesky insects that hover around the exterior lights at night.
This mower is wide and cuts easily and stores in minimal space.  This is a great push mower!

One reviewer wrote to use grains of rice to clean this feeder. This is a brilliant idea . . . and if you buy this feeder, try that!! But, please, don't use bleach.
4198	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Yes, they're 4 feet long, but their diameter varies in the extreme.  Some are thin as match sticks while others are quite sturdy.  I will not buy them again because about half of them aren't strong enough to do the job I wanted them for.

- Doesn't quite seem to get the water pressure I like especially on the more concentrated stream settings, but again for the price its a useful nozzle.
2861	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	With the horrible drought we're experiencing in Texas, I just wish I'd bought this sooner.  It's a great testament to its durability that it hasn't broken despite me trying to force it down into the concrete-like dried clay in my yard.
593	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A good hose.  Not kink proof, but at least it doesn't happen very often.  Also at one point it seemed like it was leaking at the end, but it just needed tightened.

3676	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Corona RS 7120 cuts very quickly and with minimal effort. (It cuts on the pullback)  I have given several to friends, one with very little strength in her hands, and she can still cut thick branches EASILY.  I have used many pruning saws, and the the size and shape of this one if perfect.  I recommend this saw highly.  You can use it in place of a chainsaw for small projects.  When the blade finally gets dull (my first one took several months of hard use), you can order new blades for about $10.00 each.  It's easy to replace the blades and they don't loosen up at all.  Warning- if you get one you will want to give all your friends one also.

5029	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this grass catcher for use with the American Lawn Mower model 1705-16, for which this unit was labeled compatible for use.  I would recommend that anyone with the aforementioned model mower spend the $20 on a better lawn rake, or having the neighbor kid pick up grass clippings, or a down payment on a leaf blower, or on materials to build your own grass catcher attachment.  This attachment is absolutely useless for the 1705-16.  It does not fit well at all, so that a large portion of the grass slides out neatly piling as you go (which looks worse than if you do not use the attachment at all).  Not only that, this attachment has a capacity of approximately 6 toddler sized handfuls of grass.  Seriously, you can only mow 10 to 15 linear feet before the catcher will not hold anymore without dumping it out (due to the way the catcher fits on the mower), and that is on flat ground - it will not hold anything if the handle bouces up.  The catcher can be modified to work in an almost mediocre fashion if you want to put the time and materials into reworking it, but honestly you would be better off starting from scratch if you were doing this.  This catcher is very cheaply made junk (four coat hangers and some netting to be exact) and is not in any way durable.  I was quite disappointed by this, because the American LM 1705-16 mower I have is a very good little reel mower and a quality product.
Using a rope the BK-15D suspended itself from a ladder and called to the townspeople to beat it against the great wall the yellowjackets had made their home. The townspeople were weary. Was this bravery or stupidity? Surely no entity could withstand that sort of punishment! Nevertheless the townspeople used a great pole and proceeded to bash the poor BK-15D against the wall. The yellow jackets did not take kindly to this intrusion and went not unlike a swarm of angry wasps. They quickly found the perpetrator. The venerable BK-15D.
529	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	doesn't kink,thats all that's good about it.  the fitting leaked first time I used it. its so stiff,it won't rap up neatly. if you leave it stretched out,good hose.  a little disappointed.  price was right.

7869	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Love it. Goes right into the basement storage area of the RV. Fits nicely at end of picnic table. I assembled it myself (middle-age woman). Lightweight but not junky. I cooked 2 dozen chicken drummettes on it at one time last weekend while camping. Easy to pick up and dump the burned coals into campground fire pit. The two grill racks means you can put your food close to or far away from the coals. This grill is totally worth the money I paid.

Great device.  I hope to never use a gas-powered lawn mower ever again!  The sheer bliss of having a quiet mow is worth it to me.
3249	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Good edger that is durable (have had for two years and still running like a champ) and does the job.  Wish it would cut a wider swath as it works.
So my recommendation is that you definitely not buy this model.  Instead, buy one that's easy to clean.  Look for Amazon reviews that talk about ease of cleaning.
885	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works very well when you read the instructions
For me--- about 30 pieces of charcoal, using the lid  easily grill --- two-three 1lb steaks or four-six 1/2lb  hamburgers, or one 2-3 lb roast (2lb tri tip... yum yum!), or about 10 hot dogs
The hose is strong and handles heat pretty well - I've left mine in the sun for a few months and it's still working fine.
Note: I can't figure out how I'm going to clean this well enough to put it away anywhere.  I'm going to rinse it out as best as I can, then hang it (empty) out of sight under a tree or something. Maybe leave some baking soda water in it.  I don't see how the smell will completely leave so if it's too bad I will be forced to toss the whole thing. If that's the case, then the disposable ones would be a LOT easier to deal with. It's just hard to imagine spending all this money for a month or 2 of serious fly season. Need much better prices so we can feel better about disposing of the whole thing.  It does work, so 4 stars. I removed 1 star because cleaning / disposing is very difficult.

6628	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I wish I had purchased these years ago.  I live in Northern California among the orchards and rice fields.  There is a permanent wetlands about 1/2 mile behind me.  There are so many mosquitoes it was impossible to use my patio and yard without full strength DEET, and even then.  My horses were sometimes  driven mad by swarms of mosquitoes despite my best efforts to protect them  I purchased two of the BK 80D units.  The first week or so I was very pleased at the number of mosquitoes that met their demise--several hundred per night.  Then, on the first truly warm evening, the unit facing the wetlands was packed thickly from top to bottom with dead mosquitoes on the side facing the wetlands.  A few weeks went by with varied weather and the several hundred mosquitoes per night.  Then came the morning of May 18th.  The unit facing the wetlands was packed again top to bottom ,this time on all four sides, and I have included photos.  I am guessing the intervals have something to do with the mosquito life cycle.  The units occasionally kill a few moths and also I have seen two or three of the insects we call mosquito killers.  It also kills gnats as I have watched them fly in and get zapped.  Absolutely recommend this.  I have it set on a timer from dusk to dawn.  I can truly say these units have changed my life as I can now actually enjoy my yard and garden.
420	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I like it for the most part.  The only down-side is you have to turn the nozzle through every adjustment to shut it off.  In other words, there is no immediate way to turn it off until you go through numerous streams depending on where you were.

If it came as described in the manual it probably would be better, but apparently some MBA decided it would save a spec of money to remove the metal parts in the bottom.

4184	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a reel lawn mower blade sharpening kit that includes the materials you will need to sharpen your blades. You will need to follow the instructions carefully. I used this on a Remington reel mower and it worked out well. You will need to remove the wheel cap on one side of the mower and insert the manual bar to turn the blade in reverse and sharpen the blade after brushing on the grinding formula. You may also need to turn a screw or bolt on your mower to adjust the blade angle to cut properly. This is an affordable kit that will work with many reel mowers and help you continue using the mower for many years. This is definitely worth getting if you have a compatible mower.
7323	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent product. We use it in our Victor fly traps. We live in Florida, next to a cattle ranch, and are bothered by biting flies. The bait attracts and traps hundreds of flies.

So much faster and easier than using a walk behind spreader.
All in all, this is a great product.  I haven't tried any other competitor's models to compare it to, but this zapper certainly does its job.

5763	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for the garden to keep our the birds.  It is a little flimsy and light. You'll need to find some way to secure the netting so that it doesn't fly away in the wind.  I just used binder clips to hold it down as I needed to be able to access the garden.  If you wanted more secure, I would do staplers and put it on a 1 inch wide piece of wood or some thing similar.  For added measure, I attached reflective ribbons to prevent the birds from flying in accidentally.  Seems to work.

It's better than the stinger brand because it's not got a garbage transformer, also it has larger openings, so bugs can actually get in.

I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.
The Gold model also remedied the other shortcoming of the original Smokey Joe--that silly pan to catch the ashes and cinders.  It never worked well, the vent in the bottom would clog up, the ashes blew all over the place in the wind and it was a royal pain to clean up.  The Gold model holds the ashes in the belly of the kettle so there's less mess.  I line the bottom of the kettle with aluminum foil, set fire to the charcoal and, after everything cools down, I just pick up the foil and dump the ashes with little left to clean up.

I have this for over a year and it always does a superb job of edging. I am not a believer of electric or battery operated tools for landscaping and only use gas powered engines due to their power, but this has been an exception. I love using this and it took care of my doubt about it being underpowered. It is powerful enough to tackle few weeks of growth and makes clean/sharp edges. I also have professional gas powered weed-wacker, but I was never good with that and always messed up while trying to edge, but Black and Decker LE750 is idiot proof.

That leads me to my final comment. The Mosquito Attachment Cartridges are very expensive. A six pack is more than $30 and can be over $40. I frankly think that is far out of line for a small strip that attracts mosquitos. Replacement strips can cost almost as much as the unit itself. If Flowtron wants to keeps customers and attache more customers they should take a look at that pricing.

It replaces one of the round small Webers that the leg broke on after about 15 years of use. The side air vents work fine and do not get clogged by ash or broken off  or small pieces of charcoal.  Easier to clean whether I use a fire ash  shovel  because it is rectangle or just pick it up and pour it directly into the ash can .  do not usually do the latter because of the ash "smoke " it causes, but still easy way to clean fast. It is great  in the shape because family members eat their beef at different levels from medium well to rare and  the rectangular shape makes it much easier to lay things out to cook on different  temps of charcoal fire or to track and turn etc,  We have a large regular kettle weber and have for used weber kettles for 40 year.  The little one  is convenient for just  three or four people ( holds  about 10 good sized hamburgers at a time or long kabobs or steaks cut for each individuals taste and since it is covered and surrounded by a fireplace with a cover and is on the patio  can used in any kind of weather, even a heavy Florida  storm if  necessary.

That being said, I found this reel mower to be a joy to use.  I'm using it on a yard with St. Augustine and a little Bermuda.  I've found that the mower works best when I'm removing less than one inch of grass so I try to watch the time between mowings.  At this height, this reel mower requires less effort to push than my 1/4HP gas mower.  Making turns with this are significantly easier than with the gas mower.

I recommend this inexpensive nozzle to anyone who has a green thumb, or for those who could derive benefit from other household uses. You can't go wrong with this nozzle.

The only issue I have with it is that my golden retriever LOVES it a bit too much, and went after one of the sprayers. She partially broke it, but to its credit, it still works fine. I don't hold this against the sprinkler, as I would never expect it to hold up like a dog toy.

706	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no "waves" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.

1947	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is very flexible and appears to be very well made. The rubber is pretty thick so it holds its shape (doesn't collapse or kink easily). The fittings on each end don't look like they will break loose from the hose and I've had no leaking issues. I see someone selling a set of washers with the Gilmour name on them so I'll probably pick them up to change them out yearly. Other than that I think this hose will last forever. I'll probably end up getting a few more longer ones for this yard.

Update:  Took it out for a spin today after Janus.  Filled with calcium chloride and tried to find the sweet spot with the hatch.  It started to jam after a few spins, and the handle slipped off my gloves.  When it jams, you can't force it because then the gears will slip.  I tried reversing it and got it to dump the rest of my load.  Overall, it didn't live up to the hype from the reviewers here when using ice melt.  Maybe better luck with grass seed.  Also, make sure there's no snow inside your spreader before you load with ice melt.  Otherwise, it will clump inside and jam also.

After reading many of the of the reviews it was apparent that killing Miskito's is only accomplished if the bait container is touching the lamp at the bottom of the unit.

2141	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	As other reviewers have stated, the axe blade is quite thin. So while it can make deep cuts, IF you cut with the grain of the wood (as one does when splitting) the blade tends to bind in the wood and you have to rock it back and forth to loose the blade from the wood. I did not sharpen my axe before testing it on a water oak stump, it was very sharp when I got it brand new. I've used quite a few axes, splitting mauls, hatchets, and sledge hammers in my time so I know how to swing one of these striking tools. This axe is very easy to swing and I did not find the handle to transmit too much shock to my hands. In fact, I didn't notice any more shock from this steel tool than I have from many of the hickory handled tools I've used. The weight of this tool is forward (in the head) which aids in giving you a good, strong strike. This is a "forest axe" blade design. Overall, the tool is light and is a very fast axe!
The other box presented a problem in that I needed a new connector for it. The solution was 3/8 clear vinyl tubing that attaches to a T-splitter. That splitter is then connected to a hose connector which attaches to the main hose. The joints were sealed with Krazy glue and tape. I will probably have to re-seal things a bit as there are some leaks. It is all a bit hokey and dumb looking, but it works. Besides, a large part of this little experiment was to see if was worth doing it at all. After a few test runs (and a couple of failures), it seems to be performing pretty well. The hose is terminated with a spring clamp and 2 pieces of shim wood which closes off the water flow.

I started leaving this light on 24/7 and again within a week there was hardly a fly to be found. I put a bucket on the ground under the light and the variety of dead insects was amazing.

I immediately loaded it with fertilizer and off I went. It is very smooth and broadcasts beautifully. I was worried about the lever and 'door' not being smooth to close once it was loaded, but mine shut effortlessly.  The only minor negative experience I had is what they all do when they are almost empty. Since the drop holes are on the left side. It started only spreading to the left when I was down to the very bottom since the fertilizer was dropping enough. Like I said, this is common to all of them in one way or another trying to use up all of the fertilizer versus dumping it back in the bag.

This is a medium grade hose with a male and female end, mine is green.  It comes with a plastic type washer on the female side. And the fittings are all brass.

5734	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Many of the slow watering hoses on here are weeping style.  That is, the hoses are porous and the water dribbles out.  This gives you slow watering bu only where the hose is laying.  I have hard soil and my thought was as the ground saturated, the run off would move down the slight slope and water the rest of the grass slowly.  However, because the sod had very little root  system this was not effective.  It needs to be watered top down.  This hose is exactly right for that
4005	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Flimsy for garden stakes, but they are OK for staking up canna lillies, gladiolas and such for a couple of months with clips of course.  Too flimsy to use for pole beans or anything that needs sturdy stakes.  Gardener for 40+ years that's tried it all.  These are OK in a pinch if you don't have stronger wire stakes to use.  Best if you have soft ground to put them in or they will break easily.  The price isn't bad for 25 stakes if you can find a use for them.  They won't last more than a year or two at the most if used for temporary purposes.

215	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Seems like Gilmour has been slowly diminishing the quality of their Flexogen line; they're not as kink-proof as they used to be.  Still better than all the others in the category (can't speak to the things that cost double and triple the price, as I don't feel like shucking out close to $100 to see if it makes a difference).  I'll be buying more of these, since I have a lot of yard to get around, and this continues to be my first choice of hose.  It will kink, but it is, as its name suggests, very flexible, and never feels like I'm trying to wrestle a python when it's time to coil it back up.  I also like the neutral grey color; it doesn't stand out on the crushed gravel and flagstone walks surrounding planted areas and the driveway.

Finally, I notice that large birds (mockingbirds, jays, robins) have a hard time trying to feed on the suet cake while hanging on one side. These birds long tail feathers are not anchored to anything and the birds start to turn upside down which they do not like. For my bird feeders, I made an inexpensive tail feather anchor. I had some scrap 3/4 thick exterior plywood (you could also use pine board) and cut it approximately to the dimensions of the feeders (5 x 5). Do not use particle board since it is not waterproof and will swell up when exposed to water and then fall apart.

Can't say enough good things about an Estwing. Famous for good reasons. I heartily recommend these. I love that they're made in the USA.

6116	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	EDITED: I ended up purchasing this mower just this month (5/2010) since no amount of adjustment made my Sears Craftsman mower useable. What a difference! I cannot use power equipment or my hands go numb and have been using a flock of domestic geese to manage 1+ acre of lawn in 4 fenced 'compartments'. A few times per year I need to give a once over with a mechanical mower and this does a fantastic job! I have some weeds and some areas with unevenness and the mower handled it fine. The blade height adjustment is a cinch to use. Cons: (1) wheels are positioned so I can't get close to my fence edge so I have ~6" of lawn to deal with otherwise (2) no grass catcher included. I prefer the snap on/snap off catchers I used to be able to get. Right now I'm mowing at the highest setting.
6603	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Smokey Joe is the greatest. Easy to use, easy to maintain temperature. This one is a lot better than the 40020 model. That one has the bottom vent on the side as opposed to the bottom and cooks VERY unevenly according to my brother who has that one. You can cook for 4 people on this grill. Ever since I got this, the 22" kettle hardly ever gets used. The 22 is now used for beer can chicken and company and that's it! ! ! I find it important to rotate the lid while cooking, which allows the air to blow across all the coals and keeps them burning evenly.

7334	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Wish they lasted a little longer, but they work well. They only work for about a year.
I have used it probably twice a week for several weeks and a few days I did the yard twice because I wanted it to be just a bit shorter.  I grew up with a push mower so I know how the older ones worked.  They were hard of course I was younger but I did try one maybe 20 years back and did not use it more than a few times because it was a pain to use.  I do wish the blade spun a bit when the wheels stop so you can get those high blades but it might spin a quarter turn but it seems to stop when the wheels stop.

Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.
341	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the only Amazon product I bought in 2004. I just now realized that it is eleven years old and it still works fine. Sometimes it kinks, but it has been used thousands of times under high pressure, my house has over 100 psi and couplings used to explode if you had a spray nozzle and didn't run to turn the hose bib off as soon as you were done spraying. Good, expensive hoses too. This one was different and still is.
The auger works by grabbing the wooden handle and rotating in a clockwise direction--if 2 people are doing it, you stand facing each other and just hand off the handle to the other person.  After the tool fills with dirt, just lift it carefully and dump it... Works much faster and with less effort than the clamshell or pinch style diggers.
I only take a star away because there needs to be a raised bumper between the ground and head.  You will scalp the ground for a while untill you get used to it but with the original head (at least on my trimmer) it had a plastic bumper.  This head needs something like that that will help prevent you from scalping the ground.  As I said you will get used and learn how to angle it so you won't have bald spots all over the place.  Overall I would recommend this.  They have a head that will hold like .130 line and I wish I would have bought but this will do!

BEWARE... the only weak link with such a heavy device on your back...is getting it ON your back... these weigh about 50 lbs fully loaded...so chances of injury are greatest when u try to get the pack ON your back.  I find a ledge, about back height, and fill it there, then back myself up into the sprayer, and put my arms through shoulder straps.  quite simple.  OTOH, if you try to lift this off the ground onto your back, beware of injury.... of course, if you are 20 yrs old and a football lineman, well, this statement prob. doesn't apply, but to the general population, it DOES apply, so give this some thought...

I got it to keep my very large and enthusiastic rottweiler from digging up the plants, that we just planted in the flower bed.  Apparently,  she thinks it is her digging box.  So far so good.  I'm hoping that when the flowers are mature plants and a bit larger, that she will give up her quest to remove them.  If not, we will keep buying more of this deer netting.

1965	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I definitely recommend this spreader, but I demote it to 4 stars for a couple of reasons that shouldn't stop you from buying it.  The small criticisms of it that I have are (1) the assembly instructions aren't easy to follow in places, (2) the design makes it very difficult to spread the smaller of the two cotter pins used to hold the wheels on the axle, and (3) the matrix showing the suggested spread rate was not even close to what I found as being appropriate.
Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!
Leaves: The second weekend, the leaves had started to fall. I experimented and found that this reel mower can handle white birch leaves, which are small enough that the mower just tosses them out of the way. However, my 5-year-old son and I had to rake up the larger leaves (such as maple).
This piston shutoff/on valve is very slick for being able to stop the sprinkler, move the sprinkler and then restart it without having to go back to the water source valve and turning it off and then on again. I typically set up the tractor, push in the piston in (it doesn't always grab without water flow but keep trying to push it in till it sticks.) Then go turn on the water. Then return to the tractor and standing where it won't spray me, I reach under and pull out the piston. Water sprays and I adjust the angle of the water diameter to fit the current need. Then I place the front wheel on the hose and run fast to get away without getting too wet. I wish the design were changed to have the rod extend up through the top of the tractor so as to provide easier access from both top and bottom sides, pushing/pulling the piston from either side.

1469	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this sprinkler to deal with a newly seeded lawn that I needed to water daily.  I liked the idea that this sprinkler can move through a relatively large area unattended.  I dislike this sprinkler because it "jumps" the hose regularly (even though it is laid straight, nothing in the way), it's gears on high-gear stripped after half a season and finally it's just slow to cover the area it is trying to cover - my old sprinkler (back and forth fan style) put just as much water down in less time so even though I would have had to move it a few times - at least I could water the lawn in an evening.

04/19/2018 Just bought my fourth sprayer - now I have one for each substance that I usually spray around home and garden.
1.  Mine gets stuck in bald spots, where there is not a thick grass mat on the ground.  In those spots, the ground gets soft from the watering, and when the wheels reach that spot, they will eventually spin out and dig a rut, just like getting your car stuck.  On areas with a nice continuous grass mat, it works flawlessly.  I resolve this issue by snaking the hose along the thickets parts of the grass to avoid the bald spots.  If I have to run it over a bald spot, I have to peep out of the window every 10 minutes to make sure it's not stuck there.

Cons: The clips that connect the base are a little fragile, but as long as you don't squeeze too hard I don't think they will break.  I also wish it held more nectar--I have a lot of hummers and they can drain it quickly.

129	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've had a half dozen of these over the last 15 years. These are great and given some to friends as gifts. Last fall I took mine down for the winter.

I decided to just replace it to save myself a brain hemorrhage. If these are out of production? BUMMER.
The clip-catcher for this mower is pretty weak. The between the blade and the front of the bag is too far. maybe 3 inches or so. I "customized" mine with gorilla tape to create a "flap" to make ALL the clippings get into the bag.  You must make certain the grass is dry. If you try to mow a thick, long grass, possibly 6 inches or higher, the clippings start to roll all the way over the blade as you move forward and then it bogs down and gets clogged.

The six feeding holes all have their own perch wire. The base is not easy to reach into to clean, but this is the same as with most feeders. It must be dipped into vinegar or some solution to remove the mold that accumulates between fill-ups. But for the price, this is a great feeder.

I started looking at gasoline powered edgers, but they were ridiculously expensive. That's when I stumbled upon this little beauty. I did a fair amount of research on it prior to my purchase because I didn't want a piece of junk. I looked at the reviews on all the major home improvement websites and the majority of people raved about it, so I decided to give it a shot. The nice thing with Black & Decker products is that they have a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so I could just return it if I wasn't happy.

Perky Pet's previous (old - 209) version was the best of the rest, but its major downfall was the inability to easily clean it.  This newer version (209B) changes the game since the base easily disassembles and all parts can be easily and quickly cleaned (HUGELY important if you want lots of hummers).  Also, the glass bowl has a much larger mouth, so easier to fill and clean.  Finally, it has a built-in ant moat.

Bend the straps in a u-shape and open the feeder. Push the ends of the strap through the holes of the feeder so the strap overlaps two consecutive feeder cage wires. This is done at each end of the feeder. Your wooden anchor is pressed along the outside bottom of the feeder with a strap end on each side. One strap end is screwed into the wooden anchor (I used 10 x  pan head screws). Then the block and the feeder are turned around to expose the other strap end. If the strap is plastic, pull tight on the strap and screw the other strap end. Now do the same procedure for the second strap. If you use a metal strap, you may need to squeeze the straps over the wooden anchor with pliers to get a tight fit. And a metal strap may stick up along the inside bottom of the feeder. You can flatten the strap with a long wide blade flat screwdriver and a hammer. Rest the bottom of the wooden anchor on a solid surface, pass the screwdriver blade through the feeder wiring and press it against the top of the metal strap. Tap the other end of the screwdriver with a hammer and the aluminum will flatten out against the feeders wire cage.

The colored water is unnecessary, of course -- the hummingbirds flock to a clear sugar solution just as readily.
There was a review that I read where someone may not use her pressure washer after using this thing, but I can NOT relate to that comment, as this sprayer does not provide a "blasting" stream of fluid(good news for my grass).

Not only did it meet my expectations, it beat them. It slices through thick wire-grass like it was butter. The handle is very comfortable, long enough to accommodate my 6'2" frame, and angled just right to where my arms were at a natural position. Assembly was a breeze, and took less time to assemble than to read the directions. If it had a place to hold a beer, it would be perfect!

The repair is simply done and can save you from throwing out 50-100 feet of old hosing -- or can be used to effectively connect two shorter hoses to reach farther than before.  Slide one clamp on the end of one of the hoses and the other clamp on the second one.  Coat the brass part of the connectors to be inserted into the hoses with a light coat of PVC cement.  I also coat the end of the cut hoses with the same  light coat of cement.  Insert one end into the first hose and tap it in place with a rubber mallet.  Then  insert the opposite end into the second hose and tap it home also.  Slide each clamp up underneath the end of each hose and tighten the clamp with the provided screw.  That should do it!

update 6-2016:  Still going strong.  The trick to catching these moles is in prep of the ground.  You need to find the main "Highway" and then loosen the soil.  You need room for the jaws to snap shut when triggered.  What I do is dig out the soil along the tunnel, arm the trap and place it in the tunnel.  I put a little dirt back over the hole making sure the trigger just touches the earth. What you want is the mole to come along and press upward against the trigger release the jaws.  I made the mistake a few times of not loosening the dirt so when it was triggered the dirt prevented the jaws from snapping shut. Overall these traps work great.  As i said before, bait and smoke do not work....

So, the way it works is that water escaping from the arm tips propel the arms around, and that drives a gearbox and wheels which propel it forward. The back wheels are like old time tractor wheels with small spikes in them  This is very effective in preventing slipping, The front wheel is cup shaped to fit on a water hose, which acts as a guide. So, you can water from one end of the yard to the other, as well as oddly shaped areas.  This will follow the hose however you place it.  So you can make it weave back and forth or even water in an ever widening spiral.  Just be sure that you do not have it drag too much hose as it goes.  The guide says 100 feet, and I believe it.  After it runs for an hour, I drag the hose closer to it so it does not have to pull so hard to move it.

The difference had to do with the standoff bumps the original has that control how much bite each tooth takes and also limits kickback. Using the original type is recommended, but this one serves the purpose I needed it for.
Curiously, when I first ordered these and was waiting for them to arrive, I picked up a cheap little plastic feeder at a local store.  Not only am I still using it, I just bought four more.

* glossary note: "back-lap" - a process of restoring a sharp cutting edge, by rotating the blades backwards against the cutting bar while coating them with an abrasive paste. This can be accomplished by either buying the sharpening kit and rotating the blades backward with the included crank, or by visiting your automotive parts store and getting a fairly cheap tube of valve-grinding compound, switching the drive gears left for right and pushing the mower with the handle flipped over (i.e. backward)
Ideal usage is to put this on a time where it goes on at dusk as it won't do much when there is ample light available.  When there isn't it's truly moths to a flame and your back yard will be the main beneficiary!!

3979	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This item is absolute junk. Not as specified. Diameter listed as 0.75" and not a single stake is above 0.25" in diameter. Unusable for the intended purpose.
First, the sheath is old school and made of beautiful thick tooled leather.  The sheath is heavily stitched and has strong rivets and double snaps.  The fit is snug and a very safe way to transport the axe.  It is well tanned but was a little dry so the first thing I did was to wipe it down with neatsfoot oil.  I recently saved a old leather sheath for a 18 " machete that had been in a shed for twenty years with neatsfoot oil it took weeks but it is restored to almost perfect condition.  You don't see much neatsfoot oil around today.
Of course, this can be great at home as well, if you just need a little grill, but don't plan on cooking for a crowd or cooking anything bigger than a pound or two.
Good luck. Lovely tool.

It took a few tries to find the right spot, and I didn't get the Shepherd's hook until the next day, but it started killing.  Slowly at first, but after the sun went down, snap! crackle! pop!.  Not so much during the day, and a shady area seems to work better.  I'm still experimenting, but the first day only one or two mosquitoes tried to bite me total (maybe too close to the unit), zero since.  They may blow in again, but they should find the Flowtron before they find me.

6726	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	5 stars is not a high enough rating, I give this feeder a 10 star.  The hummers will actually land on the perch railing which surrounds this feeder and feed for 1-2 minutes giving you a chance to really see these tiny marvels.  Well constructed, cleaning is a snap, I will buy 3-4 more to hang around the property.
The only cons I can think of would be this doesn't quite kill certain bigger pests with their chitin armor; i.e. junebugs, stinkbugs or even certain big moths. However it does stun them for (seemingly) random amounts of time, so it's never a problem to just spray in the morning with some soap water or peppermint oil solution. Seeing as this was the first bug zapper I owned I can't say I expected it to kill those types of bugs but was disappointed they survived the zap.

232	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Fantastic for a home garden.  The only issue is that seed hopper doesn't taper down to the seed plate pickup but is square across the bottom.  What this means is that you'll have a lot of seed left in the hopper and the seed plate can't pick it up.  I find myself shaking it from side to side or tilting at an angle as it's pushed (which screws up the exact planting depth).  If you buy your garden seed in the little packets, it'll be expensive.  However, guess the target users for this have bigger gardens and buy in bulk at garden/farm supply places.

Amazon to the rescue!
Update: I've had these for 10 months and they're rusting. I've used these heavily so the blade is a bit dull and they squeak every time I cut something. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks but I'm going to buy something a bit higher quality to suit my needs.

You might need to mow a little more often. If you let the grass get too out of control you'll hate mowing with this mower. Get an electric mower from Great States Mower. With a little extra mowing the finished yard looks great and the additional effort is minimal. Your body will be better for it too. Save your old gasoline mower for leaf control or mulching. I'm likely going to ditch mine in favor of a leaf rake.

3965	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We purchased a chicago 2-flat about a year ago.  I bought a used $10 reel mower that was awful, but got us through the dry summer last year.  I knew we would need a new one this year.  After watching for sales that never happened I turned to trusty amazon.  So far, I'm completely satisfied with this lil guy!  We have a relatively small yard, so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate.  I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass.  I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it, but I was pretty pleased.  It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower, but it really was completely acceptable.  Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.  You can't beat the price either!  I had no issue with the assembly, it took just a few minutes.  After watching my neighbor reel over his in short strokes to get through the yard I was even more glad that I have this guy!

I have had this type of thing before and they barely made a dent in the bugs but this one is amazing! I did my research and read reviews before ordering one and am not disappointed. I live in NW Georgia and with all the recent rains, the mosquitos are already out in full force. I have only had it up about 5 days but we have yet to even see a mosquito near any of us and we stay outside a LOT! There are 3 sizes-I got the big 1 1/2 acre one (we have 10 acres).  It has "attractant cartridges" and every morning there is a huge pile of bugs under it. Only drawback is it sounds like a mini machine gun so hang it at a bit of a distance from your outdoor sitting area! lol

I do believe "Solo" is a German company...hence the quality.
Back story in place, check. We have to get the moth numbers down. We started with a much smaller Stinger brand unit and it worked for about a week but was too small and quickly became overfull and less effective. We read more reviews and settled on what we have affectionately named, "The Big One." The grid is much larger, the ZAP sound is very satisfying, and the spaces between the plastic slats to the outer cage are big enough to allow the bigger bugs in -- like moths!

Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.

1303	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this sprayer!  I am used to using Stanley 61804 Professional Backpack Poly 4-Gallon Sprayer which works great, however, this thing works way better in my opinion.  When I mix up a batch of weed killer, I usualy need to use the whole fill when using the Stanley.  With the Solo one, I used a little more than half to cover the same area using what seemed like the same spray pattern.  So basically, I get better coverage with the Solo.  Also, it is very comfortable and I really like that the wand sits on the handle rather than on the back of the unit like the Stanley.  Overall, I highly recommend this sprayer if you are looking to get a backpack style sprayer.

My only complaint about the traps is minor: it would really help if they were clear plastic.  There are other traps on the market that are clear and it would be so much easier to know whether there is actually a mouse inside when the trap is sprung.  Some mice are so light that you can't really tell if there's anything inside the trap and you don't want to open it to see (I did this once) because the mouse will spring out of the trap and, in my case, run back under the fridge!

I've used the Edge Hog a few times when the grass has grown over the walk so much that the edger has to chew through half an inch or more of thatch, but it never balked. During a job like that you do have to open it up and clean around the blade a few times (UNPLUG it first), but it only takes a moment. I also think it's easier to clean up after the edger than a string trimmer and you don't have to worry as much about flying debris.
They do work and you have to be patient.  It might not be immediate but if there are fleas they will catch them.  But I kept up with shampooing rugs, vacuuming few times a day, ridding my pet of the fleas or else I would think they would have caught more but since I took every precaution to get rid of them, what we caught was remmants of what I missed.
I have used the Scott and the Great Lakes.  I have  also used a couple others years ago whose brand is unremembered.  The Scott's classic is definitely the best, and I've never had any problem with the "plastic gearing" -- in fact when I opened the wheels up a few years ago the gearings were metal.

When summer evenings arrives every day, all the bugs on the hills gather around the light source and take over the patio. They are not necessarily mosqitoes but some of them sting anyways. The fist unit we bought at Costco were not a flowtron. It worked... some... Then we tried Flowtron and have not looked back since. We hook Flowtron up to a outdoor dust to dawn timer and keep it on for 2-4 hours depending on the temperature. When temperature cools down, we are not bother by bugs and neither should the Flowtron. On warm nights, the first 1-2 hour when Flowtron comes on, it's non-stop actions. Although it's hung at the outskirt of our patio, we generally avoid the outdoors during that one hour. Once the zapping dies down in a hour or two, it's safe for us to go out.

That said, now for comments on the completed unit.  In past 14 years I have purchased several models of drop spreaders and rotary spreaders in my attempt to apply fertilizer uniformly and without having to have an ambulance standing by for resuscitation due to difficulty in pushing the spreaders.  I have around 1/2 acre of grass.  Front yard is about 60% of that total and is on a grade of around 7%.  Doesn't sound like much of a hill but when you are trying to push 40 pounds of fertilizer and spreader up hill, believe me, it is a lot.  My last spreaders were Scott's best drop spreader and rotary spreader.  The drop spreader theoretically could apply fertilizer more uniformly but suffers from 2 drawbacks: 1) the bottom holes and adjustable closer are plastic and subject to slight warping. With the very small holes, only a slight warping will cause fertilizer to fall faster out of some holes and slower out of others.  The result is banding (or striping) in the lawn.  Being careful to follow the wheel markings in the grass doesn't stop this banding since it occurs due to the adjustable closer misalignment. 2) the holes are rather close to the ground and any blade of grass that touches the undercarriage will deposit its dew onto the holes which will eventually cause the fertilizer to stick to the hole and not drop out.  This essentially disables the drop spreader until it is thoroughly dried out.  Applying the fertilizer in the afternoon when the dew is gone would seem like a good idea if you like heat stroke.

I put it near our chicken coop, filled it with water half way and I will say I did not use the packet they sent.  I could not bring myself to deal with the foul smell and nastiness and I was hoping to be able to reuse this  trap and give the dead flies to the chickens and I knew I could not do that if I used the  stuff they sent.  Unfortunately,  it did not work without the packet of nasty smell.  I thought it was a little over priced for what you get.  Ultimately this is just a plastic bottle with a lid.

I do have to stay on it and mow every week.  But I really find it kinda fun with this little guy, so it's no skin off my back.  Also I didn't get the scrap catcher thing, and I really don't need it since I'm staying on top of it and the clippings stay pretty short!  The only maintenance this needs is to be wiped down clean and sprayed with some wd 40 after each mow.  Not a big deal.  I love that it's quiet.  I love that it's Earth friendly.  And American made.

2649	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a very well built metal sprayer.  It holds the pressure well and the nozzles and O rings seal the tips perfectly for an even spray.  It is a little pricey but there is no comparison with this sprayer and those plastic ones you see in the big box store.  This sprayer can handle harsh chemicals and just about anything else the normal homeowner will need to spray around the house.  The adjustment nozzles have a great range so you can spray back in those deep corners from a good distance or set it to fan and get the up close spots without it leaking all over the place or on you.  The unit is well sealed for leakage at the wand end.  There is a bit of a learning curve on using this sprayer - the top seals in a different way so read the directions before you fill it up so you won't get a face full of chemicals.  Amazon shipping etc. was good as usual - they are the best.

Given the thin profile of the axe head, the tools reasonably light weight, and the ability to maintain a solid grip on it do to good length and shape--along with the grip material on the handle, this tool might be suitable for those who raise their own food or process meat. The weight, shape, and grip enable a very accurate blow to be struck with this. So far, I have been able to hit exactly the spot I was aiming to hit with this axe. The thin blade profile enables to tool to make deep, clean cuts with a single blow. On larger animals where you must contend with larger bones and joints, this axe would be perfect for quickly quartering game or making the appropriate separation at a troublesome joint. Being also that it's nearly one entire piece (except for the grip material) it would be much easier to clean this than many other axes and hatches that I've used in the past. For birds or smaller animals (e.g. chickens, rabbits, etc.), it could go without saying that this would quickly and cleanly remove the head bringing a quick, humane end. If you're someone who needs an axe for this purpose than I have no doubt my assessment was not in the least bit offensive to you. I trust we're all trying to act like adults here?

After using this grill, it is OK if you leave the lid a little off center to let more air in. It's a toss up between this and the older model. I prefer the holes in the bottom of the grill and the ash catcher which seems to provide better charcoal ignition/burn.

I thought I would insert a quick update after 3 years of use.  The mower has proven to be quite durable and is still going strong after three years.  I am fairly easy on the mower, and only use it on a very small portion of my front lawn that is less than 1,000 square feet.  I recommend spraying the mower clean after each use, and wiping it down with WD-40.  My original review below covers the details regarding for what conditions this mower will work, and when it won't.  Overall, I would probably recommend going with the Scott's Classic 2000-20 reel mower instead of this one, simply because the cutting level adjustment is so much easier.  The 1705-16 is a real pain to adjust cutting heights, whereas, the Scott's model (also made by American Lawn Mower) has a simple notched adjustment that does not require loosening nuts & bolts, etc.  If your intention for purchasing a reel mower is to make your own golf tee box or chipping area, then keep looking because this one does not adjust down to a low enough cut for those purposes.  Also, do NOT purchase the optional grass clippings catcher attachment unless you generally enjoy completely wasting your money.

I have VERY rocky soil and broke one, bought a replacement and broke that one too.  I put in a bolt to replace the pin, which is press-fitted to to the plastic underneath, and it is absolutely fine.  ONLY real shortcoming is that on uneven terrain, the unit can fall over.  If only the wheels were a few inches farther apart it would be PERFECT.  Now if somebody came up with an aftermarket fix for that I would buy it immediately.

However, I was not able to use this mower because 1. it left all the weeds behind and 2. I couldn't get it to mow uphill.  Unlike one of the reviewers I found it very difficult to put together because I did not have the appropriate tools.  Also, putting the foam cover on the handle was a nightmare and took me almost half an hour.  You have to slide it on bit by bit.  The manual was not helpful either.

1223	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This sprayer is fantastic.  Put what you want to spray in the plastic bottle, set the metering dial to the correct amount to dispense (i.e. 1TBS/gal, 1tsp/gal...whatever)...hook up to the hose and spray.  Since no water enters the bottle you can return any leftover to the original package - I've never seen any other sprayer do this.  ...and does it reach 30ft.??  Yes it does when you remove the black deflector.  Just be sure to rinse it out well before putting it away.  I would HIGHLY recommend this sprayer...there is no 'waste' of product you are spraying, it is so easy to 'dial' the device to the correct dilution...I just can't say how happy I am with this product.  Add to that - it is MADE IN THE USA, lifetime warranty....what more can you as for???  Do not hesitate to buy this one.  ...I also bought the 'cheaper model'...spend the extra for this one!!  The other is very similar, but this one is so much better made.

7378	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	WIPED OUT our bug problem. Installed it (in a temporary location), put a white towel under it the first night, saw a decent amount of dead bugs. Moved it to it's permanent home and forgot all about it. All of a sudden a few weeks later, I got a bite. Then it occurred to me that was the first bite in a long time. Used to coat myself in Deep Woods Off to go to outside (which I really hate the idea of DEET on my body, but at that time, it worked the best) sometimes if I forgot the deet I would get covered in very itchy bites. Even with the DEET I got bit, a little less, but in really inconvenient and sensitive locations :) No seeums not just bite but swarm around your face. This sounds idiotic, but at first it didn't occur to me that is was the Flowtron. It was like Zounds, the bugs are gone, that's great. Oh yeah, my husband did put that Flowtron thing up. We were certainly skeptical, but I can tell you it worked like magic for us. One bite in 4 weeks? I used to get 6 or 7 a day at least. And swarms of bugs in my face. They are all gone

So my recommendation to anyone considering buying is that if you are replacing an existing Rain Bird sprinkler and want to save a few dollars by using the nozzle from your old sprinkler, just buy the body and save a few dollars. Saving a few dollars per sprinkler is a big deal when you are like me and have approximately 20 4inch popups you need to replace with 6inch.

3111	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I am not good with edging the lawn with a string trimmer so I bought this unit. It was like the one I used 40 or 50 years ago which did a good job. This one is even better. The old blades were just straight flat pieces of metal. This one seems to have teeth and the motor is more powerful. Your edges get better after you have edged them a few times. It is easy to use and has some adjustments for depth which I am still learning to use to best advantage. I am looking forward to next Spring when the grass is actually growing faster but so far I am quite pleased. Moist dirt will stick to the plastic wheels quite easily but is not hard to clean off after each use.
I replaced the line that was in it with red .105 pulverizer line.  I made it as long as I could without hitting the side of the trimmer.  I trim the whole yard without having to change lines but as with any, and I've even do it with this, if you trim a lot of fence or sidewalk or driveway you can eat it up jus like any other.
LOVE IT !!

The traps balance off-center and, in theory, when a mouse enters to get the bait, the trap is unbalanced and causes the door to close.  But putting just a small amount of bait in the rear of the trap is enough to change the balance so that the door rarely stays open and the trap cannot be set.

Could I change the blade more often? Sure ... and frankly probably ought to just to save on edging time when the blade is wearing down.  It's easy enough to do.  And then you've got to figure it'd be only about $2.25 a year or so in blade costs --- less than the cost of cup of drip coffee at the local coffee shop. Okay --- I think I just talked myself into changing the blade every FOUR years. Cheap and easy time saving effort.  :-)

7495	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	These traps work great if catching them alive and releasing is what you want to do.  I have these, the Mouse Cubes, and the Victor multiple mouse trap.  This is the only one of these 3 I have ever been able to catch mice in, and I keep them all set up at all times in my garage.  You need to have this set up away from any breeze or it will trip.  It wors best parallel to a wall right up against the corner.  A tiny amount of peanut butter in the very back works great.  If you put the PB on a piece of paper it can mae the mess a little bit smaller, but once you catch a mouse it wil going to get peanut butter, pee and poop everywhere.  That is the bigest downside of this trap - to reuse it takes a bit of pretty gross cleaning sometimes.

6566	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was reading reviews for this product and I had to laugh at some. I've been using my same grill now for 15-20 years, and here are some of my thoughts. 1. An absolutely fantastic cooker, I have chicken down to a science. Try always to use bone in skin on chicken, 1 hr-1hr 15 min. for large breasts, 1hr 15 to 1 hr 30 min. for legs, 40 min give or take a few for large boneless breasts, btw always start bone side down, protect the meaty side of your breast, same with legs. number 2, I use a coffee can full of charcoal, probably 15 to 18 briquets, and I always soak some hickory, now using apple wood, gives the chicken a very nice taste and by putting the damp wood on it keeps heat down at beginning of cook and smokes up a storm for first 20 minutes. I turn my lid every 10 minutes or so,keeps cooking more even and lastly every 10-15 minutes or so I find the cool spot in the grill and use that to my advantage to keep my cooking uniform, big pieces, small pieces etc. Finally, as chicken shrinks as fat is cooked out, if you did everything right, you nuked a few potatoes and 20 minutes b-4 chicken is done you'll have room to squeeze a few in there, no foil, get grill flavor without, and remember potatos are almost completely cooked from microwave. number 3, finally you take chicken off, you grill your peppers, zuchini, and corn, grill corn husked and just laid right on grill for just maybe 5 minutes or so, keep turning veggies and you have a meal fit for a king, I entertain 5-6 people like this because I can fit 6 breasts on grill or 5 very large ones, 5 being perfect so you can squeeze the potatos on there too.

Diameter is determined by the angle of the two spray tubes squirting out the water. The angle can be changed from slightly downward (relative to a horizontal plane) on up to about 45 degrees. This claims to have a maximum diameter of 55 ft but I haven't seen that to be true for my well and pressure tank system. Minimum diameter I haven't measured but probably about 8-10 ft. You adjust the tube arms by twisting them in the rotating base T-socket. Each arm has a sleeve nut that tightens up around the tube on threads. It is possible to have it fairly tightened to prevent the water pressure pushing the tube out (which I have had happen several times) but also possible to have it tight enough to not be able to turn the tubes. It's a narrow line between too tight (can't turn the tubes) and not tight enough where the tubes work their way out of the socket and pop out. But it's do-able with some practice and it works fine then.
It coils easily and so far, does not kink.

These are are great for training/holding orchid spikes upright. The long length can be trimmed to accommodate projected height of your plants very easily with kitchen shears and a slight bend. For my mostly medium sized plants, this pack of 25 3' stakes yields a bit less than triple the number of usable stake segments.

He said his wife and children could not enjoy their pool because they would be eaten  alive, and at night forget about ever going outside. Well with this zapper they are able to enjoy the outdoors again. The price is great for the results we are getting, and even better we are not spraying poison all around anymore. The poison did not work anyway. Buy it, use it, and you will be amazed.
9600	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	First time I've used one of these, and I must say it definitely helps with small weeds.  Handle was a little rougher than I expected even for wood- very noticeable after the test run through my garden. The head is solid, and unless your using it for something substantial (not what it's intended for, btw) or you hit rock, there should be no concern about the head flexing.  It is joined to the handle securely, and I can forsee no issues there.  I agree with the other posters, that a sharpened edge on this tool would make it even better.  I will certainly get much use out of this, but only 4 stars for the rough patches on the handle.

Based on our experience, I would recommend this 6050 DeerBlock for use as Bird Netting, but not for deer protection, as it was an epic fail for keeping the deer out of our garden.
****Update: December 2014 - This spreader has held up well.  It still works very well.  I store it outside but protected from rain.  No corrosion.  No other problems.  I did buy the Earthway elastic rain cover for the top for about fifteen bucks so that rain doesn't get into the fertilizer/salt/seed.  I use it mostly for grass seed and weed/feed.  Still happy with it and fell that it is worth the extra expense over other brands, even if you only use it a few times per season on an averaged size property.
It's brighter than what I expected, which is good! I stood out there and watched for a few minutes yesterday and ZAP ZAP ZAP ZAP .. even smoke from one or two bugs! Nice! Seems to be good quality, and works well! I bought a shepherds hook to hang it in and use a ZIP-TIE to keep it in place during high winds. It's doing the job I wanted it to do!
8331	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These things work! We had a bad flea season in 2013 and I don't like spraying alot of chemicals in the house as my wife is sensitive to chemicals smells. Turn these on every night and it captured all sorts of critters in the dark. highly recommend.

- be sure to check the traps at least every 24 hours - you don't want the little guys to die a slow, painful death in a humane trap!
2337	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder looks nice in the picture but in person its not as nice, and it has a really, really bad design in my opinion. The one I received was actually broken (the plastic top part of the hopper was broken, while this did not really affect the integrity or functionality of the feeder, it just proves its not very durable plastic and not likely to withstand our seasonal extremes of hot and cold here in NJ).
2369	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very sturdy little sprayer for the price.  Well made and work very well.  I use it to spray my plants with "Deer Out" and the spray is very fine and consistent.

The pull-up edge guide converts the edger to a landscape trencher. The three-position blade depth adjustment is really important to help you control the cut. There is a door you can open that lets you clean off the blade once you have unplugged the edger of course.

Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.
6422	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  I was looking for something to use, that did not have an engine, for getting around my shrubs and flower beds and close to the house as I could not get those spots with my tractor (I live in the sticks and mow close to 5 acres a week).  My husband hates to weed whack and I can not get his gas whacker started.  I also have a push mower that says 1 pull start.  30 pulls later I got fed up and went online searching and found this Reel Mower.  What a difference from the ones years ago.  It is light, easy to put together, easy to store and did not once have to ask my husband help me.

My husband loves their ratcheting lopping shears that I let him borrow.
- Victor Mini Sonic PestChasers from Home Depot -- we seem to be getting a benefit from these. Try them.
I recommend this product to everyone!

I also ordered and received a 20 ft hose, also perfect for my application.  I used fabric staples to hold the hose in place on its side so the spray is horizontal.  Also discovered that the hose is light and moves in higher winds.  The staples solved that problem.  Very happy with these excellent hoses.
Safer than motorized mowers
Happy grilling
>> Compound loppers have built-in levers to give you more leverage, to cut thicker branches easier. Geared loppers do the same thing, but with one less lever. Most loppers over 18" long, or used to cut hard wood, over about 1/2" thick should be compound or geared. Short loppers (e.g., 12" ) are usually simple. .
3630	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	These are great except if you run it by ANYTHING sharp it will cut into the cheaply made material.  I love the Up-Spray but it is a very FRAGILE hose..... PLEASE make it into a more robust soaker so it lasts!!!
The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because it does actually clog.  I don't know if it is just the overwhelming number of bugs it is killing or what - but I had to clean it the first few nights as to not have any potential fire hazards.

7408	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Quart size bottle used with this bait.  I hung it up outdoors by the garbage can...it's completely full in a week with what must be at least 500 - 800 dead flies.  The good news is, there's no longer flies buzzing around the doors of my house waiting to get in.  The bad news is, I have to buy enough of these packages for a weekly refresh, because the trap fills up so fast with dead flies.  So, I decided today to buy the Gallon size trap to get a longer life out of the bait.
I put the zapper on an outdoor timer, which turns the unit on around 7 pm in the evening and then off automatically around 8 am when the sun comes up.  This works great!  The timer I used was the Intermatic model HB31R (sold on Amazon and at local building stores).  It's a very simple little timer with a nice cover to keep the weather out.  I ran the power cords with a "J" loop in them, so any rain water would drip off the bottom of the "J" and not get into the socket.
These hoses are actually fairly inexpensive.  The hose material is mid-range quality, and the hose fittings (one male, one female) are decent but not highest quality.

Adjusted height to highest setting for my tall fescue lawn.  Perfect height.  Pretty light and compact.  Our yard is on the small side and this is mower is ideal.  Our gardener comes every other week and the fescue grows quickly so I wanted to use this in between our gardeners mowing.
4177	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Really, really thin.  Green paint sticks to hour hands better than to the stakes.  HUGE difference in diameter stake to stake.  If I had paid more i would have returned them, but it's more bother than the return on my time.

All in all, a great replacement blade for a great product.  I never thought I would buy an electric edger. I had resigned myself to buying a gas edger at a price of about $300.  I though that there was no way an electric edger could do the job. In my case I was wrong.  Obviously if you have a long driveway or some heavy-duty need, then this edger isn't for you, but It suits me perfectly. Good luck!

I tried the FAQ section of their web site and also found not help; I eventually got things figured out using Google!  Anyway, the timer is very easy to use, setup is quick and intuitive, and everything worked right out of the box.  I strongly recommend this timer, just don't count on any help from the manufacturer.

4921	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The trouble with older bars and chains is, with age they stretch out and lose their cutting ability, even with sharpening. After a few years of occasional use, my chain and bar were done, it was time to spring for a new combo. The new combination really tears through hardwoods, I forgot how good a new chain and bar can perform!
1031	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I often spray ornamental trees with a mixture of chemicals, so the new single-chemical, "dial a concentration" sprayers don't suit.  Deflector is removable to permit spraying to the tops of trees (20").  Only bad design feature is the lack of control of the type of spray as was a feature on older hose sprayers that are no longer available in our area.
3207	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I used my edger 3 times before I reviewed it.  One of the best investments I've ever made.  Unbelieveably easy to use, and when I think about when I used my manual one...sooooo sorry I didn't buy this sooner.  Two tips.  As with any edger, best used when the ground is dry otherwise mud will stick in it, and when edging, (I learned today) run it back and forth along the edge as any grass that bends over when going forward, will be cut off when you run back over it...a nice clean cut.  Absolutely fabulious and the price can't be beat.  Don't struggle with the manual one for years like I did.

UPDATE September 23, 2009: After replacing the motor under warranty I still didn't get sufficient water through the arms to move the sprinkler. So I took it apart, again, and discovered a manufacturing defect in the "T" that the arms come out of. The hole had not been drilled through all the way. I called customer service and they are sending a new one out. In the meantime I drilled it out myself and am happy to say it is working as it should. The rating system won't let me change my rating from a one star but I would now rate the sprinkler as a 5 star. Of course, the season is over now so I'm somewhat less than thrilled, but looking forward to spring.
7153	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fantasist product - killed a million bugs the first night. Use rubber band and put a gallon baggie on the bottom and you have an easy clean up - otherwise there will a HUGE pile of bugs under this monster.

6441	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Old reliable. As always with moles it is hit and miss. Whens this works it is very effective and cost efficient. Can't use the old, back up the car and use the tailpipe method. The emmissions are too clean. Thought about using my lawn mower. That might be next.
I don't recommend this head for actual "trimming" that's what string is for. The blades will be deformed pretty quickly by hard items like block walls, fence posts, lamp posts etc. If you have an overgrown area or heavy brush trying to take over under trees etc. then this is your tool to use. I have several large sumac bushes that take over the propane tank and anything else they grow around. I was able to turn the head on its side and "trim" vertically to knock these bushes back to size.
6095	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Perfect size for two servings.  We were able to cook two split game hens and a couple of sliced potatoes on the grill.  It's super high quality metal, and the way you can slide the top back while cooking is great.  Incredibly easy to assemble too.  Perfect for what I wanted.
9518	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I would have given this product 5 stars if it came with extra "sex lures"....there was only one in the box and it has holders for 2 pieces.  It works, and it lights up the entire yard.  Recommended, but for the price, I want extra "lures", that's all.  My yard is the size of a postage stamp, but I bought the hugest one on the planet becuase of my hatred for flying pests (plus, my skin is highly allergic to stings)....so KILL 'EM ALL!!

1084	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	hate this thing more than anything. I skimped on spending money for a real sprayer so i bought this, what a waste. It took forever to mess with to get it to work, then, screwing around dragging a hose behind me dealt the final blow. The hose dragging may not seem like much but, do that for an period of time and it gets old quick. That hose weighs a lot filled with water lol. Got a backpack sprayer and never looked back since. imo, just spend the money and get a real sprayer
7447	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This is a top notch product, well made out of good material but when you toss a steak or burger on the grill you will not get those nice grill marks on your meat that you expect to see.

No grill is perfect -- I've owned a couple of dozen, both gas and charcoal. Yes, this Weber Go Anywhere grill costs twice as much as the box store junk, but you get what you pay for.  And it's perfect for my family/friend outings. I'm also using it more and more at home instead of my larger grill.
3251	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this a month or two ago and must say that I really like how well it works and how easy it's been to just plug it in and start working. It does a superb job creating nice, clean lines along my sidewalk and driveway and it also creates a nice 1.5 inch trench along my flower beds. My only complaint is that it's pretty loud (I need to wear ear plugs).  You should also be aware that things will get pretty messy when you're using it as the dirt that's being displaced is flung at high speeds in a forward direction. Of course, there's really no way of getting around this when you're edging or creating trenches. The dirt has to go somewhere, right? :-) Overall, I foresee getting a lot of use out of this thing and easily getting my money's worth in the process. I'm very happy with this purchase!

As previously mentioned, this sprinkler head handles surface source water better than any model I found.  If you irrigate from a pond, creek, lake, or other surface impoundment, then this is the sprinkler head you are looking for.
5225	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Provided you're not grilling for a crowd, this has everything you will ever need.  Why, for small grilling sessions,  buy these $300+ propane grills with all the associated maintenance, danger and complexity?  It defies reason.
8774	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice quality bug zapper at a great price.  Ive had it for quite some time with regular summer use.  No failed parts of lamps.  My one caution is that the plug is quite short.  Be sure to install very near a receptacle.

3696	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Using this thing is weird, you have to try and hover the weed whipper at an unnatural angle.  The string does not last long at all and is time consuming to change frequently.  The last time I went to change the line, I noticed the Grass Gator housing had developed multiple deep cracks.  I was afraid of it flying apart and causing injury, so I threw it away.  I logged less than an hour with this item and regret that I bought it.

Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.
6149	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	It is amazing to see that the mouse goes in and out and thanks for a delicious meal without getting trapped.
Best coverage are of any sprinkler yet.  This model sprays at least 10 feet further than the previously mentioned Orbit sprinkler.  The stops also stay put better, but yet somehow are easier to adjust with a single hand, compared to the Orbit.  Rainbird is also capable of true 360 degree operation, whereas, the Orbit model is not.
6314	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had one of the original Smokey Joe grills when I was single (a long time ago).  I used it at my apartment and took it on camping trips.  It worked well at home, but it was a pain to take camping.  It was tippy and always fell over in the truck, sending the grates, lid and kettle all over the place.  The Gold model remedied that shortcoming.  The lid locks down tight for portability.  The tripod leg system still isn't as stable as a four-leg system would be but the Gold model is not as tippy as the standard model I used to have.  (I wonder whatever happened to my old Smokey Joe?)
Inconveniences:
Unlike the original simple rectangular blade, this replacement blade appears to have teeth. I don't know whether or not that design actually improves the cutting ability, but I'm pretty certain that the greater mass is a contributor to improved cutting.

I had to buy them because the woodpeckers took and broke the ones from the feeder.
6497	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's hard to argue with a product that works.  Killed a rat in the first night and I'm expecting to catch more.  I purchased the 12 pack and set up 6 under our house where I've been hearing the critters.  I used peanut butter on half of the traps and a small wedge of chocolate on the others.  One of these had chocolate and peanut butter.  When I checked my traps this morning I could see one of the traps with chocolate and peanut butter had the chocolate removed and the peanut butter licked down a bit but not sprung.  The other trap contained the dead rat (about a 6" rat) and that trap had one of the other sticks of chocolate.  So it would seem they are going for chocolate set traps more than the peanut butter.  But it's early days and I'm expecting to kill at least a few more.
8472	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works well for catching and retaining all sorts of bugs, not just fleas, that are attracted to the light.

When you build it, build the top level first, and then the bottom level exactly like it (minus the roof),  Once the two parts are together, slide the lower level on the pole first, about two feet down, then mount the top piece on the pole.  Once the top piece is secured to the pole with the tension bolt, slide the lower level up to it tightly, and put the side walls of the lower unit inside the floor of the upper level, then tighten the bottom tension bolt.
4818	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Used this to replace the old chain on my Greenworks 18 inch electric. It's amazing how quick a new chain will cut down trees. I've bought a few more chains so I don't have to stop to sharpen in the middle of a tree cutting frenzy. This did seem to kick more than the factory chain, but you get almost no surprise kick at all on an electric so it's a minimal concern of mine.
2) Contrary to a previous review, and the product name "AMERICAN Lawn Mower". . . this well constructed lawn mower is MADE IN CHINA!!  I bought it thinking it was American made  >:+/  but am happy anyway.

Buy you one and you will not be sorry!!!!
The width of spray is easily adjustable by twisting them up higher or lower.  You can make a very narrow or very wide band.  You can adjust it very precisely, if you do not mind getting your shins wet.  I turn it on, then walk up to the sprinkler.  I then stop the arm in mid rotation, pivot the water arm up up for more width, down for less, then let it rotate 180 and do the other arm.  This is by far the most effective way to adjust it.  Another reviewer mentioned how hard it was to adjust,  then mentioned shutting it off, adjusting the arms, then turning it on.  You will spend all day getting it right with that method.
4344	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The reel mower sharpening Kit is okay.  I had to call long distance regarding questions. The lady was very abrupt.  The instructions are not clear. The instructions have 3 different languages which makes it difficult to read.  The instructions were not clear on how to remove the wheel. The handle to turn the blades that came with the kit is really flimsy.  I hand turned and hand turned the wheel to sharpen the blades about 10 minutes and did not see any improvement.

In order to remove the 9/16 nut, I had to add a couple of drops of light oil (otherwise it wouldn't budge) so when I reinstalled the nut I added a drop of loctite just to ensure that it wouldn't back off during use.
768	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Well,it was nice while it lasted, but this turned out to be a pretty cheap hose also.  As soon as the weather here in South Florida started the warm days/cool nights, this Gilmour started getting kinks all over.  I am not sure there really is a hose that won't kink; this one sure does.

3897	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is working great for our small front and back yards.  We live in a townhouse and the only access to the back yard is through the house.  This is lightweight enough to take through for mowing the back yard and then stores nicely in the garage on the wall.  I had to take a star off because it does get stuck on twigs and doesn't do well with anything besides grass.  Before mowing, we have to search for all twigs.  Also, we have found a some of the weeds and crabgrass are resistant to this mower.  On the plus side, it helps to identify the problem areas so we can treat them.
8327	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Worked fine for me.  Good for situations were a full size hose would be a waste or you need just a little extra length added.

Not only will this feeder efficiently water each plant, it's great for opening up roots if you don't own an aerator!

After several more brutal engagements the enemy had been exhausted. The several year long struggle was over.

For the cost and effectiveness, I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I have to use both hands to squeeze them as the handles are skinny and the clippers are heavy.  It is absolutely very sharp and cuts well.

3946	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I needed some sturdy saucers for under some pots which come in during the winter. Local stores had items which were either thin and flimsy or too expensive. These have been exactly what I needed/wanted and the price was great. They are plastic so don't expect them to be unbreakable, but I've carried 40lb pots with this saucer under them, raising and lowering to the ground numerous times without incident. I'll be purchasing more in the future.
I placed it at the far corner of our yard, say about 5 yards from the back porch. I do not notice the smell. Even when I'm picking tomatoes in the garden where I have it sitting on a shelf I don't notice it. On a hot day the flies totally ignore piles of dog poo and go for the trap.

This sucker ZAPS them all night long!!!!!!!!!!  now to be honest I do not notice any difference when we use this and we are outside at the bonfire..... that being said this puppy is frying bugs all night long!!!!! so it certainly works VERY well but Perhaps I have not put it close enough to me to benefit... it says to put it a fair distance away from the gathering since it is an attractant but that's OK one bug zapped is one less bug on me :)
1962	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	You probably don't want a 3/4" hose for watering the plants and whatnot, but for sprinklers and other applications where you want a lot of flow and don't drag the hose around too much it is ideal.  I bought one of these to replace a 5/8" hose from the local garden center that runs across our driveway to a big sprinkler.  The old hose was a few years old and finally cracked where we drive over it.  This one has been there for about 6 months now and shows no sign of breaking down so far.
Cons
844	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent product. I was sick and tired of cheapo hoses that I had to replace, sometimes in less than a year. Flexogen is a quality product, durable, made in the USA, and carries an excellent guarantee. What's not to like? I use mine with brass quick connects; so easy to use.

6187	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I downsized from a 22 inch grill that rusted away, to this 18.5 inch grill, so far no complaints. The top grill handles are curved to hang onto the side of the kettle when loading charcoal (my last grill didn't have this design). Plus there is a nice gap around the handles to drop in a few more coals or chunks of wood around the size of the briquettes. I can't recall where I  heard of the  great tip of replacing the ash pan with a pot to catch the ash and burning embers so they aren't blown all over the place, and it works. The pot has a rim so the clips that hold the ash pan, hold the rim of the pot. The vents are so tight fitting, when I close them after use they put out the charcoal leaving some burnt ones for the next time.
1775	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The pruning shears work perfectly! I am so glad I got them!! With 3 dozen fruit trees that need pruning these work perfectly in keeping everything trimmed back and neat.
6378	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Worked well
1492	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I thought this would be great for my yard but I set it out and it would move only about one foot per hour. I contacted Nelson and they sent a new motor which I installed. Now the sprinkler doesn't move at all. I suspect my water flow is not sufficient to drive this thing, as my house is about 55 years old with iron pipe that is somewhat occluded.
The plastic little sticks they provide for the birds to perch are not designed well to work with the aluminum floor - you end up bending the aluminum to get them to go in, and then the perch won't stay in place.
4061	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is an honest review of this mower.  Model # 1304-14 American Lawn Mower.  First off I want to say that I just moved into a house with a very small yard and this mower works perfect!  When I took this out of the box I noticed that the mower was a different color than the bright orange pictured... it was a dark brick red... which looks a lot nicer!  The only part that required assembly was the handle which was easy to put together... however the top bolt and wing nut they gave me wasn't threaded correctly so I had to use another one I had lying around the house.  The mower was perfectly adjusted from the factory.  There are 3 height settings: 1 inch, 1.6 inches, and 2.25 inches.  The 1.6 inch height is what I cut on and it's perfect.  This mower is very light and rolls super easy across the grass.  It doesn't mow dandilions too well and will get stuck on some small twigs, but other than that it cuts great!  No gas needed, stores super easily and barely takes up any room at all.  It feels very solid and I plan on using it for many years to come.  I live in Michigan and this works great here!  ***Update 5/14/15... this mower still works great and cuts great!!!  I am now cutting on the lowest height.  This is my 4th season of mowing and I have never had to sharpen the blades yet... just minor adjustments.  Well worth the money***

> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gilmour-Pistol-Grip-Nozzle-327-Teal-Red/dp/B000XTH2FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red</a>
7443	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The key point with this grill is to remember that it is a portable gas grill. It is not designed to perform in the same league as the larger gas grills. In this class of grills, it would be tough to beat. The parts are much more rugged and the support is simply unbeatable with Weber.
534	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Seems to hold up a lot better than other hoses.
4723	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My old one gave out after years of use.  It wasn't this brand but I do like this kind of spreader.  It spreads s=grass seed as well as grass fertilizer.  I do like it.  I have been looking for a long time for this type. of spreader.  Thank you.
Also keep in mind that this sprinkler is Rain Bird's cheapest line of sprinklers. More expensive models may come with pressure regulators to ensure a more consistent spray pattern if your water pressure changes or improved seals which reduce water leakage after retracting back into the ground.
The worst part, which would have made this review 2 stars if I hadn't found a way around it, is that it is intended to be single use. The little packet of fly bait does not divulge what is inside, apart from that it isn't poisonous (the flies are going to get tired and drown, not be poisoned). It vows to work for a couple of hours. So do you really want to buy one of these cups for every day of summer to keep your house free of flies? Of course not.
3857	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like this soaker hose because it soaks evenly whether facing up for sprinkler effect or faced down for soaker effect.  It is durable and well made.
8185	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purchased several of these and they are over a year old.  All have held together just fine and work well as short extensions on faucets for watering nearby plants.  Two of them connect some portable sprinklers and function without problem.

2394	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Love the high pressure rating
Buy only if you have no intention of moving them around or you have very soft dirt. Any ground that needs force to push in and you will crack these in a week or so and have water spraying out.
Can remove tip , good for 30 ft distance.
I would set on, put it gently on the table and it would trip with the lightest of touches.  Hits so hard, my ears started to ring after the 6th premature triggering.
I use it once or twice a year.
I can't say enough about Weber as a company.  Long story, but they treated me beyond fair with my 12 year old gas grill. I've seen first hand that their products will last 10 times that of the competition.  A premium price, but you get premium product and service.

5868	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	These aluminum keys shear off too easily.  I suspect they are not a universal-fit part as the description leads one to believe.

These are less problematic with my dog though, he's always
8485	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I don't like to put toxic pesticides in the house that I, or my pets, will be exposed to.  But, I have cats and even though they are inside cats, it seems like every summer, we have a flea outbreak--particularly in the carpets.  These things attract fleas like crazy.  The combination of the white paper with the light really attracts them.  Sometimes when I am changing the sticky pad, fleas will jump on the new pad before I even get it into the container. Sometimes, I just wave the pad over the carpet, and fleas will jump up and hit it.  They are REALLY sticky so you have to be careful that other critters can't get to it.  Unfortunately, a lizard managed to get to one of these even though it was in the back of the house.  Also, once in a great while a cat will manage to get one stuck to him/her and it is a pain to get the pad off of them.
5588	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works very well, a fine mist spray that spreads out about 4 feet total altogether. It gets the plants watered and happy. The pressure is very similar from end to end of the 100-foot tube.
Note that you will need to purchase an extension cord to use this unit.  The cord that comes out of  the unit is only about 6 inches in length.  It's not long enough to reach anything.  I bought a 12 foot extension cord and ran it along the house and over to the Intermatic timer.  Then the timer plugs into any standard outdoor outlet.

2048	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A beast.  Haven't used it yet, but looks and feels like you would expect.  Have had the hatched for years and love that, so figured it was time to try the "full size."  I expect good things.
Note: A pretty serious design issue with this item is that the cord is only 6 inches long. I don't know why they did not include at least a 3' cord. It makes no sense. I had to run a special conduit and install an additional outdoor outlet to be able to plug it properly. Since it is outside, I would recommend a CGFI-protected outlet. I also installed an on/off switch for it on the inside of the house, so that I can conveniently turn on this lantern at night. Happy zapping.

9066	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	We have a large back yard that is surrounded by woods. The woods are only about  25 feet deep and then houses on the other side. "Asian tiger" Mosquitos attack us day and night. They are relentless. I bought a Burgess propane fogger which works but it only lasts so long. I put Dunks in our retention pond and they work great. This thing Kills bugs because I see them dead all over it. Does not seem to make a big difference though. We still have Mosquitos biting us day and night. I'm sure it helps but I'm not sure anything can kill them all. The "attractant" thing seems like a waste. I think the light is really what attracts them. However I think this is also why they never seem to all die. They just keep flowing toward the light. So the close ones die that night and others come closer and then settle wherever they are when the sun comes up. It seems to be of good quality for the money and it kills bugs. It did really even help my problem so I could not give 5 stars.

They appear to be solid, well built brass units. They worked well for a while.

3994	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a true classic. I have a small yard in my front of my house and it is always wet.

Great price, fast shipping, I love this.
7487	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	These work great! Put a tiny bit of peanut butter all the way in the back and they go right in and get caught. I had set these for 3 hours when they caught the first mouse. Here is a tiny bit of info to help you catch the mouse. Make sure that it is laying on the front end when you set it and not the back. The motion of them crawling in to the back is what makes the trap go off. I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be better if it were see through but really you can feel the weight change when you pick it up and just turn it to flip it and you will hear the pitter patter of the claws.

I found these shears, the Zenport Heavy Duty Landscaper's Grass Shear [Item # ZL119].  They work quite well so far.  They require less energy and will pivot to a variety of blade positions.  They are not yet on Amazon so I bought them from an alternate merchant, but since Amazon carries other models of Zenport clippers, they may begin to carry these.
4972	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered this grass catcher for my Great States 16 manual mower model 816-16, but it's seriously annoying that this is being advertised as universal fit for "14, 16, and 18-inch width reel mowers" while it is not.  This grass catcher, made by Great States, will NOT fit mowers with trailing wheel (2 rear wheels in addition to the main 2 wheels) that has less than 19 1/2" space to allow for the grass catcher to be installed. Measure and make sure you have more than 19 1/2 space between the rear wheel space before ordering, or you'll have to return the item as I had to. This incompatibility is noted on the included install instruction, so I don't know why this is not mentioned here to save buyers' hassle.

As far as cutting the grass goes, my grass had gotten pretty tall by the time I went to mow it.  This mower cut the grass beautifully.  I did notice some slight differences in the height of the grass as I completed the first mowing but it was not so noticeable that I needed to go back over it.

And I got it at a great price, and very fast shipping included in the price.  Beware the knockoffs, your quality will be what you pay for, and if the head breaks off 30 feet down on the cheapo one, you will learn a hard lesson.

One question I had before buying it was about those little black caps on the ends of it where the hoses attach too... They are little tiny screw on cap/covers and right above them it is barbed to slide your hose onto.

It didn't attract them and was only killing one every couple of minutes.

6508	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is my 3rd feeder of this size and style.  It takes the bags of sugar from the multi pack box,  It holds a lot of juice and doesn't have to be refilled daily.  It lasts a good week in the fall migration.  It is slightly difficult to clean if you let it go dry and don't have a bottle brush.  I purchased this to replace a broken one.  This lasts about 5 years in heat and rain.  The bottom plastic juice holder starts leaking at the seam after 5 years of constant use.  It may not be as pretty as some, but the pretty one have to be refilled almost every 3 days.  I always go for useful and decorative versus just pretty.
The only problem is you cannot connect hoses to the end
2349	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The more I use it the more I love it. I enjoy watering plants more because of it. Well designed, made with high quality plastic, it's easy to operate. I just have to remember to lubricate it with oil occasionally. It works well to spray off bugs from plants, the one of its many uses.
I've watched the mosquitos come as moths are being zapped!- Love the zapping noise (not that loud)!

Of course this year we had no rain whatsoever for nearly two months. Having these sprinkler hoses was a life saver.
Yesterday this new hose developed a balloon and blew out. Meanwhile the 30 year old hoses are going strong, even the one that this one was meant to replace. (I put cheap plastic replacement ends on it.) I guess that like everything good, this had to be cheapened to generate more profit, so they cheapened it. What a pity not to be able to buy quality products any longer!

9330	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this "Zapper" based mostly on Rick V.'s review. We had an older zapper that wasn't helping, but I had tried everything else.
9724	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I installed this myself, as long as you label everything on your existing unit installing yourself should not be too hard. The controls are such an improvement over my old unit- with this I can just turn on one zone, I can tell when it will run next (which is a nice feature) and can easily make seasonal adjustments without reprogramming the whole thing.
By the way, I think this might fit the category of limbing axe.  I'm an old guy at 62, but I was raised around a lot of old timers.  They reached first for a lightweight limbing axe a lot like this one.

A bit pricy, (DH said he can get the same stuff from the auto parts store for much less) but it sure made my mowers good as new!
However, the hose does NOT match the one pictured in Amazon's ad. It's not only a different color (which the ad does indicate), it's reinforced vinyl, not rubber as the one in the ad appears to be. The metal connectors are cheap stamped metal with no black knob for tightening, and the single washer that came with the hose was plastic, which I replaced with a good rubber washer.
6888	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've had three of these traps for about 20 years now and it seems I have to use it a few times about every other year, or so.  It has never failed me in clearing out the moles although it can take a little time to setup.  However, there have been about one or two times when the mole has dug under the original tunnel floor avoiding the trip area causing the failure of the trap to work.  Relocating the trap to another section of the tunnel has always resulted in trapping the mole.  A few tips on using based on my experiences:  Following the instructions on the box, I build a firm, narrow soil ridge, or mound in the tunnel for the trigger pan to rest on (this mound, or ridge, is what the mole pushes through to spring the trap).  If the soil is too dry, moisten it with a light spray of water until the soil can be packed tightly under the trip trigger pan.  With the trap catch latch set, handle the trap with the thumb over the top loops and the fingers under the trip pan directly under the trip lever.  By firmly pushing up on the trip pan directly under the trip rod, you are less likely to trip the trap when placing it in the tunnel while pushing the trip pan down onto the soil ridge.  At this point I usually use my other hand to push the trip pan firmly down on the soil ridge.  Make sure there is space under the area of the trip rod so that the trip pan can freely pivot (and spring the trap) when a mole pushes up on the other end of the trip pan at the soil ridge.  Place loose soil back in the tunnel around the trap so that the area is level and the trap is about half covered with soil.  Finally,  release the trip catch latch and put a bucket over the trap.  I always place a brick on top of the bucket too.  This will help keep animals from hitting the trap and sunlight from striking the trap area and scaring the mole off. Check the trap daily and if moles are active, you should have a hit in a day or less.  If not tripped after a day or two, set the catch, pull the trap out and check the tunnel and soil ridge setup and reset, or move to another location.  The trip pan can be bent down slightly to make the trap more sensitive but I really don't find this necessary.  I suspect that the moles that tunneled under my traps detected my scent in the soil or on the trap since I do not wear rubber gloves when making the ridges and setting/handling the traps.  I'm just lazy that way.  Overall - highly recommended.

It seems to work exactly how he expected/needed & wanted it to. It has two tubes that the water comes out of & depending on how much water you want going through it there is either a good high spray of water or of course a little amount. It has made his watering chore a lot easier. He would definitely recommend it.

3145	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Powerful edger for lawns and gardens, but one of the pictures is deceptive. It makes straight vertical cuts. One of the pictures on Amazon shows a cut at an angle when it goes around a flower bed - it will not do that. My original blade was smaller in length, but the newer blades are longer and will give you a deeper cut.
Would recommend to a friend that needed an occasional post hole.

Sadly it turns out I bent the crankshaft on my mower when i broke the key. After inserting this new key and re-assembling the mower i noticed a LOT of vibration. When i tried a pass on my lawn it cut the right side down to the dirt and the left side was long. Ultimately i had to throw the mower away because after researching the problem i found its more expensive to fix a bent crankshaft than to buy a new mower... which made me mad because i bought the Briggs mower because it CAN be repaired.

EXAMPLE: SOME REVIEWS ARE 5 STAR DUE TO THE CHEAPEST PRICE VS BEST QUALITY OR DUMBED DOWN PEOPLE WHO ARE CLUELESS--- OMG/IMO:-( AS OF 6/14/15.
The only negative I might have is that it gets pretty noisy.  Mosquitos are small and each one doesn't make much of a zap, but when there's so many of them, it's almost continuous and the sound travels pretty far.  At first it's satisfying to know that tons of mosquitos are getting killed, but it soon gets annoying.  I guess it's the small price we (and the neighbors) have to pay for effective pest control.
-Cleat it off with a light knock & compressed air from time to time

3. Note that this is a Brush blade, meaning that it's a good all-purpose blade. You can get a much longer, thinner grass blade is you're just doing grass. You'll find the grass blade makes much quicker work of hay and wheat and grasses.

3287	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I used to own a Ryobi gas-powered string trimmer. When I was able to start it, it could trim around beds and even sort of edge walks. When I couldn't start it anymore, I bought the Edge Hog a couple of years ago. The electric start is far more reliable than a gas engine. While the Edge Hog can't trim next to trees or the house, of course, it clears a straight line next to walks with ease and can trench a line around garden beds. It does this much faster than a string trimmer and the result is much cleaner.

96	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have had several of these.  I just have to remember to dump out the water before a freeze.  It is easy to see the amount of rain we got from the kitchen window.

8857	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This mouse trap is good. We use the sunflower seeds in it and we caught 2 the first day. Then we left if out for a couple of hours, and we caught 3rd mouse. The mice just love the seeds. This trap is easy to use and clean.
650	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Its durable, but heavy.  I purchased 3 of these for our shore house to sit outside on the docks.  After one season, they still look like new.  They have a nice thread on end, and I expect that they will last for many years.  I coil them up after using and have never kinked or knotted.
4.  In theory, you could snake this thing around a bunch of curves, working between trees and corners.  However, because of the growing length of hose it drags behind it (see No. 2 above), if you have too many turns, or the turns are too sharp, then the hose will start to rub and drag sideways against those objects, and the sprinkler will end up getting stuck in one spot.
I don't think this will replace sharpening at the shop but should be able to just sharpen the blade 3-4 times in between shop sharpenings


7744	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Seriously....my husband goes outside on the back patio every night to watch this thing and the novelty hasn't worn off a month later.

6569	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Cheaper here than at a lawn and garden store.
7023	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This trap worked well for me.  I bought another trap that you don't have to dig holes for, but found it was not very useful unless there are visible paths on top of the ground and although it worked well in that instance, unfortunately the moles don't always leave tunnel markings, so you have to do some deeper digging.  I made sure I cleaned it well prior to use and used gloves while handling to mask any human or nonorganic smells, because I have read that the moles will just dig under the trap if they encounter any unusual smells.  I caught moles within hours after setting this trap on 2 occasions, at first site of the mole hills on my lawn.  Traps seem to be the only effective way to get save your lawn from moles.
Well, it's been about two decades, but the legs are now rusting off where they fit onto the bowl. Alas, it's time for a new Smokey Joe.

I know, I know, my friends have big fancy gas grills etc., but they don't produce anything any better than this little wizard. Plus, it's so easy to keep clean and you can just store it outside.

These rakes have a stout metal 'spring' (more like a mousetrap-style spring made of thick steel than the usual sort) on the back of them that attaches on one end to the handle and on the other to a brace running across the tines. The end result is that the rake end is sturdier.

8711	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The first thing I want to say is that this is a well built safe mouse catching trap. I would put it at a 3 to 4 star rating for a few reasons I will list below in a moment. Few Tips, I love animals, but if you have one mouse, check for two mice in your home.  If you have two mice get a VARITY of humane traps (not all mice work with the same trap) very quickly, ship them overnight to your home. If they don't work in a week, get deadly methods. You can also use the glue traps and can get them out with gloves and spray oil or put them down in a closed bucket or ice chest with dry ice by the side of them, not on them as this burns and is inhumane.  Mice reproduce from three to six and so on very, very fast.  If you don't move fast, within 3 weeks to 30 days you can have many mice in your home. They often move in pairs of one male, two females.  Also, lock your garbage can and your food up in plastic bins, mice can get up high, leap out of buckets and seem like super critter's really!  Also, check for holes in your plumbing, wash room, outlets etc. Seal these off with metal covers. Wear shoes, if they bite you out of fear, their urine and feces and saliva all carry lots of disease. BACK TO THE TRAP - the problem with this trap is that the holes on the side to help the mouse smell the bate are too big and the mice just use their hands to reach in and scape off the peanut butter or get to a treat and pull it towards their claws. The size of the trap is an issue and some mice are afraid of it.  I caught one young mouse out of four in our home with this trap. It was easy to lift the lid later to let the mouse out without touching the mouse. It was well made so the mouse could breathe and with a weight on top like a can of beans the mouse could not lift the lid to get out. It was big enough to leave some water too so it did not dehydrate while I got to the trap to let it out.
The cushioned grip is easy on the hands, even without gloves, and the fiberglass handles reduces the weight over wooden handle versions. This makes a perfect hole for a 4"x4" pressure treated post.

When going to the park or the beach, I now have the perfect grilling unit to take along. No more public grills! It will cook a meal for 2-4 people quickly and efficiently.

Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side.

What surprised me the most about using the reel mower is that I actually enjoy the chore of lawn mowing again.  I find myself mowing twice a week not because I have to, but because it's more enjoyable to push the mower back and forth for 45 minutes than it is to pound away at the treadmill in the garage.
One hinderance is that the parts need to be de-bured, as some have sharp edges and can cut while being handled.
The grill does a GREAT job and the family comments about how the food just "tastes better!"  This grill, with the above mentioned charcoal, is ready to cook in about 10 mins.  Now I don't care how impatient I am to eat...10 mins is easy.  It takes me that long to prep the meat and cut up the veggies for goodness sake.

1687	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like these a lot -- I bought them last May to cut back our lilac and forsythia bushes which hadn't been pruned in several years. The shears cut easily through both thick and thin stems, you can even cut several thin branches at once. I've since used them on average of once a week to cut and trim back tree branches and saplings as well as roses and other bushes. Fwiw, they do tend to do better on green or growing wood than on dead branches. As another reviewer noted, the foam handle covers can slide off but I glued mine back on and haven't had any problems since. The blades are easy to keep clean and the lock keeps them locked even if you say, toss them on the grass or a chair. Note, these aren't for pruning large tree branches or tough, thick bushes but they're great for basic pruning.
The only negative with the kettle cover is that if you happen to purchase the optional lid holder, the cover will fit over it, but is incredibly tight.  Although it is a slight inconvenience, the cover still holds up...and works.

After hurricane Irma this cut a lot of branches. Still razor sharp. Very happy with this brand. Saw doesnt bow out under pressure. Good hand grip
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!

Our first Flowtron lasted a few years. Replaced the bulb twice before the Flowtron itself called it quit. We were in panic mode when we found out local home improvement stores were not carrying any Flowtron that year. We tried another brand and proved the other brand totally useless for our yard. Luckily Amazon has Flowtwon and replacement bulbs in stock. We are more careful with the 2nd unit by putting it away in the stormy rainy winter season. In the drought years like we are in now, we use Flowtron nightly about six month out of a year. Granted our bug problem is probably not nearly comparable to that of the south (our extremely dry summer helps). We still appreciate the fact that Flowtron delivering us more peaceful night (after the first hour anyways).

I went over the entire property with a circular metal blade to clear a lot of the heavier duty sticks.  I then use the Echo/Gatorhead to maintain and it works flawlessly.  It is so fast, never gets tangled with grass and just flat kicks @ss.  The only downside is if you hit a lot of rocks and such the blades don't hold up.  However, you can turn the blades over and then replace when that side is damaged.  For tough weedeating this is the only way to fly.

Update: Upon using this rake, the rake actually fell apart.  I was upset.  What the heck?  Upon closer inspection, I note the thing was never screwed together.  There was a little screw in the rake head, but it was off to the side and not in the hole where the handle would be.  I had to take a screwdriver and put it in the right place.  Which begs the question, why did amazon ship this as though it was assembled?  They made this goofy custom cardboard box to contain the thing - but had they taken the rake head off the handle and shipped it like that, it wouldn't have necessitated the custom box.

181	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this because I have a large yard that the cheaper brands were not handling well, based on all the high ratings, and largely to see if it was really as hard to put together as a lot of reviews said. I have to say I had it put together in under an hour, and my seven year old son was helping me. I will agree the instructions aren't the greatest, but just thinking about what a spreader should look like and looking at their diagrams, I felt it wasn't anything to detract from a high rating.  I'll admit I didn't read any of it. I just looked at the drawings to get the bolt length and to see what holes to use. Maybe the written instructions are tripping people up.

As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.

8787	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This trap works, and works well.  I spread a little peanut butter on the inside floor of the trap and put it behind a basement door so the (useless) cats wouldn't frighten away the mice.  I caught two mice the first night and dumped them about a mile away from my house; they seemed unharmed  - one took off immediately upon opening but the other went back into the doorway and I had to shake him out before he'd leave.  They made quite a mess inside, so it had to be cleaned before I try to catch some more.  I'll be re-baiting it to see if I can catch any more.
111	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Easy to see on deck railing.  Seems accurate.
6778	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I was all set to love this feeder. I love the glass container, which holds a lot, stays looking clear, and is easy to clean thoroughly. I like the shape and appearance, and the birds love it. What I don't like, and what is forcing me to retire it, is that the bottom plastic compartment is very difficult to thoroughly clean, and so black mold builds up. If you're happy to clean the feeder and refill it everyday, this one would be fine. But if you're like me, and view the large capacity as an excuse to empty it only once a week - not good. It will be moldy by then, despite all the boiling of the food and hot soapy water washing of the feeder you do. Bummer.

2240	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to maintain the single track motorcycle and mtn bike trails I ride (its private and I am the only one keeping it up). It works really well on 4 and 5 inch trees.  The larger, old downed oaks are another story, they are like flint and nothing would cut them.  Some people have noted casting flaws in the metal, but that is silly, its an axe and not Wusthof kitchen knives.  Its a little smaller than a full size axe, and a bit larger than a hatchet.  Nice size for me to carry on my bike but still gives me enough leverage to get a good swing with both hands.  Dont buy it to cut firewood for your home, but to keep in the camper, under the truck seat, or to clean up around the house, its great.
The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.

I saw this at a local store and picked one up on a chance, it turns out that the griddle fits PERFECTLY on the surface of this Weber grill.  The lid will even close, with only a small gap in the front.  The griddle weighs in at 16 pounds, let it preheat for about 15 minutes and you can SEAR THE HECK out of steaks using this griddle!  It's completely upped grill game when using the portable Weber.  I also have two Weber kettles and of course the griddle will work on there, but charcoal generates enough heat that it isn't that amazing of a discovery for the kettle.  But for this little portable I think I've made one of the world's top discoveries!  Grab one of the Emeril griddles and reply back with your thoughts!

149	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The spreader on its overall merit is very good. I did ~3,000 square feet of my yard in under 20 minutes with 2 bags of milorganite. You gotta haul tail on the medium setting (3.5mph). I knocked one star off for exactly what the other reviewers have already stated...the instructions are terrible. It took me 2 hours to go back and forth between YouTube videos and these instructions to figure out how to get it together. At least three times, I had to undo several bolts because I'd put them in the wrong place or installed in the wrong order. For example, the arm that connects the lever to the hopper hole opener was very difficult to determine the exact orientation for install. I spent 20 minutes just trying to understand the order of the parts that need to go on before you put the wheels on and put the pins in place to hold them in. There are only two videos on YouTube and both apply to slightly different models of Earthway spreaders, but it helps to give you the general idea. The included instructions have no dotted lines to help you follow what connects to what in which order. The videos also show that different models of Earthway will apparently come with more parts too. Like washers. I guess the 2150 requires no washers because I didn't get any.

Before setting, hold them trap and remember what it feels like, so when it is tripped you can pick it up and tell the weight difference to know if a mouse is inside.  You can easily tell unless it is a really small mouse.  I dump them into a bucket with a lid for their journey to the forest.

May be used to extend drip hose or other specialty hose.  Great for camper and RV dump where you don't want to unroll a huge hose for a short hookup to wash down your waste water hose.  Why pay for a long hose you don't need?  Why cut up a good hose to make it shorter?

8268	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We have a little over two acres, mostly wooded.  I bought this so we could use our deck at night without getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.  I placed it about 30 feet from our deck during a party last weekend.  Usually, around sunset, the Mosquitos come out and force us inside.  Not that night!  We had over 40 people outside, and not a single bite was reported.  I have to admit, both kids and adults enjoyed watching the bugs get zapped!  ;-). Highly recommended for any size yard!

loose fit overall - something seems amiss at the factory - models are not assembling with as tight tolerances as in the past
One last thing, outside of the hinges, the overall quality of this grate is much better then the standard one-touch silver grate. The bars are quite a bit thicker and are just a better quality. For some reason my grill marks are comin' out much nicer, too!

I owned the piece of shxt Scott's models prior and they ALWAYS fell apart, spring in tension cable would break, difficult to use due to the very small wheels and bucket.  I got SO tired of that brand breaking, I splurged on this.  Lasted 5 years, using approx. 5 times per year, full capacity/

I didn't think I would catch as much as I did. Even when I stored it in my garage, there were quite a few bugs stuck to the sticky trap even without the light on. I would highly recommend this trap for fleas, and also a variety of other little creepy crawlies. I caught plenty of spiders, gnats, fleas, and other bugs as well.
I must say, though, I received a refund with no problems.

8425	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I'm using a 12-15 year old BK-40 (pre Amazon). Even back then it came with a 12" cord but an extension cord to the outside timer works fine. Mine hangs on a 12" plant hanger on the corner of the shed in the yard, is on 6 hours a night mid May to mid September and just this week I replaced the burnt out bulb for the 2nd time. Tapping it lightly or using a blow gun occasionally will keep the grids clean. Put it away in the shed in the off season and you won't go wrong. Old school that works.
Since it can be contorted, this is great for oddly shaped gardens, flower beds around a house perimeter, or any other oblong watering scenario. I have mine paired with an Orbit water timer to automatically water my gardens. Zero Maintenance.
8643	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good
The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.

My mower creates a cloud of dust if I ride thru the bare spots and weaker patches of the lawn under the many trees, and it all rises up near the front of the hood where the intake is for the engine. Not the smartest place for the intake so it makes the pre-filter definitely work to do its part.  I've been able to clean (both) and rinse (pre-filter only) a few times and get some hours out of each.
4998	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I appreciate that this mesh is packaged in a roll. It was evenly cut and a breeze to install, I just unrolled and clipped it on the poles as I went around my fruit tree cage, which happens to be 7' tall. So it fit perfectly on the sides of the cage. I just rolled it up to the top and secured with small bungee cords. Now it's ready when I need it. One less thing to worry about. I plan on leaving it on all year. If needed I can place fleece or plastic directly over it in cold weather when needed. The mesh is 1/2" x 1/2" and the birds can see enough shine on it to actually land on it instead of flying into it. But it does not obstruct my view of looking at my beautiful food plants. Note* I secured a heavy duty mesh netting on the top of my fruit cage to withstand smaller falling branches and hail. I recommend attaching this taught so the birds will not get tangled in it.

4) "This mower won't cut through branches" - No, it won't. Try a chainsaw. Or try actually policing your yard. Mine will stop at any twig larger than a slim pencil - but I wouldn't want a power mower slinging anything bigger than that at my house windows (or tender legs) anyway.


4644	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Doesn't cut much of anything. If you have a lovely manicured yard this baby is the ticket. If you got crabgrass and weeds this thing won't help you. So If my lawn was in the suburbs and looked like a golf green this reel mower is what i would use.

Mice can be dangerous if they get into the house and start chewing on the electrical wiring.  They can't help it, because they must keep chewing on things to keep their teeth from growing too long, which would interfere with their ability to eat, causing starvation.  That's fine, but bare electrical wiring is a fire danger.

When the one I have wears out I will get another, but I don't expect that to be anytime soon and I grill several times a week.

7266	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use an Oregon S50 for my Remington electric and the D70 for my old McCulloch 610 Pro gas saw and no complaints with either. Its pretty hard for me to mess up a blade when felling a tree but once its down and being cut into logs I can do a number on it. The most frequent damage to sharpness comes when the tip hits the ground because I haven't lifted what Im cutting up high enough not to do so. Unbelievable how little it takes to dull the cutters after doing so only a few times so I always have a few spares on hand to swap the blade out quickly and sharpen it at some later date. I have a few wood stoves so cutting down dead trees on our few acres is worth the few bucks this chains cost. I do have some pretty large carcasses to cut and they're larger than the length of my chainsaws so it takes a lot of cutting around it before I have a log to split. This comes nice and oily and ready to go in about the 5-minutes it takes to pull of the old and put on the new and much better than stopping everything to sharpen one. I try to cut the stump even with the ground and thats another major dull practice that I try never to do with a recently new chain so having a sharpened old one for whats pretty much a single use is nice to have handy since Ive even cut through bard wire thats been embedded in a stump.

9493	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The Flowtron arrived in good time and in good condition. I hooked it up and it started zapping bugs right away. (Of course my 16 year old son thinks this is great.) We live in the woods and the bugs we horrible this year, but after two weeks of use we have reclaimed our deck. This thing really works! It tends to get clogged up with bugs after about a week of use and then we just take an air compressor and blow out the dead bugs. (A shop vac reverse would do the same thing.) The only thing that stops me from giving a full 5 stars is the price of the misquote attractors refills. Why they are $35 for 6 of them or $11 for 1 is beyond me. The price is a little high but not what those propane thing-a-ma-jings cost. Overall I am very pleased. Otherwise I would not take the time to write this review.

3474	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Love my EdgeHog edger I've had for a few years now. Does a great job and is nice and easy to use. I typically buy a new blade for it every season since they are relatively inexpensive, but I do wish they lasted a bit longer. I'm not chomping mine up against the driveway constantly or anything when I edge, and I honestly only edge every other time or two when I mow. But somehow these still seem to wear down a bit quicker than I'd like. Even so, it's pretty much the only option for the edger, and it still does a great job. Changing them is easy as pie, so no worries there.
I managed to set this up off center of my yard. After the first night myself and my whole family have not had a mosquito bite since.been 45-60 days now. Seriously. Not one. Completely took out entire hordes in a 2 day period. Still going strong. I turn on a dusk and off in morning.

3050	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have owned several of these over the years, not because they broke down, but because I gave them to friends because they work so well. Once you have done the edging, maintenance is a breeze.
2396	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Not impressed at all. You can't unplug the end while the valve is open because there isn't enough clearance. Even when you close the valve it's SO hard to unplug because it's tight.  The mechanism just doesn't work.

We've had several cases of Zika and Encephalitis in the county and needed to control the mosquito population.

4428	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is my first mower I ever owned.  I live in the Philippines, and I have Korean lawn grass (Zoysia), it works very well. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is only because it won't cut 3 1/2 inches from the edge of my tiles, but I can and will use my Gardena shears that I also brought from Amazon. Putting it together only took around 15-20 mins.  After I used it today (9/15.) I did hosed it down then spray it with WD-40.  I did leave the clippings on the grass which is a very good Fertilizer as far as I'm concern.

It does turn off after going over the "hump" but you need to have the hose continue going straight at least as long as the tractor is or it will fall over. AND you have to have the hose tightly screwed on to the tractor or the water will leak out the connnection once it is "off".

Found one of the tires flat prior to fall spreading. No punctures, it just lost air. Pumped it up and finished the job. Next day it was flat again, so I shot some FlatFix into it and it's holding air now. Seems that the plastic rims do not seat the tires as well as metal, but this is the only problem I've had so far.

It says kink free but we all know how that goes.  Already had a couple of kinks but they are not chronic in the same place all the time.  If I got the rubber I would be 5 stars. For $7 a good deal if all you need is 15' of hose.  Beats the heck out the cheap vinyl hose.

2230	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	For me, it didn't do much.  I have very rocky clay that I call "soil" and the auger didn't make a dent in it.

This is not the first set of Gilmour connectors I have owned.  Several years ago I bought a bunch of these at Lowe's, the green and black ones though, same as these except the color is different.  And they worked fine, but as they got older they became very hard to disconnect.  So I figured maybe dirt or whatever got inside and was making it harder to undo them and why I thought buying new ones would work better.  Boy was I wrong, these new ones I got are worse then my old ones to disconnect.

First night out - caught one in the oven.  My other "live" trap caught one a week ago, but every night since then kept "tripping" - without a mouse.

I tried to use it in conjunction with the new Miracle Grow in-lin feeding system. The latter feeds much too fast to be used in conjunction with this sprinkler.

It doesn't waste the bulb by having it run all day and it is effective in drawing in the critters and zapping them into ash. This zapper appears well built and sturdy enough for prolonged outdoor use. I've only had it outside now for a few months, but it shows no signs of wear or oxidation. Every so often a really big bug will get zapped and the zapping noise will last a while (a minute+) and it's a little worrying, but eventually the zapper finishes it's job. You can see small blue sparks when the bugs die. It works as advertised!

This unit is light, really as portable as you could wish and is truly versatile.  It's one-touch design is nice but the patented shape and very well designed heat and ash adjustments are what make this a joy to use.  It's comparatively heavy construction insures conductivity and consistency--you know immediately it's a quality product.

They used to be nice but recently they changed their OEM supplier and their products rust and fall apart easily. How bad? Think worse than Chinese 'Harbor Freight' quality- which is unthinkable! My Hedge Shears rusted up (with no use at all) in around a year and looks like it came out of some antique yard sale. Think about tools that appear in a 'Rust Removal' Youtube video. And it was stored in Southern California in a shed with hardly any humidity!
Good stuff...just stinks horribly so don't keep it too close to your house.

Being "assembly challenged" it took awhile, but I got there. Felt pretty good about it. I then went out to mow.  Surprisingly it was easier than trying to start my gas mower, no bag to empty and then try to get on again, I do have a smallish grassy area in the front and side of my house, but even with twigs and leaves I encountered little problem.  In fact, if I'm honest, I felt good.  It was easy. No noisy motor or fumes, no worry if you have gas in the tank, perfect for me.  I live in a wooded area, don't have the perfect lawn, but it suits me fine.  Easy enough to do twice if you need to.  I love this thing.  I'm a retired female with a total hip replacement.

First thing the next morning, I would clean out the ash, carry it back to my room and reload it for the evening.  If you are a Weber Kettle user, you will feel right at home and have no problem adjusting.  You will be suprised at how much you can really put on it.  I started with the recommended 30 pieces of charcoal, but soon found that to be a little lacking in heat.  Found that 35 was about right for chicken and veggies, but 40 were needed to steak and pork.  Plan on putting it to work from time to time at home also.  Best $35 I spent in a long time.

It does a wonderful job cutting delicate, newly grown rye grass, and the stiffer, and more robust weeds and feskew in our side yard.  The cut from this mower is significantly more even and straighter than a power mower.  There is a hypnotic effect from watching the blades rotate, while tossing up grass blades, nice a quietly.  It does not kick up loads of dust when rolling over bare sections, which is very nice when it's super hot out.  the mower only weights about 15-20 pounds, so it's very easy to push it up hill, or down hill, or over uneven and bumpy spaces.  It is easy enough to push and I don't think I could call it a "work out".

7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.
It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...

We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!

One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.
 I drilled a hole in the center of the pie pan and mounted it to the bolt and wing-nut that holds the three legs together.
The REFILLS are the ONLY way to do it...  They are EASY to install and cost a whole lot cheaper than buying spools!

1609	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Only a small area (about an inch close to the handle side of the blades) cuts.  The rest just bends the branches and takes way too much effort to figure out why only half the blade surface actually cuts.  I bought these to replace Fiskars pruners that are way past their prime. Since the part that actually cuts is so close to the handle, they have limited use.  I replaced these with Felco.

The only issue I have is with the handle design. The handle appears to be glued to the shaft and it very quickly became loose and would slide off. We eventually lost it and we now simply use a oven mitt which works great. Overall, I cannot knock the operation and end product results. It delivers excellent chicken and roasts and we are always complimented on how well the meat comes out crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Next time you are at you butcher ask for a "Spoon Roast" it is a small roast similar to a sirloin. Cook it on the Rotisserie to your doneness desire and serve with a horseradish sauce.

the frog larvae, although the mfgr says not, but no frogs anymore, and after 2 years, they didn't cause a drop in mosquito population. We adhered strictly to the theory that moving water doesn't allow larvae to grow, but although I also religiously checked the yard for standing water and made sure the pond water was always moving, we had an intense problem. After 2 years of not being able to have barbeques and even with every bug repellant and many citronella and mosquito coils still had a big problem (two of our kids are the type that "attract" mosquitoes. Must have good blood!) and even neighbors had complained, but not to us. :(

The cord is very short at about a foot.  So buy a longer black or green (whatever matches your decor) outdoor rated extension cord.  I was also surprised you couldn't hang it under the eaves of the house...fire??  It does not seem to get hot so maybe they are afraid of flaming moths??
7468	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great - does what it's suppose to do. No complaints! It's nice to sit out on a cool evening without being "bugged" by mosquitoes or other pests! Would recommend this product.
9781	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I realize this was designed to be retrofitted to a sprinkler system to turn one sprinkler head into a drip irrigation point for 8-drip irrigation hoses, but I actually designed my system to using this instead of drip emitters, which I am all too familiar with and I have to say I really am glad I went with this instead. One I can control the water flow to a plant and as it gets bigger over time I am able to turn up the water flow to just that one plant, no emitters to have to worry about plugging up or needing to replace as I connected my hose straight into a 1/4" soaker hose. I also enjoy that since my system is under 100-psi I did not need to worry about any pressure reducer.
I will update when I receive it and then again after a similar amount of use. Hopefully they have the (known?) problem fixed as I really am needing additional quality hoses to purchase in the near future but I am now very hesitant...

9444	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have owned one of these units before and its still working after many years and a few bulb replacements. The bulbs should be replaced yearly for optimum performance. This unit does the job! The 40-watt size doesn't work as well. I started out ordering 2- replacement bulbs for my current unit from Amazon at a total cost of around $36. I ordered the bulbs and then realized that the cost of a new unit INCLUDING BULBS was $55. What a deal. I ordered the new unit and donated the still working old unit. I highly recommend this product. I live in California and the bug problem is not as bad as on the East coast. However, I spend time in my backyard relatively flying insect free.

The blade I received had a mounting hole that was a simple rectangle with straight sides. I contacted the seller, Mowtown USA, to return the blade. They asked if I'd tried the blade, telling me that it would still fit, but they did send me the return shipping label if I still wanted to return it. I did try the blade and it does fit so I will be keeping it.

The mesh is still like new after more than a year in place, and no animals have broken through it. It has even stood up to small limbs falling on it.

The Rain Bird 1804 Pro is the standard all others are judged by. They are durable, they don't leak or break like the cheaper Rainbird Sure Pop cheaper model and are also better than the look-a-like Orbit head. The RB1802, 2 inch model, actually costs more because they sell fewer of them. Stick with the 4in for most needs and skip the 2in. The only reason to consider a 2in pop up head is if your pipe was installed too shallow but you would be better off using swing pipe or elbows to fit a 4 inch tall head. If by chance your lawn gets very long you'll need the 4in for proper water coverage.

- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)
Nonetheless, it cuts really well. What I like is that the grass still looks natural when I'm done cutting.  Meaning, it doesn;t look like I just cut it.  Sort of like when you get a haricut and everyone can tell because it is so neat?  I actually like it better when it grows out a bit and looks more natural.

1567	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Nothing fancy with a lot of settings.  Just a good quality metal sprayer that delivers a spray ranging from a wide fan to a strong stream, depending on how far you depress the handle.  The strong stream works well for watering plants from a distance, or for washing window screens, which will be the primary use.  The wider spray is good for close-range watering. The only thing it doesn't do, is provide a gentle flow, like if you want to fill the birdbath.
8590	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this product for years.  My humming birds like it and easy to mix and dissolves immediately.  No need to boil the water to dissolve the crystals.
2601	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This sprinkler does the job and works well. I have only have two small issues with this sprinkler. First, after each use I need to reset the spray direction the following day, even if I did not move or touch the sprinkler. The second is the two adjustments for setting the spray direction have two prongs making it a little awkward for setting the direction for the sprinkler. I do like having the on/off valve when moving the sprinkler to another location in my yard, but never use it to turn on and off the hose. I have this sprinkler for about one month. For the price if it lasts one season I will be happy.
Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.
5231	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Quality product and great service.
5280	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Have had 2 of these on all summer and they have done a good job with zapping the bugs. The downside is that it's hard to get at the dead bugs that are stuck all over the grid, to clean them off.
5858	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Couldnt find in ANY local hardware stores. Great price and a good product to have on hand.

Have spares for when/if I hit that stupid stump again!
9040	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice thanks for the speedey delivery
works and works well if placed well.
If you follow the instructions provided this does a decent job.
1476	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great shears! Easy to lock and open. Very sharp and cuts easily.
The Black & Decker RB-01 (and the RB-001) are superior to the blade of the Homelite trimmer that I have, primarily because of their sharp-pointed edge tines. These allow the edge tines to be inserted behind grass growing along a planter board, for instance.
***Update*** (Aug 2014)
1457	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this machine for the past month and found it to be properly designed.  It works as represented and pulls long lengths of hose without running off the track.  Best feature:  water spray radius varies from 55' down to 15' useful for my odd shaped lawn, also its two speeds are good for various watering depths.
9881	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I don't use weeders. I use this tool and others, with my metal detector. I use it  for the heavy prying work. I treat it rough, rocks and such, it's held up well. I only rated it four stars, because I don't use it as a weedier.
It also cur down on waste by precisely spacing the seeds and distributing them properly
1520	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Best one out there for the price.  Simple and works well.  Made in red China, but still worth it.
7095	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I don't know how this works but it works and it does a wonderful job we have no more flies in the backyard coming into the house. Our neighbor has a big dog in a kennel and they do not clean up the poop they just throw it to the corner of the fence. So we have a very large population of flies. I put this out it says it has to cure for three days, the next morning I went out there and I couldn't even count how many flies when. The flies go in they can't figure out how to get back out the whole there's four of them they fly around to their exhausted and then fall into the liquid and drown. What I like about it is that it is non-toxic. The next time I buy one I'm going to buy the smaller size as I have nerve damage and it is hard for me to use the large size. My recommendation is to clean this out and change the bait after one week if you have a lot of flies in their. I didn't do this and I guess the decomposing flies may liquid that filled the whole container up which I had to throw away. This is a great product and it really works. Please pardon any grammatical errors I have to dictate to my computer as I'm a disabled veteran.

I've owned other zappers and have never had this problem.

8247	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great quality.
Mow a few hours or the next day after a rain -- when the grass is pliable, and rain has washed the mold off.  The grass should be not wet, but not dried out either.  Wear long pants, closed shoes and shocks -- otherwise you will get mold, pollen all over your legs and feet.  Be sure to take breaks, stay hydrated.

Forget about those extendable-handle units...all for show.  This trimmer delivers.  Would highly recommend.
2709	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days.

8369	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A lot smaller than the Stinger I bought a few years ago, but seems just as effective! I live on 64 acres and there are bugs galore, other than having to hose it off (make sure it's not running when you do it) weekly of dead bugs!

6799	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I own a John Deere 4.5 hp 22" gas-powered (4-stroke) self-propelled mulching mower. I think it retailed for about $600-700 ten years ago. It's performed very well, but it needs annual service; it needs to be cleaned, and it clogs if the grass is damp or too tall.
6863	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	it really works - and is entertaining to watch - but i feel sorry for the bugs who get zapped - because they get zapped really good

4) The spark lighter stopped working after about a dozen uses (typical) so I keep a butane lighter handy.
4398	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My "family Heirloom" mower was definitely not of the modern type. The bar to hold it didn't fit to take my mower apart, but every other part of this kit worked perfectly to sharpen my ancient mower to perfection. It can now be used for many mows to come!
The reason I bought Perky Pet is because locally, that's what every store carries.  This is the only window mount feeder available in the brick and mortar stores.  It's a frustrating product though.  I've never had a problem with the suction cup.  I've had petals blow off, but the hummers don't mind that.  The problem is the prongs on the back of the reservoir.  Sometime, they're going to break.  I've had them break on first filling and fiftieth filling, and even if I can get the well to stay on the reservoir for awhile, eventually it slides off.  I only mount one of these at a time, and have bought as many as 3 in a season.  I've also had them last more than one season but never more than two.  The hummers get frustrated if the food disappears.  They chase us around!

1531	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice solid and sturdy product.  It does what it's suppose to, and it doesn't leak like the plastic one I had if you accidentally drop it on a hard surface.  I bought another one for my other hose.  I definitely recommend.
3542	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Replacement blade works as good as the original that finally wore out.
I caught 6 with it.  I measured the sensitivity of the bait holder itself, and it only takes 7 grams to set it off, that's the weight of 3 pennies.  Even a very small mouse at 12-20 grams easily trips it.  I know cause I've caught a lot of mice and weighed the mouse in the trap, and without the mouse, then subtracted to get their exact weight.

1058	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	this little works just as it suppose to and it not very neat and spray were it is suppose too
+ It has a nice screen / filter at the opening.  Just unscrew the top, fill with chemical(s), replace the screen/ filter, fill it with water from the hose, and you're good-to-go.  Sometimes there's debris in water lines, and the screen/filter is the same heavy duty material found in the backpack itself to prevent those particles entering your water reservoir and, subsequently, clog the tube system .
Wasn't much of a bird fan/watcher until we installed this and now it's so pleasant to sit on the back porch and watch all the different birds come in and eat.  Friends and company are always amazed and delighted by the amount of traffic this feeder attracts.
Works great now, great buy...
  Might be better suited as a reel hose or for someone who would appreciate the lighter weight for maneuvering.
77	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Cheaply made, it broke when I tightened the screw.
3803	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Works great. Much better than my old black soaker hose that had bursts of large sprays after just 2 weeks from enlarged holes. Minus one star for this because I have to keep the water pressure manually ridiculously low and it's a pain to get it just right, then I have to adjust it if I run the washer or dishwasher etc... I would wish for a throttle type thing at the beginning of the hose. Overall a good buy and I'd probably buy the same again if/when the need arises.
2255	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	OH so much better then the twenty dollar sprayer you get at your local DYI store.  It's great product since it's mostly metal parts don't break like plastic.

The fact that the legs double as a latch to hold the top on and make it entirely portable by the handle on top is a great feature as well if you ever want to take it on a picnic, etc.

395	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good nozzle. Has a uniformly round spray pattern and shuts of completely.

5227	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Tears easily, but the problem I had with it most was that dragonflies get stuck in the fence among other things.

9734	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very good unit!
All that said, these replacement guards are 30% the price of an entire new feeder, so looking at it that way, it sounds a little steep. But still saves money over buying a new feeder.
I did find that this product works very well in holding down other garbage in my trashcan, however. Please see attached photos which demonstrate this product's versatility in this regard. Other garbage has little chance of escaping from underneath this, given the weight of the electrical cord and the plastic packaging. I have not thrown this away in my exterior trashcans to test it against high winds, but it works exceptionally well indoors. Sadly, it will be trash day soon, so I will have to part with this expensive hunk of junk. Sadly, my own internal regret at being suckered in by the positive reviews will haunt me for years to come...

It's well built and shares many of the qualities of a Great States and Scotts mowers.  The rollers are nice so you can see where you have mowed.  Height adjustment is a little cumbersome, but so are all the other models.  There is a good youtube video on height adjustment for the scotts.  It basically applies to all of these types of mowers.  Bought mine used.  Was missing a couple screws.  That is good since I go to the orange box store to replace all the screws with superior nylon lock nuts and hex bolts.  They will never some looks like the plastic wing nuts that come with these mowers.  I mow on a 1/3 acre property for the last 1.5 years with these reel mowers.  Great exercise, you don't smell like gas, and the mower is quiet.  Not much more you can ask for.

4020	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Wasn't very effective.... Eventually got tired of the thing & how much time I was wasting going over the same areas over and over and replaced it with an electric mower.  Wasn't worth the $$ nor the time in the end.
The unit gives off a lot of light and is able to attract bugs from both the first level and 2nd level of my house (I have it mounted above the 2nd story deck on the corner).  It draws all of the moths that used to hang out on our windows - from as far away as about 30 or 40 feet.  One zap and they are toast.  The design of the BK-80D is much better than other models I have seen.  The vertical rods are well made and allow the bugs to slide down and fall out of the unit after they are killed.  Not all bugs fall out, but I would say about 95% or so do fall out of their own accord.  By morning time, the wind has also helped blow some of the rest out of the unit and they have fallen on the deck.
75	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Awesome! Thank you!

Also, you really have to take the mice a decent distance away, don't just go release them at the edge of your yard.  They are going to come right back in, and will prbably not fall for this trap a second time.  Take them out into the woods a few miles away.
6869	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good gauge for keeping the depth cut teeth at the correct height.  The metal of the gauge is harder than the file so it doesn't wear out quickly if you hit it as you're filing the chain.

I ordered this hose from Amazon and just got it today.  I was impressed with it - the hose itself feels sturdy, (as in not easy to collapse), and the ends look to be of decent quality.

3. When you clear the trap, take the mice at least 100 feet away, further is better, or try to release across a couple of habitat transitions. Distance is best, but if you can't do that, you might be able to get them across the street, or in that woodlot next to your yard, etc. If you've ever seen a mouse hauling tail on a paved surface, you know that they can cover distances in a flash and be right back where they started. In your house or barn. So, again, more distance is better. Remember, mice leave their nest sites to forage ... they know how to find their way back. Their trails are marked with cues, so you have to break that chain so that they cannot find their way back.

These hedgers are very sharp, so working with them is easy. Believe me I am not strong, so the length and sharpness of the blade is very important to me.

It has definitely cut down the population of the skeeters. they are still there, but probably 75% reduced from previous.
8892	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Mice avoid this trap regardless of if it is baited or not.  I placed the trap along a know mouse trail without bait as instructed.  Plenty of mice as evidenced by fresh dropping but after a week not a single mouse.  I then baited the trap with the fish food they were after.  After another week no a single mouse.  I will try another location this week but do not expect any better results.  My guess is that the very small trap entrances are probably too small for mice.
6386	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The grill appears to be of good quality but the assembly instructions don't match the parts that were shipped.

Comparatively, one of the main reasons I purchased the reel mower was for a spot I mow that is on top of a retaining wall (in order not to have to lift a heavy push mower up there).  This area has a nice stand of Zoysia, but being as it is surrounded by an elevated retaining wall, there was no way to smooth the area mechanically prior to sodding (other than a hand rake and a small tiller).  This area has an overall flat slope, but because it was hand leveled there are some slight bumps and depressions across it.  Also, becuase this area was back-filled with a sand based soil mixture, it has a low soil fertitlity and can be droughty.  So even though I have the same variety of Zoysia in this area, it tends to have a clumpier texture to it.  I can mow this area with the reel mower, but it has to be trimmed often.  If I let it go more than a few days, then I have to trim it with the motorized push mower and then mow it every few days with the reel mower.  Whereas in my ideal portion of the yard almost anyone could use this mower with relative ease, in the rougher area it takes quite a bit of strength to use it even under good conditions.  The question of whether an individual is capable of using this mower really depends mostly on the conditions of the situation and intended use.

 This does cut grass very well, but the biggest problem with this mower is that if your grass has put up seed stalks it will NOT CUT them. It rides right over tall stuff, pushing it over and NOT cutting it. Even in the lowest and highest wheel settings. So then you have to go back over these areas with a weed wacker and finish the job..
6685	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Well, I didn't catch any moles with these. My old mole trap had broken after two years, and I tried to save some money and bought these instead. At first I thought they would be easier to set, but you really need a third hand to set these.

My biggest complaint is the sticker that you see in the picture. That is stuck on and on some of the ones I bought the sticker would not come off.

More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap.

This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.

If I was to be overly critical, my one minor complaint is that if you use a heavy extension cord, it makes the edger top heavy.  More of an observation then a real complaint. Certainly nothing that would make me take a star away from my review.  A great value for the money.
7645	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	When I am cooking ribs or a chicken which can take a few hours, you definately will have to add fresh charcoal.  The beauty of this grate is that you can add more fuel without removing the grate which puts you at risk for losing you food on the floor. Simply lift up one corner of the grate and add prelit coals.
3253	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This edger probably works find for light work in sandy soils. It does not work if you have an edge that has never been edged before in clay soil with tough sod. Mine overheated and the motor burnt out. The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal (amazing there is a metal part on this) shaft by a screw. Not a bolt, not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened. The handle, powerhead, and shaft all wobble in relation to each other. The housing is cheap plastic. The blade is not sharp and showed considerable abrasion and wear after just a few  of minutes of use. This product is like everything else Black and Decker has made in the last decade or so...junk.
9992	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice little sprayer for the price. I gave it four stars because within two months the little metal thing that holds the handle in an open position had fallen off, plus it never worked that well in the first place. It only held it about 60% open. Plus I feel that there is a setting missing. The shower setting is at a nice power, but it is only along the outside perimeter, and makes even watering difficult because the water distributes in a fairly big circle. If you use the inner perimeter holes, it is too forceful for gardening. I wish there was a setting that combines the two at a modest force. I will probably try and find that even if it's more expensive. But I'm not unhappy I purchased this.

I had to open them up and repair them, and don't have time to do this every time I use them, which appears will be the case.

9507	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I do love this bug zapper, but I noticed there weren't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be, seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek (lots of bugs!).  One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)
9892	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	great product.....my mother loves this item
My only minor complaint is that it seems a little top heavy. When I'm not actively using it, you can essentially blow on it and it will tip over. This might have something to do with me having the handle fully extended due to my height, but it's something the B&D engineers may want to look at when they redesign it in the future. It's a slight safety concern because if the user momentarily stops to adjust the extension cord it could tip over as they are re-grasping the trigger to start again.

EXCEPT the Coolaroo brand has all the male pins on the same side and Easy Gardener has the small male pins on one side and the 2 large ones on the other. This makes it impossible to push the fabric onto the pins before you close it. If you do not push the fabric into the pins first they don't close as tightly.

Im able to use less charcoal with a little less depth between the charcoal grate and the grillling surface I can get away with 12-16 briquettes rather than 25-30 built into a hefty mound and it is small enough and light enough to allow it to be easily transported.

Because of the Weber name and quality, I decided that I wanted to venture into the world of charcoal grilling.  Weber charcoal grills are a no brainer for this, but which one.  I knew that I wanted the 22.5 inch grill and I wanted the Gold version.  The only thing that I didn't like about the grill was the lack of a side table.  I figured that I would find away around that.  What I didn't realize, is that there is no temperature indicator on the top lid.  How are you supposed to regulate the temp if you don't know what it is?......Candy stick thermometer is the answer to that one.  What a hassel.  I found that you can buy a side table to go with you grill.  It clips onto the lower bowl.  This prevents the upper bowl from making a tight seal.  Why would this be important you ask.....If you are trying to smoke something (temps around 250 degrees at the bowl lid) it is really hard.  Air seeps into the coal area and adds oxygen to the fire causing the temps to rise.

5946	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Really like this inexpensive flower food. I am a novice at gardening and used this according to the box hoping it will help make my garden look better. I use it every 2-3 weeks during blooming season on my lavender this year and I got so many blooms even my friends are jealous. This box can last you for a few months of weekly use. I use it all over my garden and simply mix it with a gallon of water in a watering can. Amazon has this at a very inexpensive price.
I like the fact that this grill is rectangular shaped rather than the round. I just feel that the coals are spread out better with this design. The heat is even from corner to corner.
Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.

The gentle shower pattern, a favorite for me, works really nicely with a nice overall spray and decent enough pressure to water the back of my 8' deep garden as effectively as the front.  The jet is great.  The pattern ring doesn't turn quite as easily as my Toro nozzle, nor is the trigger quite as easy to squeeze, but both are quite doable even with arthritis in my hands and the lock is easy to flip into place so you don't have to squeeze the trigger for long periods.  The patterns are so much more effective than the more expensive red and silver Toro, I'm definitely replacing others with this one when needed.  I'll leave the Toro on in the winter, because if it cracks and leaks, I won't really care.  This is a great nozzle that meets a lot of needs from vegetable gardens to potted plants.
 So I took them apart & soaked the plastic parts in vinegar & water for an hour, washed & rinsed them again, and  voila the little Birds went after them like there was no tomorrow.  Problem solved. I used about I cup of vinegar per gallon of water. Works like a charm.

4. Do the same for the other side as #3.
A few disadvantages:  twigs the size of a pencil will choke it.  Grass that's a little tall will simply get bent over and spring right back up after you pass over it.  It doesn't leave your yard with that "fresh cut" look, it's more like "my grass isn't out of hand" look.  You can't mow closer than 3 inches to anything because of the side wheels.

Second of all it really does not seem to KINK-something that was VERY important to me after trying several other hoses and returning them.
2244	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Having seen similar items locally (but at a much higher price), I couldn't resist the price Amazon offered, and sure enough a couple days later a rather large box was on my doorstep.  When I opened it up, I saw what appeared to be a bit smaller and lighter weight than I imagined (though consistent with the facts provided), but I quickly expanded the telescoping shaft and staked it into the ground.  Many other sprinklers fail to deliver the promised range, so I was surprised to find it exceed the stated coverage area (quickly fixed by dialing down the spigot).
Oh, and if you store these things, don't just stack them on a shelf somewhere. Because when you go and get them to put them back to work, you're going to have fossilized mice in there. To store, I clean and dry them, mist them with a little fog of WD40 or 3-in-1 oil, and place them in gallon zip lock bags. When I pull them out, I give them a quick degreasing and washing with Joy dish soap and they're good to go.

I spent $40 this spring on my 10 year old gas mower to get it back on it's feet. I bought a new blade b/c the old one was bent, new gaskets and seals for the carburetor, an oil change, and a new fuel line. Would have cost much more but I am able to to do all my own work. It's been a good machine and has alot of life left in it but I'm tired of it though. Such complexity and roaring noise to do something simple like cut grass. Every year it has cost me $20 or so to get the gas mower ready. I can only imagine what it would cost to use a repair service.

One thing I don't like is that if your mowing strips or sidewalks are on the outside of your yard as most are, you have to operate it left handed. For me, being right handed, it makes it more cumbersome to use.

4456	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I'm very pleased with this product and it's easy to use. Looked for mowers that would cut grass down to 1/2" and this baby does it! As a matter of fact it was the only manual that I could find that would! Most everything I found only went to a couple of inches..not good for low growing grasses. Had to do some adjustments to get it to that cutting level as it wasn't set for that from the supplier. It  was relatively easy to do if one has any mechanical abilities and a few basic tools and a one time thing so not an issue. Cuts great and it's easy to push. It also allows for a grass catcher that pops on and off with no effort. I have a smaller area ( about 800 sf) where I'm growing hybrid bermuda so the manual push isn't a problem  but if you had a big lawn you might want a power mower. Bottom line... cuts great, easy to push and was affordable. The only negative I could find is that the distance between the blade and the wheels results in approx. 2 t3" of uncut grass when cutting up against a fixed wall or fence. Guess that's why they make string trimmers!

I price shopped and this is the best price you will find.  Certainly worth the money.  The seller shipped in 2 days.  The plug is very short so you will need an extension cord.

Note the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.

May 10, 2011: Ordered two 18" round pizza pans to suspend below my indoor units in order to catch most of the zapped bugs as they fall. Some black coat hanger wire and a drill should do the trick. Have not had my bug zappers on yet and I can really tell the difference inside already. Bought six cans of Raid insecticide for the summer. A roach actually bit me on my right arm tonight. He's high on Raid now. Wish I could find something like this Flowtron device to help zap the big roaches as they somehow find a way inside. It takes time for them to find the roach baits that are all over the home where food and water are available. There's no way to keep them out around here.

This screwed right on with no leaking. If you want a wider fan spray they have an oring kit that comes with a brass tip included. I think it has a wider fan spray.

6144	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This feeder was very innovative looking and it held liquid without leaking. I would suggest getting a stronger/newer suction cup for the product as the one that came with mine was a little yellow/opaque and seemed sort of like it was hanging around for a while. I decided to use it anyway since I had no other cups on hand. I cleaned the outside of my window with an all purpose cleaner and wet the suction cup with a little water. It held up for the first day, but when I came home the next it had fallen off of the window, the bottom piece (which is really two pieces) came apart at the seem and the part that attaches to the perches had cracked. On top of that, the little plastic piece that held the two clips on the back had also been broken off in the fall.

The Flowtron definitely attracts bugs, so be careful where you put it. We made the mistake a first of putting it on our patio and ended up having more bugs than less, as the chemical released actually attracts bugs. But then when we moved the Flowtron about 40 feet from the patio down to the edge of the lake in our yard, there was a noticeable reduction in bugs on the patio.
5204	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These were delivered quickly and were the exact replacement parts I needed.

For bait, I've had results with crunchy peanut butter. The problem with any edible bait is it also attracts ants/roaches, who will gladly eat the bait without ever triggering the trap.

8126	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For reference we live just north of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Several other reviews good and bad make reference to their area and type of mosquito and how it effects how well the unit works. It has been raining for weeks here (which isn't usual) and the mosquitoes are just out of control (not usual also), swarm us like knats lately. Honestly I'm a big guy and the neighbors gotta think I'm re-enacting the bee scene from Tommy Boy every time I go in the backyard, even with deet and bug soother sprays both on.. Also we have a 20 month old girl who loves being outside and fights us and cries as we rush her inside the house from the car to keep her from being bitten up, it breaks our hearts, but what can we do? Even our Labrador is getting chewed up and the top of her head where the fur is short is bumpy with bites and this is an inside dog with a dog door. I researched and read every review on any product I thought would help, even a little. First I drained anything holding any sort of water from the rain. I then sprayed our shrubs, compost pile, lilacs and hostas with the most potent spray I could find and it knocked them down quite a bit.  I found this on Amazon and with 4+ stars on 3800+ reviews I felt it was probably worth a try. Firstly it shipped fast (Prime) and arrived in perfect condition. I temporarily mounted it hanging from our garage eve before dark and powered it up, few zaps here or there at first. As it started to get dark it was one or two zaps per second. I went inside and came back out after dark to check on it after our daughter was asleep and it was zapping constantly. I approached it and stood in amazed disgust as the wall of the garage was furry with mosquitoes next where the unit was hanging and I watched up close as dozens of mosquitoes flew in through the outside  plastic grid and to get zapped. I know it kills all kinds of flying bugs , but was pleased in our case that it was 20 to 1 Mosquitoes to other stuff while I watched. I'm aware that it takes several days to weeks to reduce the mosquito population in an area but with this and spraying problem areas I think our yard will be filled with toddler laughter again soon. I hope this helps you reclaim your yard as well. Thank you for reading

Seeds pop out of the hopper - The motion of the disk in the hopper makes seeds pop out of the top.  When this happens, the hopper looks like a pop corn popper.

When frozen they harden but don't crack and when in the sun they soften, but don't crack.  If you take the time to unroll them, they lay flat and don't want to kink, which is really nice.  We use ours on and off several times a day at the barn.  I've replaced hoses annually until I tried this brand.  It is sure nice to have something stand up to the daily wear and tear at the barn.

I'm a power user of these things. I'm an ecologist living in the backcountry and I just don't like to kill things if I can avoid it. In the house, an old 1890 cottage, it's snap traps all the way, because I need to set traps in the nether parts of the house where I'm not going to see them but every few days. But in the brookside barn/garage where I have a workshop and keep my cars, I'm in there daily and can clear the traps. I've had a problem with minks trying to live in my barn... and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why they want to live there: ample food (mice), water, and brookside digs ... and now you know why I take my mouse trapping seriously - area-denial warfare against mink!

The small, gel-like packet of bug pheromones provided is not very effective for attracting more bugs that I can tell, and it does not last very long.

There are vent holes that the mice encounter when they inspect the trap from the outside. Make sure your bait is right up against the vents. Refresh the bait every time you clear the trap of a mouse, or every few days if you have not caught anyone yet...

5960	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Makes a big difference.  I feed my plants mostly water from fish tanks.  That is likely higher in nitrogen.  This provides a nice boost to make the flowers blossom.  I don't think it is possible to overdue this product unless you don't follow the directions.  If you have flowers, then you want them to flower, and this stuff helps a flower flower faster and better and more reliably than any other food.  What makes this food so effective is that you don't have to wait for it to dissolve.  It is in the water, so the plant gets a direct and immediate shot of the minerals it needs.  Its like you getting an injection of vitamins as it travels directly up the vascular system of the plant.  This also does not last long and needs weekly or bi-weekly applications.  It's not hard to add it to the water you use.  So if you are growing flowers and want them to flower then feed them this food according to directions.  For some flowering plants this might be good for the duration of the time you fertilize your plants.  Maybe the regular Miracle Grow would be better in the non-flowering stages of growth.  I don't think this fertilizer has any effect on the micro-biome such as mycorrhizal fungi or beneficial bacteria.  I've used it for 40 years and it's always worked for me.

Unfortunately for me, I bought it just before moving and by the time I got to assembling the mower, Amazon's timeframe for returns had passed.

He said that they were out there for more than an hour and it was at least 11 PM and when they came back in neither of them had any bug bites.

The directions are straight-forward and clearly described in the manual. In short: turn the mower upside-down, use the brush to "paint" the compound (a thick goop) along the end of each blade, pop off a wheel, slip on the crank, and have your son turn it for a couple of minutes. (If you don't have children, you'll have to do it yourself.) Finally clean off the compound and re-assemble the mower. You should be able to complete this chore in 30-45 minutes. (The alternative is to pack it up, drive it to someone else, and come home; then later drive over, pick it up, and drive it home again. Oh yeah, and you'd have to pay for it too.)

UPDATE:  I had cause to set out this trap again recently, and this time I knew exactly where the mice were coming out to feed.  First mouse caught overnight;  second mouse caught overnight the second night;  third night, the mouse activated the trap but managed to get away.  Nothing is substantially different about my impression of the trap, except that I can see it makes a huge difference where it's placed.  I think the design is excellent, with the exception of it not being translucent, compared to other similar style traps.
There are two drawbacks to the current design compared to previous years:

The plastic handle didn't get too hot and we didn't have that much of a problem the the coals going out. Just to make sure, from other peoples reviews I shoved a knife the the bottom holes (with a mitt on) once in a while to make sure, so that may have had something to do with it. I wouldn't use it on a wooden deck though but since our porch is cement/concrete it was fine.
1271	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Had many reviews most of them good. When I got mine I tried to cut a small soft branch and it just bent instead of cutting. I can see the blade is not lined up with the metal part causing a gap instead of slicing through. I now see other reviewers having the same issue, either the blade overlaps the metal or its too far apart. I was really hoping these would be decent despite the cheap price but they are just cheap. I'm sure they are not all made with these flaws so you'll have to decide on taking that chance. The metal on mine had a lot of nicks and scratches too.
9490	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For the first few evenings of use, I had the Flowtron 80 hanging from a Shepard's Hook that had once held a flowering plant.  This placed the unit about four feet off the ground and the kill rate, while acceptable, was not a great success.  It should be higher and mobile.  I rescued an old deck umbrella  holder and piece of PVC pipe about eight feet long, a 90 degree fitting and another piece of PVC approximately twelve inches long.  Screw a small eyebolt into the short piece of PVC and there it stands.  A moveable Flowtron 80 holder.  The electronic device is working properly, attracting and zapping each bug that comes within it's zone of influence.  After I worked the "bugs" out, I also used the other reviewer's suggestion to enlarge the openings, this is a bug killing machine...Lynn, in Nashville...
What I really like about it is the 'full flow' fittings.  I needed all the flow I could get, and unlike some hoses I have looked at, the fittings are not a restriction.  About the only trade off I can see, is that it takes an o-ring at the fitting, instead of the standard hose gasket.

I would have given it 5 stars if it had a longer electrical cord so there wouldn't be this large electrical connection hanging in the breeze. Just a cosmetic observation I guess.

7983	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Weber makes a great traveling grill. I use this little grill all the time! I love how it can fold-up and you can carry it by the handle. The legs of this grill wrap around and cinch the lid closed by two notches in the lid. The area of the grill surface is perfect for my lady and I. I use about 24 pieces of coal every time and this seems to cover the bottom and provide enough heat. There is a grate that is used for the coal so that the coals don't rest on the bottom of the grill. This provides circulation to keep the coals burning well. Cleaning the ash out of the bottom either requires you to flip the grill upside down and shake it or you have to take the legs out to get the coal grate out so you can dump the ash. There are vents in the bottom that open and close and vents in the top too. This grill beats-out the rest simply because of the quality and design! I would highly recommend this grill.
I baited a few of them with peanut butter around 7pm and heard a very satisfying *SNAP!* at around 1am. Checked the traps and I had my first clean kill.

Perhaps the most annoying thing for me personally has been the high cost and limited availability of replacement bulbs.  I had no luck in my local home stores.  Even though these units are far from cheap, the bulbs are almost the same price as the unit itself.  My first bulb lasted me almost 2 years using it half the time.  Still, buying an entirely new unit on sale may be cheaper than paying the high price of replacing the bulb when you need one.  So if you ever see these bulbs on sale, buy them and stock up.  You will need them eventually.

Don't let that stop you from purchasing this, for the holes that I dug that I did not encounter roots, it was quick (5 minutes) and painless. If you have a yard relatively clear of tree roots, this is the way to go. If not, get this anyway and have the clamshell supplement it. Now that I've built the fence, I'm on the lookout for projects that would require this auger - a shallow well perhaps?
1. in the spring\summer time the moles are in more shallow 1-2 inches deep, staddle the tunnel with trap pushing the middle dirt flat, this is so when the mole comes thru the tunnel he's have to raise the dirt to pass and BANG... you trap him.

4489	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This mower worked fine for a month or two for our back yard, then the handle (like, the whole top end, not just the grip) bent. The ground in our back yard is a little uneven, so I think all the bumping and jostling while pushing got to it. It cut the bluegrass in our back yard alright, but we have what I think is really beefy bermuda grass in our front yard, and this was reallllly hard to cut with the mower. We barely could get it done the first time through, then as the blade got more and more dull (we're talking like, after 3-4 mowings, not years here) it just wouldn't do it.
.
One of those tool designs that is so simple and brilliant, it makes me wonder why someone didn't think of this a long time ago, and if they did, why aren't all other designs completely obsolete.
I wish I could offer you a more viable solution!?

The only issue I found was cutting a dried palm frond that was pretty thick.  The cool thing about these bypass pruning shears is they don't ever seem to try and pinch you.  It's hard to explain, but on my cheap set, (one metal blade cuts into a plastic blade) I am quite certain that I would have accidentally pinched my hand during the course of about 30 minutes that I used these.  The lock mechanism is much more efficient and does not appear that it will break.

This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.  It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.  So I'm back to the mower.  One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.

After 5 years of use I am still pleased with the grills performance.  I have corrected the lighting problem by treaking the igniter location and the uneven heating by replacing the burner. On breezy days the burner needs to be on med or higher to remain lit.  The handle can get hot after extended use on high. The grill still cleans up to like new and there is minimum corrosion of the internal components.

5007	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.

This tells me a couple of things. First, this trap is sensitive enough to trip even when a baby mouse enters it. Second, it's far more effective than the Mice Cubes, even using the same bait.

I will report back if my opinion changes, but I've had great success with these so far.

So gross & "dispatching" them when they flew in wasn't a pleasant chore.  It was getting out of hand and reducing the time we were spending on the deck just because we didn't want to open the door so I came to Amazon to seek out a solution.

One day, I even caught fruit flies freely resting and crawling around on the ribbon before flying off. They have never trapped as much as one house fly. I am now going to try the cider vinegar and collared jar solution -- thanks so much to the other Amazonians for that suggestion.
So we looked online and finally settled for what we considered the high tech solution: the Mega Catch Premier.. We bought 2 and paid heftily for those...250$ a piece. The concept was a machine that fools mosquitoes into chasing it as it presents itself to mosquito senses as a living breeding and bleeding mammal. It basically looks like a black plastic square box with some openings. In the top part of the box are colored blinking lights (led) that rotate. Aparentlhy mosquitoes see this as movement. Secondly, under those lights, there is a large computer style fan that creates downdraft...into a compartment below when you keep octenol and a bowl with sugar water and hotdog bits. (?)

I can say that I saw an obvious reduction of pests in my backyard, but they weren't completely gone. I used an old dry toothbrush to clean the metal grate when it would get blocked up with carcasses.

Cons:  It doesn't cut tall weeds like dandilions well, I usually have to pick those by hand.  It will get stuck and stop if you hit the smallest stick.  So you need to first pick up the yard of any and all debris before cutting the lawn.

If you use these a LOT, such as daily, u might want to consider buying better strap system, or add padding to this system...its fine for occassional use, but repeated use would benefit with better padding... u can buy many kinds of add on strap systems...although I never bought any, as I only use these once a week at the most.
So, I looked around where the leak might be coming from. I also tightened the screw that holds the pump cylinder housing. I have not been able to find the source of the leak just yet. Fortunately,  was spraying some fairly mild weed killer, so I was able to press on and finish spraying the weeded areas as well as applying the rest of the ~3 gallons I mixed up. What I found is that the sprayer is surprisingly comfortable to carry, the pump works well other than the fact that it leaks, and that I do actually get the yard sprayed more efficiently with this backpack than with my old hand sprayer. That said, my old sprayer is 20 years old, and does not leak.

  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.
3788	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these trowels everal years ago after breaking a few other brands doing planting in my yard.  My soil is very rocky, and other trowels broke where the blade was welded to the handle.  After breaking several I started looking at reviews and bought one of these Corona trowels at a local hardware store.  I've been using it ever since, but recently I found it dull and rather ineffective and so I took a good look at it.  Wow!  It had never broken, but several years of hard use had worn the thing down.  I ordered a new one and just had to take a photo of the old trowel and the new one side-by-side.  I think the photo shows how much hard use this trowel has seen.  The metal blade has been worn away by the rocky, sandy soil, but it never chipped or broke.
3238	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purcahsed my unit used off of Craigslist. It was advertised as used only a few times which looked to be true. The previous owners were moving into a condo so they had no use for it. I got it home and plugged it in. I have not edged since last year. Some areas it worked great with a back and forth motion. The areas that have thick Zoysia, not so well at first on the 1.5" depth.  What I did was double up on the blade. There is plenty of thread left to secure the blade bolt on to. Now it takes on the Zoysia without issue. I'm guessing once this initial edging is done, the next ones will be much easier. Only time will tell on longevity. So far I give it a thumbs up.

Also, there are a lot of review complaining about the cutting capacity.  While it states that the cut is 1.5", you should never attempt to cut anything that big with these loppers.  You should definitely use a pruning saw for anything an inch or larger.  These are really ideal in the half inch range.
Overall I love it because it is GREEN and uses ZERO gasoline.  Being very light does help also.  A woman or elderly person could use this with ease since it weights less than any other mower I have ever used.  If you want to go green buy this mower!

I suggest making your purchase complete by getting a Weber charcoal starter chimney (go ahead and get the larger size).

I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well.

With the air vent assembled the way it's supposed to, but remove the ash can, take a regular ole small drill bit (smaller in diameter than the self tapping screw/bolt that you will be using so that it will be snug when screwed in) and drill a hole through the tabs on the air vent that insert into the kettle legs and keep drilling into the actual legs (the ones with wheels and the one without wheels). Drill all the way through all of the parts. When done, screw your screws into the newly made holes and put a nut on the end.  That's it!  Your air vent thingie will never fall off again.

First, as at least one other reviewer noted, the foam grip can fall apart. But I see not many people have reported this, so maybe there was just a brief period where a supplier had a sub-standard foam - I fixed mine by visiting a bicycle shop and getting some padded handlebar tape.
5862	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this little grill. We have used it twice already. It is high quality for a low price. The Weber portable grill was convenient for myself and my family to use. We got a good sear with charcoal. The grates were easy to use. There is a slot at the bottom and one at the top. If you want to start a charcoal fire, you just have to remember to have both slots open. This allows the oxygen to get through!  You need carbon, oxygen and an ignition source to get the fire roasting!  If you close the grate, nothing will happen.  Put some newspapers on the bottom but leave a small hole for the air flow to move through. Pile on your unused charcoal. Light the newspaper and wait for the charcoal to catch.  When the charcoal turns red, orange or grey then you are good to go.  Let it heat the grill for about 30 minutes or so. That way you get an even distribution of heat. Then, you can put on your marinated meat or hotdogs. We used aluminum foil to cover our grill so the hotdogs wouldn't fall in. The dogs still got the grill marks on them and tasted great. I would recommend this cute little guy to anyone looking for a first time Weber grill.

At mentioned in previous reviews, assembly requires diligence.  I am very mechanically inclined and did read and note all the prior assembly tips given by other reviewers.  I recommend you do the same.  I very carefully read and studied the assembly papers before putting this item together.  I thought that surely it would not take me 2 hours to assemble this given my experience, but it did take 2 hours 10 minutes.  As careful as I was, about 10 minutes into the assembly, I discovered that I had bolted the main frame to the plastic hopper upside down.  The assembly directions do have drawings but they are not nearly as good as photographs would have been.

8758	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This BBQ grill lives up to everything written about it and the quality is quite good. The new feature of detachable ash catcher is definitely worth having. This grill cooks burgers and steaks to perfection, once you get accustomed to how to arrange the live coals (using more or less heat, etc). I would recommend this grill for anyone wanting an excellent charcoal grill.
I noticed that the metal loops that snap together can come apart easily, so used a pair of pliers to close them; the instructions don't mention doing this, but they should; it took like 30 seconds, and makes a world of difference. It can easily dislodge from the mower if you kick it or bump it against something, but I think once you I get use to it, it will be easy enough to avoid.
Difficult to get on the mower in an expedient manner - and when you are emptying a catcher a lot, this can be tiresome. Doesn't do a great job collecting the clippings.

2404	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Some people complain that they are hard to pull apart but I've figured it out. The mechanism you pull down to release the adapter interferes with the flow switch. If the flow switch is open, you can't release the piece. Also, there can't be any water pressure. So, turn off the water, close the flow valve and its very easy to take apart. It works with all my other quick release pieces that are not the same brand.

In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.

6850	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These traps work really well. It was the only way we got rid of a very bad mole infestation. Our son is a wildlife biologist and he recommended these traps over others on the market. He also recommended using gloves when handling the traps and when putting these in as the moles can smell the human sent and they will tunnel right around them if they do. The other thing he showed us was how to install them that is much easier than the directions. We simply step on the tunnel where we will put this and just rock the trap back and forth to straddle the tunnel until it's down in the ground. That way you don't dig anything up and you don't have to worry about light getting. If light gets in, the mole may not go there to repair the tunnel since they hate light so much. But doing it this way, when the mole comes along to repair the tunnel since it was smashed down, it meets it's demise. I recommend getting several of these traps so that you can put some in several places. It's not always easy to tell what is the main tunnel and what is a feeder tunnel. If you get this on a feeder tunnel you might not get the mole. Nice thing about these, if you bring them in out of the weather when you are done with them, they will last indefinitely.

We live on a lake and I set it up about 15 ft high right on the lake shore.  We've had occupants every year since.  The house feels lightweight but it is still in great shape after all these years.  I think the light weight is good because with the nests and birds inside that is more weight and the box sways a little in a heavy wind.

6967	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	i had no luck with this. It is hard to get set and when you try to place it in the ground the trigger springs very easily causing you to have to reset it and try again and again. I also caught no moles i think primarily due to the locations i am trying to catch them. I don't see any long straight runs like the directions and videos suggest as the place to put the trap. All i seem to have are short round paths (which according to the videos are feeding hunting burrows) i tried placing this in these locations with no luck. I am finding the P7901 mole chasers seem to be working much better. I have placed three of them and after about 10 days i no longer see any activity in the areas (about 100 feet wide circle) from these. Some people seem to have luck with these however so i guess it just depends on if you have the right mole runs to catch them in.

The wooden handle did not go far enough into the collar for the bolt hole to line up.  I hammered it in as far as it would go, but the rake handle widens as it goes up and I couldn't get it to the bolt hole.  So, I used it with the handle held on by friction.  However, it's "no clog" promise was also a joke.  It clogged as much if not more than my cheap old rake.  Unfortunately I bought it in the summer and by the time raking season arrived it was too late to return it.  This is a piece of junk - not only improperly assembled but also flimsy.

I have a Zoysia lawn, and I purchased this model because it had 7 blades (which is what most sources recommended for this species).  With the right conditions in the lawn, this mower handles Zoysia with no issue.  I have a small area in front of my garage that I tilled, box bladed, and hand raked (so that it is absolutely level and smooth) prior to sodding; and this mower does a fantastic job for this spot.  The reel mower style makes such a beautiful cut compared to rotary style traditional mowers that I can keep this spot looking like a golf course fairway (or even a major league outfield if I want to do a quick cross cutting).  In fact, the style of cut performed by a reel mower is much better for the health of the lawn than traditional rotary mowers (which really tear the grass off versus the clean cut of the vertical reel cut).  Under ideal conditions, the reel mower can make quick work without any over-exertion; assuming I keep it trimmed at least once a week (really works better if I do it twice a week).  Besides keeping the grass trimmed frequently, it is also imperative to easy operation that you don't over load the blade.  I usually only utilize about 60-70% of the reels total width on each swipe.  Not only does the quality look better when you don't try to bite off too much, but I find that in the end you will usually mow quicker just because the mower does not hang as often.
711	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my "Scarecrow" so as to keep the deer away from my plants. It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation.

I ordered this because my old rake broke.  Well, it broke when I stomped on it.  It deserved it though; I was raking and pushing leaves into the woods with it and it cracked.  I had a moment and stomped on it which completely busted it.  I had a backup rake which I did not stomp on.  But - I needed to replace the one that broke.  So, I ordered this one.  Another reason why I ordered it was to see what kind of box it showed up in.  It's a giant square box with a cardboard piece taped to the top to accommodate the handle.  I felt bad - like some guy at Amazon had to tear up some boxes to make this work.  But you know what, he/she nailed it.  It was a nice job!  And the rake arrived safely.

9326	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This zapper is fabulous, of quality construction.  I had a terrible moth problem at my back door.  The moths were attracted to the outside, back-door light.  When I opened the door to let the dogs out, swarms of moths would fly into the house. I could not just turn the light off because it is dark as a cave and spooky back there.  I placed the zapper about 25 feet away per instructions.  This zapper lures the moths and zaps them.  I now keep my regular back-door light on, and the moths are not interested anymore.  They go directly to the zapper.  This excellent product has wide grid openings so the bugs can easily get in.  The numerous electric zappers inside are vertical so the dead bugs fall off easily.  A little bit of wind takes care of blowing the dead bugs out.  I am ordering another one for my front door area !!
I've tried a lot of things to get rid of the mosquitos but this bug zapper really seems to work best. I can even sit outside in the mornings without any bugs bothering me at all and that's saying a lot!

Yeah, if a stalk is very tough or very tall, it's hard to get with this.  When there are a few grass-weed type stalks that don't want to get cut, I just trim 'em with a clipper.

This went to work the first night and has not disappointed. Made much better than the older model Stinger brand we have. This takes small attractant packs that fit into the bottom of the unit to help lure insects. The attractant can be pricey, and this works well with or without it. Very happy with this purchase. I ended up ordering another larger zapper by Flowtron as well. I purchased this item at full cost.

8932	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use this in my barn where mice seem to invade.  I have found the secret to these is to use bird seed as an incentive, and to wash out the trap after every successful catch, so the workings do not become jammed.

1414	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purchased my 1865 traveling sprinkler in April of 2012.  I have used it twice in the front yard and twice in the back.  I am not completely satisfied with it, but consider it generally good at what it does and it still has novelty for me to watch it chugging around.  There was no issue with it arriving in good new condition and having a very easy set up.  The directions are minimal but it is quite obvious how it works.  I have a lot of 5/8 inch hose and it will dutifully follow the hose around my yard. When I have several lengths of hose and to help it out after a while, I pull it up more behind the unit to reduce the effort it has to snake the length of hose along.  I think about an 8 foot radius curve is the tightest it can turn in my situation (very tall grass) without coming off the hose track.

3261	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This B&D Hog Electric Edger gives excellent results, and it is very easy to opperate.  I'm retired now, and I've used several Gas and Electric edgers before.  It has proven to be an easy to use edger with excellent looking results on my Patio Home driveway and sidewalks with a 100' 16-2 Grounded cord. Get a roll-up for the cable. Works great for edging, and cutting in burried cables and making garden boarders.  When edging, try moving the edger forward about a foot or two, then pull it back, and then forward again about 2-3'. Repeat as you work. This gives smoother, sharper cut on the grass edge.  Mine was a refurb, and it's been an excellent buy. This has been the fifth refurb thru Amazon, and I wouldn't hesitate ever doing it again. I've had to return one item bought through Amazon for replacement, and that was an easy and excellent experience.

We live on five acres of wooded land with a creek that runs along two sides of the property. Thus we end up with a bunch of mosquitos.

6837	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We tried everything else to rid our lawn of moles.  Smoke bombs, repellant, poison worms are useless.  This works.  A big plus is you get to see the expired varmints and say a few words before disposing of them.  Moles have a very good sense of smell and this trap had a strong paint smell when I got it.  I ran it under some hot water and that seemed to work.  Use gloves and don't forget to unhook the safety bail like I did once (and everyone else).  There are a number of instruction videos on YouTube I found helpful

I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement.  The dehumidifier is about 10' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely.  It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight.
2693	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's great.  Rainbird had the marketfor many years until (apparently) their patent expired.  Then the cheap plastic imitators entered the market with their leaky junk.  We trashed a couple of them when we received and began to use this well-made (en Mexico) device.  It's made of metal and well-crafted. The only caveat is that this product does not include the spike to anchor it in the ground.  It appears it is meant to screw into an existing 1/2" pipe already installed in the ground.  Fortunately, we were able to adapt it to the spike from one of the cheap products we trashed and it works fine.  My advice is to pay a bit more and get this well-made device.
Update: 8/17. The bulb both burned out.  I replaced them both and now only one bulb works and it no longer zaps the bugs, too bad I spent the money in the bulbs.... I would not recommend this product.

The second most effective was the Trip-trap, but it suffers from a couple of serious shortcomings.  If you don't check it every couple of hours expect to find dead mice.  They seem to panic in these and even if found alive they are usually covered in urine, bait and appear really haggard.  The traps are so confining that the mice cant turn around.  Also, I often find this trap tripped with no mice caught.  If they brush against the legs of the door, which they often do in the dark, the trap can close with no mouse inside.  It helps to weight it so it doesnt trip so easily.

8627	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star.

Perfect conditions for strenuous yard work.  I worked an hour trying to get this wound around one of those "roller" things mounted on the wall.  Sweat was pouring down me.

Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.

If you had a million bugs in a 1 cubic acre area before you had the bug light, you will still have the same number after.

April 8, 2010 : Since this makes a good night light, left it on all winter. Have not turned it off since I first plugged it in. It just zapped one of those large, lanky, mosquito looking type bugs.

9478	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The main reason I needed a bug zapper was for an acute mosquito problem. My wife and I couldn't sit on the rear patio for more than 10 minutes without getting eaten alive. The problem occurred mostly around dusk. Purchased the Stinger Ultra from Lowe's. It did seem to help but the problem was still there, they were still biting. The unit was positioned about 25 feet away next to the pool. The Stinger with it's 40 watt single ultraviolet bulb was low intensity that seemed to attract mostly moths and other harmless insects. I did use the Octenol Mosquito Attractant which did not seem to attract them very much. What insects that were killed got clogged in the inner grid which was difficult to clean. After reading many favorable reviews on Amazon I ordered the Flowtron 80D. WOW what a difference. This unit contains two 40 watt high intensity very bright ultraviolet bulbs. After only 30 seconds from plugging it in all I heard was Zapp Zapp Zapp. It was killing mosquitoes along with every other insect within range. In comparison the Stinger Ultra was like a single shot revolver compared to the Flowtron which is like a MAC 10 sub-machine gun. If you have a mosquito problem this is your answer. Highly Recommended.

The packaging is good as the string is easy to get off of the spool but it doesn't come unwrapped by itself as others do. They even put a couple of small holes at the top of the spool that you can thread the bitter end through. This ensures it won't unwind and it's easy to find the end.

This little Smokey Joe does just fine, precisely what you expect from a Weber product, and I am a longtime Weber Fan.  I use it at home, but it fits easily into the trunk of my car if we are picnicking. Would certainly work for tailgating as well.  It is another, smaller, terrific Weber Product.  Can easily BBQ 6 burgers or 4-5 large chicken breasts, so it serves well for small parties or small families. Space constraints? This Smokey Joe will make you NOT miss the big Kettle as much.

It is not to heavy when full to hoId without needing a shoulder strap. I use it along with my new Hoover shampooer on the low-pile carpet, because the Hoover's water dispenser makes it too wet.  After regular vacuuming I turn the Chapin sprayer to a mist setting and use diluted carpet cleaning liquids to moisten sections of carpet.  After a few minutes I suction it up with the Hoover.  This way the carpet is dry in a few minutes instead of a few hours, and I can do the whole house in one day.

2834	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I first purchased a Ross Root feeder back in 2000 or so.  I still have my original purchase - and I am still using it.  Since I have a lot of trees in the yard, I purchased a second unit a few years ago and both my wife and I would take a set of trees and deep root feed them.  After the second unit broke, we purchased what we thought was an identical unit.  The name has changed with the new HD title, but the unit looked the same in the pictures.  Wrong.  This latest unit has very low water flow, so the fertilizer does not dissolve.  And I am always having to unclog the holes where the water comes out.  I just hate the changes that Ross has made to the design over the last 10 years.  I understand that materials change and costs must come down, but the usefulness of the end product should not be compromised and it has been compromised greatly.  Now, I am going to continue to use this one, but when it breaks, I will probably just buy another brand next time.
I have 50 psi water pressure - not great, and not bad. This will work perfectly for you if you are not trying to tunnel into Manhattans granite.

It holds the pressure without bursting, doesn't kink too badly, and slides across the grass easily.

I read on another review that the position of the stops matters and I've tried switching them so that the top stop is on one side and the bottom the other, and vice-versa, but that did not resolve the problem. I might try some light grease on the stem but if that doesn't resolve then I'm out $15.  I'm using this sprinkler on the Orbit sprinkler base (#58030) and there is plenty of water pressure.

Shortly after the previous update, I had the handle break at the bend. I was able to tape it so I could keep using the mower while I looked online for warranty info (I looked in the manual but found no help there). I looked on Scott's website, but no luck. I looked for hours. Then I called AMAZON and they helped me find the warranty info. The mower was not made BY Scott's but FOR Scott's. This means Scott's does not cover the warranty it is covered by American Mower Company; do a simple Google search for the company and you will be able to find the company's website (reelin dot com). This company was VERY helpful! They sent out all the parts to replace the whole handle, with no cost or hassle. They are very willing to help their customers. So easy to deal with. They are not open over the weekend, but I left a message Saturday; they called back Monday morning. If you have a problem with your mower contact this company and they will help.

2558	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this post hole auger based upon the reviews that I read on Amazon but I honestly had my doubts that I would be able to use it.  I am happy to say that my doubts were unfounded.  This thing works remarkably well.  I should mention that I'm a 61 year old female with wimpy upper body strength, so you don't need major biceps to use it.  It took a little while to get used to it and let the tool do most of the work.  But it's still work and I found that 2 holes a day were my max.  Like any manual post hole digger, it will not bore through big rocks, but smaller stones can usually be jiggled out by rotating the auger back and forth.  When that didn't work or when I hit a larger rock,  I used my narrow, long bladed transplanting shovel which was the perfect auxiliary tool.  A pry bar or some other long narrow tool would work as well, but my point is that unless your soil is totally stone free, you will probably need some other prying tool in addition to the auger.  The shovel also came in handy when the soil for some of the holes was fairly dry and trickled out of the auger before I could pull it out of the hole.  I used this auger to dig 2 foot deep post holes for a split rail fence.  It was the perfect size for these posts.  I am completely satisfied with this tool and can recommend it whole-heartedly.
The Solo 425 has the a very short pumping stroke and reaches a good pressure very quickly. There are a few spraying patterns that can be used which include an adjustable nozzle which adjusts from a fine spray to a stream. This is the type of nozzle that I use for spraying my apple trees. The other nozzles include a jet stream which reaches out a long way, a flat spray and a hollow cone spray. The changing from one nozzle to another is only hampered by the size of the parts. They are very small and could easily be lost. I considered giving the unit four stars rather than five for this reason and one other feature. This is being very critical.
The wires are stripped to much and touch each other, or loose wires.

The directions said it would take a while for the bait to activate but the results were almost immediate. The bait was pretty strong smelling. It was like a raw yeast smell. I was supposed to fill it 1/3 full of water and mix it up. I may have put too much water but it still worked wonderfully. I will put the 1/3 level in the quart size ones I ordered.

The Fiskars Pruning Shears are somewhat crude in appearance but they're ruggedly built and maintain a sharp cutting edge. I've put these shears to a lot of use and they've yet to be sharpened. Plus, the blades seem to be absolutely stiff and don't bend under forceful use. I can cut green limbs up to about 3/4" with these.  I'd say this is the best pruning shears I can remember using, certainly much better than the last two brands. I can't help notice "Made in U S A" stamped on one side of the tool.

1927	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the best hose I've ever owned.  Period.  After 10 years this thing is still going strong.  It's been outside during it's entire life.  Never stored inside even in winter.  It is relatively heavy but coils easily on my wall hanger.  No signs of giving up either.  I read where others had leaks at the fitting, etc.  They may have run over theirs or got a lemon.  But mine has outlasted every other hose in the neighborhood many times over.  I've even left it laying out in the yard with full pressure in it for months in the hot Texas summer heat without failure of any kind.  I'd buy this hose over and over again if I ever needed a new one.

4403	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This saved me a bunch of money on having my reel mower sharpened at a hardware store or golf course here in town.  They wanted at least $75, and I had to call a half-dozen places to even get that!  For $20 I got this kit which not only let me do it myself pretty easily (does take awhile, and the directions are moderately involved) but also gave me a tip on balancing the screws on my reel mower properly, which I found out they weren't.  I loved the hint about tearing a thin strip of newspaper and dangling it in the blades on BOTH sides of the mower, to see if they slice it right up cleanly.  If it doesn't even come close, it may not be the blades that need sharpening, it may be that the blade itself needs to be adjusted closer to the cutting surface!  All in all a brilliant do-it-yourself product that I'm glad I bought.

I don't know a lot about garden hoses, but I know that I wasted money buying really inexpensive ones that were nothing but a pain to  use with kinking and leaking issues.  I bought one very good quality hose a month or so go.. but realized that I had only solved half the problem so I decided to try Gilmour  to resolve the  extra footage that I needed,after reading the reviews on it

No movement from inside, but it felt a bit heavier than it should have if empty, so I steeled myself for the possibility of finding a starved-to-death mouse carcass inside...or having a live mouse jump out at me...okay, actually I had my son open the trap, well away from the house...apparently the mouse was alive and well, and is now living somewhere else.  Happy ending.

1145	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical at first, but after reading reviews and wanting to try something different... this was a good and cheap investment. For years, I have been using and constantly buying 2gallon sprayers, in which only lasts 1 season because the wands always either cracks or leaks. Sometimes its hard to measure out correct amount of formula.. Can't believe I have been wasting all these years, now I stumbled on such a simple & convenient  gadget as the glimour nozzle sprayer. I have used this so far 2 times, for killing weeds & grass from asphalt driveway &  rocked driveway. Very easy setup, pouring the correct amount in ounces & setting dial to 10. Works out great so far, very fast & easy spray results than using pumped sprayers. In my opinion this also sprays evenly.
It started leaking between the gun/handle and bottle. The black plastic part that connects the handle to the bottle gets lose if the handle is not perpendicular because the weight of the liquid in the bottle makes it unscrew from the handle.

This is a powerful trap that works fast.  The cocking process may require more coordination and strength than some folks can provide. However, once the trap is armed, and the berm under the trigger is at the right height, you are virtually guaranteed to get your critter from either direction as it pushes dirt to close the hole.  I use a post-hole digger to dig a clean right-sized hole, then cover everything with an inverted plastic bucket.  Just follow the directions on the box.

It gives specifications on what to use in the instructions, but I also want to mention that I used a 40 ft. Lawn & Garden Cord, 16/3 Medium Duty in case anyone was wondering.

SUCCESS... I cut a piece of wood that would be square and fit perfectly beneath a milk crate. I screwed each rat trap down to the wood... placing the screw between the rat's eyes on the graphic print.

7416	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have had a mole problem for years and have tried all the suggested solutions including castor beans. I also used the traps that have the blades that stab into the ground - thumbs down! After researching this I decided to try the Victor 0631 Out of Sight Trap. After setting the trap, I was on a ladder the next day cleaning windows on my house when I heard the trap go off. It went off with such force that it knocked over the flower pot that I had over it. And yes I got the mole. A few things to realize here. One, you need to be fairly strong to set it - it's not that easy. Two, preparing the tunnel site for placement of the trap is of paramount importance. If it's not prepared properly. it will not work. There are a lot of You Tube demos showing how to do this. Three, the mole will likely still be alive when you pull the trap out of the ground so be prepared to administer a blow of mercy. Fourth and final, I wondered how many moles I had and how long it would take to get them all. My experience seems to indicate that the mole has a fairly large territory so it's likely you may only have one as I did. I have about an acre of land on my property. If you have a mole problem this is the trap for you.

I had enough, my grandparents used to have a bug zapper when I was a kid. I always thought it was fascinating. Anyway, this has drastically cut down the bug population, we still have a few here and there, which is good. I'm sure some bugs serve a useful purpose, but an overwhelming amount is just unbearable. It comes with a mosquito bait, I did see some mosquites dead after getting this, but since then we haven't had mosquitoes. I'm sure the bait has lost its potency at this point so I cant say for sure if this made a big difference or if the season passed for mosquitoes. Anyway, we don't have a mosquito problem now, so well see next year if they come back and if this will work for them, But the other bugs were the real issue, and this fixed it!

The zapping noise isn't too loud at all, which was something we had feared as a neighbor down the street had one and it would keep us up at night (his sounded like a Star Wars lightsaber, and another neighbor had to call the police on him to get him to turn it off). The Flowtron unit is just loud enough that you can hear it working (the sound is actually enjoyable) but not enough where it's going to annoy neighbors of have anyone losing sleep. In fact it's so quiet, it makes me wish I had sprung for the larger Flowtron model, I think it's the Flowtron 80D. I know the one I have is 1 acre coverage, but I'd have got the 2 acre coverage one.

2256	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works fine to fill water balloons, which is what I wanted it for.  Quality is good and it's inexpensive so five stars.  Most people want this for its "jet" and it's fine for that too.  For filling water balloons though, I prefer the Nelson Brass Sweeper Nozzle 50161 on the end of a Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red.  The lip on the Nelson nozzle helps hold the balloon and the spring loaded handle on the nozzle makes it easier to control the water flow.  The second system is a tad more convenient, but at more than twice the cost.
3. Don't put too much dishwashing liquid in the handlebars (for facilitating the putting together) or it will drip out and then discolor the handles.
I think most of the positives reviews about the Perky-Pet revolve around that it is very effective in attracting hummingbirds, but there are other feeders that attract hummers just as well, that are easier to hang and even more importantly, easier to clean.

We put it up in February and it is still up (it is July).  We have had a raccoon climb over it and not rip it.  We have had our cats run into it and not rip it.  We have also had our chickens run and fly into it and not rip it.  Those other people who gave this crappy reviews are wrong or they strung it too tight.

A wonderful tip - I clean it out with my leafblower...it takes literally 2 seconds. Piece of cake! Not sure why I didn't figure this out sooner. The Stinger is a pain to clean out. Sure it's got the bug catching tray but the mess that's left in the metal grid is grueling to clean. The FlowTron doesn't have the bug catching tray - the bugs just fall to the ground (or become flying projectiles upon zapping!).

594	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The quality is fine although it is not as thick as two other heavy duty hoses I have. This means it is a little more susceptible to kink - though not bad. It may also be less durable but I have no evidence of that yet. It is fairly thick though and the fittings on each end seem to be well made and solid. Would've preferred a green or blue color but I guesd dull gray is acceptable. (Why gray???) Anyway, it's a good quality hose. All in all, it's a good solid hose. If it would've ben just as thick as my other heavy duty hoses, I would've rated it a 5.


1066	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Got a long and somewhat narrow yard so watering was challenging.  Struggled to get the entire yard watered without moving an ordinary sprinkler.  This is awesome!!  Runs the hose down the yard and shuts off.  No fuss and gets the entire yard.  This thing can even turn corners.  I thought it was broken at first but it just moves really slowly even on the fast speed.  Really like how you can change how far and wide the water goes by adjusting the silver spray ends.  This can even move through thick uncut grass.
I usually can shake the cans and determine how much gas is left, but it is disappointing to start the grill and go to prep the meat and return to put it on the grill only to find it stone cold because the gas ran out while it was warming up. Or worse, get your plate to go get the meal off the grill and find it laying there luke warm and half cooked for the same reason.

Every now and then, I offer to cook dinner in the oven, but he says NO! and states that he'd much rather cook out on the grill.

I have been reading dozens of sites on the care and feeding of hummingbirds ... they all advise against adding red dye to the nectar (which can easily be made fresh by mixing sugar and water).  Here is what the Audubon Society says: "No, red coloring is not necessary and the reddening chemicals could prove to be harmful to the birds.  Natural nectar itself is a clear solution." Don't buy this junk food! If you care for these little flying jewels, you'll provide what's healthy for them and not give them anything that could harm them.

First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.

SIMPLE vs COMPOUND, GEARED, or RACHET:  Geared, compound, and rachet designs give you more leverage, but that usually is not desirable in pruning shearsbut either requiring you to open the shears wider, or squeeze them multiple times to cut through a stem.

No way I'm going to pay to send this back, but I won't be using it, just like I don't use the other, because it leaks. See, it has a wide mouth and is SO easy to clean, the flower portion lifts off SO easily and you can scrub it's innards to your heart's content!! But, because it's not a tight seal a bead of sweet liquid rims the base and the bees love it, swarms of them will hang on it and drink their fill all day while the hummers go to the older, harder to clean versions. I've had the old versions for decades, they are a pain to clean, but 2 different size bottle brushes and lots of hot, soapy water accomplishes that. From now on I'm buying from Walmart, where I can see that I'm actually getting what I'm being told I'm getting!

This grill is made properly, and has been coated well with baked-on enamel paint; should offer you years of use. I would recommend you spend the extra $10 and get the "Smokey Joe Gold", over the "silver" model, simply because it comes with a chrome metal curved rod attachment that serves to lock the lid in place so you're able to cary the WHOLE GRILL around, by the handle. This feature also helps while in transit, or when being stowed, which can prevent used ashes from being spilled. Also, this feature creates a place to rest the lid, when being used. This is a great value, (my opinion). This thing is extremely easy to assemble! With only a screw-driver, you'll be ready to fire-it-up in only a couple of minutes.

Fescue, weeds, clover...real clover not the tiny kind but the big stuff...it's more difficult but can be done with determination and persistence. My yard is large. The walkable part is an acre plus with two acres left to bush-hog by tractor twice a year.  I bought this for fun, not seriously, as I just moved in and the yard was a field being converted to grass, and I hired a guy to cut this first summer.  He's not prompt for twice a month, and I'm a smartass so I wanted to show him I work faster with a reel mower than he does on a riding mower twice a month.  I'm spending an hour or two a day in the evening.  I have to say this does a good job.  The only things I can fault are the rubber grips which split in the first hour.  I bought duck tape to wrap them.  And a piece called the e-clip which the directions are not clear how to apply.  The directions show the item and a line to where they go and that's it.

I mean, how do you get to be well-known if your product doesn't work?  Neither of them were sharp, and the blades of these little pruners ...

5053	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This is basically the same thing as the netting you can buy to keep birds off your garden. The filament measures 0.006 inches. I found it impossible to attach it to an existing flat fence. No matter how many staples I put in, the netting would rip out. Perhaps if you wrap it several times around a post, you will get enough friction to anchor it firmly. In any event, while you are working with it don't let it sag and touch any debris on the ground, or you will have a lot of work getting it untangled.

6788	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These were the first mole traps I ever used, but I have heard so many bad things about the older spike on top style so I ended up trying these.  It took a little trial and error to figure out the placement and stepping down on the tunnels in just the right spots, but after that these things paid off very quickly.  Set the trap, dead mole the next day, repeat.  Once I even caught a mole within 5 minutes of placement.  It seems these killed quickly - the jaws snap with a huge amount of force.
Well pleased - perfect operation first time it cycled.  The master valve control is a plus I'll enable, and for some users so will be the pump control.  I'm not much pleased with the cost, but its obvious superiority will undoubtedly soften my objection.  I'm not easily impressed, but this unit has certainly done that.

Although not specified, the keyway notch should be 3/16" wide with a 3/32" depth. The tolerance for the keyway notch should be +.0020, -.0000 width and +.016, -.000 in depth. The pulley I received had a keyway notch that measured 5/128" too small and the key would not fit. Rather than waiting another week for a replacement, I ended up filing the notch bigger to fit.

Set your bolts up in groups of size and length before starting. This one was fully unassembled, and may also come as "partially assembled" which would make your day easier.  This is the second one I bought, and now has a horizontal bar on back to support on the ground rather than two feet on the model from three years ago.  That one  runs well still.

The additional solids present (i.e. algae, sand, debris, grit), as well as the inconsistent pressures seem to play havoc with most of the impact sprinklers I have tried.  Many store brand sprinklers will not even oscillate right out of the box, as they often hit the first stop and stop, literally.  I finally found the Orbit 56667N Tripod Base Impact Sprinkler on Amazon, which worked at the required pressures; but then it stopped oscillating after the first season.  I ordered this Rainbird (with  inch male fitting) to replace the Orbit head on the tripod, and the difference is staggering.  The Rainbird is by far the highest quality sprinkler head I have tried yet.  I have used specialty Rainbird heads in industrial applications, so I knew they were a well-made product.  Rainbird doesnt make many sprinklers that aren't for use in irrigation systems, which is why I didn't go with Rainbird from the beginning.  I am glad I found this replacement head, and I will be making another base connection, so that I can order an additional Rainbird head for use at my second spigot feed.

The cooking grate is almost level with the lip of the grill; I prefer that over the sunken grate on the bigger Webers. The cooking grate is very close to the charcoal grate, so will want to make sure that you only have one layer of briquettes (that's about half a chimney). Or, use leftover charcoal (try killing the fire by burying it in saved ashes). Less charcoal means less cost, smaller carbon footprint. It doesn't take up much space, and the cooking grate fits in a sink for cleaning. Cooked four large boneless/skinless chicken breasts last night; it could probably fit six. If you have to use the lid, you probably need more and/or better lit charcoal.

Cleanliness is important when feeding hummers and yet because of the bottle's very small filler hole, (5/8") it is impossible to get a bottle brush inside the bottle to scrub it. Filling the bottle with a cleaning solution and shaking it vigorously is the only way to clean it. Filling the bottle up first with a cleaner and then several rinses can be very tedious because of that small filler hole. And the base doesn't disassemble for cleaning, You can't see and clean the black stuff growing in all the tiny nooks and crevices.

I have had the 22-1/2 Gold kettle for probably 8 or 10 years. I cook on it at least 2 to 3 times a week year round. Sometimes even 6 out of 7 days depending on the season. I really do enjoy cooking outside and I enjoy cooking and smoking on my Weber. However, as time went on the ring that holds the ash can kept falling out of the little "legs" that stick out of the kettle. The falling air vent caused the ash can to fall because the ash can is connected to the air vent. Needless to say it got on my last nerve and decided to fix the problem.
The range of adjustability of blade height is also quite nice.  You have three holes in the mower, to raise or lower the cutting height, and three other positions in the plastic fitting to raise or lower the cutting height for a good incremental range of height.  You must use a wrench to unscrew the nut to position the bolt in the correct spot.  It is not a quick lever adjustment like on many power mowers.  But this thing costs less that 100 dollars.  Despite this lack of quick adjustment, it's still a fabulous mower, and a great value that provides a great result.

You need to dig out a trench on the starting side as long as your pipe. Turn on the water and then push in and out gently as it bores forward. Don't pull out too far or the debris might collapse (just an inch or two at most).

But this is so well made, so easy to clean, that I'm thrilled each time I get a chance to use it, just like my Makita drill.  I love the nozzle rack that doubles as a wand mount.  Mine came with two fan nozzles, and they both sprayed very consistently but too wide for my purposes.  So I got their 0.5 GPM fine spray nozzle that isn't really a mist but is a nice 20 cone.  The all brass wand on this sprayer is the only somewhat weak link.  It's easy to bend it if the sprayer falls on it for example.  Not a big deal at all, just sayin' you might want to avoid that.  One person who reviewed this sprayer here I believe warned people how the lubrication inside the pump was not suitable for use on plants.  I'm not convinced by his argument because the manufacturer's package specifically states that the sprayer is designed for and intended to be used in Agriculture among other things.

It could, of course be better and easier if it were battery powered, however I'm sure it wouldn't last longer.

It is different from a gas mower so don't expect the same characteristics. Anything taller than the blades (like weeds) will be pushed over. This should encourage you to get rid of those weeds :-) You must stay on top of your yard cutting at least once a week. Once again, this will encourage you to maintain a healthy lawn, which will get rid of the afore mention weeds. Probably the roughest area to mow is by the landscaping where mulch gets into the grass as the mulch with 'stop' the mower. A 5 minute pre-rake in that area takes care of that problem, and the mulch gets back into the bed where it belongs instead of being slung around the yard from a rotary mower. If you have uneven spots in the yard, you will notice it in the cut. So just take some compost and fill in those low spots. Your lawn with thank you for it.

Within a couple of days the hummingbirds found it and must have invited all their friends. It's super easy to make up the solution for them and it feeds them for about five days. Mix 1 cup of sugar with 4 cups of water (1:4) in a saucepan and boil for two minutes to kill bacteria in water. Food coloring is not recommended or necessary, the red feeder attracts the birds. Change solution if it becomes cloudy, as this could make the birds sick. There are easy tips online for cleaning it using water and uncooked rice.

It's 4 in the afternoon on a rainy day here in rural tampa. It just arrived. Been about 15 mins since I plugged it in and no zaps yet. The bugs aren't out right now though and it's day light but come dusk that thing will hopefully be lit up like the 4th of July. Putting 5 stars up for now will update by Sunday if anything changes.  Theres a few flies here and there right now but no zaps. Dead flies would of been a bonus but maybe bc it's day time? Or bc its rainy and not even half the ammount of flies as usual? Flies are a minor concern anyway. I need the skitos obliverated. Can't wait for tonight. They will be out full force after this rainy Wednesday.
No setting required, you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving, under stairs, in the floor of the pantry, etc. and just let them sit until successful.

Solo used to be a sound product years ago, but the plastic "clamp on" strap fixtures at the bottom and the astoundingly cheap plastic pins at the top are something Solo should be ashamed of. I cannot believe the crap that sells for $80. If you want to buy a good sprayer, perhaps Google search RelaxPack. Costs lots more, but at least the reservoir will remain attached to you and even be semi-comfortable.

I took this picture a moment before they realized they were free to escape into the wild.  I'm glad they're out of my house, but still alive and well to fulfill their rodent destinies.
3335	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It was not sharp right out of the package. The blade was coated in plastic so I had to sharpen the blades. Other than that it was a great replacement for my MTD mower's Oregon blade.
5284	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this mower for a month now, and it's been working great. I wish I discovered it years ago, it's so much more fun and enjoyable compared to gas push mowers. As long as the blade is set at the right level, there's no problems and it cuts well. (Rotary mowers cut a bit better, but if you're not a perfectionist, this works fine). Or you can go back over some areas twice - which is only necessary if the grass is really thick. I've sold my gas mower now, no need for it with this reel mower and an electric corded rotary mower for really tall grass.
While this unit is a little more pricey than some, the extra few bucks are well worth it.  The gold ring at the top (used to hang the unit) is sort of poorly designed, but it's easy to replace with a little work if you want (mine had a big gap in it - almost enough to allow the ring to come off the mounting point, which I didn't like.  However, this may actually be there to help taking the unit on and off a hook or something).  In my case, I simply cut the ring off with some bolt cutters and put a smaller stainless steel split ring in its place.  Most people probably wouldn't mind the standard gold ring that comes with the unit, but I am very picky :-)

2858	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I looked for a root feeder for several weeks and this one that I bought on Amazon is the best!  Both in structure and price.  Easy to use and has saved my trees during the horrible drought we are having in Texas.  It is sturdy and well made and I believe it will last for a long time.  BUT I was wrong!  It soon developed leaks and now it spurts from just about everywhere when I use it.  Very disappointed with that it did NOT hold up well.

So today I purchased The Scotts 200-20 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Mower and whipped through our front and back yard in less than an hour. My husband had put grass seed and weed-n-feed down a while back and we had to wait 3 weeks before we could mow, per the instructions. Add to that a very wet April and I had my work cut out for me.

7703	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We purchased this back in April since summer starts early here in Florida. We really wanted some protection from all the bugs at night when we sit on our patio. This zapper really works. It's been over 3 months since we got it and it is still is working wonderfully. We have had no issues with it at all and we run it nearly every night. We have it hanging several feet away from our sitting area and it keeps the bugs away. I know we had an issue with our outdoor power outlet about a week go and had to get it fixed, so we had to go a couple days without our zapper. We were getting attacked by bugs constantly. This is such a great asset to us. Makes a huge difference. Love it.
Just turn the dial to the station/zone you wish to program and set the start time, duration and then each individual day of the week you want to set. Push the Monday button and the green light comes on telling you it will water on Monday, and so on with each zone and day. If you want to manually water press "Water All Now" or "Water 1 Zone Now".
We moved into our first home with a yard last winter and I was unexcited about having to buy and store gas for a mower.  I found this reel mower on Amazon on sale for $99 -- such a great purchase.  I'm 5'4", my husband's 5'11", and we both find it easy to manuever both while mowing and while carting it from front lawn to back.  I find that mowing in neat rows doesn't work very efficiently for me, so I tend to attack the lawn from all different angles.  My husband mows in straight lines.  We're both happy with the results.  I love the height adjusting feature.  And it's a stylish, elegant little thing that stores well in the garage.
7310	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good price for a good chain

I see lots of complaints about the reel getting jammed on sticks. Sticks do jam the reel, but I found that the jam is pretty easily cleared by using your foot to tap the reel back towards you (just step on a blade and push it down), or if that doesn't work, rocking the mower forward a little (sort of walking it, one wheel, then the next) does the trick. I've only had to actually bend down and pull out a stick a few times.
2321	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works very well...holds pressure for weeks

3752	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had been paying 9.99 for terra cotta rolled rim 16 inch planters and 13.99 for the 20 inch planters at Home Depot. Lowes was three dollars more on each one. This year they both decided to carry planters without the rolled rims at the same price as last year. I have a lot of planters because they let me plant while I am sitting down so I wanted all of the planters to be of the same design. Amazon and particularly Tool King have been very reasonably priced on the rolled rim planters and shipping until quite recently. 25 dollars is way to expensive for what these planters are One vendor called EplexMall had six of them listed for a certain price and it turned out to be just for one. Be very careful as I just called one vendor selling a six pack on Amazon for a fair price and it turned out it was for one planter. I don't think these things are a mistake. Tool king and Amazon have never disappointed me and always ship what I order.
I highly recommend cleaning this grill after a few uses.  Just use your common sense and observations skills to determine when it needs cleaning. I usually clean mine once a  month with a wire brush and brillo pad combo tool I got From Williams Sonoma. It also Also comes with replaceable heads and works awesome. I also use wet paper towels and dry it when im done.  Done just clean the grates, clean the ENTIRE grill.  This thing is expensive and you should make it last as long as possible.  This is an excellent grill that will cook you awesome food and will last a lifetime with proper care.  I also recomend the grill cover and the chimney stater from Weber.  This is the system I use and it is unbeatable.

I bought a 10 year old American Mower last night locally. I wanted a Great States Mower #815-18 18" from Amazon (still the best new retail price I've found for that brand) but this deal was too good to pass up at $45. Owner bought it and used it a couple of times before putting it away for a decade. Was one of the 'Made in the USA' versions. Tires for example are basically new so I know it did not get used too many times. The interesting thing is that mine is an American Lawn Mower Company 18-Inch Reel Mower #1815-18 and it is exactly like my buddy's Great States #815-18 18" Deluxe Reel Mower. I mean they even have the same wheels. I am wondering if the companies are the one and the same...

With four lines as long as they can go the sound it made when I ripped it brought out the Tim Taylor in me. It sounded like it could really tear stuff up.  The orginal head has two lines and this four, I noticed that with all those lines it labored the motor.  As the lines get smaller of course it's not as noticeable.  It's not really an issue but I make the lines a littlle shorter just to make it easier on the motor.  The line is easy to switch out if you need it, no trouble there.  I hope that the the plastic holds up and the little pieces that you push the line through.

First one I ordered burnt out after about 2 months, Amazon replaced without issue. I was so happy that they replaced the item without any fuss.

Large capacity of 30oz means it will take a while to drain while its leaking. No joke. We used this last season (2014) and could not figure out why it was always empty.

7550	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This trap does the job, but nearly as well as others I have.  THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it.  Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job.  Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung.  You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically.  I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are.

My current feeder only holds 1 cup, so I use a glass 1 cup measure, add 3 Tablespoons powder, and add water to the 1 cup line = easy peasy! The amounts are on the back of the package.

Long story short it works well but I have to ask if all of those bugs were really mosquitos.  I saw lots of others in there in addition. We used the bait but who knows what flew in there.  I suppose it worked since when we were outside we didn't get bites like before.  So if you don't mind killing everything with wings then you found your killer.

The downsides:
1915	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like the unlock idea on this you can use one hand to open it and use or to close.
Please see my Amazon review titled "READ THIS FIRST" for Perky Pet's "23T Bird Feeder Foam Cleaning Mop." That review answers the many Amazon reviews that pan Perky Pet's 209 "Our Best" feeder for having a base that does not disassemble for cleaning. Perky Pet's '23T' brush makes cleaning the base easy via access through the three slots at the top of the base. Also, some reviewers here seem to think nectar must be changed almost daily, and the feeders sterilized between each use. This is sheer nonsense! Nectar will last two weeks in glass feeders without going 'sour,' even if the feeder hangs in the sun. And BTW, hummers will not drink 'sour' nectar any more than humans will drink sour milk. I recommend replacing nectar, and washing and rinsing this feeder with PP's '23T' brush, every two weeks. Washing more thoroughly with warm, soapy water two or three times a season is easily sufficient. In almost 40 years of feeding hummingbirds with this feeder, and cleaning it with this brush, I cannot remember ever seeing a sickly or dead bird.

Its "traveling" feature means that once set in place and with the hose set out in the middle of the track you want watered, it will move on its own. You don't have to run out to repeatedly move the sprinkler. And the little ramp that comes with it cane be set where you want the sprinkling to end, since the sprinkler shuts off on its own when it reaches this point.

After a year one of the 2 bulbs went out. I just ordered 2 replacement bulbs. FYI: I've read that if the new bulb doesn't work that it may be the starter which I hope is replaceable. Time will tell. A side note: These bulbs do not seem to be the intense electric blue I'm accustomed to. They are a lighter blue. There is some difference in color temperature. I'm not sure if these bulbs are less effective since I don't have an older one to compare it with.
I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.
6742	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I live next to a cypress swamp.  I have 3 of these positioned around the house.  They are a must have.  There is a lack of choice for acre+ bug zappers and I've been using Flowtrons for 3 years. Put simply, they do not last.  The fifth burned out today.  I'll be ordering my sixth of these in 3 years.  Three have burned out so far both BK-40s and BK80Ds.  Most die less than 1 year. The bulbs last longer!  I have 3 spare bulbs in a drawer now.  I've called the company numerous times on several failures.  They said they'd email me an RMA number which I never received.  They do not return calls.  So, Flowtron, how about instead of scr#wing customers you get a hold of our cheap Chinese suppliers and demand: thicker, more reliable PCB boards; more reliable neon ballasts; more reliable coils, etc. etc. etc.  They've all burned out in the 5 models I've gone thru.  But the manufacturer knows the quality is poor otherwise they would honor the warranty.

IT LOOKS GREAT IN THE ROSE GARDEN
Made in Indiana and should last forever.  I suggest applying a couple drops of oil to the wheel hubs every year.  Maintenance wise, other than keeping the hopper and seed plates clean, thats about it.

This stuff works really well. It's much sturdier than I would have guessed and we were able to wrap the entire pen with it to give it an extra barrier against snakes and other predators. I would not recommend it on it's own as a 'fencing' because it wouldn't hold up against dogs and raccoons, but it will keep out snakes and probably birds.
3039	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This tool does not have the cutting power to do the job.  It is a good tool to trim the grass edges, or thin plant leaves.  But it absolutely will not cut dead flower stems.  I regret having invested in this product.  I will purchase a larger corded model.

Must say that the steel handles have scrapes that look as if done in manufacturing.  These were also packaged on a blister pack, like you'd see at the Dollar Store.

Just keep out of reach from kids, or it will do some major damage. Be sure to buy at least 3 or 4 of these, as my trick to catching moles, was having enough to keep setting in new activity areas.

2859	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a four star item.  Great seller.  Fast delivery.  I highly recommend this root feeder.  I have a number of them and this is the way to go to water trees.  Plastic lasts only so many years so I always want to have extra root feeders on hand and this seller is great.  The trees really do "perk up" when the water reaches their roots and this is the best way to get water really far down to them.  But, be sure that you plug up the holes the root feeder created.  This can be done as you take the root feeder out of the ground.  Don't leave the holes there because the ground will dry out too fast.  It's easy to plug up the holes with the tip of the root feeder.  After you take the feeder out of the ground, just cut off the water supply with the on/off lever on the handle and plug the hole with the tip of feeder.  It's easy to do.
Most chains are designed to cut a 0.025" thick chip as they pass through the wood.  After repeated sharpenings, the depth of cut is reduced.  As the depth of cut setting reaches zero, the chain won't cut no matter how sharp the cutters are.  This tool makes it easy to reset the depth of cut.
EASY to roll (I have .40 acre lot with hills, slopes and flat areas), easy to fill and adjust, etc.  LARGE bucket = less refills means less work with a very large yard.

8347	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I needed a replacement for the short hose that runs from the faucet to my hose reel. This filled the bill, and it's about three times as long as the old connector hose, which allows me to store the reel out of the way.
2.  For every 1 foot the sprinkler moves forward, it add 6 inches of water-filled hose to pull behind it (cause it's a loop that keeps getting larger).  Thus after a long stretch, the hose it's pulling gets heavier and heavier, with more drag against the ground.  This increases the issue mentioned above with getting stuck and spinning out.  So in theory, you could set it to run 100 feet and forget it, but in reality you need to check it.  Mine goes about 50 feet before I have to reposition the hose to prevent it from stalling out.
Highly recommended if you enjoy fly free outdoor living
469	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent for the price!
7914	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this exclusively for home use. It's just the two of us so it's just simpler and more effecient to use this small grill rather than fill a large one. Also, since it's small, the charcoal is very close to the meat making it easier to char the outside of the meat without fully cooking the inside. It's great for burgers and steaks when you want a nice char on the outside but med/rare on the inside. With chicken, I use less charcoal and put it off to the side once I get the desired char.
252	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A very good seeder. It is best to have the soil well rototilled, dry and free of clumps. If the dirt sticks to the ground opener, it's too wet.
I do not hate this product, but it is not made to last. Says Made in USA, but not labeled USA Origin on label. Seems like a cheap imported product - made to wear out asap so that you can buy another one for cheap. Maybe the hose was made in China and the ends were put on in the U.S.A.?
9792	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	One of the few genuine brass hose splicers I have found.  Often, they are actually made of (cheaper) aluminum, with a brass-colored coating of some sort.  The barbs are cut cleanly and burr-free, and there is a shoulder in the center, so that it goes into each hose at an equal depth.  To top it off, the included hose clamps are well made, and appear to be all stainless steel, instead of a stainless band, with a coated worm screw, which will rust over time.
Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.
9276	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We live in Tidewater Virginia, and the mosquitoes last year were terrible although the city sprayed.  The back yard was nearly unusable, and they were so numerous that many made it into the house as well.  The Flowtron unit was so effective that it was actually funny.  The first few nights, it popped nearly nonstop.  When the activity slowed, I moved it to the opposite corner of the house with a different field of view, and the nonstop popping resumed.  We still had a few mosquitoes, of course, but we weren't guaranteed a bite if we were outside for 20 minutes.  I should add here that I think the bait helped a lot, enough that I plan to continue using it even if there is a little expense involved. If you've ever been hounded by mosquitoes, you'll understand my glee when I noticed a fine, grey filament dust on a rock at the base of the unit--dead mosquitoes.  Also, this is just anecdotal, but it seemed to do an especially good job on Asian Tiger mosquitoes, the ones that raise such big itchy welts.  They disappeared after I bought this.  I know that some sources say these units don't work, but it helped us.

If you are a real tightwad like me,scour the deal sites and find a refurb for less than half price. They are available from time to time. Identical 2 year warranty on refurbs. I and many others paid $39.99 for our refurbs.
First, let me state that my lawn is well over an acre and I use a riding mower. However, there are a number of areas that are a bit too tight for the tractor and I needed something that could get in and clip the grass (I hate using the weed wacker). This little guy works like a champ. It eats through the crabgrass, dandelions and weeds and trimmed down the grass very nicely. In fact, it was so fun to use that I ended up mowing far more than I needed to with it. There is something really fun and satisfying about using a reel mower.

2054	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for camping, and man....do I like it for the most part. I filed it immediately just in case, and it was sharp as hell. I was worried it wouldn't split semi-seasoned hard wood, but it went right through it for the most part. It did occassionally get stuck, which was annoying, and I had to pound on it with a hammer to get it out. Which brings up a point: it had visible damage from the hammering, nothing major, but the hammer was fine, which makes me think the axe steel isn't as strong as the metal in my hammer, or the weaker metal would have been the one getting damaged. Still, it held up very well and I'm not 100% I should have been pounding on the axe like that anyway. If the head was wider, or more angled, perhaps it wouldn't have gotten stuck that bad anyway. I'm not an axe expert though, but just from a layman's point, it cut through a 2-3" diameter live tree like butter.  It held up very well, and for a lighter axe, it cuts firewood that is semi-split with ease. It's also excellent for making smaller kindling.

On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.

I haven't bothered to check where this product was manufactured, but it does not matter, it is badly  overpriced and poorly built, with absolutely no QC whatsoever.  I have read in another critical review that this product is made in the USA.  That may be the case, or it may be that it was merely assembled here in order to get that label on it.  Either way, it is not the USA quality that I grew up with and still enjoy on some of my personal belongings.  I will be talking to my wife and mother in law about sending this one back.  Maybe they will go ahead and bite the bullet and get a Lesco.  What I have seen in those appears to be high end, but of course, with a high end price tag.  I, notably, am NOT a John Deere fan, not after having owned one of their discontinued walk behind mowers, and I do  know that Lesco is somewhat affiliated with John Deere, at least in our area they are one in the same store, so I am not a happy camper either way this one spins.
7811	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is my first charcoal grill and I must say I LOVE it. My current living conditions doesn't allow for such space for a full size charcoal grill, this little beauty is just perfect.  It has a large enough space that I can cook meats such as chicken, ribs, sausages, burgers, you name it this baby handled it.  Yet small enough that I can store it just about anyplace.  Its easy to clean and light enough to move anywhere.  Great purchase for my situation.
4414	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Nice replacement on my saw.  The only drawback (which isn't a bad thing), only my Oregon chains fit the groove on the bar.  No big deal since the brand has the best chains for home use.  If you're looking for a good replacement for a worn or damaged bar, I'd recommend this.

9767	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I really think that these are the best quality made drip irrigation Manifolds'. I have purchased 10 of these at Lowe's for $7.99 a piece. I recently have found that they are also sold at The Do-it-center in Simi Valley California for $6.99 each. I have also used the Rainbird and DIG systems and found that I do not like them nearly as much. The main thing that I like about these Orbits are that the green arms can be adjusted and moved, but mainly the design and performance. I hook these up to 1/2 inch barbed tees which essentially makes it a 16 outlet system. I then attach either a 1/2 gph, 1gph, 2gph dripper depending on what I am watering and I am done. I successfully water 16 garlic plants with a single manifold. I also water 8 tomato plants with a single manifold with each tomato receiving 2 drippers 1gph, for a total of sixteen. I have also used the Orbit 67025 Quad Full-Flow Manifold and found them useful for watering my Apple, Apricot,peach, and citrus trees.  These are a must for my vegetable garden because they do not get the leaves or plant wet, only the soil and roots, which helps to prevent disease and mold. These things have literally changed my life. I LOVE GARDENING.
5672	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I buy these chains at my local hardware store for about the same price as Amazon charges. They work perfectly for my Husqvarna chain saw.

When it's off there is no dripping and when it's on the spray pattern is consistent and repeatable.  I have ordered a couple more to replace my other nozzles.

9719	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Before we got thru the first season with this product, it was leaking water from the inner connection.  We've tried uncoiling the hose to it's fullest extent so we could make adjustments to the leaking connection, but to no avail.  We just could not stop the water from pouring out of that connection, no matter what we tried to do.  What a waste of water!  We're looking for a replacement product, or a less leaky way to store the hose itself.
If it had dug in, I'm not sure how I would have gotten the dirt out.  It looks like the dirt would fall out of the sides and bottom.
2567	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The best feature of this bottle, in addition to the adequate capacity, is the intake nozzle at the end of the intake tubing.  It has a fitting that prevents any solution impurities from entering and fouling the spray head, the problem that damaged the previous bottle I had.
2698	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Used these for years and years... unfortunately they are hard to find attached to a sprinkler base or sled anymore.  So we buy sprinklers with sleds, toss the head that came with it and attach these rain birds.  (reason is that most heads sold with sleds and bases do not work very long!).  Can't do without our rainbirds!  (and the Amazon price is really good!)

5056	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So I got this item delivered on time.  It was assembled for the most part.  I just had to put together the handle part.  I went over the grass and it was a breeze to mow it.  The notion of hauling around a bulky outdated gas powered monster just to mow lawn always bothered me, so I never considered buying one.  This little guy puts those to shame as it is easy to use and mows beautifully.  I'm happy with this purchase, and am looking forward to mowing my lawn again and again.
9145	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My bugs are very fond of this zapper, and their carcasses are easily removed by poking a screwdriver inside the screen.
7441	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Whatever the specs say, this unit DOES have a standard mini propane connector so you can use a Coleman-type 1-LB cannister OR an adapter hose to connect to a  standard tank.  And the grill cooks GREAT!  It sears the meat without over cooking and easily burns off the residue after you're done.  I woulda gave it a 4 but I added 1 for this - it COOLS off in 15 minutes after killing the gas so you can put it way quick.  For that I gave it a FIVE!
4946	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	good

3252	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purchased one of these about 8 years ago and it's been chugging along fine ever since [other than replacing blades periodically). We have purchased another house about 3 hours away and I decided to buy another one for there. There's been a slight improvement in the blade guard which is more open now and doesn't allow clippings to pile up inside it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a way to run without holding down the on lever. I have a very long driveway and sidewalk so by the time I'm finished, my hold on fingers are tired out.
8632	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the second purchase of this product. The first worked so well I'm buying it again. The unexpected benefit is it also attracts other pesky bugs... simply put it works very well for fleas.
There is this perfect cutting sound that the mower makes when it is just right. Learn to hear this sound and you'll know all is right with your mower. To sharpen your mower you simply tighten this cutter bar against the blades a little closer than normal and smear valve grinding paste on the reel blades and cutter bar. Push it around the driveway to spin the blades. When the blade edges are uniformly shiny across their length then you are ready to clean the paste off and readjust the cutter bar. You can buy this valve lapping paste from any FLAPS (friendly local auto parts store) and mechanics use this paste when replacing cylinder head valves in a car or truck engine.
820	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
9171	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This product is heavy duty and works great in our huge lawn and garden. The downside is the mosquito attractant is so expensive we can hardly afford to buy those to put it in as needed. However, the bugs that get into the Insect Killer are definitely dying.

2.  I don't think that 1 zapper will take away every bug in your yard.  It will make your yard more comfortable as the bugs care more about the light than they do you, but it can't be 100%.  I recommend using something like a back yard spray, or Citronella Tiki Torches around the yard to add an extra layer or protection.

8213	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I know this gadget has a lot of positive reviews, but I was totally gobsmacked by how well it worked for me. We have a large yard, half wooded, half grass. We hung this at the border between the two areas. It must be a sweet spot because it seems to have almost totally eliminated mosquitoes in the grassy parts (we don't go back in the woods much). It probably ran 3 days before we got out in the yard, but that was long enough to clobber the bugs. My wife and I are amazed.

+ The pump is easy to work, and I find that as I walk & spray, its easy to keep the pressure for continuous spraying.
7084	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Ridiculously difficult to set up and completely ineffective for smaller moles.  See YouTube videos as evidence of this.  It's pretty obvious that this is not a user friendly option for mole removal.  "Make sure you build up a mound of dirt, make sure that the jaws aren't encumbered by dirt or rocks, place leaves over the mechanism so it doesn't get stuck, etc."  Complete BS!  Steer clear of this.

They're sturdier and already paid for, and there's also no shipping fee or shipping trash to deal with. I'm willing to bet you're probably creative enough to come up with something to elevate your pot inside the re-purposed lid just a little, too, to facilitate drainage.

I do know however that the battery compartment constantly let water in, including when I tried to insulate it with additional layer of silicone. This would kill the 9v battery and the device would go out of commission. I would only notice when the plants started to look half-dead. Overall, it is a garbage product.

6071	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	From the different designs of bug zappers on the market this one is by far the best. Firstly it's got 360 degrees of bug attracting light and access to the round zapping element. Secondly despite zapping thousands of bugs each nite, the element and surrounding cage stay totally clean. I have this 1.5 acre model and it's been employed 3 very busy nites of zapping and it's still clean. My other zapper is a flat rectangle standing flat Vex bug zapper. Every morning I have to clean off its completely clogged element and cage with compressed air. The Stinger you hear zapping away non stop busy, the Vex is just a quiet messy less busy contraption.  I will never buy any other zapper again other then the Stinger Bug Zapper.

2766	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	If the handles were actually adjustable, I would be using it as a primary snath. Loosening the handles took so much pressure from the vise grips that the handles both have ugly dents and scrapes on them. Yes, I used padding to try and protect the wood from the tools. I adjusted the handles and tightened them, and the lower handle was set to go. But the upper handle just won't stay tight enough to stay put. I have the heavy brush blade on it now, and only use it for short periods - using the lower handle and an improvised grip of the upper snatch shaft. The upper handle just flops around out of the way.

*Working space. I didn't take any stars off for this because it's obvious it has none from the picture. I knew this before I bought it, but at the time I hadn't realized how much of a problem this would be. Because the grill gets so hot I have to take it far away from any children and pets (I forgot to mention the pets earlier. One of my dogs burned its nose on it the first time). So while I'm so far away I have no place to put any dishes, the required oven-mit, any spice or sauce bowls etc. Oh sure, you can BUY the extension, but to me that feels like buying a car with no windows and then getting charged extra to have some installed.

However the lights do go out after about a year and sometimes the little Transformers or igniters do as well. So, if you use it nonstop like I do  it will only last you one season, You could try to repair it but it's just easier to spend the money and buy a new one  because the cost of a new bulbs and parts outweigh the cost of a new unit . I usually buy three new ones every year because we have a lot of mosquitoes

4104	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	In my experience, the Corona Clipper GS 6750 Grass Shear is an over-rated, work making tool.  Tools should save work, not add work onto the job.  It seems to me that these clippers require more energy than they are worth.  As another reviewer said, they tend to get material stuck between the blades, perhaps requiring a strong spring to make the tool spring open, so that the jamming does not occur as often.  So, any grassy material that requires energy to cut is added to the energy-taking spring back pressure.

Since I did not see any hummers it's hard to review the product and make any type of review in regards to whether they liked the nectar or not.

6866	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These traps work very well.  I recommend checking a few YouTube videos for recommendations how to set them (wearing gloves is a good idea to keep your smell off them).  They do take a fair amount of hand strength to set but the supplied "forks" provide good leverage and I would think that the average adult man or woman can use them without problem.  The springs are heavy and strong so I wouldn't want to risk getting lighter duty brand traps in this design.  I have also used the straight up and down stabbing style traps and have had much better results from these Victor traps.

9305	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	VERY CHEAPLY made.  Arrived broken.  The outer housing is a soft plastic and bends all over the place.  Mine was so easily deformed that one side was broken off, so the outer housing was hanging on with only one anchor.  Furthermore, the electronics, when plugged in, did not work.  My recommendation is to go to the local hardware store and get one.  The low price of this makes it look like a great deal, but it is just money thrown away.  It arrived in a nice box and packaging with NO evidence of damage, so I am not sure how it was broken.
 One other item I modified was the plastic rail that  attaches to the floor by snapping it into the holes provided.  I found that some of the rails had a tendency to snap out when bumped.  I remedied this by turning the house upside down and placing it in a small plastic garbage can for support then mixed epoxy and dabbed epoxy on the bottom of the plastic rails which formed a strong bond when dry between the rail and the aluminum.
I've counseled them to start including the instructions with the plates.

I was very worried about both my dog and children getting into the new planted area because I already have a very difficult time getting grass to grow. We purchased these bamboo sticks to drive into the ground 6-10 in and then purchased chicken wire fencing and zip ties to secure to the bamboo. These bamboo stakes worked better than I could have imagined. They are much cheaper than buying pine or metal stakes and the knot on the bamboo was a perfect place to use the zip ties on to secure the fence. They are easily supporting the fencing, creating a perfect barrier between the bountiful (wishful thinking) new grass and the rest of the backyard. There were a couple broken in the second package that I purchased but it was not an issue for me as I planned on having extra. They also appear to be in good enough shape to use again in the future if I get ambitious enough to plant a garden and need to keep the bunny rabbits out.

Even the one I made with an old pill bottle works better than this.  None of the others except for one uses any poison.  I added liquid Nicotine to one which did increase the kill rate some.

> Of course, if the blade gets dull (which is inevitable for anvil loppers) cutting gets harder.  Also an anvil lopper with a dull blade often does not cut completely through fibrous material. Fortunately, it is not difficult to sharpen the blade with a file.

I've had my Go-Anywhere charcoal grill for about three years, and it has held up extremely well.  The durable exterior coating is very resistent to the elements (and it's small enough that you could easily let it cool down and chuck it into a closet if you want to keep it indoors).  The only thing that has really shown any significant wear is the grill grate, but these are easily replacable (and, in the long run, all grates give out eventually).
We also had a fly problem at one point, i put a fly bait trap and hung it next to this thing, I figured any flies that didn't get in the water trap have a chance of flying in and getting zapped. I was right, I did see a good amount of flies getting zapped, although it doesn't directly attract them.
The Dynatrap is quiet as a church mouse, but it doesn't kill the bugs, it just traps them into a screened in area.  You have to quickly shut the unit off, put a bag over the bottom of the unit and force all of the bugs into an empty plastic shopping bag.

My friend has exactly the same grill that maintains perfect consistency!  To light the grill requires several tries and then it lights with a flash that is scary.  I have tried moving the igniter closer to the burner with-out success. If conditions are at all breezy you can not operate on low.  I have an aluminum surround that works great to keep the wind away.

Third, the blade edges could have been ground a little better. The first time I back-lapped* my blades, I noticed a few small areas that still had green paint on the blade edge - i.e. they were not contacting the cutter bar.

- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.

Now that we have (almost) finished cleaning up, we cannot help but notice that much of our lawn has died while we were cleaning up and that several of our trees look sick. (It's usually the sick trees that lose the limbs). So, once temperatures drop a bit I expect to be doing a lot of spraying to try and get things fixed up.  All our old hand sprayers have died or seized up. So this backpack sprayer will be a useful adjunct to the cheapo hose end sprayer that I also use.  The backpack sprayer should be less tiring than the hose end sprayer (no heavy hose to keep lugging around) and I should be less likely to get wet in the process.  Also, my hose end sprayer always dumps stuff in my face when I try to spray up into the trees. This sprayer should avoid that problem and should be able to spray higher into the trees.  If my results turn out not to meet my expectations I shall correct this review before September 1st.

I know this is just some kind of crazy coincidence but the moles literally left my yard after I set these up.  I haven't seen one or a new tunnel in over a month now.  They may be back but for now, even though they didn't kill any moles, the cost was well worth it to me.  My yard has never looked better.

- If you have water getting into the bottle (and diluting your content), you may have a defective unit because this comes with a built-in anti-siphon mechanism that prevents backflow.
The only downside to these, especially in my application, is they get impacted with dead insects to the point it takes compressed air to really clean them  back to full operation.

First and foremost, I am a Fiskars fan, and have been for a while. I adore their genuine Finnish made products, especially their famous orange handled scissors for crafts/sewing/indoor stuff (which, once upon a time, were made in Finland with steel brought in from Sweden), but also their garden related products. Unfortunately, many years back, Fiskars became a global importer and ceased all manufacturing in Finland. Typically you can only find old stock from the made-in-Finland days, otherwise it's just new, made-in-China junk.

I'd say that if you plan on using these for general gardening, cutting flower stems or thick weeds, these bad boys will tear through those tasks.

I can't tell how many actual mosquitos it zaps since they are kind of small, but i can say that we've been outside all week long and so far have not been bothered by mosquito bites anymore.  I can't say the zapper has done it all since some days have been windy and there are less insects anyway, but other nights without much wind have actually been very enjoyable and mosquito-free.  Just one week ago - before the zapper - we were actually running to get back inside with all the mosquito bites.  This week has been amazing.  I hope it continues to work.

The extended handle in this spreader makes it a breeze to push while walking in the upright position.

We read the manual and had picked up some good pointers online: do not hang these within 20 to 25 ft from where you want to sit! Effectively this thing attracts mosquitoes and other flying mini-bloodsuckers and unless you enjoy the pain (...) you would not want to sit in a cloud of those. As one (funny!!) reviewer commented: "Capt'n, the thing does not work, it actually attracted mosquitoes and I could not sit outside anymore". This person had put the Flowtron right next to their chair. Really: 25 ft or so is perfect: one of them, this morning, had at least 300 mosquitoes hanging around on the siding, staying close to the unit taking their mid day nap. At night, sunset, they become active and the zapping kicks into hight gear.

The key to successful weeding is removing as much of the weed's root as possible.  Where do "weeds" come from?  There are some weed seeds that are very small and they actually come through municipality water systems and have been nick-named "water weeds" - so your plants need water and when you water them you also can be seeing the ground with "water weeds."  Then there are weed seeds that just blow in with the wind.  Treating yourself to some specialty weeders should help make your gardening hobby even more fun!

The spring is pretty firm, however for a woman I have large hands so it's not much of a bother for me, but I can surmise that a smaller-handed person might have issues with it.
For a very basic mower, it allows me to cut our grass and maintain an immaculate lawn.  The bagger is pretty mediocre, and easily modified to be serviceable and catch 95% or more, of clippings. I use a string trimmer to handle edges and walls, so the 4 or 5 inch gap doesn't bother me.

However I didn't realize it was squirrel proof until it popped up in my search for a new feeder. I've been watching a few obese squirrels run up my pole, reach over and gorge.

The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Droll-Yankees-PLB-Perfect-Little-Brushes/dp/B00004ZB4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Droll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushes</a>&nbsp;to clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.

My birdhouse has been up for about a month, now, and is inhabited with Martins.
BUT I RECENTLY FOUND A GREAT SOLUTION THAT PLEASES ME.  I bought a brass " Gunjet 31 (also referred to as an AA31, or TeeJet 31) spray gun, a brass wand to go with it, and a spray tip assembly.  (There is one TeeJet 31 gun offered for sale here on Amazon, but it is way too expensive compared to other vendor prices.)  What you end up with is a high-quality, all brass (except for the nozzle and a few valve parts that are steel) spray wand that does not leak, is smooth and easy to use, and is a pleasure to use compared to these cheap disposable plastic spray wands.  The whole assembly cost me about $80, including shipping.  You can buy these on line from many agriculture and orchard supply houses.  I just picked one vendor on line and called them by telephone.  The sales lady I spoke to was very knowledgeable and selected exactly the right combination of parts for my application.

4026	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Assembly was simple enough, getting the c-clamps was a little tough but its a one time thing. I have been using it at the default blade height but may drop it a little. We have a small townhouse in Houston (25' x 25' lawn), it cuts through our grass no problem. As others have said, it will get stuck with the smallest of sticks, but that's just the way the design works. Not hard to get out, but best to just make sure there are no debris before you start. Pushing it is really easy, though we have a flat lawn. I can finish my yard quickly then just hang it in the corner of the garage. No gas, takes up little space, loving it so far. If I had a bigger yard it would be a nice work out too.
The only satisfaction is hearing them get zapped.  Otherwise, its a waste.  If bug lights solved anything, they would be placed in large numbers in malaria, yellowfever, and other horrible mosquito borne disease areas.

I am new to gardening & was looking for some type of barrier that would allow water to drain from the large holes I put in my planter boxes, without losing potting soil through the holes. Well let me tell you, this was just the ticket. The burlap is loosely woven so you can see through it. Don't use it for a weed barrier because it will not stop the weeds from poking through. Very happy with this purchase.

>> There are probably excellent reasons for curved jaws.  However it is very hard to sharpen the curved blade of curve-jawed anvil loppers, and have them perfectly align with the anvil, which is important.  However, it is easy to sharpen the blade of straight-jaw loppers (I use my belt sander), and to adjust the anvil to perfectly align with the sharpened blade.  So, I only consider straight-jawed anvil loppers.

4731	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This 16-inch Oregon S57 chain is a perfect fit for my Worx WG303.1 saw and the price here on Amazon was substantially less than the Worx branded replacement chain. I see that Oregon even makes the Worx OEM chain, so that probably explains why it seems almost exactly the same in every detail. It cuts just as well as the OEM chain did when new, so overall, I'm very happy with it. I think it's always a good idea to have a spare saw chain on hand and I find it's simply a lot faster and more convenient to just swap out chains and then sharpen a dull chain with a 5/32" file later, at a more convenient time. With the quick-change feature on the Worx saw, a chain swap and re-tension literally takes maybe 30-seconds from start to finish, even allowing for a few seconds to wipe debris out of the cover plate with a rag before reinstalling it.

2934	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It is very easy to replace the sprinkler heads which I just did in a matter of a few minutes. There is one issue and I want to point that out first. The unit is covered with a glued on paper tag that explains all about he sprinkler head. It absolutely will not remove easily. It took me 15 minutes to get the paper label off the two heads that i purchased. I eventually had to heat the label with a hair dryer and even then they would not remove easily. This is just a nagging point with me as no label should be that hard to remove. You may be asking why did I want to remove the labels. Well in my case the two spray head were about 12 inches above ground in my flower beds and I really did not care for all the advertising of Rainbird in my front yard. In my case all I had to do was unscrew the heads fro the 12 inch extender pipe and then screw the new heads back on. Be sure and check the radius area on the old sprinkler head so you can get the exact duplicate. This is a very easy job. Be care not to unscrew the riser pipe other wide you stand the chance of getting some soil or sand in your water line. In the event you dod not have a rise pole and the sprinkler head is screwed directly into your sprinkler water line, it is still an easy job. Just remover the dirt or sand around the area where the headed is connected to the pipe and one again be careful not to let dirt or sand get into your water line, then just screw the new replacement head back into the water supply line. You have just saved yourself a$50 to $100 service call. I you want to do a professional job, put a small amount of teflon tape around the threads before you screw the head into the pipe. Now you are a professional sprinkler head replacement persons.

09/12/14:  Have you ever had a 35MM camera like a Nikon EM or F2?  I have both and a bunch of lenses, filters, tripods, remote triggers and on and on.

This seeder is very well balanced and believe it or not--well made.  I use it mostly for sweet corn and bush beans.  I've tried it for spinach, cucumber, and squash and really didn't like the results, but since they are hilled beds and easy to plant by hand it really wasn't a deal breaker.  Really, I bought this primarily for planting green beans and sweet corn, because I'd rather take a bullet to the head than bend over to plant long rows of said seeds.

I have my lawn mowed by a service, but they never do the inside of my fenced in area of my backyard. It's probably a 25ftx25ft area of grass. It it's fence in and the fence is covered with wisteria. I usually use a weedeater to keep it short, I've tried to think of ways to make it maintenance free. I decided to buy this little push mower and give it a try! So glad I did! I just weedeat around the edges and mow the center and I have a perfectly maintained lawn! This is my 3rd summer and it's going strong. Cons? Yeah, there's a few...any sticks causes major issues...it will lock up without notice!!! Also your ground isn't perfectly level it's hard to get one tire out of the hole. There WAS a walnut tree not too far from the area and if one fell or blew into the fenced area it wreaker havoc with this little mower.
Removing the bulbs to clean them WILL cause the socket contacts to fail!- I never did figire out how to thoroughly clean the bulbs (High psi compressor helps, and IS a must!- Vacuum cleaner is too wimpy!)!?
The 6050 DeerBlock Netting kept the deer out of the garden area until the deer decided that there was something worth eating on the other side of the netting.

5954	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the third little Weber I've had in the past 20 years - I've never worn one out; the first two were stolen!  I like the locking handle on the new model.  One great feature of these grills is that when you are done  cooking, you can close all the vents and the fire will go out in about  15-20 minutes, saving whatever's left of your charcoal for the next time.  With the handle locked, it won't spill in the back of your pickup on the  way home.
Too early for me to comment about long term reliability over winter season - i have installed it a month back, and the valve appears to be well-built.
Additionally, their guarantee is worthless as they never bother writing or calling back.

3288	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I found this edge hog to be very usuful. For edging you do not need a gas powered machine. This edger has plenty of power. So much power infact, I never bogged it down all the way. This is of course for home use only, not for a landscaping service, however I find it keeps up really well, and I maintain it too. I bought this edger last summer and it lasted all through then. I have a lawn care service. And I do not mind using it for landscaping service purposes. This trimmer is only $90.00 bucks. This is the best electric edger you can buy. And the blade that it uses has jagged edges on it to help cut through better. And you can buy replacment blades for it as well. I use two 100 foot cords together to equal 200 feet. Yes hulling that much of cord is a bit of a pain, however, its still easier than trying to maintain a gass edger. However, I do not recomend that you use more than 200 feet of cord. If you do, you lose curent and your moter will burn up do to loss of power from outlet. I used this electric device to not only landscape a home owners lawn, but I also used it to landscape a buisines. Aftor doing so, there were never any complaints! This is a great buy! Go ahead and enjoy your Black & Decker Edge Hog!

9550	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I paid $25 for the sprinkler head and the base.  Very disappointing as the nut that secures is constanly getting loose causing the adusting spring to spin.  I have found it watering my windows more than  once.  The base is rusty on the inside (only bought last month) and sprays rusty water when turned on for the first couple of seconds and it doesn't drain after hose is turned off.  $25 is way to much to spend for something that has so many problems.

Would recommend as long as I can get through the season with a tool that lasts
1099	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I used the sprayer to apply a herbicide,  when attached to the hose it was easy to use, I have see if the mixture rate set on the dial for the chemical used does the job on the creeping bent grass, It was a lot easier and faster then using the hand pump sprayer for a large area.


Walks along watering, the spray distance is adjustable. Does a nice job and doesn't waste water. There is an auto shut off that you place on your hose. When the sprinkler gets to the shutoff, a switch is pressed and the thing stops. The unit follows the layout of your hose on the ground pulling it behind.

I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.

We got it at Home Depot and not Amazon but I made sure that this was the same model so that I am reviewing the correct item
The next time we wanted to use it I set it out about an hour and half before we even wanted to sit outside and this time it really came into effect, by the time we sat outside there was a lot of frequent zapping and we were not getting bit.

It is harder to mow if you let the grass get too tall or if the grass is wet, and small sticks can stop the blades from turning (until said stick is removed), but if you stay on top of the yard this is a great eco friendly and economic tool.

Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill.

The B&D Unit couldn't cut through, kicked up a cloud of dust & grit and you had to pass over the area to be cut multiple times just to perforate (and not even cut through).  Maybe around a well maintained edge, this would keep the edge maintained, but there is no way it will cut in a new edge on an overgrown surface.  Not sure if I'll be keeping it - I'll give it one more try on the newly hand sawn edge and see if it works for maintenance.  But if you have overgrown edges along sidewalk, path, the hand saw was quick, efficient, left a clean edge and didn't over me, the operator, in a cloud of dust and grit.

it does smell HORRIBLE when you have to dump it. I got a mesh strainer from a junk sale. and use a bucket to strain the dead flies out and then replace the liquid. I have done this 4x and see no need to buy more refill packets. the stuff gets funkier over time, which means it's more effective. I do have to open the trap and then WALK AWAY (I usually open it and then go mess with the hose) because it almost made me puke last time. Once it's aired out a bit it's more tolerable.

8966	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Have bought a number of these before. and these are our favorite kind.  Even though the bugs still have to be blown out or gently tapped out, they don't stick to the electric grid like other bug zappers we've had.  Zillions of bugs, mostly mosquitoes, fall out onto the ground underneath.  Like the other zappers, these only seem to work for a couple of years, but they're worth their weight in gold for controlling mosquitoes.
Sterilize them every couple of weeks with a mild chlorine solution.

The mower cannot cut soft needle type plants, like the grass stems from neglected lawns.  And if your grass is of special needle type, check.  It's not good at removing ground hugging weeds.  It can cut through other weeds, but not as clean as a power tool.

8580	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This bug slaughtering machine is awesome. Every night I hear the mini thunderstorm of insect death and every morning I see a circle of carcasses where this weapon has laid waste to our enemies. Their plan to is attack you at night when you can't see them but before the can reach you, they are drawn to the death beam of doom and destruction to be swiftly executed before they can latch onto your skin and drain you. This product is cheap and effective. When I compare it to the automatic rifle I normally use to fight mosquitoes at night, this thing wins 9 out of 10 times. The M4 is good for breaking up swarms of them but it's highly inaccurate for such small monsters and ammo gets expensive considering my goal is to usually extinguish 40-50 straw-toothed invaders per night. However, the Flowtron BK-15D Electronic Killer manages to kill hundreds of the vampiric dragons with literally no effort at all! Now instead of spending hours upon hours every night in my battle rattle with my M4 hunting down six-legged suckers, I can binge watch Game of Thrones with my wife and puppy. Ultimately, this product saved my marriage, my skin, my bond with the puppy, and has allowed me to finally get caught up in Game of Thrones. Totally didn't expect that stupid King Joffrey to get killed by a poisoned cupcake and then Tywin shot by Tyrion while taking a dump. Oh and by the way, spoiler alert.

Most folks typically don't cook on their grill as much as I do so they may not ever experience the falling air vent thing.

6351	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Bottom line: I recommend this product, with a warning.  On paper, new design solves the biggest issue with H. feeders, i.e., cleaning because the base is two pieces and bottle mouth is wide.  However, if you fail to screw the bottle perfectly it leaks, and sometimes it leaks on the return trip to the kitchen if tilted during take-down.  So, when you take it down for cleaning, convey it to the kitchen in a bowl or platter due to leaking.

9222	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have had this for right at a year. I love it. It's really important to have it at least 25 ft from where you are, however I have it attached to my deck. It really does keep the bug population down. I live about two miles from a lake, and I get millions of mosquitoes. Millions. I love to BBQ and grill out and having this has helped me reclaim my backyard experience. I have 4 bug zappers - 1 Flowtron, two rechargeable stingers, and a plug in stinger. This thing attracts and kills everything that's going to annoy you at night. And yes, it does attract mosquitoes. I don't know how since scientifically mosquitoes are not attracted to UV light. I clean it out periodically and there are tons of mosquitoes in the grid. I also like that this company stands behind their products. I recently had an issue where my grid quit working. I emailed the company, the next day sent me an RMA number to send back to them - they fixed it and sent it back. Plus, it's made in the USA which is a major plus for me.

7222	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This works.  I will order it again.  But I will anchor it better so it doesn't blow away.  I lost it in a wind storm.  It smells pretty bad, but it also works in the house.  I brought it indoors and set it in the bathtub when the flies were particularly obnoxious inside.  Opened the (screened) window in the bathroom, and they flocked to it in there.  I set it back outside after a while, when I could begin to smell it.  I wouldn't keep it in the house with windows closed, however.  Phew!!!
I've lugged it with me through something like 5 moves, and it's still fine.  The grill has eventually accumulated rust, but it's nothing you can't scrape off at the beginning of the season, and besides they're always telling us we need more iron in our diets, right?
When it is attached to my hose it produces no leaks even when I leave the water faucet turned on. I have a very strong water pressure, and some older nozzles generate a leak even when I wrap every connection with Teflon tape. I like the springy feel of the handle as well as its ergonomic handle.

The rotary blades on the hand mower do not sharpen, nor do they cut the same way as the single blade design of a power mower.  While power mowers can be easily sharpened at an angle with just a file if necessary, the rotary blades of the hand mower are sharpened flat across the face of the blade.  Something very difficult to do by hand even if you had the mower completely disassembled.  This very simple three piece system consists of a brush, a crank handle, and a small container of grinding compound.  The instructions that come with the kit are pretty simple without a lot of detail, but describe it well enough for you to get the job done.  Personally, I found the hardest part of the whole job at the very beginning.  Removing the small "C" clamp that holds the wheel on.  Though the instructions simply stated that one should pry off the C ring by merely "sticking a regular slotted screw driver into the opening" of it, for me there was nothing at all "merely" about it. No amount of prying, twisting, pushing or swearing allowed me to get a grip on the C clamp with just a screwdriver, or even two of them.  All I ended up doing for 15 minutes was chase it around the axle.  I finally got it off by concluding that I would sacrifice it by ruining it with needle nose pliers, and then putting on a new one. (As it turned out, I easily reshaped the original clamp and reinstalled it). After removing the clamp the wheel slips right off and you have to remove the gear wheel that assures the forward action of the blades when it motion.  It is not attached in any way and just lifts off.  But one word of warning here.  Neither the directions or any other reviewer at the time of this writing mentions that the gear wheel directs its forward motion by the wheel slipping over a little "key" or steel sliver that slides into a slot on the gear shaft.  The key is loose after removal of the gear wheel and can easily fall out and be lost while  moving the mower around during the sharpening process.  Make sure you either keep an eye on it in the shaft, or remove it to a safe place.  The actual sharpening process is quite easy, just time consuming.  You spread the compound onto the blades with the little brush supplied and then turn the mower back wards with the crank provided.  You will get tired, but you can rest and restart.  Give it a good ten minutes.  The more you crank the better the sharpening job.  Oh and the crank does not slip over the entire shaft, it is snug and has to be wiggled on.  You may want to tap it with a light hammer or screwdriver so you don't have to keep stopping and pushing it back on during the spinning process.  When you're done, the reassembly is very easy, (don't forget the little key if you removed it), and after cleaning up the excess compound, your mower will cut like its a brand new model.  It really did make quite a difference for me and I highly recommend this simple kit that will perform the job easily.  Push mower blades stay sharp a lot longer than power blades so a sharpening job every other season, or even every three should be enough.  Under that schedule, this kit should last you through many years of your mowers use.  Highly recommended....

I live on a wooded hillside lot. My front yard is tiny and drops off with steep slope (think cliff) and my other grassy area is up above a retaining wall behind the house. I didn't like using a power mower in the front yard because it felt like the heavy mower wanted to go over the cliff when I got close to the edge. And lugging the power mower up the retaining wall steps out back was a pain. So I bought the lightest, smallest model of this reel mower and couldn't be happier.

Balancing the disadvantages with the advantages, the extra 15-20 minutes of your time are worth the trouble. In fact, I purchased a second head as a "backup." After being in storage for five years, I gave it to my dad, who attached it to his Stihl. Like me, he was continuing frustrated with the "built-in bumper system" that frequently unraveled and required the reloading of string. After experiencing the Grass Gator 5600 and its trouble-free operation, he was thrilled.

I have not tried it for deer, and I wouldn't try this for deer, because it seems too flimsy. If I put in enough force, I can rip it with my hands (a good amount of force and wearing gloves, otherwise it hurts your hands). Also, it's not very visible unless you are up close. If it was the only thing standing (mine is held up by a field fence), I can imagine an animal would run into it, and either tangle itself or rip it. Now, I haven't actually seen that happen, but based on working with a large amount of this product, I think it can happen.
Great solution for bug problems.

6667	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Smokey Joe Grill is a real performer. We are so pleased we purchased one of these. We cook a lot on the grill weather permitting. The Smokey Joe Grill fires up quick. The Smokey Joe Grill also cooks up burgers, hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection. I really mean it. We love it. The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by.
The outside grills, made of plastic are horizontal but the inside electric zapper grid is vertical in orientation. More so the bottom is left relatively open apart from the Octenol slots. This is VERY important, as other devices clog up. This one: you will collecvt a heap of insect parts below it. Much easier to clean.

The drawbacks apply to any reel mower, and they are somewhat significant.  Prepare to make a time investment in your lawn if you use a reel mower.  They don't handle long grass well and this means constant grooming of your lawn, at least a couple of times during the week depending on the season. When the grass is short it breezes through it, so while it isn't a huge chore it is time consuming, especially in the heat of summer. When the grass is long, this thing is a pain to use so constant grooming is essential. As others have noted, I do sections throughout the week but not everyone has the time or inclination to be constantly mowing their lawns.  As others have also noted, it does not mow weeds - at all - so you either have to stoop to pull them out or leave a very raggedy-looking yard behind. I haven't used it yet in the fall, but that's when I'll probably switch back to the gas mower as I'm not inclined to rake up every single leaf in my yard so I can use this.
- Finding replacement bulbs is difficult locally, so try to have an extra on hand

Seems like everything is made in China these days in an effort to make the cheapest product possible.

The edger is still going strong 3 years later, but one thing I noticed last year was that it was not cutting quite as well and I was having to do more than one pass to get that finely manicured look. Thankfully, I found a replacement blade on Amazon (search for: Black & Decker EB-007) which cost about $9 and after swapping out the blade at the start of this growing season I can say that the edger feels almost brand new again.

9878	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I have several areas that need trimming that I cannot mow in so I bought this in the expectations of being able to sling cut the grass and weeds. From the other reviews I thought this would fit the bill but I am really disappointed in it. It will cut (actually it is more of just a rip and tearing) the weeds and does an even poorer job on the grass itself, but it certainly does not leave a nice appearance. This will be only used when and where I have to. It is brand new so the blade should be sharp but it certainly makes a mess of the area you use it on. Plus, it is a bear to use and I am very active and stay on the go all the time, yet using this for just a few minutes almost wears me out. If I still had the box, I would return this as I am very disappointed in it all the way around. I relied on the positive reviews but I sure don't know what they reviewed or if they actually ever used this product.

If you are having trouble cutting things down you may need to swing faster than you think.  It will get the job done if you give it a really good golf swing.
Con... there is not a brush available to get inside to clean the glass bottle...
A couple qualifications: you better dump out all your coals into the fire pit and wipe the grill out each time to ensure that you don't have any hot embers left when you pack it up to go home (keeps it clean too!); and pack some stuff around it because it's a bit wobbly for travel.


3102	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	After buying a new house, this edger worked wonders to clean up the driveway edges. It has a powerful motor and it paid for itself after a few uses.

3.  Third place... Havahart 0745  - live trap. this is a traditional style live trap.  It caught 1 in 2 weeks and missed 5 times.

They don't make it clear on the box but it is MADE in the USA if you check the label on the inside of the unit (under the top).  After much research, I chose this one because it had better feedback than a similar priced unit (STINGER) which was made in Mexico.  Using the provided attractant, it worked well for getting the "NOSEEmS" in my back yard.  I have a half acre of land and this puppy arrived just in time to let me enjoy our deck.  Unlike some other units that you can't hear them working, this puppy lets you enjoy the WACK of hearing them die.

This grill has sent us to the web for all kinds of cool recipies to use over charcoal. It travels I guess...but we just use it on a patio table. When done it's easy to  clean up and put away.  My wife and I are seriously considering running a classified ad for the giant, blinding-in-the-sun, overly huge, hard to keep clean gas grill!  Imagine what we could put on the pool deck in a space 7 foot long by 3 feet wide?!

No complaints whatsoever.
The only negative thing I'd even say is I'd sometimes get confused on which was to use the openers when setting the traps.  Not really a big deal, just it was sometimes frustrating between seasons when I'd have to relearn.

9336	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This product was broken on arrival.  The outer plastic grill was broken at one of the screw attachment points, two clips supposed to keep the grill in place do not lock into the metal top because the plastic grill is warped, so the grill is dangling by one screw.  The plastic grill is the only part that keeps you from touching the high-voltage grid and it's about to fall off.  I will not plug the product in, because it is hazardous in this condition.  A note in the package says not to contact the store for warranty problems, but to call the factory directly, we'll see how that works.  May improve the rating if I get a good response from factory (or vendor).

This Weber I love. Everything about it seems perfect. I have some complaints (and I'll get to those soon, I promise) but overall I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I know it makes no sense to say that a grill has improved my cooking, but as far as I'm concerned it has. My pork chops have been consistently cooked properly and juicy. My steaks have been delicious. My kebabs out of this world. My wife thinks I deserve all the credit for this, but I'm putting most of it on the grill since the last one didn't produce results this good. In fact, my wife is begging me to grill now, whereas last summer she'd find excuses not eat my overcooked food that chewed like rubber and was garnished with burnt spices that tasted like the coals I cooked it over.

And no, it does not say what was added, so you can't say what it was. Also (Mr./ Mrs Akiko, the same peanut gallery commenter) your profile says you are stuck in the west -- happy to float you a few bucks or pass a hat for you to go back if you hate it so much here.

Wait, never mind the likelihood of me ever coming back to this review to see your comment is about 0%.
Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.

After having used this to keep the animals out of my garden, I've removed it......NOT because it didn't work, but because a king snake got caught up in it.  If my grandson hadn't come in to tell me there was a snake in the yard, it would've strangled to death.

Oh. The most "interesting" part? They breed in there. I saw maggots crawling through the masses of dead fly bodies along the bottom of the cup.

It isn't a perfect world for fertilizer spreaders.  If your lawn is flat, this rotary spreader will likely work better than other brands once you have the application adjuster figured out for your fertilizer product and have insured that you didn't bolt the mainframe to the hopper upside down.  If you have a hill as I do, this rotary spreader may be superior to other products also.
I would not recommend it!
I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who said the venting system didn't work and the charcoal fire goes out.  It just doesn't happen if you get the fire going properly to begin with.  I love it that the vents are on the sides of the kettle instead of underneath the coals.
Easy to install and a good way to save on water.
Bug zappers attract insects using ultraviolet light and the low voltage current surrounding the mesh cage kills the insects that attempt to reach the light. The problem is that mosquitoes are not attracted to light; rather, they seek out carbon dioxide to locate blood proteins which are used to develop eggs, so only female mosquitoes need to draw blood and bite. Some mosquitoes prefer bird, snake, or frog/toad blood and others like plant nectar. A few don't even need blood to hatch eggs. Along with CO2, perfume, sweat, and body odor also can attract mosquitoes. Hence, the substance that comes with the bug zapper designed to attract female, biting mosquitoes.

I don't think the alleged amount of lead in this nozzle would harm an ant. I'll risk my life and water my plants and wash my cars with this nozzle and not concern myself with such NONSENSE.......

At least 5 other people we know have purchased one since they've seen the effect our Flowtron has had
1. Always run them downhill, not uphill. The wheels can dig into the dirt and then it will "high center" the rear axle, making it stay stationary.
Once you are satisfied with the wooden anchor, unscrew the straps and paint the anchor. Apply at least one coat of primer paint and allow it to dry for 24 hours. I next apply an exterior house paint to the anchor and allow that to dry 24 hours. Reassembly your anchor to the suet feeder being careful of the orientation. Finally Spray paint the exposed metal screws used to fasten the straps  I used a clear acrylic spray. This will stop the screws from rusting on you.

I am very surprised that these manual, or "reel" mowers are not more popular, or mainstream.
I looked at electric mowers - the type with a motor and battery on board. Nice machines but still more than I need week to week. Still a certain amount of noise. Still a complex device. Then I used this Great States Mower. What a perfect tool for the job. This isn't your grandfather's reel mower. I remember using one of those when I was a kid. It weighed about as much as I did at the time and a real bear to push. Maybe it was a heavy mower or maybe it was out of adjustment. Maybe it was that I was eight years old. Tough to say.

The kettle itself is bulletproof and as rugged as they come.  However, my neighbor dented my grill top with his bike or he knocked the top on the ground when locking his bike to the fence where my grill is.  But this will have no effect other than a cospetic blemish, not a big deal at all, stinkin neighbors.  I like the plain black color, its simplistic and looks awesome.  The coating was applied throughout the entire grill, inside and out.  This protects the metal from corrosive elements, such as charcoal and water.  Also, there is a hook on the grill top which allows you to use one hand to hook it on the back of the grill for easy access for flipping burgers or what have you.  When your done simply grab the handl and cover it back up again.
I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.

Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly.

I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.

They are 100 feet away transfixed on the Victor Fly Trap stink.  (For the record, it does smell slightly rotten, but I don't find it too repulsive or strong.) The hook on top of the container is metal; I just hung it off a wire fence.  I am attaching a photo after about a week. I'm tempted to buy more as the trap has been so productive.
We did get a broken unit the first time around. Wouldn't turn on. But Amazon replaced it lickity split. Hence the 4 stars, as there may be some quality control issues. Enjoy zappin'!

I've only used it a couple of times and I can say that it worked like a charm. On my first use, it took a little extra time mainly because I had let everything overgrow while I found a better option than using my weed whacker. The second time I used it, I was able to complete the job in less than half the time.

8913	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Victor Tin Cat is a really good product.  It works with very little effort, bait it put in the area you want to catch the mice and walk away.  The only drawback I see is having to empty the trap, it can be difficult to pop open and if there are still live mice you have to be ready.  I recommend checking the trap every few days and if there appears to be live mice, submerge it in water to drown them before you open it.  I have purchase similar traps from other companies and the do not hold up as well as the Victor trap. So much easier than the snap or glue traps.

The fact that the shaft is basically a 3/4" black iron pipe with standard NPT pipe threads is a bonus when (if) you decide you need a pipe extension.
2.  Ease of use.

PS. Regarding the sharpness and condition of the blade: mine has no chipped paint and is in "new" condition. The blade is as sharp as any blade I've purchased previously, that is... I've never considered ANY of the blades I've purchased to be very sharp and always sharpen them myself before using them. They'd all probably cut fine without my initial sharpening, however, as a mower blade doesn't need to be sharp like a knife.

Now, the pump is broken rendering the unit unusable. It is really a piece of junk - not well constructed. I had to purchase two hose clamps early in it's life to keep the hose on during use. The manufacturer did not even think of suppling these hose clamps. We have a Chapin sprayer used for many years. We will replace this one with another Chapin.

My yard is on a hill so sometimes it tips and i have to go out and fix it. It is pretty slow moving and takes a couple of hours to cover my yard which is probably about .2 acres. The product is heavy and well made and requires minimal setup. If you don't want to pay for a sprinkler system and don't want to move around a sprinkler in your yard this is the way to go.
This will last well over ten years and the only threat to it's longevity is wind and something falling on it.
9522	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have owned this product for several months and so far it has operated flawlessly as far as electronics go.
UPDATE  (12.7.2013): Well!  I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the "return function" that can be found under your "orders history")and have received a complete refund!!  The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels.  Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  "count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it".

1891	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have many different types of Fiskar's tools for gardening.

Quality tools, and even if left outside over the winter, a little oil and they come back to life. Love these tools! That is a "shameless endorsement."
8212	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	It's alright but the large Stinger unit I have had for several years seems to zap more insects. The Stinger unit has a single 40W bulb that has a deeper purple color. I plan on switching the bulbs if the Stinger bulb fits the Flowtron and then compare results. Also the Stinger has a photocell that turns it on at dusk and off at dawn. The Flowtron stays on 24/7 unless you turn it off manually or hook a timer to it.
I am again a happy gardener. Yes, even in winter you need a garden hose. It has a nice all weather construction, special foamed inner layers and a glossy sealed cover. What I really like about this hose is the Flow Guard Plus collar. When the hose is fully extended, normal hoses will kink at the faucet as you yank on them to get over to that last flower bed. Well, this one will not kink since it has a nice collar on it.

8579	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We live in the Rio Grande Valley in Deep South Texas. This past year, the valley has had one of the worst flea infestations in years. We have two small dogs and one cat; the dogs go outside 2-3 times a day; the cat stays inside. All animals are given medication against fleas and ticks (Comfortis) and this medication keeps them critter free; however, some fleas still manage to get in the house leading me to believe humans bring some in. We have one Victor Flea Trap under a chair in the living area and one under a nightstand in our bedroom; they really work. In addition the traps use a nightlight and consequently, they provide a comfortable light should one need to get up during the night. I highly recommend this product.

Update #2: Before buying my first Flowtron, sought information to help me decide what size unit to buy. Have now tried out a 40 watt model in my home. It works well, is significantly larger than my 15 watt unit and the transformer hum is a little bit louder. The bulb in the 40 watt Flotron cost twice as much to replace. Leave the 15 watt unit on 24/7 inside. It works well and uses less power. The 40 watt units are brighter and would be my choice for serious outdoor useage. Will use both of the 40 watt units if needed and turn them off when I go indoors. Inside, just can't see much advantage of using the larger 40 watt unit size.

The handle is made of super hard wood and it was difficult to drive the screw into the wood.  But would rather have this strong handle than a lower quality piece of wood.

I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.

Everyone is sold out of shovels of this type  because of the frequent snow storms. During the last storm my daughter broke her shovel so I gave her my spare grain hog scoop #12 shovel. AMAZON had the type shovel I was looking for. I ordered two, one for dad, one for daughter. They arrived with the shovel scoop  protected by a flattened cardboard box. Gave the scoop a coat of furniture polish, helps the snow to slide off. YUP 10" of snow for tonight, the shovels arrived just in time. Very thankful that AMAZON had a supply of these shovels. So far this shovel has not cracked, perhaps the cold causes the scoop material to become brittle - do not know. A previous shovel did crack, epoxy solved the problem - or duct tape.

So I finally got to see this rain gauge in action and am able to write this review. It works great. It's simple with no moving parts. I've tried other gauges (the wireless kind) with zero luck, and I finally decided: simple is best in this case. This gauge measures up to 5" of total rainfall, and the large, yellow numbers can easily be read from a distance of 30 feet or more. It has a red, plastic float disc that rises as rainwater collects in the gauge. The scale is graduated in 1/4" increments such that 1" of rainfall corresponds to about 3" on the gauge, so it's also easy to read rainfall in 1/4" increments. All in all, I'm very happy with it. It's a great value for the money, and like they say, "It just works."

After we got it one of the legs came pretty bent in but we didn't want to return the product already because we needed it for the weekend. Another downside is that the lid doesn't latch on to anything so when grilling and the lid is hot you have to hold the lid in your hand. Thats very inconvenient because you cant put it down since its hot so that leaves you only one hand to grill with. Pretty disappointed.

I would recommend this hose very well made,but it is stiff at times but i can live with that.
It's fun just to see the bugs get zapped every second.  I put it up mid-late Spring in norther NJ and I live near running water so I have tons of mosquito.  The first few nights, it was insane.  Looked like fireworks and you can hear the zapping in my house all night.  It was like this for the first week or so then it started to slow.  After about 3-4 weeks, the zapping slowed even more and now after about 6-7 weeks, I get maybe one bug every 15-30 seconds.  Really reduced the flying bug and especially mosquito population.  I work outside almost every night on my garden and this thing completely decimated the mosquito population.  I think the only bad thing is it kills any flying insects but I really don't care as long as the mosquitos are gone.
But for birds, to keep in or out, it's perfect.

6677	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	These window mount feeders are a great idea...problem is, they are extremely fragile.  I've gone through 7 of these and several have been replaced by Amazon. Customer service is not the problem. Now the feeders are coming with a defective suction cup. I could tell the cup was made from a different compound as the cup is now opaque rather than clear. After a few days, the suction cup falls from the window and the fragile feeder breaks.  If the tank is not cracked it can be swapped for another base. ( I have several of these from feeders that have fallen when the base survives).  The company needs to get a better suction cup. I suppose there might be something available in a hardware store that would work. Also the tabs that connect the tank to the base break very easily.
6878	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've had one of these feeders for over 3 years now and it's still working fine. I've read other reviews that say it broke quickly and I'd have to attribute it to putting the feeder in the sun.  I had a different type of hummingbird feeder that I hung at an east facing window and it began to crack after one summer and failed after less than 2 years.  Sunshine will break down any plastic feeder quickly, causing it to crack and eventually fail. Direct sunlight will also cause your sugar water to spoil faster so you have to change it more often.  Find a northern exposure window or place it under a shady awning or eve and it will last for many years.  If you want a feeder in a sunny window, you'd better stick with a glass model.

4/9/15: The trap is almost completely full again, pretty darn amazing. The problem is that my yard is too small. I hadn't noticed it much at first, but recently we've been getting some really nice breezes (rare around here). Those breezes are spreading the STENCH everywhere, surrounding my small house. I cannot imagine why the neighbors have not said anything other than we all try to keep to ourselves. But it's making me so uncomfortable worrying about if it's bothering them that I'm going to have to pack it up. Unfortunately I missed garbage day by 1 day ... last week I took it out 2 days before garbage day and it smelled 5 houses down the block. I'm not kidding. This is NOT the fault of the product, it works as advertised.  But if you care about your neighbors, be aware of how the smell spreads as it is just about the more horrible smell ever.  lol
6219	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have many of the Perky Pet 30-ounce feeders, but this is my most recent purchase and they improved the design.

1987	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We've had one of these models in our waterfall for 4 years. It failed today after running almost continuously during that period. Our fountain is three tiered with a 4" fall spout. The top of the fountain is about 30" above the pump. The total volume of water in our fountain is less than 20 gallons. We're very pleased this pump lasted 4 years and will be purchasing this same unit as a replacement. The waterfall is outside and the sound of the pump is imperceptible. The small grill has kept out debris and we've only had to clear it once in four years - but our waterfall is in a rather clean area of the yard with no trees or other items that would clog the pump.
This zapper gave me back my porch swing.
Love it's rubber, the ONLY hose worth any investment at all, the rest are pick pockets
1582	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I noticed that, right out of the package, the shears felt a bit stiff. After light use, the blades would no longer come together at the tip and, because of this, could no longer be locked. While the blades were definitely sharp and continued to cut branches near the pruner's hinge, they were not properly adjusted and would not cut anywhere near the tip.
The only comment I can make is that this same unit is sold at Sam's Club and Walmart for the same price as Amazon.com however the one at Walmart and Sam's includes a light sensor/timer so that this can turn on and off automatically.  The unit that Amazon sells does not have this feature.

Both times the order came with the plastic junk 209B. I returned them. Perky Pet was a fool to change the design and the materials used. People used to complain the old style was hard to clean but they are just not going about it the right way. Every month, or when you see black algae growing in there, you just soak for 10 minutes in a little bleach. Not rocket science. Rinse and refill.

It really does move easily in the grass to move to the next section of gardening.  The pull out tray is useful in that I can load it up with my gardening tools, seeds, or whatever else I'll need for my yardwork. This cart is a great deal for the price.

The smaller one would still have been more than enough and would not  have drawn as much attention. This thing looks like i'm trying to have a black light party at my house.

1933	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've never seen this product in any hardware store, so I didn't know there was a heavy-duty 3/4" hose. A 3/4" hose delivers almost twice as much water per minute as a 5/8" hose, so this is great for heavy watering, and essential if you need a long hose. The red rubber hoses commonly sold have been cheapened in the past several years and no longer last more than a couple of years. I presume that this hose is as tough as the 5/8" Flexogen hoses, in which case it's a good bargain despite the rather steep purchase price.

I broke one and had to throw the whole thing away. I bought another, and have just been a little more careful. It is lightweight, since it hangs from a suction cup, so not as sturdy as the glass feeders.

The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by.

I've had my zappers for over a year now and they still effectively control the mosquito population in my south Florida yard.  What they do not tell you because they can sell more units, is that when it seems like your bulb has burned out you replace it and it still doesn't work.  Well, there is another tiny bulb under the top (get out your screwdriver) and for about $2.50 you can replace the "starter bulb" and get more years out of the zapper.  My experience is that the starter bulb (available on flowtron website) burns out faster than the u-shaped bulb that you can easily see.  Now this unit will also fry flies, lizards, and anything else that crawls or flies into it.  Follow the instructions and do NOT hang it near your door!

There have been a few times I've manually shut it off. We had a good week of torrential downpours (one or two nights were the worst I've seen in years). The Flowtron held up just fine! However, because I like to take care of anything I have to it lasts a long time, I've begun unplugging the unit during heavy rain. Although, I must reiterate, it was perfectly fine in the rain.

1294	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I like this backpack sprayer because it's just easier to make up a 3 or 4 gallon load of spray and move around our hilly property with it on my back. It's much less work than carrying a 1 or 2 gallon sprayer in one hand or on one shoulder. Having the ability to fill this with 4 gallons at a time makes the job take a little less time and that's helpful too. I didn't pay attention when I ordered and I bought this piston style this time, whereas in the past we've always bought the diaphragm style. I am not sure that I perceive a real difference in use, although they look different and there are separate instructions for each in the Solo manual. This piston backpack worked fine. I am 5'8" tall and almost 70 years old and the weight and distribution were acceptable. The rod or bar that is used to pressurize the spray is at a convenient location at the side and was easy enough to pump. The spray handle itself gave me some trouble and soon became stuck in the constant-spray position because the plastic was soft and got wedged into the little groove. That isn't good, so I knocked off a star. The spray pattern is OK. I usually use fairly large drops because it seems we always have at least a little wind and I don't want the overspray going everywhere. Not a bad sprayer, although it needs a much better spray wand.

Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.

As with all anvil loppers you have to remember not to torque the blade or twist the handles as you cut. This is what will bend even this sturdy blade.  This happens most on larger limbs where the user's upper arm and chest strength is tested, even with the compound action of the lopper, and the user tends to twist rather than squeeze the handles.  The fact is that not every user can, or should, try to cut any limb that will fit in the lopper. You can bend this sturdy tool if you use it incorrectly.

I moved it literally twenty times all over in different places in my back yard. Even up high and low. Then I even hanged smelly food on the outside grits to attract all the flies that are annoying me and my pets. NOTHING WORKED!!! It literally killed only three flies in a twenty four hour period. There is nothing that I could of done that I did not try to get this to work. Not to mention the power cord is ridiculous how short it is. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HIGH REVIEWS. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM. I AM RETURNING. And once again a company with a cheap plastic expensive product that is a piece of CRAP.
This trap is the real deal.  My wife saw a mouse scurrying in our basement under a door.  The same night, I scooped out some peanut butter from a Reeses (and ate the chocolate part, yum!) and left two traps out where she saw the mouse.  Boom!  Had him in the AM.

I hung the unit from a hook in my garage ceiling two days ago, and there are already two inches of dead flies on top of the water.

Granted I generally only cook for my girlfriend and me, but in the future I will only be using my large grill when the number of people exceed the little guys capacity. Happy grilling..
I did purchase the mosquito attractant to go with this.  The Flowtron comes with one little pack and it is good for 30 days so you might want to buy more.  I would highly recommend it if you are plagued by these bugs.  By the way..you do have to have an outdoor outlet as this is electric and has to be plugged in somewhere.

For the record, I have been using this feeder for almost forty years, with excellent results! It is a very high-quality feeder that can feed six hummers at once, and it has a 30 ounce capacity which allows me to fill it less frequently (although I sometimes have so many hummers they can empty one in a day). It also has a glass bottle. Please ... spend a bit more and buy only glass-bottled feeders for your hummers, don't waste your money on acrylic ones. Glass feeders are higher quality, they do not discolor, and they keep the nectar inside more cool and fresh for a longer period of time. Your hummers will thank you for it.

As has been noted in other reviews, this mower will not cut most weeds (crabgrass, dandelion, nutgrass, sedges, vetches, most any broadleaf, or anything with a stalk), so a fairly uniform yard is necessary for proper operation.  The other bane to reels is sticks, so if you have few white oaks or other tree species that shed a lot of debris, you may have some issues.  The tiny sticks are actually the worst, because you don't see them and they hang between the blade and the reel, so even picking up the yard prior to mowing sometimes is not enough.

1. Hang it away from your desk or any object that you would linger around at.  Since it attracts the bugs .. it will be the hotspot for them .. so no chairs, benches, playstructures or anything in the near vicinity.

5051	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Made in China doesn't sit well with me but this reel mower proved its worth after its 1st use. I used to own an American made reel mower, thought it was the right one to buy, but I was proven wrong. Used to fight with my old one, go over the same spots repeatedly to cut those few blades of grass, & constantly adjust those screws, where as this beauty cleanly cuts just about everything in front of it & I barely break a sweat. It's one of those tools that deserves to be treated well after use. Do yourself a favour & be sure to keep it cleaned, covered, & oiled after each use. Do that & you'll stop hating the day you need to use it. You'll actually enjoy mowing the yard. I do, now.

2767	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	There are times when old technology wins out over new.  This Snath is good solid wood, with steel bands for the hand grips. They are not so tight they can't be moved, but because of the shape of the snath arm, they can only be adjusted so far.  So that might be limiting for some people.  there are also three different holes for mounting the end of the scythe blade but not a clue as to what each one is for and what is best.  While there are lots of videos out there about using a scythe, only found one about mounting the blade itself.  Still not sure I've got it right.  Do not have acres of  grasses to cut, but do have some tough weeds that defeat all the different electric and gas weed wackers I've tried - hence the scythe.  and while I may not have it right, it does the job nicely

845	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased (4) 50' sections of this hose last year based on it's ratings. My experience with it is that it is by no means kink free. Although better than the "contractor grade" rubber hoses previously purchased, kinking is a serious issue with this alleged kink-free product. Meanwhile, Craftsman hoses purchased over 35 years ago as are Swan hoses purchased at BJ's about 15 years ago are far superior and still in use.

Quality Control Problems:

4101	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I wanted a machine that doesn't make noise like the gas one does, and had my eyes on this. Unfortunately, it jams frequently and I had to return it. Returning process with amazon is easy as always.
7112	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Difficult to set. Very strong setting mechanism. I bought 4 and only caught one mole in three months. They are very sensative when you set the trap; don't appear so sensative when the mole goes through-unscathed. If you don't prepare the dirt mound under the trap just perfectly, the mole detects the trap and tunnels around it.
There are all sorts of bugs in there from mosquitos to moths to lady bugs, etc.  It seems to be very effective.  I simply put it on a timer and run it every night.

This heavy brass nozzle has no press fittings to fail. Instead of two pieces press fit together as described above, Dramm has machined the inner core and the part that screws onto the hose out of one solid piece of brass. It'll still crack if you leave it outside and presurized during a freeze, but at least it won't break as a result of a poor manufacturing technique.**]

If you are far down the "gas path" as we were...maybe go back to your grill-by-fire-roots? This little Weber will get you there. :)
The picture is a little deceiving though, it looks more like a straight blade, vs the curved... so don't let the picture through you off. It is shapped exactly like the OEM.
Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.

It's a live trap, but I'm in no hurry to empty it and if they are still alive I fill a bucket with water and drown them. It's cruel, but I'm not opening the lid or taking them to my neighbors house while they are alive. I tried launching one off a 40ft cliff but it landed and ran off, damn things are sturdy. Drowning is quick. Yes I could use a snap trap, but I can't catch multiple mice with the snap traps. I caught at least 50 mice this summer with these traps.

So, if YOU are buying this hose for the Lifetime Warranty.  Dont.  And, if you think it will last a long time.  It didnt.  Don't believe me.  Check the picture.  Since there is no way to contact anyone in Customer Service at GILMOUR and they have no Facebook page, this One Star Review and picture will have to suffice.
Potential buyers should note that Weber has unique measurements for their grill grates, and you must match them to your particular model.  However, I did not buy these grates for a Weber grill; I have a CharBroil/Thermos grill with strange sized grates that I could not find replacements for two - three years after purchase.  The Weber measurements came the closest, although there is a 1/4" to 1/2" overlap, which the closed lid rests on.  If you find yourself in the same predicament, my set-up works well, even with the grill top closed, with no appreciable heat loss.  The inside of the grill still gets darned hot.
205	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Assembly was a pain since the instructions are awful. As I recall, at least one of the split pins holding the tires on is almost impossible to "spread" effectively, and the long threaded adjustment bar for the flow control was too long, causing it to foul the mechanism, making it impossible to fully close, until I fixed it with judicious use of a hacksaw. Took me about 2 hours to get it together.

6140	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Before I could secure the base, a few rabits had gotten into the garden.  As I came out of the house, they made a run for it and I actually watched as one hit the net, was paused for a split second and then kept going.  the other rabbit just ran right through. In both cases, there were nice, rabbit-sized holes in the bottom of of the fencing.  Great concept, easy install (I pounded 10' lenghts of 1/2" conduit in every 10' or so) but buy something with more strength.
2ndly - I BBQ once a week and this thing makes it easy.
My grass was already about 5 or 6 inches in some places. The soil was saturated and the grass itself was still wet from lots of rain. But once the machine and I got to know each other, I was able to mow the lawns faster than the rider mowers in the neighborhood. Simply walking behind it at a normal pace turns out to be exactly the right speed to efficiently cut the first time. I did have to fluff up some patches with my hands and go over them again, but that's because they were long, fine, and weighed down with rain.

2288	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I have 2 full size Chapin pump sprayers that perform very well.  Bought the little hand pump, it performed well, so I bought 3 more to have one for each type of product I use.  None of the 3 worked - the first one still does.  The defective ones hold pressure and spray effectively for about 30 seconds and then just dribble.  No adjustment I made was effective.
2809	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy and easy to use. The advantage of this is that you can feed all your bushes and trees as often as you need without hiring an expensive arborist. Yes, the water preassure from the arborist truck might be greater so they open more airating tunnels, but with this tool if you do it more often you get the same effect at a fraction of the cost.

You get the blank seed plates from Earthway. BUT THEY DON'T COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS. You'll have to contact Customer Service to have them e-mail you the instructions.
Mosquito attractant came with the 'zapper', wrapped in plastic with instructions. All I had to do was put the double sided tape on the proper side and then stick it to the bottom of the zapper, where there is a spot for it. I peeled off the sticky cover and then it was ready to go. When I first peeled off the sticky cover to the attractant, there were noxious fumes that smelled similar to rubbing alcohol and/or acetone. The smell quickly faded.

I gave the consumer hotline the 'Key No.', 'Part Description', and 'Part No.' from the owner's manual. A week or so later the wrong part arrived. The part looked like it had been taken off a new machine (unused but assembled). After calling again, another week or so later the correct part came (again it appeared unused but had been assembled on an existing machine).
Now on to the actual review. This thing works surprisingly well. I hadn't expected it to be a $500 Echo, so I was pleasantly surprised at it's performance. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is for the sensitive tips that other reviewers had mentioned. If it had came with a metal bumper of sorts, it would be an easy five stars. BUY THIS ATTACHMENT!
It would also work well for holding hanging potted plants in place during severe storms or strong winds if you didn't happen to be home to unhook them from a standard hanger before the storm.

The racks this grill comes with get pretty hot and give your grilled proteiens and veggies a beautiful set of grill marks.  They cook your food evenly as well.  The top rack is chrome and on two sides it can open up to add more coals while cooking.  Not something I do too much because I add the proper amount of coals and generally only cook for two people so I am done quick.  When entertaining this may play a huge role as more coals will probably be needed eventually.

- Always flush out sprayer (with clean water) to avoid cross contamination with other contents as well as ensuring no clogging for later use. I do this for all my sprayers and they still works great after many years.
1450	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.

>> Ratcheted loppers give you more leverage (like compound or geared loppers, but more so) because of the ratchet mechanism, so you can squeeze, spread the handles again (without opening the jaws, and squeeze again closing the jaws some more. So, you can open the jaws wide without having to open the arms. The disadvantage of ratcheted loppers is that they are more time consuming) to use---it takes more time to "pump": the arms 4 times to close them, than just once. . So although fine for thin or soft-wood branches (especially in tight spaces), racheted loppers are best for thick hardwood branches, or individuals with limited arm strength, for example, because of arthritis.  Since ratcheted loppers are usually built for heavy-duty use, they are usually much heavier than  comparable light-duty loppers.

I've emailed Perky Pet about this issue, which they acknowledge.  That's been a couple years ago, and I bought a new one this spring, because last year's broke.  Well, two weeks ago, a prong broke off, and I know I'm on borrowed time.  I will not buy another of these, since the problem hasn't been resolved.  I'll look for a window feeder by another manufacturer.  This is the only Perky Pet feeder I've had a problem with, and I would not recommend it.

It plowed through rotted posts, clay and stones with absolutely no problem. It's easy to attach the handle and off you go. I have one more inline gate post to do. Looking forward to it. If you have to do it, add a small sledge hammer, a tape measure and a reciprocal battery operated saw and you are in business.

The zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will "sacrifice" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).

3954	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised at the poor reviews these soaker  hoses have gotten on Amazon. I have been using them for a number of years and they have worked better than any other soaker hose I have tried. I originally came across these at Home Depot but hadn't seen them there in awhile and according to Amazon Gilmour has discontinued this hose. I was glad to see that Amazon still has a supply of them. Originally I bought 1/2 inch soaker hoses because they were all I could find and what I use them for is to keep the soil around my house slab wet enough so that the soil won't shrink causing the slab to sink into the ground. The 1/2 half inch hoses were better than nothing but didn't last long and didn't seem to put out a decent amount of water. I eventually came across these Gilmour 5/8 inch hoses at the above mentioned store and have been using them ever since as I am very happy with how well they work. When I route these hoses around the slab of my house they stay there year round. Eventually the exposure to the soil and the UV rays of the sun will deteriorate the hose after so many years and then I replace it. I replaced a fifty foot section just the other day because it developed a small crack but couldn't remember how many years ago I installed it. I had one spare section that I replaced it with and decided to buy three more sections to replace the rest of it as needed. I am one of the very few homeowners in my neighborhood that hasn't had major foundation damage from the extremely dry weather we have had in recent years and I credit using these soaker hoses with keeping my soil stabilized. I can't speak for any one else but I highly recommend these Gilmour 5/8 inch soaker hoses. They have saved me thousands of dollars in foundation repair costs.

Cleaning hasn't been a huge issue, either -- I use a standard grill brush on the grill, and wash the removable plate that sits over the burner with soap and water in the kitchen sink.  A quick wipe down of the exterior, and we're good to go.
3.  The bump button works for about 50% of the time.  Once, I laid the leading hose across another hose.  When the sprinkler got to the crossing hose, it struck the bump button and prematurely shut off the sprinkler.  A couple times, I came out to find the runaway sprinkler happily watering about 3 feet past the bump ramp and off of the hose.

It is clean, easy, simple to store and use, plus cost much less.
Comment: After I bought it, I found for a few $ more, there is a Smokey Joe slightly larger but still portable. The extra grill cooking space would be nice. Also, if they had a bottom vent to let air in, the charcoal would light better with out having to fan it.

Perhaps some others have gotten a not so good batch, but mine turned out to be as indicated on the description, so it works for me just fine.  I gave it the four stars, not because it's really high quality wire, but because it will function fine for light duty with no problems.  And the price can't be beat.  The heavier standard 2" chicken wire is three times as expensive as this stuff.

The unit has two bulbs that are easy to replace.  Each one is held into place with a plastic clip-in cup sort of affair.  This cup also doubles as the holder for the MA-1000 Octenol attractant cartridges, although I have yet to use those.  The unit does come with one sample cartridge so you can try it.  The instructions say the light heats up the cartridge and then it gives off its scent to attract mosquitos.  Like I say, I haven't had a chance to try it; it seems to work fine without it.

4230	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	For a reasonably maintained lawn, this mower is almost effortless to use.  The mower runs on two wheels and two rollers, so pushing it is like pushing a toy cart.  It takes not much effort to push it along foot paths to the destination, and about the same effort on the lawn if your lawn is reasonably flat.  A little momentum will cut the grass effortlessly.  The mower feels a little heavy, otherwise it will not stay on the lawn when you push it.  It's not a problem for a lack-of-exercise person to lift it up and down for a while with one hand.

These bypass pruning shears, a newer product offering that was only ever made in China, is a case in point. Their quality is pitiful, especially given the relatively high price point compared to other China junk. The blade is garbage and cuts like you'd expect from poorly made-in-China pruners, i.e. not very well if at all. They jam up constantly, even on light duty jobs, because they are neither polished nor coated to prevent plant material from sticking to them and gumming up the hinge. Furthermore, the button mechanism to lock/unlock also constantly locks itself in the middle of being used, resulting in complete work stoppage to unlock it again. If you're wearing gloves appropriate to doing most yard work, this can be a real pain, because you need to remove them to wrestle with this stupid thing over and over when it locks itself for the umpteenth time.

Like I mentioned earlier: I didn't take any stars off for any ONE of these complaints, but all together they do (and should) add up to a "not perfect" rating.

2074	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is indeed a useful tool.  I have used it to clear privet (15'+) and small saplings (15-25'+) - over several acres and still going.  The tool arrives sharp and ready for action.  It is not a "felling ax" for trees (40'+).  The blade is narrow and has a deep bite meaning that it is not easy to disengage from the wood if swung too hard.  But, if used on smaller dia. trunks (2-6"), it is a "hot knife through butter" experience.  2" trunks or limbs can be severed in one stroke.  It can be swung one-handed if you know how to control it and have the strength to do so, but always - always make sure of the downward path of the ax and NOT have your leg in the way.  This is a "grown-up" tool - no play toy!  A careless mistake can cripple or (if an artery is severed) kill you.  Not for children.  The ax is single forged and is extremely sturdy.  The handle length allows for two-handed use with proper back clearance.  I'm 5'9", shorter arms... if taller and longer arms, two-handed use might be a little uncomfortable - but doable.  The rubber cushioned handle (lower portion) absorbs a lot of shock.  Like said, if you're experienced with using an ax, you'll love this one.  Best use - trunks up to 8" dia., limbs, brush, small firewood jobs .... excellent camping tool.  As always, using the proper tool for the job is key.  Trunks > 8" probably best dispatched with a chainsaw.  I look forward to many years with this ax.  Keep it oiled (no rust) - sheathed when not in use - stored safely - and Sharpen when needed.  Dull blades cause more accidental cuts than sharp ones.  (no incentives were offered or received for this review)
9885	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It is what it is.  An inexpensive plastic rake with a wooden handle.  I have had several of these rakes over time.

Works great ... if it holds air !

...and, for the final straw, when I brought this disaster back into the garage to give it a once over, to make sure that it was as bad as it seemed and not just operator error, well, then I noticed that the axle was either cut or drilled wrong on both ends.  As I looked over this POJ I noticed that the left wheel, which, BTW, is mounted onto a plastic rim and not at all commercial quality, the axle is recessed into the spindle area by at least a half inch, and it sticks out about an inch on the right side from the spindle area.

The main difference I see between a reel mower and a gas mower is that the gas mower creates air suction and pulls up grass that is lying flat and cuts everything the same size. It also sucks stuff off the ground and chops it up too (leaves,sticks,grasshoppers) so there is the composting effect.
I'm picking up another of this model 209 to have two going at the same time, and to have a least one still out when cleaning the other with hot water & bleach.

A grass collecting bag is not necessary.  If you cut the grass while it's still wet, the cut grass will stuck together into a heap when you rake through the lawn.

I've bought these for myself, family and recommended them to everyone with mole problems.


Only issue is lack of ease to see into the trap to see if there is a mouse inside.  I purposefully selected this model knowing this might be the case. You do need to back light the air holes to get light inside, which will mean, in most cases, you will have to pick up the box to look inside.

9859	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Now I remember why I hated using these things as a kid.  They don't really cut grass well.  You need a lot of bat speed on them to get them to cut, so make sure that no one is too close to you.  I thought this would be useful in clearing grass around the edges of my gardens, but it looks like I'll be back to using the weed wacker.
Bottom line: THIS IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF CHARCOAL GRILLS!!!!! NO OTHER CHARCOAL GRILL EVEN COMES CLOSE!!!!!
Bulbs it comes with are a whiter light and fairly bright
I find the handle to be a bit short for me, I'm 6'1" so I have to bend over to use it (must have been built for a midget).  You need to keep the hopper clean and free of dirt and clean the seed plates before and after use (especially with coated seed like sweet corn).
I will purchase again if i need another.
1342	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.
9226	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I read a ton of negative reviews about this bug zapper. How it killed everything else but mosquitoes, how it got clogged up, how expensive it is to replace the bulb, how many beneficial bugs get killed, and so forth. I live in Houston, which is swampy and humid and a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. I also live in the middle of the city and we have no use for bugs around here, even in a 30-mile radius it is all an urban area. So I figured I could zap at will. I always had a problem with mosquitoes on my back porch. In the summer they would swarm around my pets and make them miserable. We had citronella candles, we have multiple porch fans, but nothing seems to stop the bloodsuckers. I installed the Flowtron zapper on a wall bracket about 15-20 feet from the porch. It kills a decent amount of bugs. The dead bugs look mostly like mosquitoes. The bad reviews said these were not actually mosquitoes but some other species which just looked like mosquitoes. In any case, I notice a significant reduction of my mosquito problem. I would even claim that I may have solved my mosquito problem for the time being. I also noticed that the zapper killed some drywood termites, which I take a bonus.

I do make sure to clean them out with hot soapy water if I use pesticide or herbicide since they tend to leave a greasy film. In an attempt to repel deer in my garden, I used a raw egg concoction and the sprayer handled it ok.  The concoction had marginal success with the deer which is better than anything else I've tried (I used a Ninja food processer to mix one egg with 3 cups of warm water, then strained the mixture into a sprayer.  I would have added pepper but I've tried pepper solutions before with no success)

After you get the hang of holding this thing at the right angle, it cleanly slices through the stem and the 360 degree "looped" form of the blade lets you kind of flip the plant right into a bin or wheelbarrow without every touching the plant in most cases.  That is a real plus where I live as most desert weedy plants are stickery, spiny or otherwise difficult to handle.  I never knew this tool existed until I found an ancient version of it in the back corner of my garage, having been left by the previous tenant, apparently.

It cuts the grass very well and you can adjust the blade.  My only gripe is that it works wonderfully if your yard is completely flat.  I have a few dips and small slope and I definitively had to go back and forth over several sections which was time consuming and a little frustrating. Make sure to cut your grass weekly because it is more labor intensive if the grass is higher.  On the plus side, it gives me a great workout and my grass is cut low!

3632	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	100% Satisfied. I'm not sure if I've ever cut grass so well. Much better than a gas powered rotary blade for quality of cut.
The right back wheel was defective and so was the metal plate that it was mounted to, neighbor tried to figure out a way to jimmie and correct but it wasn't possible so eventually it rubbed metal to metal and the wheel fell off.
This makes the reel turn in reverse when pushing which is what it needs to do when the compound is on to sharpen it.  You the adjust the cutter bar a little tighter - apply compound - push up and down the driveway or around the garage.  Re-apply compound and adjust bar again if needed. This save A LOT OF TIME and/or manual cranking forever with the supplied handle. Some use a drill adapter, but I like this better because the reel flies and and you can make the cutter bar a little tighter. Sharper and quicker in my opinion. Guess it depends on you patience. Plus I didn't want to risk screwing with something on the end of the shaft. There is enough compound included to sharpen the mower for years . . . you'll probably never need it again unless it dries out.

It was easy to set up; we hung it on a ornamental plat hanger from the side of our shed. Ran an outdoor power cord (make sure you get a properly rated, outdoor power cord for safety and code) to it, added an outdoor timer with a dusk/dawn setting, and it automatically goes on and off right when I want it to.
Also these shears open quite widely, making the [un-padded] handles difficult to grip around and impossible for smaller hands.to use.  I returned them and started looking for an alternative.
It is 15ft long.
I used aluminum straps to attach my wooden tail feather anchor to the feeder. You could also use plastic shipping straps (these straps are used to hold together large cardboard boxes and are often thrown away once the cardboard box is open). You will two straps, 5/8 wide and 5-6 long. For plastic straps you need to have a round hole at each end to attach it to your wooden anchor. Holes can easily be made by heating under a flame a large nail and pushing it through the plastic strapping. The nail will melt a hole for you. If you use metal straps, try to use aluminum. I had scrap aluminum from a company that was installing a new aluminum gutter for a home. Once I cut the aluminum to size, I drill a hole at each end of the strap.

Given the performance of this hose/nozzle combination, I think most people would find it far superior to 1/2- or 5/8-inch household hose applications.
I can't endorse this enough. If you have a fly problem this will help! As others have noted, this would not be appropriate for indoor use. It does emit an odor.

The 80 watt output (two 40 watt bulbs) put out lots of UV light which really draws in the bugs to their demise. The octenol lures are very strong, much stronger than the one I used to get for the Stinger zapper and really draw in the Mosquitos. Mosquitos seem to love me and will find me in a crowd, but with the Flowtron on and the octenol lures in it I don't get bothered by those blood suckers anymore.

I would have giving a 5 star on this hose, but I was spoiled after using those flex hoses, pocket hoses etc. but those hoses are worthless and do not recommend these types of hoses to anybody. I am hoping Gilmour will perfect that type of hose and make a light weight flex hose that will last, I know Gilmour could do this and this company or any other company that could perfect that design would make these types of hoses obsolete.

7817	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a good old fashioned bug zapper that really gets the job done. I've searched for one of these for years in the store, but the alternatives that they stock these days all seem to be underpowered or too dim to attract insects. This one is bright and it packs a punch, vaporizing any mosquito, moth, or other insect annoyance instantly when it touches the wire cage inside. Installation is easy too - just find a spot (usually away from your deck or wherever people congregate), run a wire there, and plug it in.
7834	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to make a large area sprinkler for my 1 acre lawn.  Works great with my creek pump to cover a 50-60 foot circle.  I put it on wheels so I can start it out at the far end and pull it forward as necessary to cover lawn.
Instructions are a mess.  There are many many pieces to try to figure out how to put together.  I was amazed at how many parts there were

9825	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I found almost no local retailer who carried this item although they did carry the type with the frame attached at both ends of the blade, and after trying to use it I think I may know why.  I was quite willing to sharpen the tool, and did so three times in slightly different ways.  Although it had a very sharp edge I most often could not make it cut well.  Performance seemed to depend upon what I was trying to cut; with just the right vegetation it did well.  But more often than not it did not do well. I tested it by trying to cut the vegetation growing in roadside ditches which was mixed, but all tender shoots, not hard, woody stems.  I did my best to find a proper technique and never did.  It may have been my fault, but the tool did not work well for me as I hoped to use it.
Above is my first review. The zapper portion quit working after 3 months. Still lights up but nothing is getting zapped. Anyone need a couple barely used Flowtron 40 watt bulbs?

Tip #2: fo look at the source of the mosquitoes and strategically place these. Even though it cover 1.5 acres a piece, you can get more out of it placing it close to the source of the evil. DO NOT place it where it does not stand out, ie. do not choose to hide it out of sight, place it where you need it.

9506	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have a mulberry tree next to my driveway and for six miserable weeks each summer, I have berries dropping all over the place. Of course, the flies eventually show up to feast on them. This year was particularly bad, and we even had a horde of moths show up. It got so bad that when we would drive up at night, we had to drive through a cloud of insects, which is when I decided to buy this Flowtron product. I have had similar products before and they all seem to work pretty much the same. I mounted this one about four feet high near the driveway and turned it on. It instantly attracted the moths and within a day or two, they were no longer a problem. The flies were a bit harder to get rid of, because they hatch new flies every week or so. But this product thinned out their numbers to an acceptable level until the berries stopped falling. Next year I will put this in place early and hope to prevent the insect explosion that I experienced this year.

I have irrigation at my home and really like it but didn't want to spend the $ on a built in system for a rental house,(but I like my properties to look nice) so this Nelson yellow tractor works great. The lawn was so burnt and brown, then after just 3 times with this tractor it needs to be mowed, and the lawn looks good again. It puts the water on perfectly and consistant. It's as good as an irrigation system if not better. (as far as amount of water being applied) The only work involved is placing down the hose and wraping it up, If you call that work? You won't regret buying it if you have a flat lawn.  From the other (negitive) reviews I've read, it sounds like people try to water mud! Up hills in the mountains. I really like it and you will too. Get ready to mow! And one other thing! Keep your eyes on it because some low life will steal it! It's too bad, but very true.
6494	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have tried several mole traps, including the nasty looking one that drives the spikes into the ground.  I really don't like that one because I think it's more dangerous to me than it is to the moles.
P.S. we are surrounded by deep woods central Massachusetts.
I have it plugged into a timer so it isn't on during the day so I don't kill the beneficial pollinators of my garden.

In summary, I am very pleased with this mower.  It more than meets my expectations.
The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.

9621	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Ames True Temper rake filled the bill for the work we had to do. We needed to clean up the yard before putting down new grass seed. There was lots of dead grass left there by a gardener who never cleaned up after himself. After working on that, we pulled tons of crab grass. It was a lot of work, but this rake was the best tool for the job, standing up to the piles of stuff we cleared out. I consider the price quite moderate for the quality of the tool!
3860	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I really like the way this hose works.  It can be used as a sprinkler hose or soaker.  Having said that---they don't last long.  Hose expand rapidly and rendered unuse able.  Won't buy again.
7504	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	These Flowtron items are junk. They don't even last a year, and the company would not honor the warranty because it was purchased online. I have had 4 of them and all failed in only 5 - 6 months. Wsted money on new bulbs, but the problems were in the circuitry. New bulbs don't fix the problems.

4945	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great! I was missing some clips and Amazon made sure I was satisfied.
This trap works best if the opening is along the path the mice travel, which is usually along the wall.  I had the front door of the trap facing the wall, and the mouse went right on in for his one way trip out.

For the first two weeks the zapper was almost in continual "zap mode" when it was dark (the constant zapping sound would have been annoying if I didn't take such satisfaction in what it was doing).  I would sometimes go stand on the porch and watch mosquito after mosquito dive into it.  Then the frequency of the zapping started to diminish as the population thinned out.  Towards the end of summer it would only zap once every few minutes.

Adjusting the height of the blades is also no big deal. I want to kill a few patches of lawn and replace it with flowers. So I lowered the blades all the way (takes 5 seconds right in the field, no tools) to cut that grass much shorter). I couldn't say whether that's harder or easier to do with this machine than others. I hadn't even expected to need such a feature so I didn't shop for it. But I'm really glad to have it.
3456	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	good
works fine.

I would buy it again.
9888	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The edge is so blunt that tool would pull the grass out with the roots, rather than cut it.  I found that sharpening serrated edge without specialized tools is quite a chore, I wish manufacturer would charge more, but sell the tool pre-sharpened.
I tried and tried and no way can I do it.  The part on the large piece that's supposed to slide down to allow you to remove the smaller part will not slide down.  And yes I did turn the shutoff sideways to give me more room and still no good.

4306	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Worked on my mower.  It took long to sharpen the incredibly old blades.  I had to very slightly tighten the main cutting bar and wipe/apply the lapping compound about four times before getting good results.  It takes very little compound to sharpen. After the last application and tightening I turned the blades back with the included handle a few hundred times and as it started turning easily it got a very smooth action.  It mows like a dream now.

If you are working on cleaning out flower beds and need to cut new borders, this really is what you need. Now I just have to haul new lava rocks out to the areas we are working on and lay down landscaping fabric. Somehow with this edger, it all seems worthwhile.

9503	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to replace a "Stinger" bug zapper that died shortly after I bought it.  The Flowtron is in another class- the grid stays cleaner, obviously making more voltage when it's powered up, and incinerates the bugs as it should, and it has already lasted twice as long as the stinger with no problems at all.  Stay away from the Stinger models and get one of these.
I purchased (2) 100' hoses.  My wife didn't turn the water faucet off and the temperature went up to 105-106 degrees for 2-days.  The things didn't split open and they retained their shape.

1102	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This sprinkler was supposed to the the only one of it's design to buy but it worked for only a few weeks before the internal gear system failed.  I was told the gear kit is replaceable but after finding that it's all made of plastic I tossed the whole thing in the trash and went back to my old style metal sprinkler.  You'd think, considering the price of these things, that they'd make them better.

Highly Recommended!
after 3 long years of use, it's still holding up. dirty, stained....but still solid. the rubber handle has not melted as I had feared, but I am careful to not put it too close to the heat. I fashioned my own string loop to hang it with. this is made of thick steel and it won't bend or break under normal use. I still don't care for the shallow angle that the flipper is at in relation to the handle, but that's just a personal preference thing
2156	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to keep in my camping trailer.  The axe was very sharp when it arrived and splits small firewood with ease.  The size of this axe is between a hand axe and a full-sized axe.  It is well made and includes a sheath for the head.  I was not careful the first time I removed the sheath and cut my hand on the blade.  Again, it was very sharp when it arrived.

I have tried many sprayers through the years... and in general, back mount is my fav.  I also have the back mount solo battery sprayer...while it is nice to not have to pump, it adds a lot of weight, size and u always have to remember to charge it up.  Then, the batteries don't last forever... so if you use these for occasional home use, and your back is strong enough to suppor this weight, this pump model is by far the BEST unit to own.  I have not had one fail on me yet...and no one wants to mess with repairing an item like this.  I guess at some point, the seals will wear down, and I will have to replace them, not a big deal.  my oldest one is 4 yrs old.

Balancing the disadvantages with the advantages, the extra 15-20 minutes of your time are worth the trouble. In fact, I purchased a second head as a "backup." It is still in storage after five years. The first is still functioning and has outlasted two grass trimmers to which it was attached.

3224	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is my second year using the B&D Edge Hog. The first time cutting the edging required patience, because the amount of material being removed can clog the Hog. Gradual forward and backward action cuts and clears the way and creates a beautiful edge. The second time is a charm, the hog rips through without a snag. The amount of water in the soil affects the cutting capability, so I would not recommed using the hog if the moisture content in the soil is high. A moist soil is the best condition as dust is reduced and the cutting ability is maximized.

7592	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have had the Flowtron BK-80D every sence the first of last summer 2014 and have now had to replace both bulbs. The first one went out about 2 months after purchase. The second about a week ago 7/ 2015. The BF-150 Bulb I order this year would not push into the socket for the four prongs were two large. So I sanded the prongs down and the bulb would fit. I also noticed that for my BK-80D that when I first bought it last year the tops of the bulbs would would not light up blue just orange. So I turned the bulbs around and put them in and they both lit up solid blue. No where does it say the bulbs has to be a certain direction, but mine do are they will not light up totally blue. The name Flowtron made in China has to be facing inward toward each other. Am I the only one with this problem or is it just my Flowtron? The other problem is mine does not draw mosquitoes. I had a Flowtrom about 15 years ago and you could hear and see the Flowtron drawing mosquitoes all night long. Also you could not get close to the older Flowtron because it was surrounded by mosquitoes. Thats why I bought a Flowtron again but this new one does not draw mosquitoes. I don't know if we have a new breed of mosquitoes that are not drawn by the Bug Light or the newer Flowtron does not work like the older one I had. I also have a half an acre Flowtron BK-15D and this one does not draw mosquitoes either. Mosquitoes seem to laugh at both. Ha, Ha!

I had a lot of problems with it turning itself off.  So I had to disable the bottom valve whose only function that I know of is to turn the unit off at the end of the run when it hits the little plastic ramp.  I would rather just turn it off manually. Just be sure it doesn't stop on anything and start spinning its wheels or the gearbox may break. The spray arms are fully adjustable and it is not possible to be consistent in their placement.  The speed selector has neutral in the middle, high and low on the sides.  Took getting my glasses on to figure out why it wouldn't go. At the high speed setting, it goes too fast to put down the inch of water I want, but the lower speed does a better watering job.  I guess we have high water pressure here, because I don't understand the reviews that thought it didn't put out enough water.  Because the unit is rather heavy and time consuming to carry it back to the starting point and replace the hose where you want it, we try to get the necessary water on one run.  I know there are better, more expensive versions of this but so far so good.  It is easier and cheaper than putting in an underground system with pop-ups and we can't do that anyway here because of winter freeze.  I find moving stationary sprinklers to be too much work for me, and leaving hoses down in the same place can quickly kill the grass beneath.  This unit goes some way toward applying water around on my yard and plantings where I need it.  Note -- this is only for flat, well-established yards.

This is a great option when aesthetics matter too - it does not stand out. You have to see it from an angle and in the right light to know it is even there, and it just looks like a dark patch.
All in all, it's great if you have a flat surface to mow and keep it raked and free of debris.
If I want to smoke food, I wrap 1/2 to 1 cup of pre-soaked wood chips in a long, thin folded piece of heavy duty aluminum foil (be sure to use heavy duty) and set it directly on one side of the flavor bar under the grate.

As everyone else stated, this takes a few hours to assemble because of the nut/bolt assembly system.  It comes knocked down as a series of panels.  They fit together very well and as long as you follow the instructions, it goes smoothly.  If you are impatient and clumsy, don't get this item as it will make you a blood donor with the many exposed sharp edges during assembly.  Once together, it's a very solid and well made item.
866	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	These pruning shears are supposed to be one of the top five rated models out on the market. I purchased a pair after a smaller pair was lost. I purchased from a big box store about a year ago. At first they seemed to work fine and cut well. I have many trees of various types on my property that I must keep pruned to avoid being raked while cutting the lawn. I have oaks, maples, ornamental pears, and white pines. We also prune various shrubs on the property. This spring is the second season we have pruned with these shears and the first one with heavy use. I had trouble with the branches twisting and getting jammed between the blade and anvil. A majority of the cuts were fine, but eventually I noticed the cuts became more of a tear as opposed to a clean cut as expected. This makes it harder to do the job as it requires me to wrestle with the tool to complete the cut. Eventually the handle covers came off. On examination of the shears I noticed that the edge of the blade was chipped and curled over making it dull.

2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.

1437	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I was looking for in a spray nozzle.  Most you find at the store these days are made of cheap plastic that either falls apart, leaks, or ends up cracking!  This one is metal, and has a good solid feel in your hands.  The included rubber washer has a good seal on my hose and doesn't leak, even at full pressure.  I get a good stream of water, and can vary the flow easily to a fine wide mist easily.
652	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Work great

This sprinkler is beefy. It's all metal except for the wheels and some parts where the sprinkler tubes that rotate come out and the piston on the bottom are plastic. When a 100 ft. water filled hose is attached to it and you are trying to pull it across the lawn, it's not for lightweights. This device has 2 speeds, Lo and Hi.  Both change the gear ratio such that the crawling a little faster in Hi gear than Lo. The idea behind the two gears is to vary the amount of water you put down on the lawn by changing the movement speed. The instructions provide a chart that shows the inches of water it will lay down for a given diameter size water pattern and speed of crawl. You can select the diameter and speed for your needs. I discovered that the smaller the diameter, the faster the Lo and Hi speed is. This is because the smaller diameter results in the spray nozzles rotating at a faster speed, hence faster crawling. This makes sense since the water flow rate to the lawn is faster so you wouldn't want it going the same speed for huge diameter vs small diameter.  Keep this in mind when setting the diameter and how much time it will take to crawl the hose to the bridge.

3218	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use this to dig small 1" deep trenches for automatic watering lines (drip irrigation).  This protects them from damage.  All I have to do is move the flexible line aside, then run this unit along the tube's route, then a parallel trench alongside it;  a simple hoe or other tool takes out the space in-between the two lines that it cut.  It's a great work saver and does a neat job.  It has the power and is easy to use - although it does kick-up a bit of airborne dust ahead of it when digging (not usually a problem, however).  When digging with it, just remember to only push it as fast as you can without lugging the motor down (wherein it could get too hot).  Again, it has plenty of power, so again, this isn't usually a problem.  I've cut through dry clay that a pick-ax bounced off of - but this unit dug right into it.  I'd advise that you should use it only in dry soil, as cleaning mud off of it is tedious.
I bought this mower and with "Prime" it was at my door in two days. It's a snap to put together and I mowed the lawn that weekend.
7585	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	At first I did not think it worked very well (all directions followed) but after much thought I put it on a timer for early morning hours and evening hours every day. Every is the key word in order to reduce the general population as these pests are not exactly rapidly attracted to this "zapper", if it kills enough of them, you won't get bit very often and a much price better than other systems.
Nuts wobbled off while mowing, lost them before I bought the blue stuff to keep them in place.  I know my way around a tool box--my neighbor borrowed it and said he tightened the ones that wobbled off on him and the next time I mowed they started to wobble off too.  So, in case you think it's a gender thing, it's not.  He commented that he didn't think the mower was very durable.

When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.

Upon other reviews I decided to give this unit a try. I use bug zappers in my garden to take care of corn earworms and other pests that derive from moths but the ones I have used in the past (Stinger) were jokes and hardly lasted a season. I put up two of these Flowtron units and was working in the barn after the sun went down and I noticed I could hear this light zapping sound coming from the garden. It wasn't loud enough to be moths so I went out to investigate. I found a cloud of mosquitoes swarming around the Flowtron and so many were diving into the light and getting burned to a crisp that is literally smelled like burning hair. We must have taken out tens of thousands of the pest that first night alone. I have already ordered replacement octenol lures and plan on doing what others have suggested and put out a new one every two weeks. I am very pleased and have already suggested these units to neighbors. Buy with confidence.

As long as your saw has enough power (keep it tuned) these chains will cut your work time.  They don't stay sharp any longer than other Oregon chains I've used but that isn't a problem for me since I machine sharpen them 2-3 times before tossing them out.  These fit my Echo CS400 nicely.

7412	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I find it hard to believe that I have been using this same little gas grill for over a dozen years. For what little I invested in this in the first place this has been one of the best values I have ever purchased.  This year I did notice some rust on the flavor bar, so I may be in the market for a new grill within the next couple of years.  I was surprised to find out that these are still available, I have not seen them in any store for years. It seems that storing mine in the shed when not using it has prolonged its life, call me crazy but I just can't see leaving a grill out in the weather year round then wonder why it would rust. The only real down side I have had with this grill is that it will go out in windy conditions and it does cook hotter at the end away from the tank, however given the number years I have owned it and the amount of use it has given me I really can't complain. I don't know whether I will replace this with the same style or try one of the Q's when it finally bites the bullet in a year or two. The Q looks promising, but it does cost quite a bit more, one thing is for sure, I will always have fond memories of this hardy little grill, and will almost certainly buy another small Weber of some sort.

Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.
What I should have done.......Spend the extra $100 and by the Weber Platinum 22.5 inch gold charcoal grill.  It has two side tables, a better cart (more stable and easier to move), and a thermometer in the lid.  I could just kick myself for my mistake.  I wish Weber would let me have a do over.

6434	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very OLD design. I think this design dates back to the 1800's. The new plastic traps and the Tomcat brand knock-offs, etc. aren't this good. It has a VERY strong spring capable of breaking adult human fingers. There's no safety features on this so you MUST place it where kids and pets can't get to it. Once it's set, it has a hair trigger so you need a steady hand and calm nerves. I set one of these in my garage and was just getting ready to place it when a mosquito hit the bug zapper and my life flashed before my eyes. They're pretty reliable for holding the rat. Whether the rat dies or not depends on what position it was in when the trap actuated. My first rat was dead as a stone from the bar hitting the back of its neck. Another rat had its pelvis crushed and was trapped but alive forcing me to behead it for a quick, humane kill. So nothing's perfect but these traps are strong and USUALLY kill immediately. They're more durable than the plastic ones. The only thing that might work as well is the electric one but those are expensive. Around forty dollars for ONE at the time of this writing.

7502	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek "EasySet" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor "Out O'Sight" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more.  With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie.  That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles.  If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap.

2211	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I bought one of these houses five years ago. I have built and bought martin house for over forty years and this one is the worst one I have ever tried to use. First the perches keep falling off. I had to tap the plastic and put a washer and screw on each post before they would stay on. The clean out bottoms will fall open for no reason. I installed the pole head pipe in concrete and the pole worked pretty good for a couple of years. I removed it every season and made a cover for the head pipe opening. The third year it was all I could do to to get the first pole into the ground mount. At the end of the season, I had to use a pipe wrench and a piece of pipe to try to get the lower pipe out of the ground by pulling up as I walked around in circles. It would not come out. So now I have the first section of pole sticking up in my yard all year. I had to rivet the bottom clean out section just to keep it together. The plastic piece that holds each section up in place broke and now the house is unusable without those 2 special pieces. There was always gaps between the sections when it was on the pole. I think that is enough to change your mind.

Now that I'm looking to replace my Go-Anywhere with another one, I thought there would be more changes in its design.  However, I see that the grill is essentially the same as the one I'm replacing.  I guess there's very little motivation to change something that works so well.  I am very surprised to see even the few negative reviews that have been submitted.  My guess is that these folks had to be doing something wrong to give this grill anything less than four stars.  Perhaps they assembled something incorrectly when setting the grill up.  It's either that or these folks had expectations nothing could satisfy.

7491	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Of all of the several mole traps I purchased recently, this is my least favorite. It is the hardest to set up and requires some significant digging. The spring is very strong and requires some strength. In fact I never did get it set.
These are numbers 6-7 of this tool - kept buying more as i became more convinced they were doing the job.  and SO easily.  put it in the ground, screw the hose on, turn on the water - you can SEE the water bubbling as it enters the tool.  take the feeder out and you'll see 4 strong sprays.  easy to stick in, easy to pull out and move.
Weber makes another model, slightly larger at 18" instead of 14" for this model, and that larger 18" model does come with a wire bail handle. I think that larger model is a better choice.

So you'll want a good $10 steel wedge for splitting wood. Which is worth having anyway.

8371	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Bought this hose to be used with a utility pump I purchased in the same order.  They claim that it would not collapse when drawing water into the pump (The sides would be stiff).  Well when I got the hose it was already collapsed and flat from shipping before using and it was a very cheap piece of hose and cheap fittings, not like the picture (I know that they say colors may vary but I thought the quality would be the same as pictured.)  Would send back but not worth the effort.... Threw it out... and bought a cheap 50' hose for $9.95 at Lowes and a hose repair connector... cut it to 15' clamp on the connector and works great.  Still have 35' left to make more if needed.  Buyer beware.

Watched videos on Youtube for this, and they were informative. Have used this trap now for several seasons, and downgraded my star rating since nothing caught in high activity area.
The mower blade adjusts very easy. But a wrench is required to set blade height. So pick a height you like, and stick to it.  Keep in mind this is the least expensive mower around, so don't expect more features.  It's a light mower, so pushing it is simple, and almost effortless. A seven year old would have the strength and stamina to mow a yard. When the blade hits a stick, or some tree bark, the blade stops instantly. It's hard enough and my blade shows zero wear/tear after about 2 years of weekly use.

I'm hoping to get many years of service out of this.

I've read a few reviews about modifying the traps and was willing to give them a try to see if they worked before making the recommended modifications.  I'll give it a week and see if any traps are being triggered but not catching anything before I make the mods.  Hopefully I won't need them.

I'm sharing my technique for setting them in the hope it will help you:
My only complaint about this is its size.  Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc.  But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched.  If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill.
Note that you CANNOT connect two of these hoses to each other. Unlike some other soaker hoses I've bought, these do not have a removable cap at one end. If you're going to need more than 50 feet of hose, you might want to look at other, longer hoses.

The small size is quite adequate for wife and I including grilled meats and vegetables.  The small size makes is easy to set up and use anywhere, to clean easily, and to store easily out of the weather. In addition, the small size uses minimal charcoal and it retains heat better than a larger unit.  The quality is great.  The air flow controls are good.  When finished cooking, shut the air inlets and smoke outlets and this thing will be cool in 30 minutes with the charcoals ready for the next time.  Weakest feature is the clip that holds the legs together. It is "minimal" but just adequate.  The strongest features are the charcoal grate, the cooking grates, and the sturdy steel body - all well made. The handles insulate well too even with the unit at full heat.

9870	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	First off, I had ordered another weed whacker like this one, but the serrated edge was longer, which my son was able to break off with no problem. I like this one better, because the serrated edge is shorter, and seems to be more sturdy. If you use it correctly by swinging your arm back and forth, without twisting your back or bending over a bit, it keeps you from having aching muscles the next day. It is very effective on weeds, but not as well on grass, because weeds have wider stems and grass is much thinner. So, if you're going to use it on regular grass in your yard, you're better off having a lawn mower. So I would call this a weed whacker instead of a grass whip. I love mine, so I do recommend it, especially if you're trying to go green.

It has shorted out a couple of times, causing the safety button on the outlet to pop, but when we checked, both times a small tree frog had gotten into the light and committed frog suicide by electrocution.  Other than that, it has worked quite well, without significant buzzing noises or flickers.  It seems more like a porch light than a bug zapper.  I do recommend the mosquito attractant, though.

You can't use much or it throws off the balance which makes the trap useless.  But if you use a small amount, the smell entices the mice to go all the way to the back of the trap which causes it to tip backwards and makes the door slam shut and lock.
It is now a mix of Rainbird/Hunter heads.
There are two mowers I prefer to this unit. One is the Scotts, which is easier to push, and can be sharpened at home with a simple to use kit instead of paying $50 or $60 at a sharpening service. But my absolute favorite manual mower- and the one I use- is the Brill, from Germany. It weighs 17 lbs, and doesn't need sharpening for 8 years. Maybe Amazon will carry it one day.

Also, you DO NOT need mosquito attractant. Like a few other reviewers have said, I get thousands of mosquitos just from the light. There are piles of dead ones under the zappers.

The next time I needed more line, I called Ryobi with a question... We got to talking about how to add the line...  She explained to me how easy it was to use refills instead of spools...  I got a package of refills at my local store, followed the instructions, and WOWed at how EASY it was to do!  ... and for a whole lot cheaper, too!
One caveat is that the mosquito attractant seems useless.  If that is your main culprit, I might recommend getting some the old "PIC" insect rings and burning a few of those.  We burn one each night we are out with the bug zapper.

I live in Central TX where the sun and heat break plastic down like paper. Most plastic things only last one summer around here. Usually the little perches snap like twigs after the year is over, but this will make it a second. And for some weird reason the hummers love this one, they fight over this one and I have a couple others in the garden area. Don't know why really, but they prefer this one. Makes me happy b/c we can see the little jewels all throughout the day from our kitchen window. And the glass jar part is way better than the plastic.

one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir.

- Because it's so small, you will want to check on it very often (once every 12 hours should be good) to ensure that you catch and release as soon as possible.  A mouse cannot turn once it's in there.
I've had the sprayer over 1.5 years now, and used it to spray the pavers, mentioned above, plus used it to spray copper napthanate on a long wooden stairway, and used to to spray insecticide and weed killer.  Plan to use it to spray Hyperseal roof sealant and reflective coating on my southern roof (which no one except aircraft  pilots can see.)  Excellent hardware.  Even spray, and great coverage from one tankful.  Easy clean up.  Will likely last a very long time, thus worth the additional cost.  Will save $ in the long over the junky made-in-China throw away sprayers sold in home repair stores.

Edited to say that I got these for $10 on sale at Amazon. I am seeing bad reviews for them and have not used mine more than a half hour or so at this point. They worked well for me and I have had none of the problems that other users mentioned so far, but I was only doing light pruning of small diameter wood.
The good part is that it doesn't clog with dead bugs - they just fall down. It seems to zap even the tiniest of bugs. The lamp lasted a long time, after one season I haven't had to replace it yet.
Unfortunately this promising metal trap is unattractive to mice. After five months with it in the same location I've only caught two mice. I started putting conventional baited spring traps in the same area and I have to empty them every day, so I know the expensive metal traps aren't doing the job.

It has been 8 days since I have applied the Spring fertilizer with Crabgrass preventer.  Usually, by 8 days in past years, I can already see the striping (with Scott's spreaders).  We have had rain the day I applied the fertilizer, so, it did get activated.  I am not seeing striping. I must admit, I expected to see it even with the Earthway 2150 but I am not.  I'll have to wait to end of July to see if Crabgrass is present.  If I didn't get the fertilizer on uniformly, I will have lots of Crabgrass.  We'll have to wait for that.

I prefer the ARS brand, have collection of varied ARS snips and some decades old but oerform like those right out of the box. Better than other bonsai or botanicals snips, ARS brand stays super sharp and admit have no problems if cutting fine, fine manicure or thru that massive main stem.

They attract and trap them, so you can see how your additional efforts (drops, laundering, vacuuming, combing) are working. Sticky paper is strong but easy to change, with pull tabs so you don't have to touch the creepy bugs. Better trap than what was offered in stores. We at first caught 30-40 per trap (used first in rooms where cats slept, and then under beds), but are now down to almost nothing. I'm keeping them going at night to alert us if fleas return. Definitely a useful tool in the battery against these pesky bugs.

Of the three, the Mouse Hotel caught the most mice by far.  The mice also seemed to be the least stressed.  No mice died in the Mouse Hotel.  This appeared to be because it is the roomiest and they can move around.  It also has a bait holder which they can feed from without making a big mess.  The one problem it has is with the trip floor limiter, which is just a thin plastic tab.  It broke off on one of the traps while a mouse was inside.  The last mouse may have chewed it off but at any rate I found it broken after catching a few mice which renders the trap unusable.  This is a design weakness.  Plan for a limited lifespan of these traps.

One other point, the zapping is rather loud.  On smaller bugs it's just a quick PZZT!  On large bugs, say a good sized moth, the zapping can go on for a few seconds (PZZT PZZZZZZZZZT ZZZZAAP) with a bit of fire then a puff of smoke.  Ouch!

Now I get better results with about 10 chunks, a negligible effect on global warming, perhaps, but way cheaper.

Dropped a few little pieces of pin cherry branches over the lump (on one side) and kept the turkey over a pan on the other side.

The root feeder, or metal portion that gets inserted into the ground naturally rusts quickly, and begins to soften. So taking it out and moving it say around to the other side of the tree, and it will bend very easily.

5844	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is my first Weber grill of any type and I really like it. Bought this one for RVing and have been very impressed with it's cooking qualities. Extremely well made and should last a long time. Legs are a little awkward to install, but this is only a minor issue. Perfect size for cooking for 1-4 people.
First impressions: My 8-year-old son mowed the lawn the first time. The grass was probably 5" tall and slightly damp, but this mower went right through it. There were some spots that needed another pass, but that's because the grass was too long.
2056	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have a ton of bamboo in my backyard and I've tried using everything from saws, chainsaws, and machetes to cut it down. Some tools took too much labor. The chainsaw kicked when the bamboo would start to fall. So I decided to splurge on this axe. It's fantastic. I can cut down 1-3" shoots in just a few chops. And it's easy on my wrists and hands. Glad I bought this.
I had long since lost my chainsaw instructions and was not aware of one guide bolt that is used to position the chain and it kept coming off (so be aware if this is your first time changing blades) but once I figured out what I was doing wrong, this chain worked brilliantly. Great deal for the price.

I don't think my remarks are a slam against the quality of the product as they work as described.

4253	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	We got 50 of these in 2 -25 packs. They shipped in completely different boxes, one long and thin (logical) and one short and wide (illogical)! Anyway, we wanted these to help support our trellised tomatoes - the trellising line was attached to heavy metal stakes but these helped hold the plants with plastic ties. None of them broke during our first season of usage, and I lightly pounded each into the ground multiple times. Also used some with pepper plants, large cosmos and marigolds, no problem there even with some reasonably heavy winds. We'll see if they can survive a second year of usage, but after pricing out the plastic stakes and these, it was a no-brainer. I will say they are very different thicknesses, so fat and strong, some thin and spindly, so I had to do a little creative selection based on the plant.

6413	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I love the idea of a grill that is small and convenient, I put 4 pork chop and 3 chicken breasts on it and it cooked them wonderfully BUT.... I'm puzzled as to why the "grill" ( the part you place the food on) is already starting to rust? I washed it thoroughly with a NYLON(!) "scrubby" ( I had oiled it first) and then put it on the top rack of the dishwasher AND IT HAD RUST ON IT THE NEXT MORNING! This is bulls_ _t! Now I'm afraid to cook on it. Very disappointed!
When choosing a trap location remember some kills are bloody, so spread out some newspaper or plastic first if that will matter to you.

7778	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I am rating this mindful of the cost.  I had a 14 year old Genesis B that I adored, but which had pretty much lived its life and which I did not feel like taking on a multi state move.  This is a temporary fix while we are in a rental until we buy our next home.  First the good: Easy assembly.  The igniter is a little hard to align just right but once set it works fine (you need to leave a little space, as noted).  Seems to get sufficiently hot to properly heat the meat for proper cooking and for "sizzle" on the outside.  I have found that you need to keep the lid on and pretty much run it on high in order to cook. The little bottles of gas seem to last pretty well.  Now the not so good.  As others have mentioned, as compared to wire cooking surfaces the juices tend to pool up (if you have the grate flipped the wrong way).  It is far harder to clean than the very similar looking grate (color; blue/grey) on my Genesis, even with pumice and Scotch Brite sponge pads.  If the lid is not on it likely won't get hot enough to cook much of anything. The cooking surface is small so you sometimes have to cook "in shifts".  Overall though, for $50 it is a very workable little gas grill for tailgating, camping, apartment/condo dwellers or those in situations like ours.  Once we move I will buy another Genesis and it will likely not be used again but for the year we are here it seems to have been a good purchase and allows me not to have to move a dirty grill a few months down the road.  It was also cheap enough that I won't feel disappointed if it sits on the shelf, mostly unused, after that year.
  I did exactly what he and the manufacturer suggested, put the zapper about 15' out from the patio, and plugged it in about 5PM.

3876	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live in a dry AZ area, and mosquitos are there, but not too much of a problem. My primary issue was having hundreds of moths outside my patio door on any given night. Sure, flies and mosquitos are there too, but the moths are too many. I was delightfully surprised that this product attracts and kills any flying insect, from mosquitos to even large moths. The first night I had it on (I have a dusk-dawn power adapter outside for this zapper), it killed bugs the entire night - at a rate of about 2 per second, I kid you not!. In the morning I saw that there were dozens of dead moths inside the lamp enclosure. The only "downside" here is that I had to use my leaf blower to clear it out. Took about 5 seconds, and I'm hoping that over time, the moth population here, at least the ones in my immediate vicinity dies out. This is a great product!

On another note: I also purchased the Dynatrap from Amazon for my inside garage area (about 99.00).  Great product, but you must leave it on at all times otherwise the bugs will escape.
So, as far as reel mowers go in this price range, this is definitely 5-star worthy. It has a nice, solid construction and has what I consider a healthy heft to it. It rolls smoothly (and self-sharpens as it goes I might add!) and cuts well. The handle is very comfortable. You can easily adjust the height with a single screw (I keep it set at 2") and it only takes a minute to do. I love that NO TOOLS are required for this thing so you can literally just adjust your cutting height and go.  Initial assembly (again, no tools needed) took only 10-minutes.
Easy to clean, works perfect, great for travel.  You should get a  connector to 20lbs propane tank.

6737	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	After reading the reviews on this i decided to take a chance. I wanted this mostly to control med and Caribbean fruit flies.  I have 17 fruit trees around my house. I also wanted to get rid of Mosquitoes. Yes i know that bug zappers don't attract mosquitoes.  For those who complained the lure did not work i would refer you to a number of web sites which clearly state that different types of mosquitoes are attracted to different lures. I live in central Florida and I ran a home study on lures and sure enough in my case the Octenol lure that came with this did in fact attract a lot of mosquitoes. In a controled test putting another unit with the same lure in my screened pool area i found it worked very well on that unit as well. So yes in my area that lure worked and so did the Bug zapper. Yes it kills some beneficial bugs sorry folks but have you noticed how many eggs and insect lays.  I don't think this is going to wipe out the population of any insect. I have found no bees, wasps in the unit to date.

I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.

There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.

The grass was not looking that great after mowing and now looks completely uniform in height after sharpening.  Not only are the blades now sharp (took about 30 minutes to disassemble, sharpen, reassemble) but there were instructions on how to adjust the mower.  BTW- turning the reel with the included lever was easy.  The mower still has duct tape to hold the padded grip together, but there is a certain masculinity to having a well used piece of equipment.
I've tried taking it apart and putting it back together using different degrees of tightness many many times. If you screw it too tightly you will strip the plastic threads so you have to be careful not to overtighten it. I tried and tried but just could not get this to reliably stop dripping.

I have a large Weber gas grill that I use at the house and have been extremely satisfied with it. This portable grill works great on fishing, hunting, camping and beach trips. It folds up compactly and is easy to transport. Simply put, I will only buy Weber for here on out after owning many others(Char-Broil, Thermos, Charm Glow). When I had those, I didn't realize that there was as big of a difference in the pricier Webers as there is. Generally speaking, they heat much more evenly and quicker (often with lower BTU ratings) than the competition.

Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.

I have been using it for about a year now and it still does a great job. A few notes - Only use it when it is bone dry outside. If you try and use it after watering your lawn or after a rain mud will clump inside the edger and clog it up, resulting in you having to pull out large mud clumps from inside the edger every few feet. I have also found the first edge of the season, or the first time you use it if you haven't ever edged your lawn, can be challenging for you and the edger - but after that this edger can help you maintain your clean edge with ease.
These are 100% metal, inexpensive, and work great for years.

Obviously I cannot tell longevity since I just got it, but the plastic seems kinda sturdy. I have a very strong grip and don't think I can break it by squeezing hard. I bought 4 since I have vacation condo.

Had used the 12 and 14 bar sizes before (from Oregon as well.)  This particular 16 grouping fit the Tanaka perfectly and, as one has come to expect from the Oregon brand, the performance is exceptional.  Sadly, during this harsh New England winter, I have had to use the chainsaw more often than expected (or hoped for).  Nevertheless, the saw performed brilliantly, cut smoothly and effortlessly, and remained sharp much longer than projected (in view of the moist, snow- coated timber.)  First-rate saw blade combination.

Update 06-27-09: Still using this mower 99% of the time. Have used my gas mower once in the past year b/c the grass got too high while I was out of town. Have only needed to sharpen the mower once. Found that the optimal walking speed is slightly slower than what i thought it should be. The right speed seems to fan the tall grass into the blades at the right pace so everything gets cut. Too fast or too slow and the cut is not as good. Seems to be aging well. Remember the part of my original review where I bragged on the fact that my kids could walk right up and ask me something? Turns out that this is a DOWNSIDE. Constant interruptions makes for a long yard cutting chore. VBG! The headphones help...

We have a large second-story deck (16' x 40') on the back of our condo and I wanted a solution that would help draw insects away from us.  We don't have a great deal of grounds around us, so I mounted this at one corner under the deck, and it works great.  I'm continually amazed at the quantity of insects it eliminates.

Had the UV bulb starter blow after 10 months and they sent me a replacement UV bulb starter right away "for free" with proof of purchase (it only cost $2.38 if I ever need to replace it out of warranty).

4500	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This mower really cuts grass well. Only 2 drawbacks I found: 1. you must make sure all twigs from trees are picked up as small twigs will stop the mower in it's tracks, when they get lodged between blade and cutter & 2. this mower will not go to the highest hight adjustment and work...the bracket that holds the back rollers is made from plastic on each side, and it will bend, thus allowing the roller to pop out and the mower will fall back to the lowest setting and cause you to reset the roller.  If however you are happy with the medium setting or low setting, this mower works great.  I had forgotten how much fun it is to push one of these babies!  that good old sound, and the grass goes chop chop!  No gas, no oil, no starter cable to break, no exhaust, no starter fluid, no priming...just push!

5018	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	At first I was skeptical, but after using this for a year, I'm sold.  We spread this on the ground to cover plants or areas we don't want varmints, whether deer, rabbits, chipmunks, etc.  It is thin so it is not readily seen via eyesight, so it's not visible from the road when people drive by.  Deer step it in once, and that's all it takes.  All the other animals in our area (very rural) have learned to avoid  this stuff because it sticks to your feet, just like it does to the animals.  We put this down again this spring, and it stops all animal traffic into the yard. Last fall, we were cleaning off the old leaves before winter and we even had a blue racer (snake) that was caught in it.. (it couldn't get out), but we were able to free the snake by cutting it off (very carefully).  Snake rested for quite a while on the ground after being freed, but soon left.  This is great stuff, we also use it to cover potted plants left outside, and the plants are not bothered by any of our wildlife.  I'm guessing the people who don't rate this high just don't know how to spread this out for maximum efficiency.

I have 2 Weber rotiserries, one for the gas grill, one for the kettle.  And while I agree the EZ-Que cradles are a better design, the Weber spits are well made and do a good job.

I can fit 2 whole chickens on the spit and the motor doesn't strain to turn them.  The tines that hold the food are large and strong.  The food cooked on a rotisserie is delicious.

I replaced 3 valves 3 years ago, and they have worked fine ever since. What I really like about these Orbit valves is you can easily turn them on manually by pushing the lever on the solenoid about 1/4 turn. This makes it easy to flush lines and/or test changes you make to your system. They also have a 6 year warranty which is better than just about anyone else.
All these valves seem to have stopped working at the same time. Tried replacing diaphragms and switching solenoids. Additionally, the valves will not turn on manually. If I find the valves are not the problem I will reedit this review. Until then, I recommend you stay away from these.

Sure enough some fertilizer got stuck in sprayer part, used safety pin to clear hole in sprayer assembly, cleaned with water and set dial properly (at max, 10tsp/gal for powder to liquid mix, line up with little dot on side of sprayer right beneath dial) and has worked like a charm since.

Only downside is the hose can kink quite easily.
Overall, I am happy with this product, and it has made my watering much easier, but it is definitely not a "set it and forget it" device - there are too many things that can go wrong so you need to stick around and watch it occasionally.

The grill has four air vents (two top mounted exhaust vents, and two vents mounted along the bottom sides).  Opening all four vents allows enough oxygen flow for medium temperature cooking.  Closing all four vents will suffocate a fire pretty quickly.  Cooking with the lid off and the bottom vents open will net you a hot fire that will be great for searing.

So just stay away from this feeder, which is neither the least expensive nor the best hummingbird feeder on Amazon.
This fly trap smells foul. I'm not joking around. You'll need to place it far from your door, so that the stench of rotting garbage doesn't assail your nostrils every few seconds. However, it's disgustingly effective. I don't know how long it is supposed to last for, but within a couple of months, the cup was absolutely full, and more and more flies tried to get in. Seriously. My cup ranneth over. I placed this out back, where the super of the building stores the garbage on the days when there isn't pickup, because the flies were coming into my space from that space. Personally, I don't mind bugs, as long as they're not in my space. Go outside, roam free and happy, and leave me alone.

1. It's important to note that this grill does not have any kind of carrying handle of any type, neither as a bail nor anything on the sides.
I now need to replace my old Rainbird APAS Anti Siphon valves. After 20 years, they have developed hairline cracks on the pressure side and this is letting water seep over to the anti-siphon top. In 15 years, I only had to replace the piston/diaphram once on these Rainbird valves. So it will probably be either Rainbird or Orbit for me. If I can use the same riser spread like before, it will be Orbit vales. But I suspect the manifold is leaking, so if I have to dig out and repipe the manifold, I will probably choose Rainbird.

5402	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've used these to prune much larger branches than I think they're probably intended for.  It's difficult to say what the maximum thickness branches they are intended for because the documentation on the package gives no such guidance.  Nonetheless, they are holding up very well even when I should probably look for my loppers but when I'm too lazy to do that, "just for this one branch."  I just use a sort of twisting, "sawing" motion to get the branch down to size a bit before I execute the actual cut.  The blades are easy to lock closed with one hand so you can stick them in your pocket and not get stabbed after you forget they're in your pocket.  Keep the blades sharp and clean the blades with a wet rag, then with a dry rag, and finally wipe with an oily rag after each use and I think you will be glad to have these for a very long time!
This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up.

I have tried a different variety that uses a darker spectrum of light, darker to the naked eye, and they do not work nearly as well as this unit does.  I had some longevity issues with a prior Flowtron unit that I had purchased, so I cannot say anything about the long term reliability of  this unit, but it is very effective for clearing your area of bugs attracted to light.  I do not have a problem with  mosquitos so while the unit comes with mosquito attractant, I cannot tell you if this is effective for them.

4261	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Update Sept 2012: Mower is still my favorite. I have taken to sharpening it once per year. It doesn't work well on dry, crispy grass like we've had this year. Mostly likes green, wide blade lush grass. Consequently I've used the gas mower all three times I mowed the grass this year. We've also had alot of sticks in the yard due to wind storms and that is also a reel mower show stopper. Still love this mower but a rechargeable mower might be a better tool for some folks because the sticks and crispy grass won't hinder it. My gas mower will probably last forever as little as it gets used. Had to patch the deck which is rusting out this year. Odd. No worries. The gas mower is worth $25 tops at this point anyhow. Have seen some DIY electric mower conversions. Might do that to mine. Cut the noise and fumes.

Ever the less, after two hours, common sense, and a couple of beers I assembled the Earthway C24HD.  Also, words of wisdom.  I used an appropriately sized deep well nut driver on the nut end and a socket mated to my Dewalt impact for easy and quick assembly. Obviously don't go crazy on impact usage.
In the time I have tried it (around 3 weeks) it has definitely worked wonders and I can see the electric grid bars filling up with the insects.  I oiled the steel grid lightly before use (with a spray of WD40) prior to inserting the bulb.  I did this to cause the insects to stick less on contact when they get buzzed.  It should make blowing them off later, a little easier.

These mowers have limitations as you may read in other reviews. Without a blade spinning at 3,000 rpm+ it does not pick up the grass to be chopped by the blades. That means grass blades that don't stand straight enough to get cut won't get cut. It also means that debris like leaves won't get mulched. Surprisingly having mowed my yard with a reel mower a few times now - it just looks better to me. It's not a perfect cut. I can find a few stray blades that got pushed over instead of being cut and stand back up between mows. I'll get them next time. No sweat. The blades get scissored by the reel mower rather than torn or chopped by the gas mower blade. Looks greener to me.
7286	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say other than it is a well made and good looking cover for your Weber charcoal barbecue.

1/29/2010 Using this grill in winter is fun because it's so easy to clean up and bring inside after it cools off. For example, after work yesterday we grilled delicious marinated chicken and veggie kabobs in the early evening moonlight, even though it was only about 10 outside. For dessert we roasted marshmallows over the charcoals and watched the full moon. It was great.

Once you get the hang of how to use it, you'll love it. If you have a large area to water, this it the sprinkler for you. I recommend buying the longest hose you can because it will not go over the spot where two hoses are joined together. It will simply trip the shutoff feature when it gets to the joining spot.

5178	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I'll start with what's good about the Scott 2000-20: it's lightweight and easy to push (I'm 51, female, and if I can push this thing so can you).  My lawn is fairly level and it leaves it with a nice even cut.  I love not having to maintain a gas mower and it's nice to mow without having fuel exhaust in my face.  I can mow early, when it's cool, without disturbing my neighbors.  All in all, I'm pleased with the performance.
At first I was annoyed it wasn't near as tough as the old bags but a month later, the 2 layers I put down have survived cutting over 60 salmon better than expected. It is getting tattered but serves it purpose, was easy to get and to install and replace.

On the upside, I put these on a low-HP saw that I use just for cutting small stuff and limbs. The less aggressive nature of the chain means that I can use a somewhat longer bar because the blade won't bite into the wood quite so hard, and stall the engine. I find it safer when walking through a cut, cleaning the mess, than using a full-size saw with an aggressive blade. Every tool has it's use.

783	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good product for spraying insecticide on my spruce trees.  The pump up sprayers required mixing and simply didn't enough liquid up into the tree branches.  And the hose end sprayer that I purchased from the local box store just didn't get up high enough. The Gilmour 362 shoots a stream nearly 30 feet.  Unfortunately, my trees are 35 feet tall.  But I think if I stand on a ladder the nest time I spray the trees, I should be able to get clear to the top!
- If and only if you are willing to take the bulb out, carefully spray the grid with pam. Less bugs will stick. I use leaf blower to clean of the grid every now ant than. BUT IF YOU DO SPRAY THE GRID, MAKE SURE THE BULB IS OUT. DO NOT GET ANY SPRAY ON THE BULB ITSELF.

No such problem with the Flowtron 80 watt zapper. The straight up and down electric grid design is far superior. No clogging problems at all. Bug get zapped and fall straight down and in the morning there is a nice pile of fried bugs on the ground which my chickens love to gobble up. I have had a few nights where the humidity has been very high here and a fem bugs have clung to the electric grid but a slight tap on the zapper the next day and they just fall off and out.
Yes, the occasional stick or piece of mulch stops me, fortunately twigs are not a major issue in this particular yard, YMMV. If I do find something that stops it (and it STOPS! be ready to buckle over the handle which fortunately folds away when this happens) a simple turn of the reel backwards with your foot lets whatever it was drop free and you can carry on.

Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.

5483	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I was excited to find the tube sprinkler hose as I have been looking for one "forever." I purchased the 30 foot and the 100 foot in order to place at 2 locations. I had in mind that this would be exactly like our old sprinkler hose - medium weight hose material with the tubes and a flat side with white stripe and easily spotted holes. It's not and I was disappointed. It feels thin and I had to pull it apart as I got it out of the package and tried to stretch it out (I thought then it was going to tear on me). If the holes weren't "marked" with teen weeny brown specks (about the size of a chigger or "no-see-um"), you wouldn't know which side was which until you had the water on. When it is full with water flowing through it, the material really feels like a water balloon that will pop if it catches on anything. I've pulled on it to move it and was scared it was going to tear; I ended up moving it foot by foot (getting wet in the process) because it stretches like a rubber band/balloon and looks/feels like it will rip any minute. I'm not sure if it will last long. All of that said, I am still well pleased with the product. I have them stretched in my two flower beds and they water beautifully. The spray is just like the old ones and in that I am delighted. I would recommend the product and we'll see how well it lasts.

Of course it runs 24/7 as instructed and now all neighbors want to sit out back in my yard evenings. During daytime I'm no longer bothered by nasty "no-see-ems". Some of your know those pesky bugs/insects that come out of nowhere.  I purchased my own hook hanger as instructions suggest hanging it 8' from ground so I'd suggest buying your hanger locally (Home Depot/Lowe's).  I've had little ground cleanup to do as I've noticed early in the AM the birds are doing that for me and at night the frogs & toads do the cleanup. I'm finding this part amusing to say the least.  Great purchase, withstands our sudden thunderstorms without problem & its placed out in the open.  When it first arrived I had a minor question for the company. I called & their messaged gave me an email address to contact for quicker service. I did & received my reply with couple of hours. All positive. Great company to deal with. Again...I've not been bothered by any insects since this purchase.  Notice in my pic the cover over extension cord. This was purchased from Amazon & is great. No water gets near connections & I'm using a heavy gauge outdoor extension cord. The item is Hot Headz Extension Cord Cover set of 2.  Of all the cord covers this one while not water proof (stated on site) is water resistant. Has tight seal & DOES fit heavy duty cords.

Long story short, my tines were spinning in the WRONG direction.  Once I turned them, it worked great!  Saves you thousands over installing an underground sprinkler system and I'd argue, it probably covers more ground!

Our old mower often left the grass looking matted down and the grass blades shredded. We have a friend who has worked in the parks district for years and he swears that push reel mowers are the best way to go if you have a smaller yard. They cut like a scissor instead of whacking away at the grass. As the blades turn, they brush the grass upward, snip it, and you are left with a plush, clean cut. No more shredded brown tips and matted down grass.

This has a clever design that doesn't get false trips since it's balanced pretty good but it's super sensitive.  I suggest even indoors to try this out plus it won't snap your cats nose or anything since it just closes the door.  It's not a cheap little mouse trap but if you want to catch a mouse this was very effective.
ACTUALLY, my other zapper has a bug collection tray you have to empty and it collects and hangs on to water when it rains. The smell is AWFUL! But this thing's bottom is the same as its sides, so bugs just fall to the ground and rainwater doesn't pool.

You also need a pair of bypass loppers if you care about the health of a living plant that you are pruning. Unfortunately the bypass loppers are not ideal for both jobs. They will quickly dull if you use them to cut dead brittle branches. I therefore wound up with both of these loppers and a pair of Fiscars bypass loppers of similar size. Both are excellent tools and have a 3 to 1 mechanical advantage that makes it incredibly easy to cut large branches.

8844	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are easy to clean and have pretty much eradicated my mouse issues
** Update ** After two summers of use, I really love using this spreader.  As a tall person, the handle is wonderful.  I like this product so much, I ordered a second one for our weekend place.  Google before you purchase.  Unlike my first purchase, I had to buy some place else because Amazon was not even close to being the low price leader I am used to them being.  Great spreader!
I have noticed that one side of the grill gets *slightly* warmer than the other -- not a huge difference, but enough that I find I often need to "shift" things around to get them to come out even.  However, that CAN be a good thing when I need to cook things to differing degrees of "doneness" for my guests' preferences.

So the snap traps I set caught three mice.  At least one mouse got into the leftover poison bait that I left in the original box, up on a shelf.  No mice were caught by the Tin Cat.

I use it for a neem oil spray to treat my indoor plants when they get spider mites, as they seem to every spring.  Anyone who has used neem before knows that it's extremely sensitive to temperature changes, doesn't mix readily with water (the key is adding a gentle surfactant--a sudsing agent--I use either baby shampoo or castile soap), and easily separates.  This can make it really tricky for any sprayer, because, if it sits too long, the neem will basically separate from the water and get into the parts of the spray mechanism and render the spray bottle inoperable.  So you really need to have a sturdy, well-made sprayer.

Solidly constructed of good materials.
7975	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This grill offers efficiency and utility in a small package.  The quality is in line with the price.  The venting system allows one to quickly control heat, and if necessary, to entirely extinguish the fire for future reuse of the unburned charcoal.  It lacks the ability to adjust the grill height (distance of food from charcoal).

3918	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to "steer" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to "steer" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.

5986	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Okay, it's a. Weber, so it slightly overpriced.  Nonetheless, it's very durable, easy to assemble, and very portable.  The portability is the big difference between the Premium and regular Smoky Joe models.  The handle (not present on the regular model) which locks the lid in place for travel also, when folded down to a supplied clip, provides a place for the lid to be pushed up and to one side  no more putting the lid on the grass or making circular marks on your picnic table or deck.  The only other differences that I've noticed are that the Premium model seems to have slightly sturdier legs, and lacks an ash opening at the bottom.  As the ash cleaning opening was too small and inaccessible in the first place, it's hardly missed. As we use charcoal, rather than briquettes, the Weber kettle shape works very well for us  it slows down the burn a bit through controlling airflow  this means the charcoal, which burns a bit faster than briquettes, lasts longer.  Why do we. use charcoal?  Flavour and the lack of unknown and unwanted binders and additives.

If you want to grill steaks or burgers it's better to keep the lid off in order to get a nice hot fire while cooking.  Works great for roasting marshmallows too.  The size makes it just right for sitting atop the grate on those old school park grills.  This unit is very portable and the lid can be secured to the bottom with a bungee cord and clasping underneath.

One thing to keep in mind if you buy one of these is that there is a rotating part that goes in the connector you screw it into.  You need to make sure that part does not scuff the edges of the connector.  I found that when I bought the Butler stand to mount this sprinkler on the supplied plastic part did not work well.

I live in the San Francisco East Bay and have been feeding the H/B for many years. The key to getting lots of birds is easy. 1. Use this feeder 2.

The Flowtron BK-80D runs on 80W of power and claims to be able to cover up to 1.5 acres. It does live up to both claims, as it reliably zaps light-sensitive insects from dusk to midnight. I let my zapper run a few hours each night to thin out the army of mosquitoes and other annoying insects that fly around at night. After midnight they seem to taper off; for me, prime-time bug zapping starts at dusk and go on for 2-3 hours.

So it looks to me that this is a great thing for you if it works in your area. Where I am, it is useless. I've read that Lurex is a better attractant, but neither Flowtron nor anybody seems to make it for this type of zapper. If it is so good, there should be a great market for it but where is it? One would think the manufacturer would be champing at the bit to make the product work on more varieties of bug. This makes me think this zapper is more snake oil than a solution for mosquitoes.

As an aside, the "VELCRO Brand - 45' x 1/2" Adjustable Plant Ties For Gardens and Gardening - Green" is a pretty good alternate for foam-covered wire, as the diameters I've been able to find so far on Amazon have been thicker than I'd prefer.

Finally, cleaning and maintenance...I haven't owned this unit long enough to need to do any maintenance but I would anticipate that the fluorescent bulb will last several years if not more. Cleaning is trivial - like others have said you can blow the insect husks off the grill with a leaf blower or shop vac, but I've found that using my garden hose on a light "shower" setting works well and is very convenient (obviously, if you use a hose to clean it, don't do it when it is plugged in and don't turn it on until it dries). The Flowtron will not clog up easily since its grills are spaced right and the zapping bars do not overlap.

7966	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a quality made hose and serves my purpose. It is fairly short, only 15 ft, but long enough for what I need. For the price I thought it was a good deal and it looks like it will last a long time.

3155	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	First one broke on first use. Returned it.  I pay someone to edge my yard with a gas mower at the start of the year and then keep up with this one. Not very confident in it's power. Honestly, don't waste your money, buy something better.

I have hit the sidewalk many many times but have not damaged the blade or the sidewalk so the design is good.
You can use other 40 watt bulbs that are in the same style.

I clean off the bug parts once or twice a week.  Compressed air works very well for that, and there are other ways which I'm sure are not recommended.
Imagine if your grocery store was like Amazon, and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?
2653	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Was a little reluctant to buy this item from a vendor on the west coast (Reliable Hardware and Supply) for shipment cross-country to the Wilmington, NC area, but the price was great and Reliable had good reviews.  Bought it for $[...]  delivered, a great price (saved about $[...] over Amazon's price.)  Received on time, and in perfect condition.  Pump is obviously superior to any "Home Depot" pump I have ever bought and used, including stainless steel pumps. This review is a little premature, since I have not used the pump yet, but thought it worthwhile to comment on the price and delivery from Reliable Hardware.  Will rate the pump after I have used to to spray wet look sealant on 450 square feet of pavers.
Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.

August 6, 2010: It's time to deal with hurricanes, bugs and heat now. My trusty 15 watt Flowtron is busy tonight for I have little nats and other flying bugs in my house. That same 15 watt unit has been on nonstop since I first plugged it in- same bulb with no problems. Just needs some cleaning up now and then. At less than $30 currently with shipping, think I'll buy another 15 watt unit to put in the other end of my home. Need to step up my roach battle also. Have four tubes of roach gel.  It's impossible to keep them out around here. Like living near the ocean even with the bugs. Before I got this device, used insecticide (flying insect killer) every second or third day during the tropical season. Now, have not gassed my whole house like I use to do yet this summer. Surely that is healthier than the chemicals I used before. It keeps the bugs under control- they don't bother me with this device in service 24/7. Just use common sense if you intend to use it indoors. Keep it away from all flammable things. It's an electrical device that'll have dead bugs falling from it. It is always possible that the device can catch on fire. So use good sense and understand the potential hazards it can present wherever you use it. Have mine on power strips such that I can easily switch them off when I leave the house if I wish to do so.
Try to hang it over head high, in a DRY (electric) area.
Funny story:  I set one up at my parents property where we camp.  I caught a mouse in the outhouse.  There are no magazines in there.  My sister found the trap before I noticed it was full.  She picked up the device and being overly nosy she opened it.  I heard an extremely loud scream!
When, I received it one of the cuting blade was longer than other blades, I had to grind down the blade to match the height of the other blade.  Bad purchas on my part.

It takes a round support which is easier to find and cheaper than trying to find a triangle shaped pole.  The only problem is the construction of the house.  The buyer must put the house together with nuts and bolts.  If you are not handy with a screwdriver and pliers, don't buy this unit.  Buy the Heath plastic Martin House.  I now have one of each.

The Smokey Joe works great for indirect cooking of small roasts or other small, but thick, cuts of meat.  Put the charcoal on a side of the kettle with a vent, put the meat on the other side.  Close the vent on the kettle on the meat side, open the vent on the fire side, open the lid vent and put the vent holes over the side with the meat.  It creates a draft inside the kettle that works extremely well.  The size of the grill prevents true slow cooking but this modified indirect method works extremely well.
Yes, I keep it indoors.  Not an issue until a lot of zapping starts taking place.  Then you've got a bit of a smell problem, but I'd rather have the smell of burnt bugs than the bugs flying around inside.
Anyway, we started to enjoy the "ZZzzaaPPP" with time because we know that another bug won't bother us!

It's got a lot of power.  He loves it.
We have been giving our cat Yucca in her food and that seems to repel them as it is excreted in her skin. She seemed to have indoor allergies and an allergic reaction to the fleas, so that's why we began it, although I did read that it should chase the fleas off of her and thankfully it has done that job quite nicely.
786	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The hose was as described and received in a timely fashion.  I am using the hose with the Suncast Hose Reel and it is a perfect match.  This hose is well made with minimal kinking.  I would recommend it to others.

1227	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Really like to old reliable design with it's modern updates in materials. Best bang for the buck in my opinion.
462	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Does the job I bought it to do. Well made. No problems.
Maybe it is because my mower is old. Maybe it's because I got a funky catcher. It certainly isn't because I am not using it correctly. Whatever the issue is, this is not doing it for me.

Get Amazon's 12" hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers to replace fuel lines. Cut lines at a slant to ease installation. Work them back and forth to loosen. Set the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM's at full-throttle. Set the idle just until the chain just stops on a chainsaw.

I'm also a quilter and use nothing but Fiskars scissors, rotary cutters etc so when I discovered Fiskar gardening tools I was very pleased.
657	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This hose was a real disappointment.  It's described as flexible; it's about as flexible as a lead pipe.  No way can I curl it up or, for that matter, really uncurl it.  Beware!
-- Reservoir pivots so that it is always perpendicular. This is both a plus and minus.
5252	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great price and quality
2502	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Well this gem really works as well as other reviewers have stated. I will say it is best used in combination with a post hole digger. This auger works to rapidly make a hole, however the clamshell action of a post hole type digger will allow you to easily clean up the sides of the hole as well as remove dirt debris from the bottom of the hole. I was able to make eight post holes 30" deep for 4 x 6 inch posts in approximately 6 hours in California hard pan dirt. Note this auger will not work in very rocky soil as it gets hung up on rocks and on tree roots, both of which I was able to address with the post hole digger and then continue augering. Also as noted by others, the hole actually comes out 7-8 inches in diameter, perfect for a 4 x 4 post. Combining this auger with the fence post digger allowed me to easily enlarge the hole for my 4 x 6 inch posts. I am very glad I purchased this auger for my retaining wall project, it saved me a tremendous amount of back work on the post holes.
If these are < 1 yr. disposable items they should not charge more than $30.
8065	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Workes as expected and no leaks after more than a year.
7957	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this hose as a drain for my dehumidifier, so this was certainly a low-demand use. After only a week the female connector started leaking water onto my basement carpet. Rubbish.
762	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's been a year with somewhat constant use (bi-weekly) and it's still going strong.  Well worth the money.

A good mower like Scott self-sharpens.  You'll need a good strong big screwdriver to make the adjustments every so often.  I do so every other mow, or every mow when the lawn is thick.  Four screws that set the closeness of the fixed cutting blade to the reel.  Two on each side.  To adjust, a very slight partial turn is needed.  No more that "a hour" or "half an hour" of the sweep of a 12 hour clock face.  You want to adjust  so you just start feeling resistance and hearing "click click click: when you mow a few feet.  That's a tight set to sharpen.  Once I do a few short rows back and forth on the tight setting I back it off a quarter of half the turn I used to tighten it.  That seems to give me the best cutting setting.
6946	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good product. Fast delivery. I will recommend it to my friends.

The bottle and metal spray handle are one piece.
All of these need a chemical insert to attract mosquitos, I suggest if mosquitos bother you that you purchase a Thermacell mosquito repellant unit.  If you want to ZAP bugs especially the lawn munching kinds, get this one.
6246	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	On the positive side, this is made with a heavy-weight glass bottle that is very strong.  It all is well made.
The only negative issue we've had so far is that when it's raining a lot, the zapper will start zapping nearly continuously. The electricity seems to be arcing to dead bugs that are still stuck to the outside. Once I clean it, I imagine that problem will cease.

5124	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Much cheaper than purchasing at Home Depot. Home Depot had advertised for $89 - what a rip off! Purchased here and works great for protecting our small veggie garden!
7193	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This trap really works, I wish everyone in America would by one.  Only problem is that they reek (they are supposed too,it's how they work) and all the dead flys caught in one are pretty disgusting.  You could re use the trap, but it would take a pretty strong stomach.
7748	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this little grill.  Bought it to replace a very old, round Weber and this is perfect.  I like the rectangular shape so much better, it's also nice and heavy and being able to hinge the lid up for a wind break works perfect.  I usually grill for just two or three people and the size is perfect for that with room left over to move food to a cooler area or to toast hotdog/hamburger buns off to the side etc.
Nice planting tool for a larger garden saves your back and knees.  Things like onion sets still need to be planted by hand however.
For those who worry over the light weight: You'll learn to appreciate how light and strong it really is.  You can pick the whole thing up and pour out the extra seeds back into the seed pack easily. If seeds get behind the plate, you might want to check and make sure you have the plate on right! I pour some baby talc in with my seeds, and I never have much trouble. If you need to get the last seed planted, just lean the planter over to the side some, and the seeds - every one - can get caught by the plate and planted.

9757	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	My old RainBird 4 station controller of 30 years was acting crazy so I changed it out to this model. It was an easy install, has many different watering options for each zone and is a user friendly design.  I noticed the backup battery was hidden so I called Rainbird support. My old timer had a 9 volt battery that could be changed. The battery in this SST 1200o cannot be changed, so when it goes bad the unit will have to be reprogrammed after every power outage...not good. Support said it's a rechargeable lithium battery. The outdated  manual that comes with it is for an 8 zone model, and is the same on their website. The connectors for the station wire are push in connection type, so rigid wire is needed. The unit measures 9 x 9.5 x 4.5 inches.

9510	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Flowtron BK-40D works great hanging from a tree thirty feet behind my house on a waterfront lot.  I plugged mine into a timer to turn on at sundown and run for three hours.  It attracts bugs away from the house (lights) and zaps them, so sitting on the back porch or going in and out at night is much more pleasant for us humans.  And, there are fewer spiders webs around the house and fewer bugs in them.
8817	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.
6809	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Satisfied...
I mainly run this without the mosquito "attractant/lure". We have tons of moths and other big bugs. It zaps TONS of those. I've seen tons of other random bugs, including termites (winged) getting fried on the grid.

Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray.  Investigating, I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly, breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage.  This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron.  I contacted Parts and Service.  They had me email my Amazon receipt, and immediately sent me a replacement cage.  Nice service!
If you live somewhere where it never freezes, then yes, the adjustable settings make this a good product.  But I live in Vermont, so this is a deal-breaker for me.

WARNING This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."

On dry and sandy soil, it tends to all fall out when you try to lift up the auger, so you'll find yourself switching between this and a shovel for removal.  Wetting the area helps, but not dramatically.  It's still an issue that you'll have to fight with.
    neighborhood activism:  get your neighbors involved, as the problem is very unlikely limited to your property...  rats eat dog feces, compost, grille remains, bird seed... and just about anything, but, in our neighborhood, they were feeding (or are still feeding) at a neighbor that does not clean up after their dog and a neighbor composting... and, living at another neighbor that has let their garage and yard go to squaller. thus, our yard was a traffic route between feeding and nesting.  but, it is a city wide problem, as we have learned via nextdoor website for our city  so, neighbor involvement is a must, as you may eliminate them from living or feeding on your or adjacent property, but they will still be in the area and will likely return.  if you do not know your neighbors and do not want to do the door-to-door thing, then join nextdoordotcom for your city and post something like  "Unwanted Neighbors - Rats!" ... this is how we learned that it is a pervasive, city-wide problem and we were both receiving and disseminating information via this site  though i appreciate that most of us no longer need neighbors in this era, you do NEED your neighbors as allies in this war!

Now for the mowing part, this mower works better than I hoped.  With only two wheels, you can pull the mower back and turn it with less effort than is required with an electric or gas mower with four wheels.  In tight spaces, this mower is easy to turn and bring back.  For the area that I mow, the mower must be pulled back several times.  The available grass catcher would create problems by dumping grass each time.
5738	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This product is NOT designed to keep deer out. It is far too flimsy.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing but since it had a high review I purchased it. Don't spend you money on this if your goal is to keep deer out of your garden. It MAY be good for keeping birds out. The old saying "you get what you pay for" definitely applies here.
5.  Kness Tip-Trap 109-0-001 - last place.  The Tip-Trap missed once and was tipped but empty.  I kept it baited and tried for 2 weeks, I put it along a wall with peanut butter, etc, baited as per directions with a small dab but it remained empty the whole time.  It was cheap at least.

2971	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	If you purchase an INTEX Easy Set pool, and you live in a region that requires you to take the pool down for the winter, you should understand that you are essentially purchasing a $100 disposable pool.  The pool will not make it through the winter stored in the garage without cracking.  We purchased an Easy Set pool in July, 2009, took it down in September, 2009, and then tried to set it up again in May, 2010.  The morning after we set up the pool, we discovered that the inflatable ring that keeps the pool from spilling out had gone completely flat because it was riddled with little pin-prick sized holes.  After spending two-weeks trying to indentify and patch all of the little holes (I stopped after patching 8 of them), I finally emptied the pool and threw it in the garbage in disgust.  The Easy Set pools only carry a 90-day warranty, which I learned only after calling INTEX customer service.  (Nowhere could I find warranty information in the materials that came with the pool.)  Not only was INTEX unwilling to send me a new pool, they wouldn't even send me a coupon for a discount on another pool.  Now I have to decide if I want to spend another $100 on a disposable pool, or if I should just take my daughter to the lake.  It seems like such a waste to have to throw these things in a landfill just because of a "few" little holes.

After a half hour of this, I actually feel like I've accomplished something. I've brought order to the lawn. I've been outside in the sunshine. No one interrupted me. Ahhhhh. I'm refreshed and jolly well ready to go back in for an afternoon of conference calls and document edits.


Again this is a great hose and would recommend highly, ***** five stars.

The only minor "twist" is that you have to tie a small tight knot in the red plastic cord that runs through the red plastic top, which screws onto the glass.  That's likely the only way to secure the two together.  I used needle-nose pliers to tighten it.

Unfortunately, if you get a flying insect with bigger wings, and it gets tangled in the inner cage, the device will continue to shock it until either it is singed to a crisp and falls off or you shake the device using the upper ring. The long period as the big was repeatedly zapped was something I could do without at a patio dinner party. It was hard to ignore.

4552	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	worked as intended
601	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We have used one of these for about ten years with great success.  The tractor can even follow the hose around gentle 10' radius curves.  The little ramp clips on the hose and has a folding ground spike to keep it  from slipping.  When the tractor reaches the ramp, it pushes a shut off  valve on the belly of the tractor.  Very simple and effective.  Part of our  ramp finally snapped off, but it still works.  We've never had a problem  with the tractor.  The adjstable spray wands allow you to regulate the size  of the area covered.  I suppose it can drag about forty feet of hose before  it slows it down.  That probably will vary depending on the depth and  density of your turf and how straight the path is.

1188	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a "traveling" sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.
6338	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Like it.  so far it seems to be making a difference in my yard.  I believe that it has cut the mosquito nuisance significantly.

Then 2 places in the back yard. With this little gem, I ran the hose through the yard - with a bend to cover the 45 turn, no less. It works perfectly.  It's also pretty ingenious how you can adjust the arms for wider or tighter areas.

9708	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Its dead simple - surprisingly hard to find in a water timer. It runs on time without problems for 6 months now even after power blips out. One important thing to note is how many zones you need. I made the mistake of getting a 12 zone when I really only had 6 wired and only use 3 out of them due to drought. Speaking of drought, if you have restrictions in your area where you can't water after rain fall, there is a rain delay button making it perfect for my area.
I bought these and ones similar that had a clear top.. i liked both and they would have been fine if field mice would fit ... if you go to a pet store the cute white mice fit.. ANYTHING  bigger will not fit..

Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.
9359	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The reviews for this were somewhat mixed but good overall.  In use, it actually kills many moths and few mosquitoes.  When I searched to order a second attractant cartridge (it comes with one, but there are slots for 2), there were reviews for this product under the attractant that were less favorable than under the actual product.  I am/was using the largest model.

1082	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The most frustrating to use its  blade refuses to stay tight having a inlay nod to keep tightening by a bolt  having no concept in its technology  what so ever.  You never will need to change the blade it never will get worn enough to worry about it

No big deal, since you only have to do this once. And, the assembly gave me a chance to examine all the parts carefully. The materials are all sturdy and fit together well.

2719	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.

Put this trap in an active tunnel and BAM!, killed a huge mole the 1st day.  I've got 2 this year and am very pleased.  be careful when setting and installing, as the pan requires little pressure to set off.  And I flag mine so it's noticeable and I don't hit them with the mower.
5934	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is an *ingenious design* and I applaud the designer.  When the door shuts it's shut, you can see across the room whether a mouse got in, it's easy to clean, has fewer parts to break and none to rust.  I did have a guy escape once when I was gone for a few hours, still can't figure how he did it!  No trap is 100%, but to me, this is number one!  I've used it over and over (and over) again, works like a charm.
Other nits I have against this device is that it leaks around the hose connection. It's worst leak is on the backside of where the connector attaches. I plan to contact the mfgr about this "defect?"
I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.

6690	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I would have given this feeder 5 stars if the glass bottle had a larger opening for filling and cleaning.  I thought that the red plastic top was a screw-on lid (like the feeder that I was replacing had).  It screws on, but onto the bottom of the glass container, not the filling end.  The filling end has a very narrow opening and a regular-sized bottle brush will not fit into it for cleaning. I don't even want to think about how hard it will be to clean the base.  I am quite disappointed with the product, overall, but the birds like it.  It's all about the birds...

6317	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this hummingbird feeder. No complaints, no leaking. The hummingbirds are crazy about it, I will be purchasing another.
The ash catcher is a really nice touch as well.  I personally thought it was worth paying the extra money for this feature over the Weber Silver Grill.  It is simple to remove and empty and catches the ashes and small pieces of hot coals which inevitably fall through.  It is just convinient and more importantly, SAFER.  When dealing with fire around your home, safety is absolutely crucial, this model offers that insurance.

I do use mine for salt.  I don't use rock salt, I use calcium chloride or magnesium oxide pellets.  I leave the agitator in and I go slow so it doesn't throw the salt too far (onto the lawn).  I never leave salt in the spreader for more than a day so it doesn't absorb moisture and harden in the hopper.  I also use a plastic grocery sack as a hopper cover to keep snow/water out and finally I rinse it with a bucket of hot water after each storm/use.  I know that Earthway discourages use with salt, but I've had no problems with it.

6213	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I ordered my Scotts 20" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.
Update: It has now been five days since I received my 15 watt Flowtron bug zapper and I'm happy with it. It has been on 24/7 since I plugged it in. It's not terribly bright which makes for a soft night light for my den. As I kicked back with my laptop tonight and listened to a bug fry every now and then, just ordered two more 40 watt Flowtron units. Hope to have a very bug free summer in my home.
The older model had a "swing open" cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.

Finally, make sure you only fill as much nectar that can be consumed in 2-3 days.  After that, it starts to ferment or get moldy.  So, if you only a few hummers, maybe only use 1 cup of nectar at a time (don't buy the premixed nectar - total waste of money - or use red dye which is harmful).  USE CANE SUGAR FOR BEST RESULTS.

The unit itself is fairly well balanced and easy to maneuver.  I have the handle extension at the lowest setting (I'm short), but there are several other higher settings as well.  There is a rear groove that helps guide the edger to follow the edge of the drive.  It has different depth settings (seemed to help when I lowered it).  This also has an option to use it as a trencher, I assume for laying wires.  I don't anticipate using this feature, but it is nice to know I have that capability.

Got tired of the other kinds that you would normally buy at your local store only to get a piece of junk and find it at the curb for trash pick-up. I decided on this unit. Earthway makes a quality product. Opened it up and assembled it in about 45 minutes. Not too bad. Instructions were clear and picture illustrations a bit schetchy at times but none-the-less it worked out. Very satisfied! I would definitely recommend this spreader. Just be handy with tools and patience with the instructions and you should have it together without complications. Only wish that it came with a hopper cover. This is an option to purchase should you need it.

Installation was easy. Basically I just reused the old manifold risers. First I cut the risers in half from the manifold to the old Toro valves. Next I unthreaded the old cut-off risers from the old Toro valves, and threaded the same cut-off risers onto the new valve. Then I glued the cut off riser end into a coupler and glued the coupler onto the old manifold riser that was cut off and still sticking up out of the ground.

I am 45-years-old. I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years. And I have NEVER had a power edger. I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned, manual edger. Finally, after too many blisters, a sore back, and just plain old laziness, I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog. And boy...Am I glad I did! Right out of the box, I could tell this was a quality product. Assembly couldn't have been any easier. Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle. No tools required! And everything else is pre-assembled. I had used a power edger in the past. Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something. But for all practical purposes, this was my first time. And it was easy as pie. I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog. The edging was done fast and easy. What a difference, too! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger. Instead I now get a nice clean "professional" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers. I had a $25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member. So for about $65.00 total, I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!

The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.

The Scott used to have a less well made handle.  To me, in my use, it is the handle that is the wear part.  In my heavy use I have broken the handle on every mower I have owned.  Given the many plantings and hills I have to be pulling the mower back and at an angle a lot.  Scott re-engineered the handle a few years ago -- a single U lower handle with thicker tubing.  That  handle lasts twice as long or longer.  When a handle breaks I call the Scott 800 number and they send out a replacement, or replacement for broken section of the handle.  No charge.  Very happy with the customer service.

But unless there is something really tricky in getting it going (yes, I found the button on the bottom) there was nothing I could do to make any of it work. Just sat their and directed water to one spot.

7594	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	From my reserch, this is the best mole trap out there.  It does work for me but took lots of trial and error to figure out how to set it correctly.  I bought two, one worked perfectly, but one had too much powder coat on the trigger pan to release properly.  Don't be afraid to use pliers on it to adjust the release/ trigger pan lip to set the release force.  And make sure the legs pass each other when released, one leg was slightly bent striking the other on one. What I found works best for Pacific NW moles was to dig the trap hole just barely large enough for the trap.  No loose dirt on ends of trap.  Clear the mole tunnel of all loose dirt with a spoon and pack the bottom solid so he doesn't dig around in the soft dirt. I used sod to cover the trap with NO dirt back fill in the hole like the instructions say. Once I found a main tunnel to set it in, its deadly!
2501	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It works, and quality is good, but I haven't used it enough to fully rate it yet.  I will say that if you take a few minutes with a file and sharpen the edges up a bit, it becomes notably easier to use.  This seems true with most any new outdoor tool.  I suppose they don't want to ship it overly sharp for fear of damage to the edge or possibly injuring someone.

Perhaps it's because I live in California, but it bears a warning label saying it contains cancer-causing material--I'm guessing lead, but jeez, I wouldn't let that deter me. I imagine that's one of the many examples of a government regulation that must be applied across-the-board, whether meaningful or not. "Anything that contains more than X% lead must contain a cancer warning." I'd bet that unless you ate the damn thing, there's no cancer risk---but what do I know. I certainly haven't investigated it. Life's too short to worry about risks likely to be minuscule. My recommendation? Go buy the thing and enjoy your gardening.

April 15, 2012: Have had one of my 40 watt bug zappers on indoors for a week now as Summer approaches. These were money well spent for me. A screw in Levitron socket to outlet adapter available from Amazon or a hardware store will allow one to plug these units into a standard light bulb socket on an overhead light fixture or wherever.

Weber, it would seem, has a well-deserved reputation and this backyard grill has many nice features that make grilling easy and fun. It appears to be wonderfully sturdy and well constructed. It's not too bad looking and it does a wonderful job on the meat. I'm not a big meat-eater but I almost can't resist the taste and smell of a cheeseburger cooked on the Weber Grill.

Sometimes it gets the spacing right, sometimes it doesn't get any seeds, sometimes it gets 3.
The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.

After a fair amount of trial and error with feeders, this is why I would say this model is the best: it is easy to clean with a sponge bottle brush (also purchased on Amazon, along with tiny brushes for the feeding opening) and, most of all, the heavy plastic hook hole. Living in California means triple digit numbers for heat in the summer. Unlike other feeders with less sturdy plastic that breaks, this feeder stays strong and battles the heat without disruption. Side note: there is no need to dye the water red. The feeder  alone will draw the birds. They know what the feeder means.

1.  Probably not great for newly seeded lawns.  The weight of the hose will soon be too much for the tractor to pull and it will get stuck in the mud.  It needs the root system of established grass or sod to maintain traction.

COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERS
1284	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered this sprinkler with high hopes because I have a huge lawn, no sprinkler system, and it just isn't possible to water with conventional "move-around" hose-end sprinklers.  I got it to work (make sure you get the sprinkler arms in exactly the right position!). The sprinkler itself is quite heavy, metal, but - the cheap plastic end-ramp (that the sprinkler is supposed to climb onto & shut itself off) is absolutely useless.  Why Nelson thought a light-weight plastic fixture with an inadequate short rod to anchor it into the ground would be acceptable and work is beyond me! I've tried a number of times to make this work, with only one success... I have a LARGE rural lawn - it's not a golf course! - but it should be acceptable for this to negotiate.  (I recently bought a new hose - a Tuff-Guard Extra Flexible, Kink Proof Garden Hose - and the traveling sprinkler can't follow it at all, but gets hung up on the hose ridges.) - This thing will probably live in the garage until I donate it, sell it, or give it away... I'm going to check out other brands...

Thumping stops, valve works, but then solenoid leaks.  Tighten the solenoid and when you close and reopen the valve, the thump thump thump comes back.  It's like is trying to open the valve, but can't quite get it opened.  Maybe the solenoid plunger is slightly to long ?  Just not reliable.

Advantages: No gas, no fumes, no loud noise, much safer than a gas mower.
One minor criticism--it would have been helpful if there had been a way to see inside the trap and know for sure if it contained a mouse, and what the mouse's condition might be.  I don't think I'd have been nervous about opening the trap if I'd had some way of knowing what to expect, and it doesn't seem as though it would be difficult to make a transparent window in the side of the trap for that purpose.
I saw this on Amazon -saw it was Prime - and had to try it.  Now THIS is a bug zapper!  We leave ours running. It still zaps 'em in the daytime too. At dusk and dark though, that's when it really does it's magic.

This chain has one less link than the stock chain that came with the saw. The original Bar was made by Echo. Both are low kickback, but if your old bar is worn out , your extra chains will not fit this bar I'm told because of the link difference. I have not used it yet,but it appears to be the same low kickback design and also will sharpen with the same size file. I trust this brand over any others and the price was half of what I would have paid in the store.
3611	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The new blade worked perfectly and allowed me to trim my lawn in half the time....  half the time that is from the completely worn blade I was using before. It had been so long since I changed blades that I didn't even remember that new blades have cutting teeth on them.  Highly recommended.
I only relate this story because I am the last of the online buyers. Resisted this method for years. But Amazon has yet to fail me in the last 6-9 months on any order. And while 45 cents is no big thing it certainly is more convenient to go to the door for a FedEx delivery than shop at Sears.

6951	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	First, let me say that my favorite method for ridding the yards of the furry beasties is to watch for active tunneling and pop them out of the ground with a pickaxe. I learned this technique from an old time Tennessean neighbor, who is very successful with it. While it works great in the early spring when the grass is short, not so much in the hot summer when the grass is grown longer, as the tunneling is difficult to see. NOW, I have tried other moles traps over the past 7 years, and have had NO LUCK with any of them ... even those which claim to be the best, were given to my neighbor as they just didn't trap my moles. I came across this trap on the Victor website, read the Amazon reviews about it, and purchased 2 of them ... I figured it couldn't be any worse than the previous traps. Of the Amazon reviews I found Geoffrey Klos' review information and one other which included a video of setting the trap to be very informative. To this point, I had been trying to get one particular mole for a couple of months. After receiving the traps, I read the instructions on the box, compared them to the Amazon reviewers, and did the following: gently pressed down a portion of a long "highway" tunnel with my foot; dug out a section of the flattened tunnel the width of the trap with a garden trowel, cut 2 "leg channels" with a flat-bladed ice chipper to a depth that the set "trigger pan" would sit flat/level with the surrounding ground, set the trap, placed it into the tunnel, and gently backfilled the dug out portion under the trap and covered it with magnolia leaves (not sure why). Somewhere I read that if the trap didn't catch a mole within 48 hours, move it, as the tunnel has been abandoned by the mole. As I knew this mole was still active in the immediate area, I decided to just leave it and see what happened. 72 hours after setting the trap, my wife told me that the trap levers were laying more flat than upright, and that the locking bar was no longer locked. YEP! We had the mole!!! Woo-hoo! Not yet deceased, but under our control! This is the best trap I have used, and there are 2 more furry ones in my sights at this writing. Recommended highly! Good hunting!

I have not had any problems with the mower in the year I have had it. I originally bought it because I was tired of smelling like gas and I was growing a little concerned with the pollution of a gas mower (noise and air...I have poor hearing already and a typical mower was too loud). This mower is great for those reasons. Plus, since the grass is cut and not beat, I have not problems with my grass allergies. I would normally have a running nose when I finished with a grass mower. Now I have a dry nose, I don't smell like grass, and I don't smell like gas.

One other thing: I can grill "hot" in the Joe Gold even without my added grate because I use Stubb's all-natural charcoal (or equivalent), not the supermarket stuff.

It took the 3 of us about 20 minutes. Would have been faster if I'd followed the directions and dug the entry and exit channels a big longer.  Also, we ran into a big rock and had to shift a few inches. Once we hit just sand, it was smooth going.

3) If a problem develops with one segment, I can shut it down for repair while the other segment is left operating.
Wear protective goggles and keep pets and people away. You're out of the way of debris mostly when you're behind it, but the blade sparks when it hits rocks and the blade sends rocks flying VERY far. Our garden is near our driveway so we had to move our cars for fear of denting them.
6115	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores "inconvenient truth" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now "running like a champ".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the "high spots".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.

Why any company would ship a unit that weighs in at 40 pounds loaded, would "include" a 1" wide waist to shoulder blade harness as adequate baffles me.  A back pack this heavy (and otherwise this good) merits a harness that wraps around the waist to take most of the weight.  Shame on you for selling a should saver (which you tried to wreck) for extra money.

1996	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered two of these Gilmore sprayers via Amazon and received promptly.  Both units had air pressure leaks where the handle part of the unit screws onto the liquid holding portion; One sprayer air leaked moderately, the other unit air pressure leaked severely;  I was barely able to use the moderately leaking unit to do a "rush job" by very frequent pumping.  The severely leaking unit was not usable because it lost pressure so fast.  I called Gilmore customer service and requested a new unit and was told I would be sent a new replacement sprayer if I would prove recent purchase by sending them a copy of the concerned invoice via email -- I did this and quickly received a new identical replacement sprayer.  I immediately added pure water to the reservoir, operated the hand pump to pressurize, and immediately noted this new replacement sprayer also had a severe air pressure leak making it virtually unusable.
They refuse to use the "automatic" feature defeating the purpose and accidentally change a setting while operating manually.
3291	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works well.
My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly e.g., it's not an even "circle" of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.

4308	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	While this mower trimmed small patches of clover and leafy plants, it simply squashed down my grass without cutting it.  It wouldn't cut anything taller than just a few inches, which I suppose is fine if you want to mow your lawn every other day.  Any little piece of debris will stop this mower in its tracks - even a patch of grass a bit thicker than usual.  My yard looks terrible and I am returning this mower immediately.  I do not recommend this mower.

4012	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have three of these (BK-80D) around my farm in Georgia that I run from dusk to dawn almost year round.  They work better than any other chemical free concoction to eradicate bugs, especially mosquitoes.  The octanol cartridge is not really necessary.  I was going to give them three stars due do durability issues, but since they work so well I bumped up the rating.  I had to replace several starter bulbs and one transformer on them.  They can easily be changed and the company will send you one if it is within the two year warranty period.  Flowtron should include at least a couple of starter-bulbs to start out with since I seem to need about two per year for the three units.  Also, the main bulbs need to be changed pretty much yearly, so consider another $30 per year for this plus the energy usage.  However, overall, and due to its effectiveness, they are the cheapest and most effective option out there to get rid of night/dusk time flying insects.

My only complaint is the ants use it as a freeway to get to the dead bugs on the Flowtron device. It took less than 5 mins to install this. The screws that came with it is sufficient, but depending on the surface you're mounting it to, you may want to consider stronger wood screws.
Did not leak at spigot
The assembly instructions were a little mysterious, and the pictures, including the one in this ad, show the handle attached BACKWARD. The top of the handle should angle down, not up, or the leverage will be lost. I put my handle on as shown and attempted to mow that way for 10 minutes until I realized that su'pm wa'n rite. Ha ha, very funny, Scotts. Hope the neighbors didn't see that. Fortunately all the bolts have wingnuts so it was easily corrected in the field.

The opening of the mouth is small on the glass jar so you can't get inside to clean it and the plastic base doesn't come apart so I had to get some pipe cleaners to clean the inside as it can get moldy in hard to reach spaces. Overall though the birds love this glass one as opposed to the plastic ones I have.

Mosquitos love me. I joke that people don't buy citronella candles, they invite me to a party instead and all the mosquitos will come to me and leave them alone.
Pros:
For an experiment, knowing that a primary lure for all US breeds of mosquitoes is CO2. So I am going to install a CO2 generator typical for aquariums and have the vent tube attached to the base of this unit without a lure and count the mosquitoes killed over a forty eight hour period.
These are strong and sturdy.  Makes trimming easy.
7936	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have had the Flowtron BK-80D every sence the first of last summer 2014 and have now had to replace both bulbs. The first one went out about 2 months after purchase. The second about a week ago 7/ 2015. The BF-150 Bulb I order this year would not push into the socket for the four prongs were two large. So I sanded the prongs down and the bulb would fit. I also noticed that for my BK-80D that when I first bought it last year the tops of the bulbs would would not light up blue just orange. So I turned the bulbs around and put them in and they both lit up solid blue. No where does it say the bulbs has to be a certain direction, but mine do are they will not light up totally blue. The name Flowtron made in China has to be facing inward toward each other. Am I the only one with this problem or is it just my Flowtron? The other problem is mine does not draw mosquitoes. I had a Flowtrom about 15 years ago and you could hear and see the Flowtron drawing mosquitoes all night long. Also you could not get close to the older Flowtron because it was surrounded by mosquitoes. Thats why I bought a Flowtron again but this new one does not draw mosquitoes. I don't know if we have a new breed of mosquitoes that are not drawn by the Bug Light or the newer Flowtron does not work like the older one I had. I also have a half an acre Flowtron BK-15D and this one does not draw mosquitoes either. Mosquitoes seem to laugh at both. Ha, Ha!

1169	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Really nice pruning shears. I've used Fiskar shears for many years and always been pleased with the quality. I needed a replacement set and bought these, expecting them to have the same excellent quality but also the same sometimes-difficult blade lock that my older Fiskars have. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this new pair has a very simple slide-up-and-lock feature to lock the blades. This requires a simple push with the thumb instead of the old balky and difficult to use locking mechanism that had to be forced into place. Nice improvement, Fiskars!
669	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a very good garden hose.  This was a replacement for a supposed "heavy duty" hose I bought from a well-known big-box store that just didn't hold up.  That hose leaked and sprayed all over the place from the minute I brought it home and already started to kink and pinhole within a month.  This Gilmour hose doesn't leak a drop and hasn't kinked on me at all.  I'm pretty happy with this product and will look to buying all Gilmour hoses for my future needs.
It would be nice if they had a pre-drilled hole to attach the handle, but that is only a minor quibble (I never actually fixed it in place and used the tool just fine).
Do your research.  If you are primarily concerned about mosquitoes or have a larger yard, you will probably want to step up to the 80D or another line of products.  If you are primarily looking for something for moth control on an average sized home, this product deserves a try.

I checked on mouse home ranges, which vary based on food available, but a block is far enough away to release the mice. I release them in the same place, since I assume they are a community in my larder where I trap them.  That's what the mouse social organization literature says, anyway.

We bought both the gallon and quart size containers, though found the quart lid didn't fit well. So highly recommend the gallon container - then simply buy the refills and watch them die by the thousands....maybe even tens of thousands!
He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I'm happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system. Will update if there is any more action, positive or negative.

6347	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I tried smoking out this guy and it never worked, after about ten smokes i went to what I used to use all the time, the Victor mole trap.  I let a friend borrow my old traps but never got them back so I went out and  bought four.  I put in three traps in access tunnels around his nest.  Bam, he is dead.  I recommend using a  post hole digger.  Dig between mounds, DO NOT TOUCH the trap with bare hands.  Use gloves.  Do not try to trap the mound tunnels. Set the trap between holes, per directions, mound dirt in center of hole, put sod  chunks back over the top of the trap after you set it.  I reach down and hold the trigger plate firmly against the trigger arm so no false triggers during placement.  Put the arms in line with the hole so the tunnel aligns with the trap arms.  Mound the soil to hide the trap.  Then place bucket over the hole to prevent light from penetrating.  I kick over the mounds to see if more activity occurs.  I use two and three traps per critter.  Never a fail.  Find the tunnels between mounds by staggering post holes till you find one.
47	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This tool saved me so much time. I purchased a house that had horrible linoleum floors that were too far gone to lay new flooring on top of. I purchased an random oscillating scraper, with much back pain and being on my hands and knees it worked very slowly and chipped the old flooring away rather than scraping up huge pieces. I went ahead and bought this bully scraper and everything started to move along at a fast pace. It is made very well, the blade is thick high quality steel and the handle does not bend even under strenuous scraping. Any equipment will start to dull while rubbing it against cement, but this did so at a much slower rate. I did run into two or three spots where the linoleum was heavily glued and would not scrape off, just a word of advice if you have access to hot water and have cement flooring it helps to mop on some hot water and let it sit for a couple minutes and it will scrape off like butter.

On my Husky these chains last pretty well, fairly big high rpm saw, rips like crazy with a new or just sharpened chain. You people trashing the chain because it's the wrong one; well I don't find that the chains fault. When you get the right one, save the label so you remember what to order.

Unless I just have been blessed with a house full of brilliant mice.
6823	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This summer, sick of my dirty, smelly, loud gas-powered mower, I decided to purchase a reel mower. As someone who consdiers himself to be environmentally friendly, I no longer felt comfortable using a polluting machine on my lawn. At the same time, I didn't want to turn lawn mowing into a huge, difficult task. After researching every model on the market, I decided I would give the Scotts 2000-20 reel mower a try. My idea of lawn mowing has completely changed. What used to be a tedious, annoying task is now pleasant and relaxing. That is due to the ease of use and functionality of this mower. Out of the box, it is very clear how to put this mower together, and it should take no more than about 30 minutes to get that part done. Just remember to put some dishwashing detergent inside the rubber handle cover before you slide it on. Then you're ready to go. The height adjustment, which is located near one of the rear wheels, is very easy to access: you simply push a lever in and slide it to the correct height level. The height levels are clearly marked right on a dial (a lot easier than having to get out your wrench and screwdriver for most gas-powered mowers). In actual cutting, this mower is very smooth. With minimal energy, the blades spin with good speed and torque, easily cutting the grass down to size. I have a somewhat weedy lawn, and I was concerned that this mower might bog down, but it cuts everything with the same smoothness. My lawn also has several uneven spots, but this mower handled that nicely as well. The rear wheels keep the mower balanced as you push it. If you push faster, of course, the blades will run faster. However, at a casual pace, the blades definitely spin fast enough to take care of a typical lawn. I have even "let my lawn go" a couple of times this summer (it grew to about 6" in height at one point), but the mower handles it just fine. As you're mowing, you'll notice that there is a lot less dust flying around, no smell of fumes, and you can listen to birds and natural sounds the entire time you're outside. This reel mower cuts the grass more cleanly for sure -- you can see that the grass is greener when you're done, without brown tips. When I cut my lawn, I leave the cuttings there and allow them to mulch into the soil. The mower is light enough to lift and carry into a storage area. You don't have to keep oil and gas around, so this mower takes up the minimal amount of space. Here are the only disadvantages to this mower: (1) You can only get about 6" to an edge; (2) If a stick gets into the blade, you have to stop and pull it out; (3) You will not be visiting the local lawnmower repair shop every season for a tune up, spark plugs, air filter, and any number of other unpredictable problems. Since I started using this mower, several people have asked me if it's more difficult to use, if it's slower, or cuts worse. I assume potential buyers are asking the same questions. I will venture to say that it is actually JUST AS EASY TO USE A REEL MOWER AS IT IS TO USE A GAS-POWERED MODEL. There is NOTHING about a gas-powered mower than makes it easier to use, and gas-powered mowers do not save any time, espcially when you consider all the peripheral needs of owning one. Overall, this is an example of a simple, low-tech solution to a common need.

7254	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	For all of my camping purchases, this is the one that I most wish I could take back, pony up a bit more $$, and purchase a better grill.  This (as most reviewers will state) will not get very hot, will have un-even cooking temps, and goes out constantly.  If using in any sort of wind, you should be aware that you will constantly be forced to re-light during the cooking process.  Additionally as this thing will not get very hot and/or cooks unevenly, you will be waiting a long time to cook any sort of bar-b-que item.  As an example it takes 30+ minutes to cook frozen burger patties.  Recommendation - save your money and purchase a larger grill (webber Q)

Saved a lot of money and stress!
The unit is heavy and the hose makes a mess of your yard. If it gets off track and is not following the hose it can be mired in the garden, or worse start walking into the street. To be honest we have two of these and went back to using traditional sprinklers even though we have to go outside and move them all the time. It's a neat toy but I guess if you want your lawn to look nice sprinklers should be installed.

The steel used in the gauge is quite hard but you need to try to avoid filing into it.  If you file away at the gauge itself, you will end up with excessive depth.

1) Effectiveness

There are a couple drawbacks. Most importantly, it really only works well when you have a rather large open area that needs sprinkling. If you have large trees in your yard (as we do), it's less practical. We need a separate sprinkler for this. Also, the sprinkler is quite heavy. This is not a lightweight piece of equipment.
5172	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.
2659	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works like a champ.  However the first time I used it, like others mentioned, it got stuck and would not flip back the other direction.  It turns out I had a kink in my coiled hose reducing water pressure.  Once I d the issue and straightened the kink the sprinkler began working flawlessly.  Well constructed.... use with an Orbit spike.
My kids wanted me to tell you that the fire flies are gone too.  That makes me kind of sad, but they can go play in someone else's yard....

I followed the instruction, hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go. Oh, I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom. A few zaps here and there, but nothing spectacular. I left it on out there for a week, and saw no difference. Still got attacked by mosquitoes. Two weeks, same thing.

7898	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product because I have a hose cart and the connector to the cart had split and was leaking.  This product was the perfect remedy.  It fit perfectly but left plenty of extra length to move the hose cart around as needed.  It fit tightly on the hose cart and the spigot.  It included two O rings to ensure no leaking.  The hose was sturdily built and did not kink which is a big plus.  It allowed good water pressure to the hose reel and did not decrease the pressure to the hose itself.  The brass connectors were very nice and tightened nicely to both the reel and the house spigot.  If you need a replacement hose for a connecting hose I would certainly recommend this one.

1.  You cannot stop a section mid-program (for example, to adjust a sprinkler head) and then resume where it was in the programmed time.  You have to start again using the water one section feature.

- The worst problem is the rust. I must admit up front that I leave this grill out year 'round, including all winter. If you keep it indoors, it would do better I'd hope. The weak point is the "flavorizer" which is a thin piece of inferior steel shaped to fit beneath the grill and above the tube where the flames heat the grill.  This thing is simply made of the wrong sort of steel, not enamel coated, and far too thin. It has slits cut in it by necessity for ventilation and to allow the heat through to the grill, but within a season or perhaps two, it will literally disintegrate nearly to dust, with large holes appearing and rusting away to nothing.  This piece is also where all the drippings land and can really build up. It's really a messy process to disassemble and dump these out. The "flavorizer" part rusted out on my first one, and I found that a replacement was nearly what I paid for the grill, but I went ahead and got one. It too rusted into dust eventually. Unsurprisingly, my latest one rusted out horribly over the winter and, like the first, it literally fell apart, leaving gaping holes.  This creates open flame beneath the grill, overcooking the food and allowing drippings to fall directly onto the gas burner. Neither are good.
7453	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	What is bad to say about these great grates? Uniform heat, easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates, and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old Weber.

My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal.
The price doesn't seem to change much). (I searched quite a bit before deciding to buy this. There just aren't that many choices in mosquito zappers. I think this will change with all the disease carrying mosquitos on the rise (such as the Zika and Chickungunya virus).

This is an easy unit to assemble.  Out of box you have a complete mower assembly.  All you need to do is add the handle.  The mower handle consists of four pieces of metal tubing.  These are held together by three " machine bolts and three lock nuts.  The tools I used for assembly are a 7/16" wrench, a 7/16" socket and a pair of pliers.  There are two studs on the mower assembly to connect (mount) the handle.

For the most part, I have been very pleased with the performance of the American Lawn Mower 1705-16 reel mower.  I would advise anyone looking to purchase a manual reel mower to do some quick research if you have never used one before.  These type mowers are a bit limited in scope as to what they can handle, and it is very important to fit the specific reel mower type to your specific needs.  Certain grasses require a heavier duty mower than others, and there are certain conditions that no reel mower will handle.
251	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Got mine second hand (but I bought the optional seed plates new for it).  Works fine but the prepped ground needs to be smooth and free of lumps (finely tilled and raked smooth).
Previously, I had a sprinkler hose, but it was a much less pliable vinyl and difficult to manage. This hose on the other hand, is extremely flexible and easy to position. The difficulty is that this hose uses 2 side-by-side hoses joined together which means 2 water inlets. So I had to create a feed for both inlets from a single source hose.

9926	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	What can I say, I tried using my sprinklers in the spring and the solenoid would not work. Since the valves were Orbit, I just replaced them with these.

One in a porch area or 2 in a barn. You will control the buggers.
7022	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Very well built and sturdy but so far, after a month of trying, no moles.  Located in Florida the soil is extremely sandy and loose so when we try to retain any semblance of a tunnel it's just a pile of sand.  Not sure if there's any secrets to using these in sandy soil but we have stepped down tracks, found rebuilt and pushed part down and had it get pushed back up.  Then we have set the traps, waited and waited, and don't get a thing.... except more mole damage all around.  You disturb the track at all and it all just collapses down.  Any hints would be GREATLY appreciated.  If we could eliminate some of our moles, or even figure out how to get just ONE, then we'd be pushing the star rating waaaay up.
The principal is great as are the promised benefits. Fortunately, there are better made alternatives. For about a hundred dollars more you can get a National Walking Sprinkler model that has steel gears and has been around since the thirties - made in Nebraska I believe. Amazon sells their model B3 or they have a web site. You won't regret the additional investment. As it does not have auto shutoff, you may want to add a timer.
9619	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Was inexpensive and had free shipping.

489	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These shears are great so far, but I've only used them a couple times this spring. They are incredibly capable of trimming even thicker (~1/4 inch) green branches on the larger shrubs which I thought they might choke on a bit. The grips are comfortable and the length of the blades allows you to shear large swaths of whatever it is that you are trimming. The hole on the end of the blade is a mystery to me; when this item arrived there was a tag secured using that hole, but surely it's not there just for that reason? If it has any real purpose I'd love to know, but it certainly has not hindered its functionality either.

319	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For a serious gardener, this is a great choice.  I bought 2- 75 ft lengths  my hose reel holds 150 feet. The hose is well made and has excellent, water tight couplings with good spring protection for all the abuse and dragging around I will put it through.  It feels durable without being deadly heavy.  I water a green house and large vegetable garden daily and have gone through a lot of hoses over the years.  This hose was advertised as non-kink, but I've already had a couple of episodes when kinks happened.  However, I would describe this hose as very highly kink resistant, quickly unkinks once the hose is adjusted, and much more trouble free to haul around and operate than any other hose I've ever owned.  Careful storage, by winding your hose onto a  good quality hose reel is one of the best ways to prevent kinks and prolong the life of any hose.  This hose has been in use daily since March (located in Central VA)  and has gone through at least two times when night temperatures went down to 26 degrees  just fine.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well this hose will do through from October until mid December with use in grow tunnels.  I think it will work fine, but will report again later.  Highly recommend, especially if you water a lot.

All in all, a great product. I never thought I would buy an electric edger. I had resigned myself to buying a gas edger at a price of about $300. I thought that there was no way an electric edger could do the job. In my case I was wrong.

I have noticed the grass looks better with this mower. This could be due to the fact that I cut the grass pretty long (leaving about 3 inches in length). As some have said it does take the grass a little time to get used to a reel mower...about 2-3 mows.

I have lost count on the number of non-rubber hoses that that I have replaced in the past couple of years.  I have had them burst and/or leak on me after what I consider to be an unreasonably short amount of time.  I have tossed because they were so stiff that I could hardly straighten them, or that they were really heavy, or that I had difficulty rolling them up on my hose reel.
I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter.

2243	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I noted several people had problems with this little lite weight sprinkler but I have used mine often and liked it so much I ordered two more. I like that it covers a LOT of area with not having to turn the faucet on much. Lite weight and you can change the height. I did buy another one very similar but heavier and more expensive. It works well too but this is much cheaper.
8471	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great product, good price, and fast delivery.  I am in Washington state and we just went through Snowmageddon.  Our trees had 10+ years of growth over mild winters so there were may branches that were over extened and the weight of the ice storm leveraged them to the breaking point.  Trees, branches, split trunks, fences, flattened shrubs, you name it.  My old saw blade was so dull that it barely got through the bark.  It was raining so I got on line and ordered this blade - received it in 2 days, just in time for a clear day and got all the debris cut up.  worked great.  would by Oregon brand again.

7711	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This is the FOURTH grill I almost threw away due to corporate refusal to provide ANY written assembly instructions. Sure, there are drawings, but some of us are still LITERATE. When I saw there were no screws to attach the legs, I thought I had received a defective product because it's just too much work for Weber to WRITE (remember WORDS??) anything indicating that the legs were to be attached by spreading them and just clipping them into the supplied holes. I think consumers should demand a halt to such corporate irresponsibility. We do not work for Weber or any of the other corporations that sell items we have to finish manufacturing ourselves. The LEAST these corporations that increase profits by having us complete the manufacturing can do is PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS. Here's a simple way to test if instructions are useful. Have a variety of people who do not work for the company and are not at all familiar with the product attempt to complete a process by following the instructions. It's called a usability study; those of us who earned advanced degrees in something other than business are familiar with the process, and it's time corporate decision-makers learn it.
These are a bit more expensive than what you may have bought locally before, but these are the right size to properly mend or connect 3/4" hoses.  Considering the fact that you don't have to waste time and money to drive to the big box store, and then drive back again because the connectors you bought didn't work properly, having Amazon deliver them right to your door saves you time and stress.

846	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	In addition to its excellent quality and dependability, the Gilmour Flexogen is backed by Gilmour's Lifetime Replacement Policy which states; "A Gilmour product will provide complete satisfaction for the life of the product or it will be replaced free of charge. For replacement of an unsatisfactory flexogen hose, cut off both ends of the hose and send to: Robert Bosch Consumer Service, One Sprinkler Lane, Peoria, IL 61615. Be sure to include your name, address (not a P.O. Box), diameter and length of the hose and a brief description of the problem you are having. A replacement hose will be shipped approximately two (2) weeks after your information is received."
5) "I have three-foot tall weeds that this mower won't cut" - Again - you're using the wrong tool. But then, you probably also think that a hammer is as good as a screwdriver for putting screws in. And you'd better harvest those three-foot tall weeds before the DEA finds out about them.

1270	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Love it. I use it every week
998	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this sprayer.  It is finely engineered, with metal parts used for key components, works great, and has a lifetime guarantee. The spray pattern is very nice and even, and adjustable.  When the spray deflector is removed, you will get a powerful stream to reach 20 or 30 feet into trees (depends upon your water pressure).
The handle is retained on these studs by "E" rings.  I used the pliers to push the "E" rings into place.  An extra "E" ring is supplied in case you have trouble with this step.  As a guy who has put on a lot of "E" rings, I recommend doing this where you can find the part if it falls while you complete this step.  As for height adjustment, the factory setting works just fine for me.
The glaring weakness for this unit, regardless of cost, in my experience occurs when cutting a grass on fresh, brand newly planted/growing lawn. I do "the first cut" when the very first blades appear that they will soon lay over. The blade slices very smoothly thru the new, long-ish blades.  However the wheels push over and compress the blades down against the ground. The next pass, obviously doesn't cut them, because they're laying down within a quarter to half inch high.


1202	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Cheap coated mystery "metal" (MIM with a stamped handle) construction with some brass and plastic bits. Unless you remove it from your hose and bring it inside after every use, eventually that coating is going to chip off and the nozzle will start rusting as it's exposed to the elements. From a value perspective, do note that you're spending about 1/3 the cost of a high quality machined brass nozzle.
8586	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Works well maybe too well.  It is a small device but packs a loud, morbid punch. I thought the instructions were exaggerating when they recommend putting the device 25-30 feet away from the "protected" area.  That is not idle chatter.  The device zaps bugs in a loud taser-like shock. Bugs large and small. In fact, it attracted bugs I had never seen before or thought were pests! It attracts everything and zaps them as soon as it comes in contact with the inner chamber. It's loud and a bit jarring after a while. You are left with a puddle of dead bug shells.
CONS:

UPDATE:  The Gallon bottle arrived, and I moved it to a less conspicuous place from where I hung the Quart bottle.  After a day, no flies.  After two days, only a couple of flies.  What the heck could be wrong?  Then it hit me...the old bottle had hung in direct sunlight for most of the day, while the new bottle was hanging in the shade.  The Fly Bait wasn't "brewing" as fast, and I noticed there was no stinky smell.

  As for PLACING seeds , it works excellent !! depth easy to adjust , mechanism smooth , marker works , lite weight and strong enough .
I do not try to reuse it the next year. It is very thin and clings to itself due to the microscopic barbs on the netting.  Also, the shrubs will grow the next season making it difficult to fit the prior year netting.
9052	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fits as expected for my B&S Intek 24HP lawn tractor (inside my Craftsman mower).  Exact replacement and it traps the dust and grime that gets sucked in the front intake.  The pre-filter requires oiling so as to capture the fine dust).
One major drawback is the lack of a photo cell or timer - so buying a timer is needed (fortunately they are not expensive) in order to save the lamp and some electricity.
8006	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a well-designed small scale charcoal grill.  I generally use it when I only want to cook for one or two people or when portability matters.
Sorry I got off the main subject but was trying to give you ideas on how to place the zapper since it works so well but yet you wouldn't want it drawing bugs to you but instead away.  The replacement bulb seems a little expensive too from what I seen so take care of the unit and do common sense maintenance on it and hopefully this will last for years, outside of buying those bulbs. I am trying to include a short video. Do not be afraid to purchase this bug zapper.  Unless it arrives broken or defective you will be very happy with the results.

I was using them for the first time and found that I couldn't cut a branch of 1/4" without the cutters getting hung up. I even had a few such incidents cutting a 1/8" twig. The cutting blade would bypass the branch being cut and leave a gap on the tool that you could see through.
9500	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This newly designed vertical bar type of electrodes is SOOOO much better than the old cross-hatched system which was always plugging up with dead insects and either catching fire or becoming non-functional until the bug sludge was removed.

Save money by making your own nectar. A solution of one part sugar to four parts water (3/4 cup sugar to 3 cups water, for example) makes perfect nectar. I like to boil my nectar for a few minutes and then re-stir it to ensure the sugar has fully dissolved, then I simply let it cool. Adding red food coloring to your nectar is completely unnecessary to attract hummers, and is not healthy for them.

Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.
755	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the third one I have gotten. If you want a great hose and a great price, buy this. If you need 2 shorter hoses, still cheaper to buy this hose, cut it in half and buy  fittings for the cut ends

6357	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I noticed something fierce chewed away at the dog food container in the garage.  So I figured if something would go through that much trouble to get to dog food, why not give that animal dog food along with a cold bar of metal?  So I baited this trap with peanut butter, and put a couple pieces of dog food in it.  Make sure to wedge a piece of paper in the lever so they cannot take the bait back home.  It did not take long for the rats to succumb to the trap. In one week I caught eight, including one on the second floor on the roof.  I just kept re-using the same trap.  You can't find a better price on a dozen rat traps anywhere.

1625	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is the classic nozzle, well made and heavy duty. Does exactly what you expect when you squeeze to trigger- goes from fine mist to full blast. Only minor complaint is the little "on-keeper" metal clip on the back tends to fall off.
I bought several and am using them for areas that already have a long hose but with plants near the faucet, so the long hose can stay on the outer parts and this shorter hose can water the nearby plants.  However, 15' doesn't go very far, so practical use is limited.
  14) Now, use a finger to feel the clearance between the ground and the lever; and, push and/or tap the trap down slowly until it is only 1/16th inch or so from the ground.
at night. To my dismay in Aug 2016 it completely stopped working. My mother had a smaller model and hers worked for years. Maybe I should of went with the smaller model! Guess they just don't make things like they use to. For the price, and the brand name, I would of expected a longer lasting product. Of course it's also out of Amazon's return date time frame.

The brass Gilmour Jet works fine when new, but after a few gentle drops onto the driveway, the brass nozzle bent over slightly and partially separated from the base.  It then leaked profusely, making it useless.  The brass on the nozzle part of a Nelson brand sweeper is thicker and larger (stronger) than on the Gilmour nozzle.  The Nelson can easily stand such "abuse".  See Customer Images. I've dropped the Nelson nozzle on the driveway a hundred times and it's full of scratches, scratched, but it doesn't bend.

Remember, you want to draw the mosquitoes AWAY from your area, not to it, and that's exactly what the blue light does.  Great product tried and true. There are others out there readily available in your big box store.  This one will do the job better. I don't know why stores have stopped carrying them locally. Perhaps because they can buy for less and have a greater profit?

I think that a mouse would have to be really, really hungry to force the doors open -- there is quite a bit of resistance.  The mice in my house aren't really all that hungry (if they were, they'd be easier to catch in any style trap, y'know?).


8742	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I'm puzzled where the flaw is in this trap.  It's all metal, so it certainly removes the mouse's ability to chew their way out.  Yet I'm having the same mystery as so many others here:  mice get in, they eat the bait leaving a mess inside.  The get out however.  I've looked it over, applied tape to the cover to prevent a strong mouse from pushing his way up and out.  The tape doesn't not prevent escape.  So the lid must not be the flaw.

Cooking is slightly slower with the portable gas canisters vice the 20 pound tank--but not that much slower as to be a problem.  You do need the Flavorizor Bar in place to distribute the heat better and more evenly.  I have never had any problem with the piezo electric lighter.  It still works after 20+ years.

2253	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Have used this sprayer a lot this year.  The sprayer and wand are top quality.

4567	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Wow, how easy to mow a flat smooth lawn.  Fun, too. Warning, though, ruts in the lawn will make this thing get stuck.  It doesn't "glide" over the top of anything.  It HUGS the earth.  But, it gives a great look.  Another warning -- you can't let grass grow too long; this will only work on already short grass. Think of needing a "trim" instead of a "cut".  If I wait to long to mow, it doesn't cut the grass, just bends it.
9960	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Sprinklers work as good as new. Our little puppy chewed up the wires to the solenoids on the old ones. I guess they tasted good to her.
I bought this zapper as well as a bunch of citronella candles/torches.  The combination made the problem bearable, but after a couple of weeks I found that we no longer needed the citronella stuff - the zapper had diminished the mosquito population so much that the problem was minimal.

I brushed aside conventional wisdom about mole behavior and the need to put traps only in frequently used main runs. I seeded the most recent activity with a total of 6 traps.  I carefully installed one of the new victor traps in a feeding run. Making sure the blades were free, and placing a mound of dirt in the center of the run to cause the mole to push through it and resulting in a trip of the trap. I poured fine dirt to close off light.  I also wore washed rubber gloves. I was also careful to set the trip on the very edge of the trip pan catch for hair trigger action.

If your wheels jam hitting a root, just rock the mower or turn it upside down and roll it.  It's like an old tv. Doing magic stupid stuff makes it work.  However, remember the blades are VERY sharp, so exercise caution.

Be advised that these things do not discriminate between benificial bugs that we need for pollination of plants and such.

7925	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It fits much better into the limited space of my camper than the conventional round-style portable grill does. Plus the legs function to enclose it all as it's own hand sort of case. Also it's not held together with screws (expect for the handles) so there's nothing to rattle apart. Highest quality materials, as per weber standards. My only minor complaint is that with short handles and removal of those side metal panels it could be even more compact and fit even better into what tiny space I have.
The coals got hot but a little ash fell through the holes.  A piece of foil under the legs to catch the ashes would work, but I found an old aluminum pie pan.
6794	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have used this Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder style for years, it is the best one on the market. The hummingbirds like the perch and in the spring we have to put out 2 of these as we have well over 30+ hummers flocking to the feeders. We put one on each side of the house as the little hummers are very agressive. These feeders are so popular at our home that we have to fill them every day in the spring for a few weeks. We keep one up through the winter as we always have a few that seem to stay. When the food is frozen we bring it in for an hour or so and defrost the food and they are ready for the sweet little hummers. Someone comented that they are hard to clean, well maybe but I just take an old bottle brush and bend it a little and it works just fine on the bottom part and the little flowers pop out and I clean them with an old tooth brush. You can also buy more of the flowers. My only complaint would be that the perch after awhile (1-2 years) gets a little brittle and if you are not careful unscrewing the base the perch may break. Also we have a couple of Oreols that love the sweet food and so I take out a flower so they have a bigger hole to suck up the food. I will always by this type of feeder as long as they make them!
3762	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The female connector on the first one detached from the hose even before it was filled with water!  Apparently it was not glued.  Second hose just burst open and not excessive water pressure.  The third one is still working amazingly enough

This bird house is made of cheap, thin metal that has very sharp edges.  Fingers get sliced very easily trying to put it together with the overwhelming amount of parts.  On top of that, it's so lightweight that a strong wind blew the top section off the bottom section, and the plugs blew out of it.  Had anyone been outside in the vicinity when it happened, they'd have been seriously injured.  It's a good thing there weren't martins nesting in it!

Update 6/25/15  Does leak all over the place, it could be the end from where you put the sprayer on, but not what I expected.  It is also very heavy.  You need a special long nozzle to prevent your wrists from giving out or creating carpel tunnel.  I wish I had of gotten something else now.  I never did like the idea that the end was bent a little.  It is still awfully heavy.  Don't like it.

We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.
My only issue was that it was folded in half and then rolled, so you have to struggle with it a bit to get the full seven foot height out of the roll.  It would have just been easier if it would have come as it's seven foot roll or had been rolled, then folded so we could have unrolled it easier.

I got these refills for the trap and leave it on all the time. That way I can make sure I do not get an infestation. It works great and does draw the fleas to the light. It's very strong adhesive traps them there. I would recommend this to anyone with a pet and the possibility of fleas. Great value too.
7260	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This fly bait always works well. We hang receptacle from long hook in a tree in the backyard. It keeps the flies away from the patio and the breeze/wind moves the odor along well.

311	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this tough, durable hose. The length is perfect for a large backyard & kinking is a minimum even in cold weather. It is easy to attach to the faucet & the water flow is great. An extra is the metal spiral at the faucet end to keep it from crimping where it hangs down. Much better than the plastic sleeves on other brands. The 8-ply construction is tough enough to withstand the elements be they hot or cold. I've had this hose for about 8-10 months & it is as good as the day I bought it. So Gilmour is my hose of choice for the future.

I set out the traditional traps with metal tongues/trigger systems. The rats were able to clean off the traps without springing them. And at other times, I would find as many as three SPRUNG traps with no rodent. And all of the bait would be cleaned off, so I knew they got away unharmed or weren't hurt enough to result in death.
9320	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It kills flying insects and bugs but you should use bait for best results. It also clogs. It could also catch fire if you don`t clean it. Keep it 3 ft.away from the house. The smell could reach 5 ft. Spiders will spin webs on it then fry themselves. It killed a large praying mantis. Mount it in the air. A replacement bulb runs $10 or more so keep that in mind. I had the earlier version of the BK-80D programmable and it fried the bulbs too fast. Replacement bulbs were $28. However it did seem to kill more bugs. The newer BK-80D seems to be an improvement and worth the purchase. The bulb is only about $15. Shop Wal-Mart first.

This nozzle is a good value.

303	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	For the high price and glowing reviews, thought for sure I'd get several years of use from this "quality" hose but nope...I bought this last year and have used it about 5 months and now it leaks! I have never had a hose leak where this one does - about an inch up from the crimp on male brass fitting(see pic). Btw, the hose was drained and stored indoors last fall/winter and this is not a simple washer issue...It is leaking in the middle of the brass...Very strange and disappointing - especially for this price! Save your money...
8864	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Mice apparently do not like the cold clammy metal on their itty bitty feet.  Never would go inside. So it was a waste of money.  I would not recommend this trap.
1565	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent Product...

8777	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the first grill I ever paid more than 30 dollars for, and I love it! The ash catcher is a great idea, especially if you have ever grilled on a wooden deck and had the hot ashes start little fires on your deck. I liked this item so much I bought a second one and had it shipped to my father.
the first few days the bucket got FULL fast. Now it seems to get about half filled on a weekly basis. It's approaching fall so I'm sure that's lessened the population but I also think the trap is helping cull the population a good bit as well. Even if the population isn't decreasing, they've been distracted from my door to further toward my back yard which makes me happy!
8886	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	great product.  just wish that I could see into trap without have to glance in holes in side to see if mouse is in there.  works great though.
3234	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like this edger. It has some major power to it.  It will trim much better than you can ever hope to do with an trimmer/edger plus the grass and soil is not flying everywhere.  Keep the inside guard clean or it will degrade performance, particularly if you have clay in your soil like mine does. I give this two thumbs up. My yard is starting to look pretty nice.
I have only had the new Hunter heads section a year, and I hope they last longer/more dependable!?
2202	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this (from Amazon) for my son after I bought mine from a local hardware store. I use a chain saw a lot for keeping saplings in control on our property. I wanted something with a shallow angle so it would cut limbs with one or at most two swings. From my actions you can see I was delighted with my purchase.  I appreciate the quality of the leather sheath that covers the head and protects both the cutting edge and the user!
9584	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Not much I can say about this as they have changed them slightly from when I put in the original ones. I just bought it for a spare valve or solenoid as the price was right and all the parts seem to be interchangeable. I have had 3 solenoids fail in 10 years. I have 5 zones. All were on the above type of 3/4 inch valve.
5697	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I didn't use it for the deer, I used it to collect apples from the ground (otherwise raking them up is way too much pain). The netting seems adequate and strong enough. It's very thin but not flimsy, I don't think I tore any of it yet, even when it gets stuck on the weeds. The downside is that it's very hard to see on the ground in the black color, I'd like some bright yellow-orange-pink color to make it visible. I'd also like the edge to be thicker. As it is, I've been threading a bright mason's line around the edges to make them visible. One 7x100' roll covers the area under one tree.
Just don't expect to keep drilling & never pull it up. Drill about 6" & pull it up, clear the head, start again.
Just a final note. Reel mowers aren't for everyone. If you have steep slopes or over a 1/2 acre to cut, you may want to consider another option.
Pros  It does not kink up and is very sturdy
lastly, best wishes to your soon rat-free life. :-)
639	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	When I use a garden hose, one thing bothers most is hose kinking. This one is no exception, it kinks. I found another brand "Water Right" which is  very light weight and made of high quality material. The best part is it doesn't kinks!
9679	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I say that,  but there may be big ol' wheely cart like things out there that are better and hold a lot  more hose.  For those of you who don't want a giant piece of funky looking stuff to store or haul around, and would rather have a reliable convenient hose real that doesn't stick out and look cheap and ugly but  works,....then this would be the one.  And BELIEVE ME I have tried lots of hose reels!  I loath most of them and especially the way they trash up a yard.
675	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fiskar is an industry leader in outdoor equipment, I'm glad I found these before buying something else. Would buy again if needed, recommend to everyone. Solid handles, solid blades, works great. Great product, great price.
In addition I have been using this bait also in my disposable Rescue fly traps. Yes, they can be cleaned and re-baited. The plastic bag is strong.
Even when I go up/down, it falls over at the slightest bare spot!
5426	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought two of the 1 1/2 acre models. I use them in my backyard, and I can say they have really made a difference in reducing the mosquito population.

With all the concerns with mosquitos now days, I see these as a good investment, to help you enjoy your outdoor space.

I set it in my living room because I had to get a mounting bracket. That Friday night I had yet to get a bracket but the bugs were bad outback. So I strung up with some rope and tied it to the bracket for my satellite dish. I know not the best idea but I might have had a few in me.
6641	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. Bulbs are holding up and the unit works well. Sometimes the dead bugs get stuck in the wires, but most of them just fall to the bottom of the unit or just straight to the ground. I'm not sure how well it works on mosquito's but it does kill everything else. Flies are mostly attracted to it, which works for me.
2695	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Brass and stainless construction. They are old school and proven by time. Solid built. Currently "Made in Mexico". If impact head is what you are looking for, this is a great buy.
6130	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had a problem with mice, and a friend suggested this trap.  It worked fantastic.  I used peanut butter as the bait, apparently an irresistible lure, and the mice went in.  Their weight causes the back to shift down.  Lifting the front quickly shuts the door.  It has a fine weight balance to quickly trap the mice.
55	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This floor scraper was delivered quickly,and was exactly as described. Very well-made heavy-duty tool,and I really appreciate the non-wooden handle with the rubber cap on the end. No more worries about splinters as it gets older.

6474	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Set it right and it works great. I do recommend this for moles.

3044	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these for many years and when I finally bent the blades and the battery was worn out, I never got around to getting another one and I'm glad I did.  This is one of the handiest tools in my garage.  You can leave this hooked up to the charger cord all the time and grab it when needed.  I use this to trim ivy away from the base of my roses and trees, to trim spots along the edges and for light trimming.  It will stick and stop on anything much thicker than grass or ivy, but I've gotten used to just putting the blades flat against the ground and pulling the trimmer backwards sliding the blades on the ground.  That immediately dislodges most everything.  I take this out at least once a week to obliterate a weed or clean stuff up.  When this one gets near the end of its life, I'll get another one before it goes.

When I called Customer Service at Spray & Forget I was told that I CANNOT USE THIS SPRAYER with their product!! They don't know who linked it here on Amazon and they have been trying to get it unlinked to no avail. So, if you are buying SPRAY & FORGET products, DO NOT BUY THIS Gilmour Sprayer!!

Do remember to take it inside during freezing weather!  Otherwise it can crack if partially filled with water!
4834	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use these on my Poulan for tree removal and for firewood.  I keep one on the saw and one as spare.  Priced right and you don't have to drive to the store.

It pushes as easy as my old gas mower and is easier to back up and get around beds and trees. The only negative thing is that due to the wheels and cutter,it does not mow as close but I just trim with a hand trimmer. I would recommend everyone to try this! Even my dad who used the old time reel mowers was so impressed with it! You can visit with neighbors and hear the birds singing while you mow! It is great and it takes me less time to mow since you don't have to take time to start your mower and add $4.20 a gallon gas every time you mow!

1953	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Flexogen are consistantly the best hoses I have ever used. Any hose can be kinked, but the eight ply resists it while remaining relatively supple. For the few people who encounter leaky ends, my advice is to take Gilmore up on their lifetime warrantee. Few companies stand by their products as well as the Gilmore Flexogen. I am proud to support American workers.
The feeder base is red plastic with snap-in flower feeders, and they are prone to leak.  Worse, quite a variety of flying bugs and ants are able to get inside the feeder.  The feeder base does not come apart, so you can only keep rinsing until the dead bugs stop floating out.  You can't see the inside edges of the feeder to see if it's clean enough.  After about a year, the plastic flowers started breaking, so I gave up and tossed both feeders.

I would have liked to have seen a metal bearing in the shaft versus a plastic collar at this price point. Time will tell if that is a longevity issue.  I have a feeling it will be fine.
I use the Flexzilla Garden Hose, 5/8 in. x 100 ft., which is a fabulous hose as hoses go. I have found that it works ok with this sprinkler most of the time. I've had multiple times where the front wheels jump the hose and it wanders off on it's own random course. This is not good if you have left it alone thinking it will stop on the bridge ramp. I've had it run into flower beds and get stuck digging the wheels in the mud and going deeper and deeper. This jumping the hose issue almost always occurs on a corner. They claim it can handle curves of 8 ft radius but I'm skeptical as I've had it jump the hose with more gradual curves even. This could be due to this hose being more squishy than your traditional hose. It also could be due to the 5/8" hose size. But if I were to get a 3/4" hose, the length it can track and pull behind is reduced. I also think lawn unevenness on a curve may also contribute, but that is just a thought, not proven. BTW, I would not use this sprinkler on 1/2" hose it won't work well at all for tracking.

Great charcoal grill!  The enclosed ash catcher is particularily useful if you grill with lump charcoal  versus briquettes, like I do.  It catches any sparks and small pieces of lump that drop through the charcoal grate.  Hinged grate is also a big plus.  I like to use the Weber charcoal holders to hold my lump when grilling steaks-- push them together in the center to sear (brings charcoal about 2 inches from meat) then push them to the outer edge for indirect cooking.  I also added a thermometer to the lid to check and adjust cooking temps.

I really wanted to like this sprayer a lot more than I ended up liking it. I have a yard that is good sized for Silicon Valley (I'm sure folks in other parts of the country would laugh at that). It's about 13k square feet. Normally, to go around spraying pesticide or weed killer, I have to re-load my 1.5 gallon hand pump sprayer a couple of times. Not only that, I have to carry that sprayer in one hand while the other holds the spray wand, all while occasionally pausing to set the sprayer down and pump the sprayer up and then pick it up again. So, I thought that with a "professional" sprayer of 4 gallon capacity, I could load up the sprayer a little over half way, walk around while spraying continuously and be done much faster and easier. As it turns out, this is all true, except for that the sprayer leaks somewhere near the piston assembly on the bottom. It's hard for me to tell exactly where the leak is coming from. I tried tightening a couple of likely screws. I also looked for damage on the cylinder housing and adjacent areas. Nothing. I just get the occasional drip of weed killer on my calf and on the lower part my shirt. Ew.

You cannot go wrong with gilmour brand. So far I have had only good experience with these. Knock on wood ;)
7825	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is one great BBQ grill!! The only gripe I have is for some inane stupid reason Weber changed the handle from wood to plastic, the plastic absorbs the heat and you'll need a glove to remove the cover. They forgot the saying "If it works, don't fix it"!!!!!

4443	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This review is for my first use--which was today.  It gets jammed fairly easily with very small sticks a third the width of a pencil or less.  You usually have to bend down to clear the jam--which was the most tiresome aspect of this.  I guess it is safer because it does not mow backwards.  That means more work.  Don't expect it to take only one pass over an area.  Once you come to terms with that, you can become one with the mower.  No sense in being frustrated, that just is how it is.  It isn't hard to push after the first minute or two, and the arms stop being in shock.  But you will be doing a lot of walking back and forth.  I did the front yarsd today.  The back will be more of a challege b/c the grass is longer.  I may cry.  I did smell the cut grass.  That was nice.  Got a little exercise and sun, that was nice.  Didn't like that it kicked up the sticker burrs which stuck all over the bottom of my pants legs.  Other than that, I think it was pretty much what I was expecting.

2534	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works much better than the 2 handle type hole diggers. Went through sandy hard compacted clay easily. I have both type diggers. The two handled lever one would only penetrate a couple inches of clay even with a lot of downforce. So this one saves time. Good for 4 inch posts but sides may need shaving for 6 inch posts. I only use my two handled one now for cleaning up the hole and removing loose dirt.
I built a small stand out of 2x2 pressure treated lumber.  Cost me about $4 to make.

I was looking at a more expensive one thinking it would be better, but liked the results I saw from other buyers photos. I can't imagine what the more expensive ones do that this doesn't. Great for my needs, very happy with it. Makes a subtle but significant difference.
I have had my Raintrain for 5 years and it still works perfectly (no leaks, shut off is complete, arm rotation is steady and water comes out very evenly).

The Scott's rotary spreader is very difficult to push uphill.  I think this is likely because of the plastic wheels just do not roll smoothly.  Inherent disadvantage of a rotary spreader is that it will send the fertilizer out further when you are going down hill than uphill because you are traveling slower uphill and the impeller is rotating more slowly and throwing less of the fertilizer.

The axe blade is beautiful and just the right size for my uses now. The edge was rolled a little when I checked it but with a few licks across a steel that was cleared up.  I can use this thing without killing myself.  I can even use it with one hand if need be.  The stainless was very smooth and well brushed to a medium shine.  The shaft appear to go all the way through the handle.  I can't guarantie that it goes all the way through the handle but if is like several of my other Estwing tools it does.  The grip is designed to absorb vibrations and does so very well.  If it last as well as my others I will be passing this down to my grandson with the other Estwing tools.

The mower does seem to get hard to push if I am not in the grass. I think the grass "juice" lubes the blades. If it gets hard to push then as soon as I have cut about 2 ft of grass then it's easy again. No oil or preservatives required.
  So if you have a mosquito problem, read Rick V,'s review and try this great Flowtron zapper!

This is one of their favorites, hands down.  The only problem I have is that is a bear pulls one off the window (we live in the woods near the Canadian border), the perches or the plastic fingers get broken.  The easy answer to that is a piece of copper wire wrapped around the screw at the bottom that comes around to the back and then through the holes and folded outward.  For the perches, you can do the same thing making little loops of copper wire that fasten to the screw on the bottom.  I have more then 10 of these feeders.

Handle was poorly finished and needed to be sanded prior to use to avoid splinters in my hands.  Pricey, but did save time and it worked different muscles than the shovel.

I am SO glad we got this instead of a gas mower, and I would recommend it to anyone with a small grassy yard.  It does better on some kinds of grass than others--one of our neighbors plants grass that has densely-packed blades, and quite a bit of effort is required to get through that.  Other kinds of grass are easier to get through, though--and, as so many other people have noted, the hard parts can provide a good workout.

My only complaints are similar to other reviews: the lack of spray pattern options and the fact that it tips over when set on a flat surface.  The latter drawback and make it more difficult to get set up, but this minor inconvenience is much better than multiple trips to the hardware store to return defective items.

They have a hard time cutting really floppy greenery or the extra thick blackberry brambles that plague my yard but work well otherwise. I also use them to cut up bully stick chews for my dogs.

We've had this gauge for years and really like it.

Sprinkler systems need to be adjusted at least once a year so they like to call me anyway and even I appreciate this timer's simplicity. Debris plugs the nozzles, winter affects adjustment/orientation and even lawn mowers and string trimmers mess with adjustment.

I live in Florida, where men over 55 (as I am) are required by law to own own reclining lounge chairs to watch TV, and muse cook outdoor at leasrt `100 time per year, mostly during the hot months when it makes no sense to heat your place up by cooking indoors when you can start a charcoal fire in 30 seconds with a chimney and some newspaper, and can start cooking on your charcoal in less than 20 minutes, no problem. And now I will go clean the cooking grate in my Joe Gold. Really quick and easy to clean that small grill, which (unlike the grate from a bigger grill) fits easily in our kitchen sink.
6656	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I won't elaborate since the other reviews do a good job, but I will say that I love my reel mower! It has reinvented my view on mowing the lawn - it now is something I enjoy rather than a chore, something fun to do with the dog keeping me company instead of being scared of a gas/electric.
Make sure you re tighten the bottle back onto the sprayer....Well it is hard to explain with words but the gray sprayer where it connects to the brass part. There is a fitting that just screws into the sprayer. If it comes loose the sprayer will spray even when the trigger is not squeezed.

I had one of these for about 4 years up until an hour ago when the handle did snap off.  But then it is kept outside in all sorts of weather so I'm not surprised. And I did just order a replacement (the whole sprayer).

Over all it works quite well and is very durable. My only complaint is that it is not as bug and weather resistant as I'd like in terms of protecting my stuff. Bugs can easily get into this cart, as can rain. They enter through the large rectangular hole that is at one end of the top. If you really want your stuff to stay in immaculate condition, buy a yard caddy and keep it inside your shed or your house.

The rake is great. It made short work of policing up the back yard of our new place, which was littered with sticks, rocks, and odds and ends. It really wasn't that expensive compared to what you pay for the shoddily made rakes that are easy to find. I will likely buy another.

2018	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Understand before you order this nozzle cannot be spun and shutoff at nozzle.  You have to shut the water off at the hose bib (faucet).  I bought this to wash my cars.  I generally spray car to get it wet and than turn nozzle to shut off water while I soap up vehicle with wash mitt.  This nozzle requires you to go back and shut off faucet at the house, soap the car, and return to faucet to turn on for rinse. Repeat as many times as necessary.  I returned nozzle to Amazon with no problems.  I bought instead "Hose Nozzle High Pressure for Car of Garden"  solid brass, made in USA, which you can shut off/turn back on at the nozzle.

As others have noted, it does not cut really tall grass or weeds well.  I use a trimmer for the weeds and tight boundaries around the yard anyway, so that isn't important to me.  Adjusting the height is very easy.
9877	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I got this for keeping a path clear that I use on my daily bike commute.  The tool is sturdier and sharper than I expected.  The handle is plenty long enough, something I was concerned about as I am 6'4".  Clearing the overgrown path was a heck of a lot of work though, particularly since I made it wide enough that weeds won't lean in and brush my legs as I pass.
9613	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This True Temper square point shovel is decently made considering what it costs. It's not really a commercial grade heavy-duty shovel, but should be fine for the type of yard work I'll be using it for around the house. The shovel measures approximately 57" long overall, with a 47" long gray fiberglass handle and yellow rubber grip at the top. The square blade is about 10" wide and seems to be made from reasonably heavy gauge steel, so feels like it will hold up to my regular use. The decal on the blade says it is made in the USA from global components and has a 15-year warranty.
3654	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Really cuts down on the line hassles.  Perfect for homeowner use, maybe not so much if you will be running it all day.  Easy to re-string and lasts long enough for my purposes.
It comes with a small mosquito attractant that is placed in the bottom of the device. It works well but I have my patio (bug) lights about 15 feet away from the device and still saw mosquitos buzzing around the patio light. So, it's not 100%, but judging from the sea of dead bugs, it does the trick with most flying insects. I recommend plugging in the device several hours BEFORE you are outside near it.

Update:  I'm revising my review from 5 stars to one star.  The second time my wife used this, it snapped in two.  The "Lightweight, one-piece, polished aluminum alloy" is apparently too lightweight to hold up to the task for which this product was designed.  Steel would have been a better choice of material.  I do not recommend this product.  It didn't last long enough to even wear the label off.

I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies. The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy.  Also, like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice.

Oh * Another little side note, that this company does NOT disclose. You Will be needing to buy packets of their bug repellent every 30 days or so.
I occasionaly disconnected the grill from the 20 pound propane tank I use at home so that we could take the grill on outings to the beach.  My only complaint is that everyone else wants to use my grill whenever I take it anywhere.  So I frequently end up overseeing their cooking as well as my own.  I usually bring extra portable gas canisters for that eventuality.

6355	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We live in the country and occasionally get mice in our garage, and thankfully less often, in the house.  We had some snapping mouse traps set, which worked, but the mouse would be killed (and not always instantly).  My teenage daughter did not want us using that type of mouse trap anymore.  My 10-year-old son came across this catch and release mouse trap on Amazon.  It was inexpensive and had decent ratings, so I agreed to order it.  It has worked great.  My son takes care of everything:  He baits the trap with a little bit of peanut butter, places it in an area he knows where the mice are located, and checks it at least once daily for a mouse.  When there is a mouse in the trap, he takes the trap outside to the woods behind our house and releases the mouse.  He then cleans and rebaits the trap.  He has caught and released several mice.  (Hopefully not the same one several times!)  This trap is much more humane than the snapping type of trap.  Would definitely recommend.
1231	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I use this sprayer to apply all sorts of lawn and garden concentrates.  The spray is consistent and even.  The handle is all metal which is really nice.  No more plastic nozzles leaking all over the place.  The spray handle is a great upgrade from the built lawn fertilizer spray bottles with the plastic tab to turn on and off the sprayer.

1802	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very well made Pruning Shears.
Construction is solid: the base is solid wood (either a hardwood or a very dense, furniture quality pine). The metal is thick. The spring is strong (and deserves your respect when setting it). The trap springs at a the slightest touch; remember that and keep your fingers clear at all times once it's set.

And I kept it up until last week and started to look for something more up to date.  I looked at Weber's Smoke Grill which is a step up but, there was not enough difference as far as price than this one and this grill here in my opinion you can't cook a better steak or pork than this one here.  And from my first experience with my first one, it last.  You get your money then some with this grill.  You will not regret buying this grill.
7156	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It smells like horse doo Doo, which is, I imagine, one reason it's so effective! Use in same-brand's container with small amount of added water, you will see big dead flies floating in it VERY soon. Great alternative to expensive fly zappers and ugly fly tape!
6826	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	After a few touch-up sharpenings your chain will not be taking as much of a bite out of the wood as it did when it was new.

5996	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I owned the Silver and Gold side by side for close to a decade. Now I just have the Gold, which has more controllable heat because of the side vents, which are WAY easier to adjust (and close after cooking to preserve charcoal for next time) than the Silver's bottom vent. You say those vents are above the charcoal? Not on mine when I'm grilling, because I have a cheapie pie cooling rack I sit on the charcoal grate to raise the coals an inch or so, which makes for better open-top grilling in either Joe.

Most of my lawn is bordered by pavement or by cobble stones, so that makes it easy to edge (I straddle the mower over the lawn/pavement and over the lawn/cobble stones).

7623	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	WTF? $150 for a spreader?  That's a lot of clams to lay down, especially for a homeowner.  But it's worth every fr'king penny.  Why?  Because it works like a charm.  The pneumatic wheels make handling a breeze even with a full load.  And it broadcasts like a mofo saving time and effort.  Used to take me 45 minutes to treat roughly 12,000 square feet with my $50 spreader (owned for 15 years, I might add). Now it takes 30 or less and with the wide dispersion, missing areas is a thing of the past.  I paid $199.00 and purchased locally at a Tru Value Hardware store.  This seems to be the usual retail selling price.  However, they assembled the unit at no cost.  If you're even fairly handy with tools and have some time, save yourself some bucks and buy from Amazon.  The instruction manual advises that using the spreader is most effective when walking at a moderate pace (approx. 3 mph) and I found this to be accurate.  I learned that there is definitely a qualitative difference between spreaders.  Maybe that's why many landscaping professionals use Earthway.

1033	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	LOVE LOVE LOVE this sprinkler tractor!~  So easy to set up (just watch a youtube about it - takes minutes) and leave it alone.  Guess my only trouble is remembering to shut it off when it's done.  May need timers for that.  We live in the country and have about 3 acres of grassy area.  Really helps us keep it green in the hot summers.
The house we just moved into has a sidewalk, curb and gutter, the first house I have ever owned in town to have these items. I soon found out I needed an edger to help keep the grass trimmed at the edges of concrete. The weed eating device just didn't make it look right. My neighbor came over with his B&W edger one day and demonstrated it and I was sold on an edger.

6399	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This grill cooks meats, fish and veggies very well. Able to adjust flames with vents on hood and on bottom of grill.  Preventing flare ups. Would definitely recommend to everyone.
I want to point out the proper way to use these, which never having had a ratchet action pruner, I wasn't aware of.  The trick is to begin squeezing, then slowly release pressure UNTIL YOU HEAR A CLICK.  Then apply pressure again.

The handle bars were heaver and longer, tires are larger and spreader control better.
Update 12/12:
8715	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This really works in killing the bugs in your home or yard. Bugs are inexplicably attracted to the light and get zapped to take them to their next life. Has a low buzzing sound, which doesn't bother most people but for sensitive folks it might. Excellent construction, made in Korea.

It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.

Obviously, these are manufactured for Weber grills and, because of the measurements, are the only option for those who need to replace Weber grates.  I'm just glad I was able to use them for my situation as well.

In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.

9890	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For those who found the cutting edge not sharp enough to their likings, remember all you need is a file. It might help to have a vice to hold the tool rocky steady. Then file the edges to be as sharp as you want them to be. The manufacturer likely doesn't but a really keen edge on it on the advice of their lawyers. Don't make it too sharp though with a thin razor edge as that will be dulled quickly when you whack tougher stems. A file is safer for sharpening than a grinder as it's too easy to overheat the edge with a grinder. Depends on skill level of the user.
2911	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent sprinkler - lasts a while - Altough it's tough the adjust to the 90 or 180 degrees.  Get ready to be soaked.
*** No lava rocks or charcoal needed- Weber's Flavorizer Bars do a very good job at dispersing the heat.  The middle does cook faster than the edges but once you know this you can use it to your advantage by placing the items that take longer to cook towards the middle and leave the quick heating items on the outer edge.
3718	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	We used it once and there's a split in the hose.  Replacement or refund is contingent on shipping it back.  C'mon, how much is THAT gonna cost us?  We'll just chalk it up to a lesson learned.
I have told everyone about this item and so glad they make it.  I can do my yard over and over before I ever have to replace string and I have a big yard.  String replacement is so easy that a child can do it and like I said, the design is fantastic.  Get it..Easy to put on your weed wacker and get rid of the tangles or string binding up forever.
You don't want this to be over any place you don't want a pile of dead bug bits. Since it has an open bottom (no tray) the zapped bug bits just fall out. I have this out on my lawn, close to a hottub to help reduce the overall bug population so I don't see any piles of dead bugs (but I hear the zaps all evening.

2740	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had an older Ross Root feeder several years ago, but lost in in a home move. The old one was built like a tank - all metal - tough as nails and I thought I might regret getting this newer model. The head of the unit is all plastic and I was skeptical that it would last, but I needed to feed some citrus trees in my yard. The new feeder arrived and I'm impressed. Yes, the unit is plastic, but it is sold and sturdy. I've had to really lean on this to get it to penetrate some dry patches around my trees and there is no sign of weakness or bending. The cup for inserting fertilizer tabs is larger than on my old unit and the whole unit reeks of quality and endurance.
9351	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	So far so good, has drastically reduced mosquitoes, don't know if it is the attractant or the device but it works. The attractant is not inexpensive and I have seen mixed reviews on it so I am a little confused. Hard to put some science behind it without a lot of with/without testing which I will likely not do. Bottom line, with the attractant in it I have far fewer mosquitoes.

Hubby & I were both amazed.  I ran this overnight and cleaned it out daily & in just a few days, there was a significant decrease in the moth population.  It was a rough time in New England for moths and many areas had trees without leaves due to their destruction.  We live in a wooded area and we didn't see any damage.  We know this made an impact and is now a must-have for our home.

3120	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tool. really does the business

Then the bulb died.
* Form factor - the unit is relatively light weight and easy to assemble. The conversion from edger to trimmer is a breeze. My only complaint is that the "battery" is really the entire top head of the unit - the black area in the picture. If you have the space to wall mount the charger and hang the recharger then it's not an issue; but if you don't, and you don't want to bring the entire unit inside to charge, then you have to disconnect that entire black head area and plug it in. Would be nice if the battery was smaller and the more traditional rectangular battery that other tools use

2058	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	For what I need it for it will work.

In my opinion this mower and the grass catcher is exactly what I expected, given the price. The quality of the mower assembly itself seems very good, but I can see why others have complained about the handle being cheap (it could defiantly be better), but with care it should last several seasons (maybe longer), and seems like it would be simple enough to replace if and when required.

2644	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this to spray a sealant on my stamped drive and patio, but have not used it yet as I wait for cooler weather in mid-to-late September. Got tired of paying $900 every two years -- last one lasted only through 2013 summer. I researched this Chapin product and found it to be top-drawer. While consulting with a local supply house that sells concrete sealants, etc., the tech helping me asked what sprayer I had to do the job. When I told him the Chapin Industrial 3.5-Gallon Concrete one, he commented this is the "very best." At that supply house I know these sell for well over $100, so buying from Amazon.com was a great deal for ca. $80 +/_. For long-term use the sprayer MUST BE CLEANED PROMPTLY AFTER EACH USE, which for the sealant I'm using is zylene. Should last for years and avoid paying for poor workmanship by those who claim to be "professionals."

6785	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.

4075	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	OK I cannot vouch for longevity but as far as cutting grass I think it is easier than my gas mower.  While it is not going to work well if you let your grass get to high but if you cut it regularly it works great and is easy to push. I bought it for the front of my house which is mostly Bermuda and It thought it would result in a better cut for that type of grass.  It cuts great and I ended up doing the majority of my lawn with it because it does not take much effort to push and no noise so I can cut at dusk or even in the dark if I wanted to without bugging the neighbors.

It will  only be a matter of time that it will start to leak.  The hose isn't even a year old.  There is a life time warranty saying the manufacturer will replace the hose free of charge.

The old one was built like a tank & was still cutting well but, the metal rod finally broke where the wood handle was riveted through it. It didn't have serrated edges (was flat) which was good because it was easy to sharpen. The edges on this model are NOT sharp - and they are difficult to sharpen due to the serrations. But, the #2 rating is because after the 3rd time in use, just cutting some thicker weeds, the metal rod actually bent sideways between the wood handle and the bottom turn. I was able to bend back but it bent a second time & is now much weaker at that point. If I could return it, I would. They just don't make 'em like they used to. I'm trying to think of a way I can modify it to inc. the old rod/cutter into the handle of this new one. I would recommend against buying this product.

Powerful. easy to use with right or left hands.  In the heat of the sun jsut now we only did the front property line and it took 10 minutes to cut 150 feet of edging along the street/side walk, and both sides of the side walk! No sign of blade wearing down.

1215	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	These pruners were bough to trim small bushes and plants in my yard. They aren't the sharpest because any bushes that have a small anount of diameter to them makes it difficult to cut through. I would just use these for really small diameter objects. It has a locking mechanism to it to keep them in the closed position when not in use. It has a comfortable grib that makes it easy to hold and prune. The curved tip is great for hooking around small branches that you don't want to cut. I recommend these for some starter pruners.


5059	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I know they call it deer netting but I don't know how it could possibly stop a deer. It rips at the slights tug! I used some to cover my chicken run and used skinny zip ties to hold it. Completely useless. It's constantly tearing through with minimal pressure. I had it caught on my button once and without even knowing, I ripped out two zip ties.
6564	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was very skeptical about Perky-Pet's "Our Best" feeder product claim.  I purchased feeders from local home improvement and chain stores and all leaked, failed or lasted only one year.  At first, the hummingbirds were reluctant to use the Perky-Pet 209 and I almost sent these feeders back.  Once the hummingbirds got used to the feeders they swarm them in the daytime so I purchased two more.  They do not leak so far and have lived up to the claim as Perky-Pet's best feeder.  The 30 oz. glass works best for me because the liquid food will last 4-5 days before being empty.  Once they learn where the feeders are located, they will chase each other to dominate them.  Amazing.  Give one a try.  If you get the same results, you will buy more.  Be prepared to make a lot of food for them during the season.  Good luck.
8629	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	If the directions for use are followed, this works very well - in a dark room, where there's little activity. Especially in combination with Advantix (or another, just not Hartz - that stuff is dangerous) flea and tick drops for the pet. My son and I made it a math game (he loves math) for him to keep track of how many fleas were found each morning, added to the previous flea count. Even during daytime and evening with the lights on, if there's no one in the room so the fleas don't jump on you instead, fleas would jump in. Not in hordes, thank goodness, but it did help to clear the fleas from the floor and furniture without having to use stinky powders or chemicals. I would recommend this!!

I bought one for a daughter and saw it lying iin her garage floor in 10 pieces. It had come apart when she was cleaning it and with no instructions it was a hopless nightmare. Soon after this, mine fell apart after the rod holding it together unscrewed itself. I have worked for two days on it, again, no instructions, no  diagrahms, nothing to go by. I am a pretty handy with any task but this is impossible. It is on it's way to the dump. One more thing before I go, when it rained the sunflower seeds got soaked and ruined so they were all gummed up inside the tubes. HATE IT!
9437	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Seen these bug zappers around and thought it was time to buy one to help zap mosquitos and bugs in back yard and patio area.

> Pruners are used 1-handed, loppers are used 2-handed.  If you need to hold a stem or branch while you cut, or you want to collect the cut stems as you work, a pruner is your best choice.  Loppers are less tiring if you are cutting alot of thick stems, particularly if you have a weak grip for some reason.  Loppers (particularly extendable handle loppers) give you far more reach, so that you don't have to bend over, or resort to a ladder.  The reach can also help protect you from the thorns of roses, etc.

I've cut some fairly large branches and it just slices right through them. Makes trimming my bushes a lot easier, and I prefer to do it by hand then with a hedge trimmer. I've found that if you do them every month by hand they always look good and it's less work. Just my 2 cents.

9776	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I got this to replace the bottom part of one that had the wings on a spike. Well as the posters say they use the softest metal known to man and they bend and snap. I think that bottom lastest 2 wks. This seems to be a way better alternative. I put a different brand impulse top on it and it sealed better than its original bottom component so that was great. I am super careful to not force it into anything but soft ground.

5186	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The cover has a mesh strip in the front and back. I'm not sure what they are for but if your grill sits out in the open, the mesh allows water, dust and whatever to get inside the cover. One of the reasons I bought the Genesis Gold B was because of the enclosed area under the grill. The first rain came right thru the mesh and everything inside the enclosed area was soaked. The same thing with dust. I'm trying duct tape over the mesh areas. If this will not work, it will be new cover time! Very dissapointed with the cover but the grill is great!
I estimate there's enough compound in this kit for about six or eight sharpenings, which means it could last up to ten years--quite a deal compared to paying someone else to do this simple chore--and you'll have the satisifaction of knowing you did a great job.
5726	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I really like this soaker hose.  I have ordered two more.  You have to be careful with it since it is pretty thin, but the water is more evenly distributed than other sprinkler hoses I have had.
3722	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great for what I need it for. It won't cut the tall weeds so you have to keep the grass cut where you use it. I needed it for a small fenced in area where my dogs do their duty. My regular mower won't fit in there and this is much easier than getting out the weed eater and making a mess of myself.
6202	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have a horrible problem with bunnies eating everything including the front lawn.  I have tried every product I could find including some home made remedies.  This "netting" has been the most effective.  I draped it over my small grapefruit tree, and over the small plants around the lawn.  It did snag a couple lizards, but the rabbits have left the ground cover, small plants and tree alone.

ORIGINAL REVIEW JULY 2013
1398	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I actually was impressed with the quality of this sprayer.  I was expecting a cheap metal feel, like some similar ones I've had in the past, but instead it is smooth and has some heft, sprays consistently and without dripping or leaking anywhere.  lt's a very good hose sprayer for the money.
4266	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	These are of high quality material that easily help in the garden. If you are looking for lightweight pruners I highly recommend them

5180	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This is clearly not deer netting, maybe birds will fly in a die in it.  Way too flimsy to be deer netting, not even close.
Here in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hose&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Permatex-22058-Dielectric-Tune-up-Grease-3-oz/dp/B000AL8VD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.</a>&nbsp;If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.

5302	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Just too flimsy to hold anything back

UPDATE: I took it apart today. Fairly simple affair. Doesn't seem to be much to go wrong. Couldn't figure out why that little transformer wasn't electrifying the grid. Tried to call the 800 number they tell you to call first before sending the unit back. That's when I found out that customer service ends at 4:30 PM. I was too late. You would think their customer service works on an early evening shift considering that anyone running into a problem with this thing would do so AFTER sunset. VERY FRUSTRATING!

First night up the wife came in and commented you ought to hear the zapper, I went outside and she was right, the light on this one is brighter than the ones I have had in the past. After a few weeks it seems to have helped the mosquito problem we have this year quite a bit. It still does clog up with dead insects but not nearly as often as my past lights did, thats why I gave it a four star!

5257	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This netting is dangerous to wild life and humans. It is so lightweight, it can not be seen. Birds have become trapped in it. Dragonflies got trapped in it. A gopher snake got trapped. It is so fine it is easy to enter and get stuck and impossible to see. I myself have tripped on it, hurting myself. It is terribly thin and due to that reason, it is very unsafe.
8951	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Perfect fit

***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
I don't own this mower- a neighbor does- and while it worked very well when he first bought it, it's become increasingly difficult to use over time as the blade dulls and parts rust and wear. If you're  going to use a manual mower you've got to pay attention to care, much more so than if you use a gas mower. I recommend spraying all moving parts with a coating of Boeshield (available from Amazon) on a regular basis, for one. And get an annual sharpening.
4677	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Always good. DEPENDABLE

3354	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Typical difficulties are to be expected when installing this spool inside the exterior disk.  The lines are susceptible to binding between the edges during the install process.
Won't be buying from Flowtron again.
3521	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This thing sucks. I have go over the same spot at least three times. Even when I first bought the mower it was not a one pass mower. I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants to mow their yard. Its good for exercise in that you'll be pushing it around much longer than you should. It also gets stuck on any little twig. Doesn't matter how small. If there is a twig in your yard somewhere you will know about it.
Would be nice if it came in different colors! ---

8019	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Hose seems to be built stronger than I expected after reading all the reviews.  This was a black hose with gold strips.  I'm going to use it as a suction hose with a small 12 volt rv pump and believe the 15 feet will allow me to get close to the waters edge with no problem.  As many pointed out the fittings are thin metal and may not hold up well with continued use.  I plan on splicing into the hose anyway to add barb adapters to fit the 1/2 pump connectors.  Since I'm not even sure this will work, I was glad to be able to order a decent quality hose for such a reasonable price.  I did take a look at Wal-mart RV hoses and none of the 15 foot ones were of the quality of this hose and the connectors were about the same and the price about a dollar more.

9390	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the best money I have spent all year. We have had a very wet spring. After just 1 week with the zapper, we have almost no mosquitos. This zapper is working overtime. We plug it in around 7 PM and unplug around 7 AM. I would highly recommend this machine.
I purchased and installed the matching catcher, that clips on to the sides and hangs from the handles.  It took less than two minutes to assemble and install and works pretty well.  It does not catch 100 percent of the clippings.  Last evening, while cutting grass in the wind, some of the clippings blew away before landing in the catcher.
Since using the unit, there have been almost zero moths bugging us.  I live out in the forest, so there is no shortage of bugs flying around here.  Even with other lights on, the bugs seem to favor the Flowtron.  The unit does make noise when the bugs are zapped (as all units do), but since the bugs routinely fall away from the zapping rods pretty quickly (much better than with other units), it's only a short zap.  Once in a while there will be a longer zap, but not too often.  At the rate this unit kills bugs, I think I may make a dent in the bug population around here - which is fine with me.
6034	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nothing better than the original Weber kettle, just ordered my third. I've yet to wear one out, just have multiple houses and bought one for a friend. An often unrecognized bonus to the Weber kettle is how little charcoal it uses, and being able to close the air vents and put out the charcoal for later use. This smaller 18" version is great for just a couple people, if you have 4+ to feed you will probably want to step up to the full 22" size.

5675	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	We had so many mosquitoes we couldn't enjoy our pool near dusk.  I bought this unit and crossed my fingers.  The first night I used it, the mosquitoes were still swarming.  Since then, however, we've been enjoying our pool every evening.  I suspect the mosquito attractant is key for this use, but as far as other bugs go, this thing really goes to town.  I would give it 5 stars if the power cord was longer.  With such a short cord, it made hanging the unit and attaching an extension cord more difficult than it needed to be.
764	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This is one where I should have listened to the other reviewers.  I liked the idea of a premium hose made in the USA.  Unfortunately, after sitting out less than a month it started developing bubbles with pinhole leaks.  Due to the nature of the material, you can not just tape them up as with a rubber hose.  The black rubber Craftsman this replaced lasted me a good 10 years.  I should have sent this one back.
The depth of cut should be the same for all cutters so they each take the same amount of wood.  If they aren't the same, the saw will vibrate more and can have a tendency to cut crooked.

9727	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This item did the job for which it was made. . This was purchased as a connector between the main hose and a 15 ft. shorter hose.  The valve, being closer to the  area being watered allowed me to be able to see the sprinkler, he force of the water, and just what was getting the water.  I was experiencing a leak where the shut off valve was attached to the main  hose  I then purchased a different shut off thinking maybe the first one was defective.  THE FIRST ONE,  THE ONE BEING RATED HERE, IS PERFECTLY GOOD.  My main hose is defective and  will be replaced this next summer.
The metal chain that connects the wire frame of the feeder to the metal hook at the other end became tarnished during the winter. The manufacturer could have used stainless steel chain instead of coated steel. The cost would have been minimal for this change. If this matter isn't addressed properly, your suet feeder my wind up on the ground someday. In my case I cleaned the chain with a fine steel brush, clean the chain with some alcohol and allowed the chain to dry. I applied two coats of a clear acrylic spray paint (Krylon Crystal Clear 1301) to the chain allowing the first coat to dry properly before applying a second coat. This should protect the chain for many years. If the tarnish is noticed in the future, the chain can be clean with a steel brush and repainted. If you have just recently purchased this item, I would clean the chain with alcohol and spray it twice.

This unit should be hung away from your house, which doesn't mean it needs to be placed 20 feet away.  It only means that if you have a deck or something off your house you should place this on the farther side.  It's easy to equip a hook on a high post from which to hang this.

When the hose burst further down, I couldn't get the metal hose mender off to move it because the screws had fused to the metal body.

6430	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This one lasted a long, long time. The little yellow plastic flowers at the base of the feeder started to fall apart to the point they were old and brittle. This has been an excellent feeder. It is true what they say, add more red to the juice and you will attract more hummingbirds. We moved several times in the past couple of years and we managed to find hummingbirds everywhere we went. We've always enjoyed our feeder when the birds hover to get a drink. We have purchased a different kind of hummingbird feeder and have yet to hang it out, but I have a feeling that I will order this one again. It doesn't look fancy, but the birds sure like it and isn't that's what its all about after all?
When I first received the Scotts, I thought the blades were too tight, so I loosened them (and tested them by slicing pieces of paper with the blades).  The adjustment was easy to do; a small wrench is included with the mower (or you can use your own wrench or a large flathead screw driver).

At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase, he even snickered when it came out of the box, but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our "big" mower.

511	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A good product but not for heavy "stuff", small hedges calls for these trimmers.
Pros - It sprinkles just like it says it does. The spray distance is adjustable based on your turn of the spigot, and adequately covers all areas around the hose. The length of the hose is also adjustable, and is determined by your placement of an easy and reversible clamp. In place the hose tends to stay in place if not molested.

No worries, that company no longer has their knock offs on this listing.  This works well from the few times I've used it, and does NOT mix water into the container to spray, it uses a venturi style suction to pull the fluid out, so when you are finished you can return the rest of the product into the original container without contaminating it or diluting it.  I don't recall the name of the merchant that sold me the knock off, but I have to give them five stars as well because as soon as I pointed out the issue they refunded my money 100% and told me to keep the sprayer and removed their listing so I cannot knock them but so much.

5544	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this garden deer block fencing for my garden. I only had a small garden 25 ft x 25 ft and I had a little left over. The fencing did not rip easily as some other garden fencing has done. It is by no means a super strong garden fencing either though. We have a ton of deer around here so as you can imagine I was worried about them eating up my garden. The fencing lived up to its name. I did not have any deer in my garden throughout the whole summer. I was very happy about it. I also never saw any small animals in the garden either. A complete added bonus! I can not say the same thing about my dog though. He jumped over, crawled under, and eventually just ran right through it. So like I said it is not super strong. I would not try to lean on it or anything. The fence was a lot wider than I needed though, so I left it doubled over. This added a bit of extra strength, but as stated my dog did run through it. So if you have any pets that are all about being with you all the time, I would think again. If not, then I would recommend this garden fencing to keep the deer out of your garden. Dig in!

We have never actually gotten any Purple Martins to set up shop, but have had many other types of birds lay eggs in here over the years.
