3128	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	All the other sauces were hot, but we wanted to try this one.  We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce (about a cup of wing sauce).  This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small.
8346	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews. To keep it short here, it's way too salty, so you have to use just a little, then you can't taste it because all you can taste is salt. Then there's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses. Too artificial looking. To sum it up, I do not recommend this for anything. Can't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese! Way too salty! Ick!

Rambutans are like lychees, but much more satisfying as they have a lot more flesh than lychees. Having had A LOT of Rambutans in Asia over my childhood, these really take me back. Unfortunately, I can't get my Tropical favorite fruit anywhere in the States, Mangosteen are impossible to come by! This is a close second. As with any groceries, they're a little smushed, a little ripe, and mostly perfect! I'm very glad I was able to get a little bit of our childhood back in the States, it was completely worth $35.

7680	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The first time I drank it, I didn't think much of it. I think the first time I thought it was too bitter. I ended up keeping it around but not drinking it. Fast forward six months, I drank it again, and now I really like it. It has a sweet and spicy flavor that is really enjoyable. The aroma is very warming too.. smells like the holidays :) I think once this comes back in stock locally, I will buy another box.
We use it in moderation once or twice a week so the amounts of sodium and MSG are not an issue for us.

While this is an extreme hot sauce with a good amount of extract, the taste is quite passable, especially for what it is.  Obviously if you eat enough at one time, you will taste extract but in use enough, you will taste extract, but it's hot enough where you don't need to use that much as a little bit will heat up your bowl of chili or salsa and add a very pleasant smoky flavor.
But the further away I went from mac & cheese, the less enjoyable I found this powdered solution to be. For example, I tried using it to make my favorite broccoli cheese soup, and the results were so disappointing I didn't even eat all of it. This definitely cannot replace regular cheddar, but it sure can make a quick and easy, cheesy meal.

  The best sauce in this set, by far, is the Chipotle. It's not very hot at all, possibly even less than Tabasco, but the flavor is great. It has a very strong smoky chipotle flavor, and is quite sweet (it's the only sauce out of the four that has any calories, according to the labels). Really this is more of a bbq sauce with a bit of zing. The only drawback is that bbq sauce is very inexpensive, and this stuff is over $4 for 5oz. The flavor is so good it's almost worth that price.

Pommery is neither a hot nor a sweet mustard, but savory (a Dijon mustard style). It combines a woody vinegar with a unique crunchiness of whole mustard seeds.
I dip blueberries into it.  I cover a large plate with it and then add steamed greens and eggs and eat it for breakfast. I add it to soups, sprinkle it on salads, add it to meatloaf, cakes and cookies and brownies.  I love love love it!

Decaf coffee, decaf teas (black, oolong, green, white) are all off the plate right now. Most coffee substitutes rely on barley and rye, so that's out for me. I even tried Dandy Blend, which supposedly they strain out the gluten, so it's gluten-free ... but my eczema and skin just reacted so badly 10 minutes after I drank it. So no DandyBlend either.
sugar free gum, but no cinnamon flavor.  There national brand flavor is very strange, an herb like flavor, that is

Two factors kept me from giving this 5-stars.  The first is the inclusion of Sleepytime.  Some people may really like this flavor, and I do too, but for me it's a specialty tea you pull out before bed.  You buy a whole box of this and keep it in your cabinet at home.  I wanted these to have for work and home, and Sleepytime at work... just not for me.  So I have to pull that envelope out and take it home.  I know, the horrors.  The second is the division of teas.  There are 5 flavors and 18 tea bags.  I mean, really?  Would it be so cost-ineffective to put in two more bags and divide the flavors equally?  But as it is, 2 flavors get 3 bags and 3 get 4.  And I'm no different than anyone else, when there is unequal division, of course it hasn't been divided right.  For example, one of the flavors that gets 4 bags?  That's right, Sleepytime.  Chamomile and Peppermint are also members of the 4 bag club.  So my 2 favorites, the Lemon Zinger and the Honey Vanilla Chamomile?  Yep, the 2 flavors that got shafted.  I know, woe is me.  Alas, it is the difference between a 4-star review and a 5-star review.

7555	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Proper steeping time is required to get the right taste, otherwise the taste of vanilla will overwhelm the tea.  I suggest 10 minutes.  I know it's a long wait, but it's worth it.  I get great pleasure out of making a cup of this tea for anyone that has not tried it and waiting to see the look on their face.  I wait as it steeps with a secret grin and then let it cool a little until it is the perfect temperature.  My friends don't come back asking for more, because they are immediately to the store to buy their own.  It is simply the best tea I have ever had anywhere.  It is wonderful hot on a snowy evening and steeped and cooled and poured over ice in the summer.  IT is wonderful to combine with another fruit like tea to give it a kick.  It is wonderful in every way.

This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone.
3557	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Regardless of the quality and the many reviews which praise the product, I was astounded when I got the package of beans and saw that I had paid nearly $17.00 for such a small bag.

It is a different, more tasty version of mayonaise.

PS:  By the way, like some of the other reviewers here, I recommend the regular or light carob powder over the dark brewed blend also available on Amazon.  Carob is not like chocolate in that it gets sweeter and stronger when roasted a bit longer. In my opinion and that of others here, it just gets more bitter and less pleasant by the lengthier process...
Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.

Nesco Original jerky marinade is superior to Nesco's Teriyaki jerky marinade.

7003	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this product with anticipation of a great seafood base for soup and stews. It was late and after 2 weeks of waiting I contacted seller. Janet the rep asked if my address was correct and to check it first. I have used the same address for 3 years and it was not the problem but Fed Ex was! I let her know they simply had not delivered my package and that wasn't the first time. I wish the vendors let you know at time of purchase who delivers for them. I would not use Fed Ex, they used to have such terrific service but now there are News reports on how bad the service is lol! Anyway she stated that she would send out another one 2 day air, about a week later the original finally showed and no confirmation asked he simply handed it to me and dashed off. The directions say dissolve 1 teaspoon lobster base in 8oz of boiling water. For each quart of stock needed use 1 1/2 tablespoon. They claim they use 1/3 less sodium, now mind you it contains 680mg per serving size!! Thats an unbelievable amount of salt. It had my head swimming from dizziness. The ingredients don't list tomato but when you get past all the salt you taste tomato and not lobster in my opinion. I would probably have to use much more base to get any seafood flavor but am very concerned about that much salt in my familys food. I would not purchase this again considering all the trouble I went through and I could have bought it locally for half the price but the seafood bases are a little harder to find in my neighborhood. One more thought and I am done. Food vendors should automatically be required to list all nutrition facts. This was an all around wasted holiday effort for me and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.

The original and teriyaki are very good, just the right amount of heat and sweetness. The Hot and Spicy mix packs a nice hot punch with a mild sweetness. I prepare jerky in a dehydrator and finish with cold smoking for 2 hours. Smoking is what take good jerky and makes it extraordinary. I prefer this to the original mix from A.C. Legg.

As a 'Francophile' (lover of French products and cooking and Julia Child) I switched to pricier French sea salts.  I still feel they might offer a bit extra...but I have gone back to Maldon's star-shaped pressed crystal salt because most 'upper end' Amazon customers will find this salt to be just fine and more reasonably priced than the French alternatives I also love.  Maldon has a clean, non-iodized briny flavor and a crush-able texture that allows sprinkling or strewing over meats and vegetables.  Very possibly this is the price/value champion for every day use.

Well Dave the gauntlet has been thrown down, is you product man enough to step up to the plate and answer the challenge?
And because this is only a jalapeno sauce, it really isn't all that spicy.  This is not one of those "Death" sauces that you parcel out a toothpick at a time and where a single bottle can last years.

Celestial Seasonings teas are packaged in completely compostable and biodegradable pillow-design tea bags without the need for a tag, string, staple, or individual wrapper. These unique tea bags are packed in boxes manufactured from 100% recyclable materials.

1479	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'd never purchased any Lee Kum Kee products before, but I saw that this shrimp sauce had only 2 ingredients (whole shrimp & salt) so I checked out their website. Most shrimp paste is made by mixing fresh shrimp with salt, pulverizing the combination, then letting it  sit outside to dry in open tanks. (Which can be kinda dicey in places like China, where there's rampant air pollution.) This is what the  company's US website said: **"Lee Kum Kee has improved the traditional processing techniques by selecting the best silver shrimp and drying them in a pollution-free greenhouse instead of constantly exposing them to outdoor conditions. This ensures our products are produced in hygenic conditions and guarantees food safety. The shrimp are fermented and dried without adding any preservatives, MSG or artificial coloring so they retain their natural taste."**  That sold me on it. (Amazon also had it for less than than the manufacturer's website.) Unlike every other shrimp paste I've tried, Lee Kum Kee isn't a hard, caked powder. I opened the jar to find a thick pudding consistency, with all the robust shrimp flavor you get from the usual versions of shrimp paste. Because it's wet, you definitely need to refrigerate it once opened. (Bacteria love a wet environment.) But I'm thrilled that I no longer have to use a hammer to break off pieces from a block of shrimp paste. Now, I can spoon out a precise measurement that I don't have to dissolve in boiling water before I can cook with it.
7871	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This hard to find tea is like a little cup of heaven.  I can find it at some of my local Giant stores, but glad to see it on Amazon.  A hot cup of this with a bit of honey is heavenly decadence!  The flavor is impeccable.  I would knock down one star for questionable ingredients (why is soy lecithin in my tea???), but it really does taste so fabulous, I just can't do it.

When I was young, Lipton tasted so pure, and you had to hurry and take the tea out of the hot water before it got too strong. It also had more of a clear, astringent quality. Hard to explain. So I haven't had that experience in a long time, no matter whether I buy the bags or loose. Has Lipton changed since I was young? (I'm talking 1960s-70's- maybe later.) I've noticed a lot of food items have changed quality since then and have used cheaper ingredients and / or you get less. Anybody else remember a difference in the old Lipton? I thought buying the loose from Europe (which I think this is) would be better, but it's not.

6	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this tea!  Okay, I'm not a high falutin' tea snob, but I first enjoyed this Lipton yellow label tea when on a trip to Singapore, and whether it was the room service, the company, or the country - it left such a favorable impression on me, I search it out whenever possible.  Maybe it's the same as the USA's white label Lipton tea, but the yellow label tea appears to me to be smoother and more mellow.  I would highly recommend it - give it a try!
The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.

Root beer was invented in 1875 by Mr. Hires (the name may be familiar to you), although precursors were available many years earlier. It's estimated that there have been over 2,000 root beer brands. Boylan's, based in Haledon, New Jersey, is also well known for its birch beer, a related product.

3892	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a unique soda pop, I'm not quite sure I've had one like it before.  For the record I've never been to anywhere in Latin America, just the States and Canada.  Anyway, it is very much worth trying at least once.  Some people describe the flavor in reviews as like bubble gum, I'd say that close but there's something else there too.  For something as "simple" as soda pop the flavor is very subtle.  It is VERY sweet though, not sure if my bottle uses sugar or corn syrup (the ingrediants on the bottle I got says either High Frutose Corn Syrup or Sucrose was used) but regardless, it is very sweet, probably up to the level of Jolt way back when they still used cane sugar if not more.  It's not something I'd want every day, I'd grow tired of it, but that is probably true of almost anything.  But it is a nice unique treat to try, and despite the price and shipping (It was packed very well as an aside, and shipped quickly so I don't think the shipping was overpriced considering that) I know I'll order it again when the mood hits to have this.
I enjoy drinking this it has the feeling of coffee without the effects.  I can enjoy and and still relax.  I love this.  So happy its back and available.
Food To Live performs well in ithe packaging of its nut varieties. These arrived in a very thick bag, with a convenient zip-lock open feature. These nuts are the best Macadamia Nuts that I have tasted, and they are excellent value for money.

3535	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a much better Coffee than the French Market brand sole in our local grocery stores as chicory Coffee.  It tastes like a higher quality Coffee and it's just so much better once you try this brand of Louisiana coffee you'll never touch French Market again. This is a mellow, smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after you're finished with your last cup for the morning. French Market (it's only competitor) is bitter, too strong, the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable, and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth it's so bad. I've on occasion used peppermint tea after one or two cups of French Market.

The flavor is consistent throughout the base and does not settle out--it will never separate the flavor from the salt from the liquid and fat; not even when left on the refrigerator shelf for months and months.  That is important to me.  The base is very easy to spoon out; it doesn't harden in the cold of the frig.

The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.
9422	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this licorice. Reminds me of my childhood and how much my mom loved it and for good reason. Soft, chewy and flavorful! This company had the best price at the time of purchase also.  Not a huge fan of the blueberry or raspberry flavors,  but that's just personal preference.
4280	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This product exceeded my expectations. I'm really happy with the rich gold color I was able to obtain using this applied on fondant. It did take a couple of coats but even the first coat still had a nice opacity that would've been fine on it's own. Are use this to color a unicorn horn for a cake and it was fantastic. The gold was very bright and beautiful, it took about 3 coats to get it the way I wanted but it went on easily. I applied it dry and mixed with lemon extract or vodka and both methods worked well.

3794	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I use a lot of black pepper in everyday cooking and usually we do a custom blend of fresh ground pepper corns - because my husband took a class and got persnickety about pepper. That's a good thing for the most part, but sometimes you just want a quick dash of pre-prepped plain black pepper over a burger or fries. I've tried the generic versions, but McCormick has the best flavor, even heat and it doesn't clog up in the can if you don't use it daily.

3069	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I would tell you first this is an absolutely fabulous product!!  On the other hand it's not for the faint of heart, LOL!!!  I've been a chef for 20 yrs., this product rates very high in all areas of flavor profiles.  The only drawback I have with it is the initial heat is so in your face hot if you are not prepared you could damage your mouth and everything you eat past that is a non-issue.  My suggestion is to just use a single drop on the first use to let the palate(roof of mouth) and the 50 or so gustatory receptor cells on our tongue to adjust, letting what I will tell you is an incredible initial shock to the mouth even for a seasoned hot sauce connoisseur settle.  My eyes watered and I got the heat hick-ups oh, wow, my forehead immediately beaded with sweat!  I thought for a minute or ten because I had tasted an entire 1/2 teaspoon I had gone to H***.  I sat down and ate about 20 soda crackers and got some relief.  I have tasted (300K Scoville) Habanero Sauce, and although great it doesn't compare 'if' you use this product correctly.  This is not a product to be used by someone who is not a seasoned hot sauce user or someone who thinks they would like to play a joke.  I was very satisfied with this product and will order it again and again.  Living south Louisiana it compliments many items which I eat.  I am a person who can eat a raw Habanero without batting an eye and I emphasize I had to adjust myself to eating this sauce with time and patience until it was what I now call 'A Beautiful Thing'!!!

Now I keep a jar of it right next to the salt and pepper, I use it so often.  It isn't fresh vanilla bean, but a close second.  And it doesn't drip! :)

1095	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	The spicy flavor has a lot to be desired , yes it was somewhat spicy but the good taste was missing and was it ever salty ? They need to go easy on the sodium , a lot of my friends thought. The same !
9009	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this big flaky salt. It has a clean salt taste, rather than the harsh chemical taste of, say, Morton's table salt.

It arrived on time. We had this with crackers and a wasabi flavored seaweed snack. Really good. We tried different combinations with crackers, sirachi, mayo and also sour cream and cream cheese. Very good. Tomorrow I'm going to make an Asian kani salad with this. I'll order from them again.  For those people wanting an expensive caveat I don't know how to rate this. For my family we have always eaten the tarama or taramasalada by Krinos which is an inexpensive Greek spread made of carp roe. We also eat this and the salmon roe at the Japanese restaurant.  So for the price and for what we're accustomed to this is an excellent product.

That's fine with me : ) I'm writing because I tell ya, It really really really does cut your appetite!! I am really plus size, round with belly fat, and fat neck and chin and it's been impossible for me to lose weight especially after 50 years. Well, this week, I realized "why am I not craving carbs like I usually do"? Well, I have to attribute it to the Ooo Long. Nothing stops my craving for sweets and this does! I have gotten on my treadmill after not looking at it for 5 months! I pulled all the weeds from my garden ( a task I kept avoiding), and have energy where many days I don't want to get out of bed. I suffer from xtreme exhaustion, though I don't do anything strenuous. Now I'm not so exhausted anymore.
I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.

3126	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This sauce is HOT. It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!

2766	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I'm afraid I have to agree with some other reviewers about the downsides of this product.  We eat a lot of almonds and it turns out it's hard to beat our California almonds.  These are grown in Spain so are probably a different variant of almond than were used to.  They are small and we didn't like the taste as much or the dusty / powdery / dirtiness and washed them before using.  There is a lot more of the skin that you have to contend with and once I bit into one that was like a stone it was so hard.  We have decided to throw the rest out and not buy again.

Okay, the truth on this product. I wish I could buy it at a lower price and in quantity, because I can use up the bottle in two weeks I like it so much. It's not too hot and it's...Zesty?...and a nice variation if you like milder hot sauces that also include many other flavors besides hot. I still use "wicked hot" hot sauces, but I also enjoy Tobasco Chipotle sauce as a table sauce these days too, which is much milder than the original.
9327	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Delicious and priced reasonably compared to the white, refined, Domino Dots sugar cubes.  We use for hot tea almost exclusively, but occasionally will pop one of the smaller ones into my mouth for a treat.  The sizes vary and the cube shapes are rough, but they are none of them are too large for a cup of tea, which I was concerned about when first ordering them. I plan to get them again when we finish with the three boxes.  They are sealed in a plastic bag inside the box, so they should store well if you were wondering about that.

3167	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!
But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891. All in all a perfect black cherry soda, best I have ever had.

How hot you ask?  If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue, there is noticeable heat.  When it comes time to eat a meal, I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat.  The stuff is no joke.  If you use it like Frank's Red Hot, you will probably die.  100 percent recommended if you like things HOT.

After years of on and off use of this product I now mostly use it to sweeten my "other" supplements/smoothie ingredients and only ideally if I have an electric blender available. Although the product clearly states "MIXES INSTANTLY. NO BLENDER REQUIRED", I find that to be a real stretch of ones imagination!  If one were to mix the powder into boiling water it may "mix instantly", but I tend to add this to cold milk (or similar) and, believe me, IT DOES NOT MIX INSTANTLY!!  Of course, this is not a major issue if you do not mind a lumpy shake, but if you want a smooth drink plan on using an electric blender --or allow extra time for an extended bottle shaking ceremony as part of your workout!

Of course, the peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, licorice and chamomile all help calm a churning stomach. Vitamins B6 and B12 are "stress vitamins" that give you a sense of well-being, keep your hair from falling out, prevent premature graying and boost your immune system. Eleuthero, or Siberian Ginseng, is known for its ability to reduce hypertension and inflammation, boost memory and increase endurance. Tilia flowers may be helpful in preventing headache and high blood pressure, as well. Catnip is a mild hallucinogenic in felines and supposedly has a numbing effect on humans.

It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive (over twice the price of the item itself) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it.

9974	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is an updated review for the third shipment as I purchase more than 10boxes for each order. I enjoy Stevita Supreme very much but there seems to be some inconsistency in the sweetness. The first box which I've opened aren't sweetness (and I'm already using the 12th sachet in this particular box) while the previous 2 shipments were all right. Can Stevita Stevia please explain on the inconsistency of sweetness and currently, I've to use 1.5 sachet to get the sweetness while I use only one sachet for the 1st 2 shipments? I still have 12 more boxes and I'm wonderfing if I should continue using Stevia.
As of now I've used about 500 packets, mostly in tea without milk.  I find it a perfect replacement for Splenda in tea, but still it took me a few weeks to get to this point.  Even though Stevita is a pretty good stevia product, I still had to get my taste buds to the point that they were happy to have it.  I did this by starting out with half Stevita and half Splenda in my tea.  Then after a week or so I switched to full-on Stevita and haven't looked back since.
as the chocolate note is totally absent from detection.  Although it's just "okay", it's not all that exciting to my taste buds. I'll finish the package but won't purchase again.
9250	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love my salts. There's a preferred salt for almost every type of food. Fleur de sel, or "flower of salt", is a *finishing salt*. This means that after a meal is cooked and prepared, fleur de sel is added as the final touch to enhance your food. Add a little bit right before you eat and it will add a kick of flavor.

It is very hot, but not stupidly so, like "Nuckin' Futts" or "Mega-Death Sauce", but it is still hot, so, if you aren't sure if it's too hot for you, it probably will be.

3134	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	This sauce has a nasty bitter flavor. I have no idea where all these people are getting that it tastes good, it doesn't. If you use it as a sauce it is just horrible. The heat level is not very high either, don't let anyone try to fool you on that. Oooh, let's capitalize on the ghost pepper craze. Whatever.

957	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Worked great. I wasn't sure I would need it so had it as back up. Thought the icing could use a little pink tint. Instructions said use a toothpick. Thought more would be better. NOT. It turned into neon pink with 1/4 tsp. A little truly goes a long way. Next batch used the toothpick method and lovely shade light pink.

135	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Does the job!  I switched from Wilton for making hard candy.  Ateco works better and blends quickly during boiling process (no stirring).  For one batch of hard candy I've found that 2 drops (not 1, not 3) is perfect.
My bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy.  This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem.  As others have mentioned, this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water.

Obviously Azaleas are outdoor plants, but our winters can get cold, even down south, so I bought a grow-light from Amazon.com, and I'm going to try to get this Azalea through the winter indoors.  In the spring, I can set it out under the arbor in the backyard.
8861	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	As another reviewer wrote, I too ordered this salt since it has an ultra-fine texture. It arrived in a flimsy box laying on top of a popcorn popper box. A slight hit on the box during shipping and the salt container was damaged. I did not realize that "This item is not eligible for return.", not until I needed to return it or have it replaced.

I've been telling everyone about how much I love this. I'm telling you, you will never use regular salt again after using this.

I have bought other Chai ta bags only to throw them away because they were disgusting. This one has just the right mix of seasonings and a hint of vanilla. Like another reviewer said, milk is a must for Chai tea.( I know--I had never put milk in my tea in my life and it sounded gross!) Vanilla soy milk is great and enhances the hint of vanilla in the tea. I also sweeten mine (honey is recommended but I use sweetner). This tea frequently replaces my morning coffee, and the decaf version is just as good if you want it at bedtime. I like it so well that I have ordered it by the case from Celestial Seasonings when I couldn't find it in the store! Kudos to Amazon for carrying it!!

This is pretty good for spicing up soups, chilies, etc.  However, not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something, not because it is too hot, just don't care for the flavor that much 'straight up.'
Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine

8194	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have tried-out this fine tea in several ways now. It was great each way -- hot or icy by itself -- or hot or icy added to regular black tea. My primary purpose was to find a good cherry tea to make my own black cherry black tea blend. This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea. It is not as tart as a "zinger" type tea -- rather just spot-on to back the black cherry blend. Celestial Seasonings has fine-tuned this blend of various organic ingredients very well -- to find a mix which is most like a rich tart black cherry tea -- great on its own or in a further mix +++

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.
696	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I already reviewed the item and felt negatively about it. First the bar has 15gr. of sugar and 200 calories and relative a low protein content.

And if you can't tell that I'm all about the green curry right now, I'm using it again tonight in a pork and vegetable dish for company.

8982	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	This is an odd salt. It is too expensive to use for salting the water, say, for pasta. I tried it over the food without grinding, and that didn't work either.

5231	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Well, you have to love this cheese to eat it.  It is salty, somewhat crumbly, and has a unique taste.  It is very good, in my opinion, while I am sure that some won't like the taste.  It is hard to find, and here is a good source for it.  The sellers have found a good method to ship it to prevent getting too hot in shipping, which is very convenient since they use priority mail.  Good for them, and good for my wife and I.

8728	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is really, really good sea salt and it's different in that it is salt flakes rather than salt granules.  I like this even better than Penzeys grey sea salt.  A little goes a very long way; be extremely judicious.
So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.

Celestial Seasonings' Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea.

As described this is a finishing salt, so don't waste it on adding to recipes, you only want to use it on things where you will get it as a grain of salt rather than disolved, for example it is amazing on steaks, added on top of a prime rib durring the resting period, on salted caramels, chocolates, or on veggies after they have been cooked. It is a small amount, but because it is just a finishing salt you don't need much of it so it will last a long time.

I'm sorry to have to say this but Celestial Seasonings Chai tea is better than Tazo's. Normally I get a chai tea at Starbucks but lately I've been making a lot of tea at home. Now that the weather is cooler I'm trying out lots of teas. This chai tea is in little pillow bags so there is not waste. Since there are no strings, tags, staples or wrappers the company claims that they save more than 3.5 million pounds of waste from being put into landfills. This is really something. Anyway, this tea is made with black tea, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper and star anise. It also contains some chicory and vanilla. Now I have to say I've been enjoying this tea but didn't realize its full potential until I drank it while eating a piece of banana bread. The flavors were perfect together. I'd recommend you really stock up on this tea because it is so delicous.

Although I can see how the strong taste of this Whole Leaf flavor can be off-putting to some, I find it very delectable, especially when I mix it with clear liquid SweetLeaf Stevia.  You can use half and half ratio, or one third of Whole Leaf with two thirds of clear liquid and the end result will be lot more palatable.  You can use either plain unflavored, or any flavored clear Stevia (valencia orange and chocolate are my favorite).

I add my daily tablespoon in my morning coffee to sweeten and it is delicious!  I could probably eat the tablespoon just by licking the spoon but it is very sweet and I've been off white sugar long enough that too much sweet is a horrible taste to me.  This works perfectly.  I just use the stronger stuff for my baked beans - this is perfect for "medicinal" purposes!

For those who aren't familiar with Rooibos Tea, it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor, minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid, but with the anti-oxidants and other GOOD stuff.

The only downside to this and all Barry Farm items is the shipping.  This celery goes for around $2.00 a package but costs around $7.00 to ship.  All Barry Farm products are expensive in the shipping sense for a reason I have never really figured out.  But it's very easy to make this and any other Bary Farm purchase easily a bargain by combining either 3 or more bags of this, or anything else from them.  You can actually order 6 of these celery bags for around a dollar more in shipping than the cost for just one.  I routinely order at least a couple of several products at once and end up paying close to the actual price per unit that way.  I highly recommend this very flavorful and convenient celery talk and leaf, as well as combining the shipping on this and or all Barry Farm products.  It will help make you some of the best one pot meals you are to ever enjoy...

The taste is strong and flavorful although I would expect that not everyone would like this tea.  However the benefits derived from drinking genuine Rooibos tea is amazing and that is exactly why I love this tea and continue to drink on a daily basis.

If you dilute it in enough sauce, soup, chili or whatever you like hot sauce in you'll find that it has a really great taste that blends well with most dishes.  On the other hand if you just use it straight you'll probably be sorry.  For most people this would be considered an EXTREMELY hot sauce.  The bottle has warnings for people with heart and respiratory problems.

Each time I drink it, it reminds me of one of my favorite books, Chocolat. If you're a sweet tooth, I advise you try adding a tsp of light/golden brown sugar - I've tried it with honey and it didn't taste right. It is a bit pricey, so if you can find it at a lower cost in your local market or grocery store, I'd suggest purchasing it there.

Flavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.

Rather than store the 6-pack of boxes in the cupboard, I put the teabags in an airtight canister and keep it on the counter.

3073	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This is a "curb rating" on my part.  I'd rate it about a 2.  It does deliver on its promise of heat, but the flavor is just nothing to write home about.  If you've ever eaten old, dried cayenne straight from the jar, that's exactly what this tastes like.  It's earthy, bitter, and simply put, lacking complexity.  The onion and garlic and stuff that are supposedly in there, just don't hit home, and the fresh pepper flavors you get with less cheaply made sauces, isn't anywhere within a mile of this bottle.  Furthermore, I can eat about a spoonful of this before I feel the full mouth, in-my-face pain.  It says one drop at a time, which might be true for some people, but if I want to get the real spice going- the brain tingling, endorphin-pumping kind- then I need a few shakes.  It's actually not that much hotter than sri racha sauce, which tastes SO much better, and doesn't rely on added capsacin.  I was on Skype the first time I ate this, with my boyfriend.  He wanted me to do a review while I dealt with the pain (he watches a guy who does reviews of superhot hot sauces, just after trying them).  He asked me how it was.  I sighed, and, without any drama at all, said... "...Hot."  He laughed, and said, "Aww, you sound so sad!"  It wasn't intentional, but the lack of flavor... not heat, but FLAVOR... was just intensely disappointing.  You'd get more flavor out of some finely chopped habenero, and about the same heat.

It gives the oatmeal a sweet, cinnamon-y taste that is just too yummy!

Despite the outrage, floods of phone calls and letters of disapproval to the U.S.D.A. and the F.D.A., All almonds sold inside the U.S. must now be PASTEURIZED, Chemicalized, Bleached, Tainted & Poisoned. These same agencies have notified food producers that they should DISHONESTLY label their pasteurized almonds as 'RAW' (the opposite of pasteurized), and that the food producers will get the government's full BLESSINGS. Therefore, almonds in the United States which are labeled as 'RAW', are deceptively labeled, and you should do your own research and expose and boycott all the companies that participate in this deception, corruption and sham.

[3] Penzey's - I disliked - the best way I can describe it is a combination flavor with aspects of flower, artificial coconut-pineapple blend, and cheap mallow filled pastel coated easter candy.
Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.
Take this salsa, add in some roasted and chopped tomatoes and jalapenos and green chiles and garlic that you roast in your own oven.  Add a little fresh cilantro and maybe a bit of sweet onion.

I forgot to remove the tea bag from my mug, then later threw a black tea bag in there and brewed tea again.  The scent of peaches wasn't as strong but I could taste it alongside the black tea and that was a very nice flavor combination.  (This tea also makes a great iced tea, by the way.)
8875	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These salt flakes are delicious.  I first tried a tiny pinch on sauted eggs.  Although I used less than I would normally have put on with traditional table salt, the taste was extremely satisfying.  You get wonderful bright, clean, little pops of salt taste on your tongue.  When it's concentrated like that, it's far more recognizable and satisfying, and you can use less, and still feel very satisfied.  Your mind and body are very aware that you got your salt, unlike when finely milled salt is distributed evenly throughout your food.  I was surprised by the sensation.
9946	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Let's face it -- it takes effort to get used to stevia.  There is a learning curve for your taste buds to get used to it because it just isn't sugar!

The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three, but its taste is just not at all like Postum, it is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it. Often I'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it. (I could always tell if I've ingested aspartame by (or nutrasweet, whatever) by how I felt, and try to verify any food/drink I ingest doesn't have aspartame. I mean, an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare, and itself found to be an effective weapon, really shouldn't be passed off as a food item. Stevia is ground plant matter, even less processed that sugar.)The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink.

I used two bags of each, sweetened to taste, in each half gallon of water.

Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

Once before I bought this bulk from Amazon and used it for the topping we used the Kraft American and it worked out. This time I find the cheese is unimaginably salty, it could not be applied to popcorn, even unsalted popcorn that was coated using unsalted butter. The salt content of this cheese is just off the charts. Well, no one I know of claimed this to be the same as Kraft's American Cheese or suitable as a popcorn topping; so no harm no foul between me and certainly Nots [with the] Barry Farm.  This cheese is probably meant to be used in a casserole with noodles, milk and other ingredients that it is complimentary and diluted with. I'm going to give it to my daughter who feeds the grandkids "mac and cheese" and she can use this in that and in other recipes that the cheese can be a part of.
They are sealed in aluminum pouches to assure their freshness and to prevent cross contamination of the tea fragrances and flavor.  I have attached photos of a new box we just opened for your information.  My wife likes these a lot and we recommend them to you.
9053	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I don't know why I have always resisted buying this for so many years, I don't know if the term flake put me off or what but it is SO good. You crush it between your fingers and sprinkle over food. I think this goes great whole on top of sweets like chocolates or cupcakes for the salted caramel flavor - you get a flaky salty crunch that is awesome. I think its great for cooking with as long as you break it down with your fingers, we keep it in a salt box on the counter and it is all we use now.
7366	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I enjoy these tea immensely. I am a little troubled that the teas are so heavily dyed and also sweetened.  My favorites of the flavors are the raspberry and cherry and course those are the first to go and my least favorite is the blueberry. The blueberry  flavor in my opinion is reminiscent of berry flavored cough syrup. I enjoy drinking these because Celestial uses rose hips as one of the herbal ingredients .And I read and believe that rose hips can help alleviate some pre-menstrual symptoms but dubious pseudo- science aside these are just really juicy and flavorful teas.

8168	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I drink a giant mug of this almost nightly. Peppermint is very soothing and relaxing, and it's great for settling an upset stomach. It's up there with ginger for homemade remedies. The aroma is too good to resist and the taste is just as good. It's minty and a little sweet, but not too sweet. It's much healthier than soda (barely different from warm water), so if you're trying to break a soda habit this tea is a must. It's a great thing to drink any time of day. Great for settling out a large meal, relaxing/calming down during a hectic day, and great for unwinding before bed. Celestial Seasonings always has the best teas, and this is no exception. It's great to find it at such a bargain online.

I use it in place of vanilla extract all the time. This is a fantastic price for a great quantity. I will be purchasing this again as I'm sure to run out at the speed I'm using it.  Its more of a syrup than a paste really, but it exchanges for extract beautifully.  I usually just take out a bit of sugar from whatever I'm using it in as the paste does contain sugar.

  The biggest problem I have with these sauces, specifically the red and the green, is that they contain food coloring. I don't care about any health effects, but honestly the green is a very strange shade of green. Almost fluorescent. I feel like I'm putting toothpaste on my food almost, and it makes me want to eat without looking at my food. The red is not nearly as strange a color.

This is indeed HOT, but eating it neat doesn't feel quite as intense as eating a fresh habanero to me- my ears were not burning.  The heat is quick to start, strong, and tingly, lasting for several minutes.  The flavor of the sauce reminds me a little of tomato paste with cherries (but not sweet) and I don't really taste chili peppers.  Excellent for kicking things up without altering flavor too much.

It's a lovely, relaxing tea to read with, day or night. I drink it hot and cold. Cold, it's often more refreshing than water. Sometimes I have a craving specifically for Passion Iced Tea. Hot, it makes a beautiful breakfast tea or afternoon tea. It might even be a good dinner tea, actually, if you sip it between courses to cleanse your palate! I usually order an Earl Grey. I'll test it next time I can.

I finally bought this giant size bottle and am so glad.  I don't worry about running out and tend to use a little more than a recipe calls for because I love the taste so well (and I have plenty -so why not use a little more).  This is so far superior than most store bought vanilla.  No comparison really.  Just keep in mind there are tiny black vanilla bean specks so if you use this in something white - you will see the specks (such as cream cheese or white icing, etc.)

Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use "natural flavors" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called "effervescent decaffeination" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.

9789	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	After decades of suffering migraines from chocolate - yeah, I know, stop eating it, right?  I rarely do, but when I do I pay for it for days - I thought well, why not carob?  Looked around on amazon, found several products I thought I'd try, this one included.  Not sure I'll ever eat it.  I've had carob before, and another one to compare I ordered at the same time.  It's like night and day, these being night.  Like I said, grainy, gritty, thick aftertaste/texture like eating carob-flavored crayons.  Other than that, they're not bad, and I think they might work in cookies.  YMMV.

Forget jalapenos and so on. Then, as I read further about hot peppers, I came across references to ghost pepper. Habaneros are hot; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year. As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner, you get heat and they also support flavor.
I didn't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported, in fact it's putting out little white flowers that are great.  Don't believe the reviews that are two years old, maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great.

It is waxy, which is common, but it is very hard, making it fairly hard to dig it out with a spoon, even though it melts easily and completely in your mouth.  I suppose this is a fairly minor problem, but I wouldn't buy it again.  It is a very mild/bland honey, which some people may prefer.

The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter.  One part Marmite to two or three parts butter.  Then spread thinly on toast.  Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt.  Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat.  The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a  substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots.

So, Where would you use this stuff?? Well, maybe a cold dessert like a strawberry pie with the pretty glaze stuff. Should be thick, but you don't want to cook it, right...There are plenty of other uses too. Think for a moment and I am certain you can come up with some of your own where it would be handy to thicken something without cooking it. There is another feature that differentiates it from the 'regular' CLEAR GEL as well. While the instant version (this one..) starts thickening immediately, it also WILL CONTINUE TO THICKEN if you do decide to heat it or cook it, but only ONE TIME. This is important---You should only heat this product once. Exactly what happens if you re-heat it...I don't know. But the manufacturer (supplier..??) says to only heat it one time.

I already have a couple of sea salts, as well as the ubiquitous pink salt, and I figured that was more than covering the bases on salt. But I had to find out what all the fuss was about, and now I know. This is the angel's version of salt; like solid snowflakes with bright and fresh salt flavor (hey- it's not really explainable, but I'm trying...). This is the finishing salt they use in heaven.
You can purchase vanillla bean powder (through many suppliers) and anything you add after that is completely up to you. If you prefer paste already made, I'd recommend the vanilla queen. No sugar added!!!

This new stuff has the sharp almost acrid sweetness that is just like every other spearmint gum.  I don't think it's the sweetener either, because their Juicy Fruit tastes just like the old time juicy fruit.  They must have changed the 'secret recipe' for the Spearmint and they absolutely ruined it! It used to be my favorite flavor, but evidently it's gone forever.

This has become my favorite liquid type sweetener, even over honey, although I don't think I'd use this in tea, only on foods that call for syrup, since I would think the buttery flavor might get lost in a hot liquid.

I am a bit picky when it comes to my teas, and this one had a nicely mellow, medium bodied flavor (absolutely no bitterness) while still having enough strength and character without the need for milk and sugar.  With a pinch of sugar, the tea opens up with a hint of a creamy floral aroma, and it was heavenly with the various cakes, scones, and savories served with the O'Henry afternoon tea.

Eleuthero may also support the body by helping the liver detoxify harmful toxins.

Follow-up research shows that, MOST Whole Foods Market only sells bitter almonds that are pasteurized by STEAM!? which is an improvement over the poisonous pasteurization methods; but it still DEGRADES AND DESTROYS the nutritional value of the almonds, and of course, it eliminates ALL or most of the vitamin B-17. There is usually no way to know which method was used for pasteurization at most retailers, because the pertinent labeling laws were made to benefit the chemical industry, and deceive consumers. Because the FDA have instructed food producers that they should dishonestly label their PASTEURIZED almonds as 'RAW'.

It's not spicy, exactly - it's more of a fruit kind of flavor.  Another reviewer compared it to A1 sauce, and that's pretty apt at least in terms of viscosity and color.  However, Pickapeppa has a LOT more flavor notes to it.  It's outstanding on grilled chicken or pork.  I got so addicted to it that I started using it on French fries.  Another idea is a kind of ersatz dip...take a block of cream cheese and smother it in Pickapeppa, then use it as a spread on Ritz crackers.

5474	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Simply the best for Qi deficient people. Check with your Acupuncturist. This is not a general tonic for everyone is is very specific to a Chinese Medicine diagnosis. It can create imbalances for those who do not need this specific type of support. Pollen and Royal  Jelly are cooling. So if your condition  does not require this  it can harm you. Also they use  multiple types of Ginseng. All Ginseng is not created  equal. Contrary to what we read Ginseng is not just for energy boosting. Different  types of people need specific types of ginseng for specific purposes according to my Acupuncturist.
4513	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I never tried this before. It is not a substitute for vanilla extract. It only adds brown specks to your ice cream. It has little flavor.
7470	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Before I even lowered the tea bag into the hot water, the smell of the tea was delicious!  After steeping the bag and removing it, WOW, it tasted delicious!  It was such a relaxing, calming afternoon I had while sipping that tea.  My 25-year old son walked in the room and even asked me what smelled so good.  He normally notices NOTHING!  I am a huge tea-drinker when I am either sick or upset, and I can vouch for Celestial Seasonsings Mandarin Orange just melting away the tensionI highly recommend it.
5990	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	There are a lot of claims floating about on how this tea can help you lose weight. Well I cannot say it has that impact but I began adding it to my morning tea in the morning and I have been able to stay active and go for long periods without getting hungry.  I also take another herb that is supposed to do the same type of thing and so I cannot say which one has the most impact or any impact at all. I always have been able to skip eating if I was busy and I have been busy so I cannot say that buy this and you will experience magical things happen to you. But this brand costs very little and actually tastes very good.  So I think if you are curious about this type of tea for the price it is not a great risk to try it. Plus it does have a pleasant taste so even if it does nothing for you, you get a nice drink.  It does not come with a string so you end up fishing it out of your cup which is a minor annoyance but at this price well so be it.

The texture/thickness is exactly like honey, so it pours slowly and thickly, making it a lot like honey in this way as well. It doesn't seem to granulate like honey, though, which I'm glad for.
So how is this brand different than the others? It has a natural, lightly sweet taste. The flavor profile is coffee/caramel-like. Not tangy nor robust, like many others (which is probably best for baking and BBQ sauces). It has a deep dark flavor that is highly appealing. Closer in taste to buckwheat honey. Try drizzling it over high quality vanilla ice cream, and you will pick up on the caramel notes. My primary application is to coffee/coffee alternatives.  I have since tried (some offered on Amazon, in larger quantity) other brands of "blackstrap molasses". I assumed they would all have the dark flavor compared to regular molasses. Not necessarily true. Some taste too bright and tangy. Some are good, but not quite like this one. So if you haven't been consuming molasses and would like to start, just know that it might take some time and money finding one that is perfect for your taste preference. All the more I can say about this brand is that I have seen several bottles become empty these past few months. As a side, these nice glass bottles can be reused as cleaning/personal care product containers by using the spray mechanism from a plastic bottle. Just cut the straw part down some. Enjoy!
6476	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Nice selection of sampler package.  I like them all, so none of them have to get tossed or passed on to someone else.  I'm glad I tried them...I never would have thought of trying peach, but it is really nice.

3931	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this to save some time when making Mexican dishes that call for it. Making it from scratch with anatto seeds in a blender is kind of messy and time consuming but the flavor is a million times better than this stuff. It's also really too dry to even be called a paste.
But, here is the kicker, never before in history had any nation practiced the absurdity of pasteurizing dry (even salted) nuts, fruits or seeds by FORCE. Americans cannot domestically buy raw almonds or fruits for food anymore, and much more importantly, Americans are being prevented from using bitter almonds (vitamin B-17) to cure their owned sick body from cancers. Judging from the F.D.A.'s bizarre aggression towards almonds which contain intact vitamin B-17, and apricot seeds, it is easy to conclude just how powerful and effective vitamin B-17 is for curing cancers, at least for those of us who are knowledgeable about the F.D.A.'s unwavering history of destroying and censoring ALL effective NATURAL, Herbal or other treatments or CURES. Only to protect the big-evil 3s (Big Pharma, AMA & ACS), well 4 if you include Satan, whom only purpose is to kill, steal and destroy. And they have done a good, well an excellent job so far, while wrecking in major wealth and profit. What a mind job!!??

I've been making jerky for years now, and switched to ground beef jerky about 2 years ago because the dentist said it would be easier on my husband's teeth, so I bought the LEM Jerky Cannon and got busy.  Using a liquid-based seasoning makes for a very tasty jerky, but it squirts a lot of liquid out while extruding the ground beef onto the drying trays, so I thought I'd take the easy way out and try a prepackaged mix.

Toward the end, add sugar to taste and, for tartness, add either fish sauce or lime juice.  Enjoy.  Depending on the time I have, I augment the sauce with kafir lime leaves, basil and fresh garlic and/or ginger.  But these additions not needed, but give the sauce a bit more zing.

8386	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...
- To make iced tea that tastes like Starbucks Green Tea, brew 2 tea bags in 2/3 cup of boiling hot water. Let the tea steep for 5-6 minutes. Remove tea bags and stir in 3 spoonfuls simple syrup. Pour over 2 cups of ice and stir. I usually let this set a few minutes for the ice to melt and dilute it a bit to make it not as strong and to cool it down. I know this seems very strong and bitter at first, but if you've ever had a cup of their iced tea right when they hand it to you then you know it is very strong and overly sweet at first till the ice melts.

I like to make it very strong and brew it extra long, I add just a wee bit of sugar, but it really doesn't need any. I took this to work in a pump pot and everyone who tried it loved and asked where it came from. Only thing is I told them it was called Sugar Plum Fairy...oops! lol, guess I should read better and not just look at the pictures on the box!

HOWEVER........the Amazon price is just about double what I pay for it in the grocery store.  And....yes....you can find it at almost any larger grocery store.
This tea is amazing.  It is no overpowering, has a very light tingle of spice (probably the ginger) followed by a cool, minty sensation all the way down your throat.  I suffer from a lot of stress and anxiety; this tea gets rid of it all.  If it weren't for this tea, I may have became an alcoholic to calm myself down.  It is amazing how much this tea can help you if you suffer from stress and anxiety.  I drink it in the morning and at night, I find that it really makes the day run a lot smoother for me and I have been referring to this tea as "medicine" since it relieves some anxiety without all the side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, addiction(I am addicted, but it's not a drug!

6271	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have been looking for a substitute for King Arthur's Instant Clear Jel and I'm so glad I found this version by Barry Farms. There's a very decent amount here (much more than KA's) and I like that the sugar and citric acid have been left out, this is just plain ol' clear jel. This product is fantastic for making pies, works so much better than ordinary cornstarch or flour. Simply mix - I like to toss with your fresh fruit and other ingredients and add to your pie crust. This gives a lovely "jam-like" consistency to pie fillings and will firm up the juice if you're using berries or wet fruit so you avoid a soggy crust. There are no instructions but you can find recipes on KA's website for a general idea of how much it takes when you bake a pie. For example, I used 1/4 cup in the last 10 inch apple pie I made, 2-3 TBSP would be appropriate for smaller (or flatter) pies. You may need to experiment a bit with your baking, I like that this Clear Jel doesn't clump or harden like regular cornstarch if you use a bit too much, it mixes very well. It also works very well with low pectin fruit. The price is very reasonable too! Highly recommended!

I drink it as is, or mix it with pomegranate tea, which can be a bit strong on its own. This compliments and mellows the pomegranate out. Add stevia, and you have a drink that will make you forget those calorific sodas. And its good for you too! It is packed with antioxidants, is anti-inflammatory, and has a calming effect which can help irritability, headaches, and even help insomnia sufferers.

This sauce is a great place to continue your fiery journey. Just beyond the horizon of Cayenne peppers, which they use to produce the mild, aforementioned mass-produced Louisiana-style sauces - lies a big family of chil peppers waiting to meet you. In this case, El Yucateco took the unripened green Habaero and made a sauce out of it. And it's darn good! Like many folks, you'll most likely discover this for the first time on the tables of smaller, more authentic, out-of-the-way Mexican restaurants. Yeah the color's a little too Kermit-like, but the sauce is smooth & tangy with just enough bite around the corner to lift your mouth spirits. It's not a direct assault - but it will linger for a while, like a grade-school crush. Let me also recommend two things: Firstly, you should definitely be able to find this in Latin supermarkets for a ridiculously good deal - like $3.00 for the 8oz bottle - or - check the 'Ethnic' food aisle at any generic supermarket - if you're in luck, they'll have it. And while your in said aisle, pick-up ya can or two of Chipotls en Adobo(sauce). Start adding a few of these smokey delights, chopped-up, to recipes that are lacking depth of spice. iAye Chihuahua!!!

I like that I can drink it anytime without caffeine jitters and I am experimenting with different additions for my taste. I found that flavored creamers improve the taste which makes me happy and I can hardly taste the five spice . I have been a fan of Celestial Seasonings for forty years and decided to try their version of coffee substitute. I usually purchase Postum but it got real expensive; $12.00 for eight ounces. I like Roastaroma hot but not cold but tastes differ . Buy this to get off caffeine but don't expect a true coffee flavor. Do some experimenting yourself maybe add some roasted chicory?

You can also add this to pastry recipes before baking like cakes, cookies, muffins, breads, you name it. It will also replace eggs in a recipe. You can google 'flaxseed, egg replacement' to find the correct ratio for your recipe or use mine. For each egg, combine 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed (measure after grinding) with 3 tablespoons of water. Stir well, and place in the fridge to set for 15 minutes.

Passion is a very crisp, tart tea. I don't sweeten my tea, because I think the flavor loses its edge. And Passion is edgy, in a good way. It really lives up to its name.

I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?

I will admit, I didn't want to dump the entire bottle in the icing and I was only making enough icing to frost 12 cupcakes (not a lot).  I did shake the bottle well prior to use and beat it well to mix it well into the icing.  I finally gave up and went with a different company and made different colors for my icing since I could not achieve the white color I was looking for.  I would not recommend this company for coloring and they do have a lot of additives in their products.

3058	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I usually get their Ghost Pepper hot sauce which is much more hot but I decided to get this one this time. It is still delicious and flavorful. But one of the bottle had pepper oil/extraction sitting on top of it. Oh man that was really hot. I tried shaking it to mix it up and all but it still set on top of the sauce. But no complains here.
6900	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	WOW, what a tea! And, I don't just mean the flavor! This tea makes me feel so relaxed almost like I have taken a mild tranquilizer but actually I've only drank herbs that are good for me. I think it may be the Hops herb in there creating that chill-axed mode. When I am feeling stressed out, drained, worrying, etc., etc., etc. from things piling up on my shoulders, I take one or two bags (two if I'm over the top stressed) and some hot almost boiling water and let the tea bag steep for quite a while so I get the full benefits of the tea. I may leave the teabag in for 30 minutes to an hour or more, (or less time if I'm at my wits ends and need it immediately, lol). I never have any adverse reactions to it. Just calm peaceful state is what I am left with. The tea is nothing short of amazing, I kid you not. The only thing is I try not to drink it too late in the evening because it has B-6 and B-12 in it which supports the nervous system and aids depression/anxiety but also may give a little energy as all of the B vitamins do. It has a form a ginseng as well, called eleuthero, which is a balancing herb that tonifies the body and mind so that balances out the B vitamins in the tea. Hard to explain but it sort of relaxes but balances and takes that strained, drained, stressed out feeling away. It's honestly a great tea.
I especially like that this tea is caffeine free and features rooibos tea. Rooibos tea is as healthy as green tea, I've read, and it's far more palatable when combined with these delicious spices.

Sometimes adding a little milk and sugar is good and sometimes just plain is good.  Haven't tried it iced yet but I'm thinking in summer I will.  We recently switched to tea after noon...  replacing the afternoon pot of coffee.  Sometimes I like it so much I think I may give up coffee.  Will have to try the other varieties made by Tazo Chai... there is a wake up one that might completely replace my coffee.
Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.

So I ordered this from Amazon. The tea is spicy without too much cinnamon flavor, as in many spicy teas. You can really taste the other spices. It's really good if you steep the tea in a mug of hot apple cider. Tastes good plain, or with a little honey and milk/creamer.

I usually drink the Sleepytime tea at night but wanted to try some other flavors. The regular Chamomile and Peppermint are pretty "normal" tasting and was very much like other brands i've tried. The Lemon Zinger is great for iced tea or day time since it gives a nice tangy kick. The Honey Vanilla Chamomile has a "warm" feeling and makes my nighttime tea a little more enjoyable and i believe it helps me fall asleep, as does the Chamomile and Sleepytime teas.

Overall, the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals.  As it has less than 200 calories, it can be classified as a snack.  I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I can't leave for lunch.

Many are not much better than ordinary black tea.  The only exception, I've found so far, is Numi Organic Tea Emperor's Puerh, Full Leaf Black Tea.  It has a deep, rich, earthy, malt flavor that I find really appealing.  It may be too strong for some, but at least you know you're imbibing the genuine article.

8092	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I can't get enough of this tea.  I use a boiling water kettle that I purchased here on Amazon to boil 32 ounces of water.  4 bags of this tea, with 3 packets of stevia goes into each pot.  I make two pots at a time, fill them half full with boiling water and let them steep for a couple of hours.  Then each pot fills one half of a liter 'bormoglio' canning bottle, fill the rest with filtered water and in to the refrigerator they go.  It keeps me out of serious trouble with diet colas :)  It's wonderful iced or hot, but this time of the year the refreshing cold tea right from the fridge is perfect and tastes sooooooo good.  No caffeine so great for those of us that are sensitive to caffeine too late in the day.  I finally have something good to offer friends that drop by and they have all commented on how good and refreshing it was.  No aftertaste left when using Stevia as opposed to artificial sweeteners or sugar.

8430	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Our local health food store recently changed their nutritional yeast which I had been buying for over 20 years. I noticed it was darker but didn't think much of it until I tasted it. It was just horrible!!! I tossed it as I knew I would never eat it and had not kept the receipt. So I got online and ordered this yeast from Frontier. Very tasty and though the bag had a hole in it I was quickly sent a replacement bag. I'm really happy with this nutritional yeast and happy to have a new, reliable source for a staple in our house.

UPDATE: A day later (11/25/14), I want to add that I did have some of the Jolokia Hot Sauce 'straight' on some more of my chicken last night. It made my lips tingle nicely, and I could tell it was in my belly--but was it truly HOT? I would say no, not for a person like me. For someone who does not like 'hot' things, probably they would think it is a very hot sauce. For me, the flavor reminded me a bit of Tabasco, but more engaging. I like the flavor, and I like the heat that the sauce does have. But is is a 'killer' sauce? I did drink a little bit of plain, goat milk kefir afterward to settle my stomach, but--again--considering I've found certain raw, crushed garlic cloves to elicit much stronger reactions from me, I'd say the answer is No.

Well, the limas turned out to be barbecued. And they were to die for. Absolutely totally unbelievable flavors and textures. The whole house smelled divine when they were cooking.

It's good too balance out the arginine/lysine level for those who have any of the herpes categories like shingles, cold sores, etc.; i.e., too much arginine causes outbreaks. Popcorn is high in arginine, so the lysine in nutritional yeast balances that out. Everyone is different. I also put it on other things. Another reviewer or commenter said their child had stomach problems. Children generally eat candy. Fruit around the same time will cause pain in the lower digestive system. A vegetarian friend of mine said that when I mentioned I told her I got nutritional yeast. I'm glad I learned that as I had terrible pain in the lower digestive. Problem solved. I told her I had it with spaghetti, so she tried it and loved it too.

Enter carob powder.  Carob is a tropical pod that contains a sweet dark pulp that is very similar in taste and texture to cocoa.  The pulp is dried and then ground into a powder that both appears and tastes similar to chocolate.  It used to be something only available in health food stores.  But now with the advent of the internet, it is widely available here and other places online.  Despite carob powder being very similar to chocolate in calories and fats, it is nonetheless a healthier alternative.  It contains three times the calcium found in chocolate, and more importantly to me, unlike chocolate it contains no caffeine.  This was the true benefit we had in mind in substituting it for the cocoa at trails end each night.  Make no mistake about it, carob is a little sweeter, but definitely not as flavorful as real chocolate ounce for ounce.  Anyone expecting hot chocolate will be disappointed by a straight mug of carob.  It's not only not as tasty, but it remains a little grittier as well when dissolved.  Surprisingly however, my experience back in my sons scouting days proved that the boys got used to the carob powder very quickly, and actually enjoyed its little grittier texture.  As for its flavor, straight carob brewed hot reminded a lot of the scouts of Yoo Hoo drink.  Anyone familiar with the taste of Yoo Hoo can easily imagine carobs flavor.  Even if we decided to spike the carob powder with a little real chocolate, we were still giving the boys a healthier drink, and of course a lot less caffeine. We went through quite a few pounds of it in my sons younger days.  With very few complaints or disappointment.

9994	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I used to have a small baking business. I still bake a fair amount of bread, all with my own personal recipes. I use only quality ingredients, and raw honey for the sweetener. Saf is the best yeast, better than the other two major companies. This is granulated yeast, and you measure it by the teaspoonful. I keep mine in the freezer in a tight plastic container, and use it directly from the freezer, putting the container right back in. I used to buy this yeast from the big famous baking catalog, but I'm so happy that it's available on Amazon. I buy everything from Amazon! At this point in my life, I just use the Zo bread machines to bake my bread. They tell you to put the dry yeast granules on the top of all the other ingredients, but I don't follow those directions. I always "proof" my yeast, which gives it a head start, by letting it sit for 10 minutes or so in the warm liquid with a little bit of honey, before adding the other ingredients. If you're going to go to the trouble of making homemade bread, please use good yeast.
5733	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I've been buying this honey for several years and have to say it's better than anything local or storebought.

I look forward to this Celestial Seasonings specialty every year, as it is normally available only from October to January. The roasted barley malt, chicory root and carob give it a rich, robust flavor--almost like a cup of mocha. Rose hips, natural plum flavor and chamomile flowers add a sweet, fruity taste akin to a fine plum pudding. Ginger root gives it that characteristic holiday zing. Try this full-flavored herbal infusion yourself, and your taste buds will dance with delight!
I have to add that we love the artwork on this box as well.  All the Celestial Seasoning boxes are nice, but this one is exceptionally beautiful.
4392	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla. There is just such a flavor difference. In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor. I use this in banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, custards and ice cream. Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand. In fact, I don't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles. I guess I can't live without it.

7748	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Very distinct blueberry taste. Naturally sweet. Makes a great iced tea. I use 4 bags of this and 4 bags of Lemon Zinger in a gallon of water to make iced tea. No need to heat the water. Just put the bags in water, add sweetener, if desired, stir, and put in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Leave the bags in until the tea is gone, and the tea gets better over time. You can also make straight blueberry tea. When I made it using 8 bags, I found it quite strong. You may get a better taste with 6 bags to a gallon of water. If you love blueberries, you will likely love this tea.
As I looked online, I realized I could end up spending a lot of money and end up with a lot of yeast we didn't like. So I picked up some Bob's in powder form locally, to try.  Didn't care for the smell so I was hesitant about actually using it, but I hadn't quite run out yet. Then wonder of wonders a local store had Frontier mini flake and when I bought some and got it home, I knew it was the mini flake we all knew and loved!
Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.
Would buy again
I'm certain it would perfectly penetrate your popcorn kernels too though.
9766	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love the taste of these. I bought more at a local market and they do not taste as good. I have to wait until it is cooler to order more of these carob chips, because they did arrive with a few melted. This is noted in the sellers details.

Taste-wise, they were similar to vanilla wafers with chunks of baking chocolate.
1296	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The tea is rich and smooth, as a black tea with a bergomot flavor that is very subtle, almost non-existent, so if you go to Earl Grey for the bergomot flavor and aroma, this tea may be disappointing in that regard.
This tea is great hot too with a touch of cream, stevia and nutmeg -- like peach pie dessert!  You can even make peach jello jigglers with it, flavor a smoothie, make ice cream, etc. It is super delicious and super versatile!!!

This is a great way to add omega-3 and fiber to your diet without taking yucky supplements.  From what I understand, flaxseed can be used to replace eggs in recipes.

This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer.

In the past, I've had the powder ("phuket"), and frankly, I'd rather have it in that form.  One thing I thought was odd with this product is that it comes in a plastic bag, so you need to squeeze it out into the jar for storage.  The paste is really thick, so it's a minor chore.  I guess the plastic bag is more secure in shipping than if they covered the inner rim in plastic, like so many other companies do.

Texture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.

We love to use the Barbeque on steaks and ribs or mixed into baked beans.  The Fajita blend is great for making marinades or adding to ground beef for tacos.

I guess Toffee was the best of the worst but my kids love it in Milk so its a treat for them! As I run around the house chasing 3 kids, my coffee gets cold and that is the ultimate test, is it drinkable after its cold.  Im drinking it now and I can do this!  Weight loss here I come!

2453	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I really like this iced tea, as it helps me drink more water, without adding more sugar to my diet. I read another review (not on Amazon) that claimed that it tasted like "unsweetened Kool-Aid" and it absolutely does, but I think that makes it taste really good! I drink this plain or with a packet of True Lemon or True Orange. I was a little worried about the rooibos component, as I don't care for rooibos, but it has a very mild rooibos flavor.
7077	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Once you open the box, the tea smells absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, the flavor isn't as dramatic and loses the little flavor it has only after a short period of time.
I recommend making this less sweet,  then adding some international delight French vanilla creamer.  Oh my GOD
The nuts themselves were of a very pure taste, with absolutely no hint of rancidity, or any "off" flavors. These are lovely just to eat as is, but we particularly enjoyed this entirely new experience of such sweet and fresh-tasting nuts when used in our health Smoothies, and other foods.

1807	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic thanks
7306	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This is the worst tea from Celestial. It tastes straight up like cinnamon and vanilla. If there are any other flavors, they are hidden behind the cinnamon flavor. If you like Big Red Gum or Red Hots in a tea, you may dig it. I honestly think that they were aiming for chai and flopped and renamed it something vague enough to save face.

Also great on tacos! Will be buying these again before long!
917	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Amazing!! I made a crystal ball cake and sprayed it on for a "glassy" finish and it worked beautifully! No weird taste that I could detect and sprayed on smoothly.  I want to try some other colors now!
2968	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to challenge some Asian guys at work.  They laughed at my last sauce.  So I brought this in, they gobbled it up with ease.  They said yeah, it's pretty good.  Then I was mad.  How bad can this stuff be, I thought?  So I poured a couple nice size dabs on some crackers and munched them down.  And I haven't eaten anything hot since.  That was a month ago. This stuff burned all the way down, and out the other side.  What was I thinking.  Holy woah.  I hate those guys.

2871	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I wrote a previous review on this product, and I was pretty well satisfied with these almonds and the supplier. However, this particular batch was awful. In fact it was so bad, it was the exact opposite of my previous review in which the almonds from this supplier were fresh and tasty. So I re-ordered from the same supplier. This batch of almonds were old with little or no taste. Some were so old, they looked like they had decayed and had a bad taste. I am no almond expert, but I do know if the product tastes fresh or not, and this particular batch was anything but fresh. It was like these almonds had been sitting around for years before being shipped, so I won't be ordering from this supplier any time soon. The quality control is lacking. In fairness, every once in a while, I would luck out and find a single and somewhat acceptable almond, but then the rest of the handful would turn on me!! I wish the supplier would have more quality control.

If you check the label, you'll see it's got B vitamins and lots of other good things you need in it. I always have AT LEAST two boxes on hand, so I won't run out. As far as I know, it doesn't cure cancer, but it sure can make the day-to-day stuff we all go through go a LOT easier. Folks I've recommended it to have come back and thanked me PROFUSELY, and everyone likes the taste. It really has seemed to work for everyone just like it does for me.

Enjoy
4844	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The only complaint I have is with the bag.  It is a zip lock top and because the ground flaxseed is so grainy, it gets stuck in the zip top if you pour any out and will not re-close.

259	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.

8029	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea is like drinking a ginger-y lemon drop after you add your choice of sweetener. It is very flavorful and has already become a favorite at our house.  It is also a good tea to mix with black or green tea if you want to add some caffeine.  Since it's caffeine-free, it's very versatile.  It might even make a good lemonade style cold drink.  I'll test it out.
5375	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I use this product in my smoothies and it has an acquired taste but it is actually not that bad
There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy.
4481	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I like this product so far.  I had never used this product before in baking and wanted to give it a try.  So far, I am very pleased with it and may upgrade the rating to 5 stars after trying out a few more recipes with this product.
It's hard to describe but the flaky slightly wet quality makes it delicious to sprinkle on dishes and to cook with. It's really exceptional--I can't really define why, but if you already buy different salts for various parts of cooking and serving food, you'll appreciate the subtle qualities.
6143	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We really like this product.  We've reordered for ourselves and given this honey as a gifts and it is ALWAYS well received.

3873	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These sugar cubes have a unique and delicious flavor.  I bought them specifically for coffee and I find that they add a smooth complexity to my coffee in comparison to the usual C&H Sugar.  I even let one rest on my tongue, just to get the pure flavor.  It was utterly delicious.
While warm, spread over cooled 9 x 9 inch cake.
8852	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Salt is not just salt! This product has beautiful crystal shape and exquisite taste, at least on my palate. Salt dissolved nicely when mixed into food, no gritty mouth feel, this salt also served to create a nice presentation when used as a garnish because of its large thin crystals.

4587	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This was fun.  I bought it just to see what Japanese mayo is like, since I am a big fan of mayo.  This was nice and the packaging was unique and entertaining (a clear very thin plastic bottle with no markings in a labeled bag).  The mayo itself was fine. But, I find that I personally prefer American mayo.  But, that is just a matter of personal taste.

223	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	These candies did not taste fresh and the surface was not shiny as I have seen it when buying this product in the supermarket. They looked like they had been hanging around for quite a while even though the expiration date had not been reached. Because of the odd taste of the product, I threw them away. Won't buy them again on line.
457	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	My husband and I were so disappointed with the flavor of this Aroma Rood blend. We love the Douwe Egderts Pure Gold Coffee. But this we awful and we dumped the whole can into our compost pile.
Just don't do what I did and test it by dolloping  a big blob on a corn chip and chowing down (I was used to less-spicy sauce). Felt like I had a nest of angry hornets in my mouth.

3803	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered this twice.  And both time got the pancake syrup instead of the cane sugar syrup I wanted.  We don't like the pancake syrup as much.  I don't know if it is really different to have partially invented sugar syrup versus cane sugar syrup as ingredient. But it tastes different to us.  I looked back in my past orders.  British delights is the new supplier that sent me the pancake syrup (not as good as the original one).
Shame on them for labeling this "Pure". You got my $10, but I will never buy their products again

My wife ordered this at Christmas; we mix it with natural, dark, crunchy peanut butter for a snack on crackers.  It is absolutely marvelous on leftover toasted biscuit.  Very creamy with a subtle sweetness; great in a cup of coffee.  A far cry from the pesticide & herbicide infested commercially-processed honeys one finds on the grocery shelves.  Simply delightful!

I will be purchasing this product in the future.
2. Pasta tossed with butter, nutritional yeast, and capers. Squeeze some lemon on it, sprinkle minced fresh parsley. Add grilled chicken, if you like. Tastes similar to chicken piccata, but takes a fraction of the time.
1170	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love the flavor of these, but found that it's best dispersed if mixed in the ground beef using a food processor.  There's two (attached) packets: one with flavoring/spices and another that is curing salt.  For me, I use a little over half of the curing salt, but never the full amount.  The jerky is too salty otherwise.  I always keep the finished jerky in the fridge anyway, so I don't need as much salt in mine.
I purchased this item full price as described above. My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way for my thoughts.

1496	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These are just the best - cannot find this variety of pasta anywhere nearby and am so glad to find them available here.  Try them with fresh asparagus and a lemon sauce - you will not be disappointed.
3963	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I love hot sauces. But at first I didn't like this at all. Hard to describe, but it's flavor is peppery like black pepper. Not anything like what I was expecting. It has grown on me. Sometimes I use a little of this mixed with traditional hot sauce. I've found that there are certain uses, like making chili, where I like it fine. I think I'm likely to get another bottle when I'm done with this one. If you want a hot suace with a different flavor, you should try it -- it won't be wasted.
Try it very good in tea and decaf coffee.
9795	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great chocolate alternative. It does not taste exactly like chocolate, but it's close. My body loves carob and this product is good.

6514	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I don't think they make any flavor that's not good, but blueberry is my favorite of the bunch. The other reviews are misleading about one thing, however: not all of them are naturally sweet. You might want to make sure you have your sweetener of choice on hand. I use sucralose.

8277	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I drink a lot of tea and I've tried many different brands and flavors. This is one of my most favorite teas. My only complaint is that the wonderful spice flavor it's quite strong enough for me. I love the smell of the spices; the cinnamon, cloves and other spices. The blend between the apple flavor and cinnamon and spices is about equal; no one over powers the others. Other brands I've tried are way more apple or no apple at all (depending on the brand) but none I've tried have the blend of spices, which I love in this tea. I really think liking the flavor of a tea is personal preference, but If you're a tea drinker I think this one is worth a try.

If you think that the whole flax seed is better for you then think again.  It passes through the human system whole without digesting.  That's why the ground flax seed is the better way to go.  And since I'm eating flax seed, I decided that organic is the only way to go.  Spectrum Essential Organic is always fresh and good quality.

2515	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I use these in place of wheat or any other grains for baking as well as just eating. I soak and dehydrate then run through my processor to make almond meal. They taste great but are very expensive.

8284	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	My rating is unfavorable conditionally: Years ago Kraft packaged a dried cheddar in a gold metallic foil-wrapped shaker tube; Safeway and other stores carried it, they may have called it Kraft American Cheese. At one time the same product was in the same size shaker under Kraft's but the container was blue. Our family used this as an add-on topping for popcorn until Kraft stopped making it; I don't know why.

I love the fine-tipe squirt bottle, especially for Japanese food. It makes it easier to "frost" food as a topping. I don't know that I would call it a replacement for regular American mayonnaise, and I'm not particularly fond of it with meat, like on a sandwich. But it gives a great tangy creaminess to veggies, sushi, omelets, and sauces.
This isn't for the faint of heart.  You bite into it, it bites back.  If you love that kind of thing, give it a try.  If you don't, just stay away.

It's a good vegan alternative for recipes that call for cheese or a cheese flavor.
My fave Lobster Boullion Paste hack is a warm seafood dip. Make it in a mini crockpot. Use 1 bar Neufchatel cheese, 1 can crabmeat with juice, 1 shallot minced fine, and a combination of 1 tbsp each lemon juice and white vermouth plus 1 teaspoon lobster paste whisked together. I also like to add Korean red pepper flakes. If you don't want that kind of spicy, use black pepper to taste instead. Heat, stir, and enjoy.

5318	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I normally purchase the Yoga Organic Raspberry leaf tea-but couldn't find the multi pack so I ordered this in the multi pack. I buy it b/c it tends to help with all sorts of menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes. I drink about 3 cups a day. However, the Yoga brand tastes very mild while this one is strong. I've explained to people that it tastes like what I would imagine a tree tastes like. Sounds funny but to me it tastes like wood might taste. Nothing offensive, just not what you would drink for the sheer pleasure of it. This tea however does taste strong, maybe it has a root type of taste to it? Yuck, not for me.

9982	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I was suspicious at first because having used Truvia before, I noticed the packets were much lighter than the Truvia packets. The Truvia packets are 3.5gms each but the Stevita are only 1gm each. However, they sweeten just as well. Be careful not to over do it with Stevia sweeteners as this will give you a bitter taste. Both brands dissolve much better in hot beverages verses cold ones.

The Jerky Cannon came with one packet of a spice mix and we thought it was pretty good.

I will absolutely buy this again, as it isn't a product commonly found in my local Save A Lot here in eastern Kentucky.  I top a rice cracker with a dollop of cream cheese and top it with a small amount of this caviar.  Ok, not really a "small" amount.  A fairly large amount.  I'm addicted to it!

And you can use it when cooking on the grill, in the oven, on the stovetop, or in the barbecue pit. In a word, it's versatile. But not just that. The taste is great and provides a natural smoky flavor to whatever you're cooking. We've tried it on a number of occasions, and we've never been disappointed. The recommended serving size is 1/4 tsp., which means that a little goes a long way.

LOVE a light sprinkling of this on my dairy treat... or even rice pudding... with a little squirt of that

The suggested serving size is a little small as we got 3 reasonable size servings instead of the four indicated on the packet. We also discovered that if you over whip it, the mousse mix makes a nice topper as well.

You don't need to use very much and then your craving is filled. I am not a doctor but I have heard from reliable sources that unfiltered raw Honey helps reduce seasonal allergies due to yourbody getting some of the pollen that the bees have on them and then they put it in the honey. That pollen in the honey is like a healthy way to train your body how to fight the pollen. I have been doing many things to be more healthy in in the last 8 years but I can confidently say that I have not had any allery responses in more that 2 years.

Well then, I went to try and design a sugar free pasta sauce and I used stevia. The surprise was that now I could leave out the salt too, and not even miss it.

I was actually impressed with their large size, shape and foliage. They were intended as gifts for family and friends. After a couple of weeks, they all started losing their leaves. Upon closer inspection it was evident that they were infested with some type of crawling mite, aphid or whatever. I quarantined them from my other houseplants which displayed no similar problems. My Fukien Bonsai are now void of all leaves --- since Brussel's Nursery/Amazon will not accept returns at this stage, I'm trying to revive them with TLC.

Then you can worry about it going bad on the way to you & also buy a jar of Raw honey to take it with..... ALSO , if you do choose to purchase the pure fresh RJ, which is great, make sure the company your buying from PACKS IT WITH FROZEN/ICE PACKS! They may be melted by the time it arrives to you thats ok but it has a much, much better chance of not spoiling /going rancid on the way!  Reputable dealers will always cold pack fresh RJ! Even a 1 oz jar! In hot months, if possible, buy it from a whole foods or vitamin store near you. That way you don't chance spoilage . Whole foods keeps this brand in a open cooler in the vitamin aisles . Even in the store they KEEP FRESH RJ COOL & temperature controlled! Except If it's mixed into honey ( like this one ) it will be on a shelf as the RJ is kept preserved naturally by the honey~ Though even in the honey, if you heated over a certain temp you'd begin to destroy the benefits of the RJ. I try not to even add this into tea or coffee ( I use my regular raw honey or Agave ) because the heat of the hot liquids can destroy , breakdown , lessen the wonderful benefits in the RJ. I will swallow a tsp on its own before or after hot coffe, tea to be sure. I don't want to waste my $ getting a raw, unfiltered, low/no heat used product then destroy all its greatness by adding into Hot liquids myself!

Nutritional yeast is tasty enough to be used as a condiment, and vegans like myself use it as a cheese substitute in vegan dishes. To create a vegan parmesan cheese, I ground up raw cashews and mixed the cashew powder with this nutritional yeast. It tastes delicious.

Dried, powdered root and rhizomes, 2 to 3 grams per day, are commonly used. Alternatively, 300 to 400 mg per day of concentrated solid extract standardized on eleutherosides B and E can be used, as can alcohol-based extracts, 8 to 10 ml in two to three divided dosages. Kan Jang is a formula combining an andrographis extract with an eleuthero extract providing 2 to 2.4 mg eleutherosides daily. Historically, eleuthero is taken continuously for six to eight weeks, followed by a one- to two-week break before resuming.
985	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This was my first foray into gel food coloring. I use it to dye cookies, cake batter, and icings, which it works wonderfully for. You only need a tiny bit to get bold color (which doesn't fade in the oven) and it doesn't change the taste or texture of your baked goods. I would highly recommend this, especially if you've never used gel before. The difference is amazing. Be careful with it, though-- it's also quite good at coloring hands and counter tops!

I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255vf: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

This is not at all to imply that ALL the negative reviews on this product are false.  I'm just pointing out the ones that fall under " error of the buyer not the product" . If you think it's a bad product, that's fine. But don't say it's not real, it's fake and or misleading because you failed to read the listing in full or just read the big words " ROYAL JELLY" and then didn't bother to read anything further on the label or description ( like "in honey"...) .

Since its a powder you can much more easily make an accurate measurement of how much you want to add to your stock. And as a powder, it contains slightly less sodium than the familiar cubed bullion.

It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States.

5697	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by "thinly?" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.

7768	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Ahh, Bengal Spice, it's been a favorite of mine for a couple decades now. The warm spices; Cinnamon, Clove, Black Pepper, and more give it a slight bite, but Celestial Seasoning's version of this Indian Chai is also rather sweet, unlike other Indian Spice teas I've tried. I'm not actually sure what makes it sweet as there aren't any sweeteners added, but I don't need to add sugar to this at all. Milk or creamer of choice makes this a delicious treat. I enjoy it in the evenings either with a snack or as a snack by itself! I love that it's caffeine free so I can enjoy it any time I feel like a cup.
Prices can always vary in the Amazon Market Place
This particular blend includes several other spices, I would guess maybe it is chai, and when I open the box I am almost positive that I smell black pepper.  I wish they made this in a loose tea form.  When I am going to have it I do tear open the tea bag and pour the leaves into my steeper to get the full effect.  Don't expect this to taste like chocolate milk, you will be disappointed.  The flavor is unique as is the consistency.  Without the sweetener it's not as flavorful for me.  I have stashed some of this at the top of the cupboard to keep as my comfort drink on a day when I just need an emotional lift.

I was worried this would be too thick or crystalized for baking, but it's soft enough to scoop out and measure. Tastes fabulous in tea. The only kind of honey we'll use from now on.
2681	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This stuff tastes delicious. I wake up to a couple cups of it every day. I'm no tea snob and my tastebuds are unrefined. I drink it with 2 spoons of sugar and a tiny dash of powdered creamer first thing of the day. It's really good, just try it.
2825	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Reasonably priced, fast shipping, and VERY fresh--very few nuts to throw away after soaking (which isn't always the case with raw nut purchases, particularly cashews). In my experience, Food to Live has been a consistently great supplier of raw, organic nuts.
1275	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I would give this delicious tea 5 stars were it not for a 'natural' flavor added to the tea.  I am not sure, and I do not want to start any conflict with Harney & Sons, inc.  I love their teas, have for decades.  My body systems have become more "reactive" to food stuffs that never gave me a problem before, Harney  'E.G.S.' Tea is one of those items.  After 1 cup I started to break out in giant, angry red blotches on my face, neck, and dcolletage.  I thought it was a delayed reaction to something I ate earlier.  So, I tried my second cup, at which point the severe HIVES and angry rashes started faster, were much larger, and also painful, but horrifically itchy.  My delicate facial skin the following day was rough, with the actual tactile feeling of burlap combined with sandpaper, but worse.  At which point I knew this delicious tea was no longer my "boyfriend' and the break-up would be immediate.

This is USUALLY the best price here at Amazon but check your local Vitamin Shoppe as they have it on sale periodically.  This is also the best neutral taste ,... kinda of like creamy oatmeal. IT IS GREEN. I use a simple 16oz blender bottle with 50% water, 50% plain soymilk, 2 scoops.  It is naturally sweet so be aware if you mix this with any sweetened products it may be too much. I am a diabetic and this has a very LOW impact on my levels . I am a big boy that enjoys Eating REAL food .but this really tides me over for breakfast every morning.

8891	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am really enjoying using this salt.  It has a great flavor.  I would highly recommend it. The shipping time was quite long, however.
I made a wonderful  salad dressing using this as a base with olive oil , herbs, and garlic. The black vinegar seemed to give a less overpowering sharp vinegary flavor to the dressing and let the garlic and herb taste come through.

I love this particular tea.  It is perfect because of all the lovely flavors.  They are all rich and fruity - the perfect amount of flavor.  Like I said earlier, the peach is my favorite flavor.

And let me tell you they just melt in your mouth. Kringles are big business in Wisconsin's fifth largest city and several bakeries ship these tasty treats to loyal fans all across America and beyond.

2488	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I never would have thought I would get excited over molasses. It was always one of things in the cupboard that rarely made an appearance on the counter unless it was needed for some gingerbread baking recipe. Funny, it was baking that led me to try it in other applications. I was working on creating a cookie that didn't require much white sugar, and took a chance at using some of the contents from the dust covered jar of molasses (another popular brand). It tasted great, so much so that it became my "secret ingredient". One day not long after, I had a craving for molasses. Weird, right? I tried a spoonful, but didn't really care for the taste by itself. I then added it to my coffee and found that it lent an intriguing flavor. After all the NON gingerbread baking with my new found ingredient, I didn't have much molasses from the initial jar left. I don't think I ever saw what an empty jar of molasses looked like.. ha.  So when that was empty, I made purchase of this Plantation brand, which happened to be the only kind of molasses in the store I was in that time. It was less than $5 for 15 oz. I brought it home and tried a small spoonful. It just opened up my senses and something about it really appealed to me. It tasted real, like it was something I should be eating daily. I then added it to my coffee, and was amazed/delighted/stoked about how well it went with my coffee (which I drink very dark/bold, and now also primarily drink coffee alternatives--which I have reviewed); like it was made to go together: Coffee, Molasses and..Me!  (I told you upfront that I was excited over this stuff.) With this newly discovered affinity towards molasses, I had to research to see if there were any benefits to consumption. Well, indeed there is. There is no shortage of good information by placing these words into a search engine: "blackstrap molasses benefits", and what blackstrap molasses is versus molasses.

After I got home from vacation I was bummed that I didn't buy more.  I honestly can't believe I found it on Amazon! I will definitely buy this again. Try it you'll love it.
They turned out great! The best thing is that it doesn't have any MSG, nor coloring

6595	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I needed this (along with other ingredients) for making home made gripe water. Worked like a charm for a fraction of the store cost and no artificial stuff added.  I also use just this alone for my kids when their stomachs are upset. Nice alternative to store meds with artificial ingredients and dyes. I drink it myself because it tastes amazing. I add local honey and it's perfect.
Anyways; I just set up a small bar and wanted a fancy sugar to keep in my equally fancy sugar bowl.  Old Fashioned's are a favorite here, and as much as I love this sugar, I have to disagree with the other reviews about this being perfect for cocktails/cold drinks.  The cube itself will soak up bitters and will crush easy enough under the light touch of a pestle but these cubes are made of large coarse sugar crystals.  They do not dissolve easily or quickly (it's hard to say they managed to dissolve at all) in cold liquids; even with a lot of additional pestle grinding, aggressive stirring, and patience/time (about an hour).

7095	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I love this base for every kind of soup I make, besides adding to pasta water, vegetables (if I boil them), and any kind of slow cooker dish. That said, the jar I received was almost dried out, although still useable. Considering it's half the price at the local organic food store (the whole paycheck one), I'll make the trip to the store instead of risking another expensive, mediocre jar.
Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans.  Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better.

5256	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I have no complaints about quality of this product. The nutritional value of this Brewers Yeast is outstanding but it has an awful aftertaste to me. I had a difficult time getting it down. Masking it with protein and stevia helped a lot. Still the aftertaste was really off putting despite what it says. So in this case, that's what you get when nothing is added. I still wouldn't discourage someone from trying it. Maybe you won't mind the aftertaste or won't mind being a little creative to disguise it. For me though it was too overwhelming. So I wouldn't buy again.

After multiple attempts at this, it never totally softened. Doesn't appear to be crystallized, just has a very waxy texture. My friends raise bees and I've eaten a lot of honey, seen what it looks like fresh from the hive  and this stuff is unlike anything I've ever experienced. The taste is okay but I'm not sure what to do with it. . I'm thinking about just throwing it away. I showed this stuff to my beekeeper friends and they were also very suspicious too. We all agreed this is not pure raw honey. If i knew where to get it analyzed by a lab, I'd pay to do it.

7931	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I had a box of this tea for weeks I hadn't tried until one late night when I couldn't sleep I got up and made a cup. I was astonished by the sweetness, though I rarely have sweet foods so may have found this sweeter than others would, but did a web search to make sure there was no sweetener. It maybe the combination of flavors that gives it such a sweet impact on the palate. This is now my favorite herb tea, and I enjoy several cups a day, or if a craving hits I drink this tea instead. I find the cinnamon taste  to be just right, since I didn't like strong cinnamon teas before. The cost through Amazon is a bit less than in my local market unless they have a sale. I use about 10oz of water per tea bag, let steep a couple minutes to release all the flavor.
So maybe everyone doesn't experience that, but from that experience alone, I am no longer going to consume sauces that aren't all natural.
Each Kringle serves 8 to 12 people and my experience has been that they freeze quite well. Just a couple of weeks ago I sent a co-worker a Kringle to express my sincere thanks for a profound act of kindness. She loved it! Meanwhile, I showed up to Christmas dinner last year with a Raspberry Kringle under tow. Everyone enjoyed it and remarked that it was fun to sample a regional treat from another part of the country. If you are looking for a different sort of birthday, anniversary or Christmas gift then I urge you to consider one of these O & H Danish Kringles. By the way, they are also available in two packs right here on Amazon. You just might start a brand new tradition in your family. Highly recommended!

This is the most delicious honey that I have ever tasted. The texture is not sticky like the bear honey, it spreads on toast like butter. I have put it in my tea and coffee and I can't say enough about it. It is so worth paying a little extra for this. It also gives me peace of mind to know that it is organic. I will never go back to the bear honey again. I highly recommend this honey.

3103	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	"Dave's Insanity Sauce" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.

A quick web search will turn up some fantastic ways to eat each cheese, ranging from marinated in olive oil and herbs (Idiazabal), to served with dried fruits and nuts (Mahon), diced and added to a tomato-based salad (Murcia al Vino), and even coated and fried (Manchego). I definitely recommend picking things that will highlight the flavors of each cheese rather than obscuring them, as these are truly delightful.
Can be had with or without milk, with or without sugar.

My little guy marvels at how nicely sweet it is even without adding honey. My grown-up friends have been amazed by this as well.

Can't wait until this summer to enjoy it iced!

This honey may not cause any problems for many, but I wanted to share this experience, as I think allergic reactions are a very important consideration that should be factored in prior to purchase (and some may not think of it, as I didn't). I did read that many people "power through" tolerable or minor symptoms (that "may" eventually subside) to enjoy the possible health benefits associated with consuming bee pollen and/or raw honey. I considered doing that, but I am more inclined to think that pain, discomfort, and/or other negative effects (with the exception of sore muscles from a good workout), are pretty good indications/signs/signals our body is giving us to let us know it doesn't like something  we are doing to it...I'm very compelled to listen.:)

743	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am CONSTANTLY baking and this icing always gets awesome remarks. Most people are convinced it is homemade! It is light, fluffy and hard not to eat before you get it onto the cake!!

This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring.  One small package has lasted us a year and a half, using it a couple of times a month, and I am just now nearly done with it.  No one has ever noticed a beet flavor in the finished products because you only need a tiny amount.
8446	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great flavor, great price. Wish I had bought more.

8091	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I buy this flavor by the case - it has a very sweet, nutty, cake-like flavor which is great on it's own or even better, I combine it with another tea and it's even better. My favorite companion to "True Blueberry", making my tea taste and smell like a blueberry muffin hot from the oven. This is great stuff, I'm glad even when I can't find it in stores in the summer, I can order it here.
4117	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The flavor of this cheesecake mousse is outstanding. This product contains real cheese powder and I love it. I do not make the mousse mix; I put 2 or 3 tablespoons of the dry mix in my vanilla whey-protein drink each morning and it's so good that I bounce out of bed every morning and (well, after doing morning-type things like washing, etc.) almost run for the kitchen to make this drink and take my vitamins. What a treat! I know it contains Splenda, and Splenda gets a bad review in certain circles, but 2 or 3 tablespoons of this mousse mix ups my drink from good to heavenly so it stays. Please, eDietShop, keep selling this and I will keep buying it. Cheers!

3829	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased the Lyle's Golden Syrup because my grocery store quit selling it and this seemed a great alternative. The package of 6 bottles arrived this morning and upon opening the poorly packed box I found a bottle had been broken in transit. Had there been proper packaging I'm certain I wouldn't be frustrated. Hopefully, this will be rectified or I will cancel my subscription to this item. I pay for 6 bottles I expect to receive 6 undamaged bottles.
2791	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I just got it in the mail and immediately put eight bags in two quarts of filtered cold water.  Left it in the fridge for about 3 hours and then sweetened with Stevia and it is delicious.  I could have taken it out at about 30 minutes but I wanted it strong.  We will be buying the other flavors!!!  So raspberry and delicious.  I know we are going to go thru two pitchers a day!!  Bring back the lemon flavor!!!

This is a tea you sip slowly, because it is just too intense to drink fast.  Though it is hot, it tends to create a cooling sensation from the mint as it slides down my throat, which is nice.  It can help clear sinuses, too!
8140	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Delicious variety of flavorful fruit teas. Perfect to tuck into a tea-lover's gift basket! I also add one or two bags to a pitcher of iced tea for a refreshing flavor change.
7897	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Celestial Seasonings Chamomile tea is the most intensely flavored I've tried. Sourced from Egyptian Chamomile, the aroma and flavor are concentrated, naturally sweet, and densely flowery. We have found this to aid in relaxation and even peaceful sleep. I've found it helpful combating colds and flu, and calming allergies. Invariably, Celestial Seasonings provides consistently excellent quality, holding to extremely high standards. Enjoy!
It was so wonderful to see the familiar boxes with rusks in our pantry and we just about inhaled it! It's similar to biscotti  which is a sweetened bread that's cut in slices and then dried out in a low temp oven). Ouma Rusks aren't as sweet and it's bigger than biscotti usually are though, but we prefer it like that.
9288	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The salt itself is a good sea salt but in my opinion, not that much different than other sea salts I've bought and tried. It has a clean taste and the grains are a perfect size. My only complaint, is the use of the word "Canister" in the description. It's purely my interpretation but that leads me to believe it is a can of some sort. It's not, it's just cardboard. That, and it's "eye catching container" description on the selling page feels misleading. I never mind paying more for a condiment when it comes in a fancy canister and I erroneously believed this was one of those times.

834	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Of all of the Luna Bar flavors, the Chocolate Peppermint Stick is my favorite.  It is very minty and easily chewable.  You don't have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it.  The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty.  If I had not looked at the wrapper, I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar (try doing that with other protein/meal replacement/nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration.)  There is also no vitamin taste.
6589	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	While the tea isn't bad, the issue with Celestial Seasonings now is the tea bag itself.  I have noted for a good while how poorly their tea bags have been constructed.  Cheaper...Cheaper...Cheaper for years now. Out of the sampler pack, I have had several bags that can't hold up to steeping and the bag breaks and spills the leaves all over the cup. I'm done with Celestial Seasonings because of their bags.  Also, I do like tea bags that have a string attached so you are able to pull out the bag without a spoon.  That's the one thing I never really cared for with Celestial Seasongings

I love the taste of regular tea but I don't appreciate drinking things that don't hydrate me... so this is wonderful to make up big pots of tea but also be hydrating instead of using a dialectic.  Tastes ALMOST identical to Liptons or other teas.  Highly recommend!

3096	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.

My aunt kept telling me about this tea then one weekend she came to visit and I tried it and completely fell in  love! It tastes amazing. I honestly can't tell that it is in fact a tension tamer helper, but it really has a great flavor. I always use liquid Stevia vanilla flavor for any tea or coffee I drink but this tea really doesn't require any sweetness in my opinion and one other reason I love it so much is because I can just put it in a cup and have refill after refill of the same bag. The healthy skin tea I was telling you about (and most teas I have come across) you can have 2 good quality cups of tea on 1 bag tops, but the tension gamer I can refill and refill with hot water from my kettle and it has never tasted deluted. I only use a bag for a day then throw it away or sometimes 2 of I decided to put a teaspoon of coconut oil in my tea. (If I drink my tea with coconut oil then let it sit and get cold the coconut oil hardens and doesn't look good, so it's a mental thing for me to replace it but with more hot water I think it would actually be fine)

And if you've been getting the cheap stuff at the grocery store, you are in for the vanilla heaven surprise of your LIFE!  I bought this with one intention - I wanted to make vanilla whipped cream for pancakes and waffles (YUM!), and found that vanilla extract affected the flavor and texture of the cream with the alcohol taste.  This has no alcohol and is much more concentrated in flavor and body.  So . . . .after having a culinary orgasm with the vanilla whipped cream waffle . . . . I poured the rest of my mix into my fresh roasted coffee.  O.  M.  G.  To die for.  Holy crap, there IS a food god and she (yes, she) blessed all of us with this amazing product.  Ok, so then my wife and I both got a bit obsessed with this vanilla flavor and started experimenting and putting it in everything.  Here are some other uses we didn't think of at first but turned out to be absolutely AWESOME:
8747	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Excellent fine salt for popcorn and peanuts. I love salt and love putting this on chips, and almost everything.
5407	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I just wanna try it out and compare it with my regular oolong tea that I usually drink..It's good, subtle taste but single use bag, unlike my old brand it was stronger like black tea and can make up to 3 mugs of tea.
3620	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mayonnaise with a true, authentic tabasco flavor. It saddens me that it is not available at my local grocery. It really brings out the flavor of a great sandwhich with just the right amount of heat
To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese, so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta (uncooked) -- but you can experiment for yourself.
140	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.
826	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great flavor!
8038	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	You'll either love it or hate it. It's a strong tea but I can use less sugar. I also add cinnamon and or milk to vary the flavor.
665	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	didnt use it yet but they're oretty
I suggest you use your regular salt for cooking and have this as the salt you may add right before serving. It seems to me a waste to use this in a recipe but great for salting right before eating.
310	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go...... who always has time for a sit down breakfast? ... Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD !
9430	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	So fresh and tasty not overly sweet, very soft perfect texture, will be ordering more. arrived quickly.
4543	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product.
Really disappointed.
4994	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I use in my Nutribullet with my green smoothies almost daily. Not gritty
8676	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Very good taste.

7380	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	This is a very pleasant tea mix but, every single one of Celestial's tea flavors that include cinnamon, there is always way to much and it ruins what would be an excellent drink. If i wanted a cinnamon only flavored drink I'd make one myself. They seem to get turned on by adding too much cinnamon and this flavor is no different. The cinnamon washes out every other flavor.
9416	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	nise

1373	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Nice flavoring for dishes. Give it a try, not just for Oriental food.
8621	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Make sure you read the size this is a very small box
906	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for an odd reason: to identify medication.  I currently have 9 different medications that are all round shaped and white.  Some have lettering, some have a score line, some have absolutely nothing.  Since I divvy up my pills in one of those weekly boxes, it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish one pill from the other--so I thought of using this frosting spray.
3699	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love them.
7204	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	LOVE IT
*Easy pour container has Amazon Prime for fast shipping and reliable product quality

That being said, this one is still good for those times when I don't want to go all out so it's not without its merits. But if you're looking for ultimate in heat, this is not it.
6128	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is very good honey, best I ever tasted! the honey is soft and even texture and easy to scoop out with wide knife or sharp spoon.
Pets with heads are overrated.
Blueberry -> Cherry -> Raspberry -> Multiberry -> Peach (yucky aftertaste on this one).

First time I have tried this and I love it.
4285	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Loved!
1416	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location.  I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock, but I don't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store, plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me.  I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product, but there it is.

2475	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Very good for the price point
For the most part, it has good ingredients although neither of us like using anything soy, this states to have soy lecithin in it as a flavoring. I wish the company would either leave that part out or switch to sunflower lecithin which would be healthier. Nonetheless, it probably doesn't have much of that soy lecithin in it and my husband really enjoys this tea. I'm sure we will continue buying it as the need arises.
1635	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Good Seller, the best pickles made!
7462	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I like this for just having a hot drink available at work or camping.
9227	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I have used this so for many years and it has always been excellent. However, this time it was totally different and the salt was ground much finer a lot like Morton table salt or maybe even finer yet. But the real disappointment was, the flavor wasn't there what happened to your salt?
3023	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.

3316	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Wow, Jelly Belly licorice, my favorites, in a large supply for a good price. The real deal, fresh and yummie. I have a candy dispenser and this works great.
8146	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't find this product anywhere and my 86 year old mother kept talking about the days when she could make cheese popcorn.  She has jars of this cheese all over the house now and is happy as a jay-bird in whistling time.
4961	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The product is everything that I thought it would be and it arrived as expected.
Stomach upset (dyspepsia)...Some research shows that taking turmeric by mouth might help improve an upset stomach.

1494	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Have tried the store found brands and the noodles have not held up to my recipes. These held up and tasted very good.  I've found a new and true pappardelle egg noodle. Thank you!
4381	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Some vanilla extracts taste more like alcohol than vanilla, but not this one. This is an essential pantry item for those who love true vanilla flavor.
I like this far better than just the runny vanilla (that is commercially produced)
No matter. I stuffed the carcass full of Peeps and Reese's pieces, and strung it up by the legs in a tree in the yard. The kids took turns whacking at it with barbecue tongs until it all came tumbling out, like some sort of hairless Easter party pinata.
3341	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These licorice jelly beans are the best.  They were super fresh with super licorice taste. Even though they cost a bit more, they are so worth it if you're looking for really great flavor. They can't be beat!!
137	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative. They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this...I am "returning" item. I am trying to avoid my children's exposure to yellow 5, red 40 and so on...I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause. This may be fine for someone that doesn't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family.

7339	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Not what I thought I ordered but good tea.
1327	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I am very happy that I was able to purchase this product. The shipping was pushed back so I have to remember buying before running out of this.
1982	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	It takes 2 teabags of this to make a single 12-oz cup of tea steeping for 5 minutes. Overpriced and expensive tea -- that doesn't even taste very good and has no fragrance whatsoever. I'm going to post this review to every TAZO AWAKE listing on amazon.com that I can find, so others aren't taken in by Tazo's hype. (Purchased at my local grocery store. Not an expired package.)

5224	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	So, here's a true story for you. One day, I wanted my husband to put my shelves up for me in my craft room (due to an unfortunate incident that shall remain unnamed, I am no longer allowed to use his drill). He did not want to do this, because it involved measuring, finding studs, and was generally boring and tedious.
9748	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love it
9625	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We've used  this  mustard for decades, literally. It is one of the finest mustards in the world and you won't be disappointed.
I have purchased most of the available mint teas on the market plus choose it whenever available in restaurants and have learned that Mint Magic is the best mint tea anywhere, plus it is 100% caffeine free.
1420	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Makes any asian side dishes delicious, a must have. I took a star only because it's not spicy at all. Its all about the aroma and flavor it gives, very distinct.
1605	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These were a gift to a cookie monster of a guy... He loved them. Delivery was a little delayed but the address was very rural, so it's not unexpected.
By this time I was absolutely no use to him as I writhed in silent mirth. Would you like to try some he asked which sent me into paroxysms of uncontrollable hilarity.

Celestial Seasoning Brews Up Teapots of  Environment Responsibility
I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers 
No other cons to mention I love this stuff and can't believe i didn't know about this till now.
I definitely don't recommend this product.  Now I'm stuck with four big boxes of it. Maybe I can use it as sachet in my kids' sock drawers or in between sheets in the linen closet or something like that.  It really does smell nice when it's dry in the bag in the box. Just don't drink it.
6062	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What an awesome treat!  My first taste - I'm in heaven!  Enjoying a small amount of this takes away my craving for other bad choices like, chips, chocolate and cookies - you know the three C's.  I love real maple sugar candy and this is as close to that consistency as I could find.  Thank you clever bees for making the world's perfect food!  I'll be back again and again for more!
8467	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This is pretty good quality

2268	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	The Bonsai came in superb condition and I followed religious followed the care booklet. The tree gradually deteriorated over the first month and the leaves began to drop of. This was followed by an infestation of black fly. It was at this time that I decided to move the plant outdoors. We live in the Pacific Northwest and the temperatures are relatively mild. I next contacted the vender and he said that the tree could survive temperatures in the high 40's at night. The tree is slowly recovering outside.
7998	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I tried this about 10 years ago and I fell in love with it.  All of a sudden it was no where to be found.
9198	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	In response to "I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being?"  I think it does!  Whenever I drink this tea I feel happy and warm all over (especially now, since we're under 18+ inches of snow).  The tea is yummy.  It took a little getting used to since I'm a devout coffee drinker, but now my morning isn't complete without a cup of Tazo's Green Tea.
342	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	very convenient and practical to have all those sprinkle in one place, it when on easy and that we like when you are cooking with kids

128	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor. I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand. Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types.
1616	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Its about time Spanish products started getting their due.. The most famous (rightly so) Spanish cheese, Manchego, is world class, and is really tough to beat.  Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.  Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores.  They have great specials and offers, so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan.  Regardless, Manchego cheese is so good, you'll undoubtedly be back for more.. and more..  and more.

2405	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	yummy
Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

I've ordered other nut etc products that were awful so these were a nice CHANGE!!!!
3252	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Very fresh!  Arrived very quickly
5296	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am an avid tea drinker so I've tried hundreds of flavors and different brands. As far as detox teas go, this one is my favorite. Many detox teas have a laxative effect which I don't feel is necessary (if that's what you're aiming for, they have a smooth move tea that works just as well). This has a delicious and light fruity flavor and is absolutely delicious whether hot or iced. I drink a cup every other day now simply because I love the flavor. I can't say whether or not it "detoxed" my body, because I tend to eat pretty clean, but it definitely had no negative side effects which is always a plus.
830	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The best Luna bar so far. They come as close to the girl scout cookies, Samoas. This bar is healthy and DELICIOUS! These two adjectives aren't usually used together when describing a health bar. I slightly heat this bar up in the microwave (at 10 seconds) and drink a glass of milk with this bar.
8403	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	They taste strong. I like to chew on them during the day after I eat for a cleaner mouth feeling.

5085	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I throw into anything like yogurt, cottage cheese, cereal and even on fruits for my toddler.  She is easily constipated so I add it to her foods and she has been a lot more regular now.  I also enjoy it in my own foods.  I recommend it!
1522	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love brie was good thank u.
This is the plain Pommery mustard.  It also comes in Firemens (spicy). . .  .Green Peppercorn. . . Royal with cognac (my favorite, actually, but a bit pricy) . . . . Honey Mustard.  If you're looking for a smooth mustard, then try Pommery Moutarde du Lion.  This mustard is what you think of when you hear the words Dijon Mustard.
9150	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This salt is a great finishing salt for sweet or savory foods.  It flakes well between the fingers and has a pure taste.  I buy on amazon because it beats out my local grocery price any day.  I will be buying again.

7845	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great flavor!
9540	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Tasted terrible. Had a plastic taste to it. I'm assuming it got that flavor because of the baggie it came in. Bought it to color frosting for my son's cake. It made it a funny color and the frosting had to be thrown out because of the taste. I used a recipe from a good natural foods cookbook to make the frosting, and it tasted good before I added the beet powder. I added it per instructions.
3857	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This sauce is very hot, and I LOVE IT. I love spicy food and this has a big kick even with a small amount and great flavor, I have also tried ghost pepper sauce, which is very hot, but loses the flavor. I add this to the top of my burritos, I put it on tacos, and also it is a great addition to Hot wings! if I make a pan of hot wings I mix about 6 drops of this to a package of wings and it gives it a great kick with extra flavor. VERY GOOD, VERY HOT. I have tried many other hot sauces as well and they just don't have that kick I am looking for while maintaining the flavor of the dish. you only need a few drops, so the bottle lasts awhile, Overall great product, it is made with Habenero peppers and has a wonderful flavor, I have even brought some with me to mexican restaurants in my purse to spice up my dish!
8524	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	If I had realized this had folic acid in it I would not have bought it. See article pertaining to folic acid/folate and breast and prostate cancer  https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/folic_acid_dangers_and_prenatal_vitamins.aspx  This is a synthetic form. It is fine to get folate in the food we eat naturally.  I know I was surprised too. I just don't want to take the chance.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

7710	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have had some other peach teas before that I didn't like, but I got this in a Celestial Seasonings sampler pack and so I gave it a try.  I put some hot water in my mug, over the tea bag, then had to leave my office for a bit.  When I got back to my office, it smelled WONDERFUL in there.  That was a great sign.  (It's a small office but the scent filled the whole room.)
8823	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This salt really enhances the flavor of nuts and popcorn. I see these as opposites of a coin and how could it do it. It does it very well. It's amazing how well it clings. I haven't tried it on air blown popcorn, but on regular popcorn and nuts, it's a clinger

2796	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea, Sweet Coconut is my favorite decaf tea. I drink it all day. Until I found this tea, I thought I would never find a decaf Chai that was full of flavor. If you love Chai, this is a winner!
They can say no ADDED MSG, because they add it in a different form than pure MSG

I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!!
5486	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I can't complain about the quality of the product. It's well packaged and contains exactly what the product description says it does. It tastes ok (considering Royal Jelly is not exactly an appealing flavor for my taste buds). The product is mixed with honey which helps make it more palatable. I feel great since I have been using this product. I can't really be sure if it is due to the royal jelly, but if it's not then what an awfully strange coincidence.

The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.
I've used a couple other Products from YS and both were of the Highest quality.

2181	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Has good flavor and serious heat, not to apply directly to food, more to add heat and flavor when mixed with something. I mix it with salsa, beef jerky marinade ect. don't need much to do the trick.

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.

6141	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE THIS STUFF!  It seemed costly, but, I am so glad I tried it. It is a firm form of the tastiest honey I have ever had. I spoon it right out of the jar and into my mouth. If you need it to be softer you just warm it up. It's not crystalized like when honey sits for too long.

1/21/2018  I now notice that Feridies is a couple of dollars per can cheaper than Than Royal Oak.  However, the latest two cans i received of the Feridies contain smaller peanuts than ever before.  Yes, small nuts have a different bite than the larger ones.  Well, back to Royal Oak.
The others has a slight vitamin taste which doesn't bother me, but I just love peppermint. It tastes fantastic, each bite gives you the sweet minty taste with a bit of chocolate taste. I could gobble mine down in a few seconds and it's easy to chew which helps my teeth. Probably one of the best tasting out of the Luna and Cliff bars. I even like this peppermint better than the GeniSoy one. It didn't melt in my messenger bag which is a benefit, but I'm thinking about keeping an ice pack just in case, but it's nearing winter.

Most almonds are pasteurized with PROPYLENE OXIDE other producers used other chemicals/poisons. Propylene oxide is a known carcinogen, and it is on California's Proposition 65 list of chemicals that cause cancer and reproductive harm. This means that the majority of almonds sold within the U.S. are not only nutritionally neutralized, but they contain dangerous chemical byproducts as well, which cause cancers and other diseases. Before the F.D.A. decreed that almonds must be tainted, almonds were so healthful that they could cure cancer without side effects in most test subjects.

Before I bought this, I read another reviewers opinion and she/he had stated that you can taste a peppery lemon snap in the back of your throat after each swallow. After I read this, (Since some citrus drinks can irritate my throat) I thought it might have a strong, citrus flavor that could burn my throat, as well as have a sour aftertaste. But that isn't the case at all. Just a hint of lemony ginger in the back of the throat after each swallow.

Silence... he appeared at the door with a bemused, lost look, not quite sure where he was. His eyes were glazed, slightly crossed. The mouth moved but no sound came out, then with a whoosh of air he looked at me with tears in his eyes and in a whisper said, wow. His tongue had begun to loll out of his mouth at this point obviously trying to escape the inferno he had ignited. Drink some milk I told him. He looked at me with blank eyes. When he finally managed to make it to the fridge he swallowed the milk, his tongue still feebly falling out of his mouth. My ears feel funny he said in a quiet voice.

Most importantly, do not be fooled by any particular vendor, which can change day to day.  Examine the description closely (and perhaps double check the manufacturer's own site for details), and check the shipping fees.  If it's an Amazon-sold product then super saver/prime shipping apply.  If it's a partner-vendor who stores it's inventory in an Amazon warehouse, then the same applies regarding shipping (and can be factored into costs).  If it's a partner-vendor who does not do that, well, then you must double check the shipping prices as occasionally there are some 'interesting' shipping fees to be found out there.

My opinion is, if you think you're buying a natural product to replace the chemically altered products like aspertame, you're not. This is mostly sugar alcohol called Xylitol. Stevita may also cause eye and sinus infections as I don't belive the new formula is a plant based product that you're pouring into your coffee cup or cooking pan. Watch a mist of fine powder float up into the air when you do and you will actually taste it on your tongue. More so when you pour hot liquid onto it. It also gets in your eyes and you breathe it in and it may cause eye and sinus infections. I know it did for me.

2133	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this 40 pack of Spearmint gum a few weeks ago. It came promptly and was well packaged. Several years ago, chewing gum seemed to stick to my dental work so I stopped chewing the stuff. Summer before last my daughter offered me a piece of Wrigleys and I found that it did not adhere to my dental work so I bought some. Whether or not Wrigleys is the only brand with non-stick properties, I have no idea, but if that has been a problem you might give this brand a whirl. I quit smoking in 1985 and used toothpicks to assuage the transition for a long time. Now chewing gum can help pick up the slack. Spearmint is my favorite breath/mouth freshener. Good gum, get some.
Like others, my shipment of six 14-oz canisters arrived with some breakage and crumbling.  So far, I've used 4 of the 6 cans, each containing 2 foil-wrapped sleeves (so I've opened 8 sleeves so far).  I've had 3 sleeves with NO breakage at all -- every one completely intact with just a tiny bit of crumbling on an end here and there.  The other 5 sleeves contained some broken cookies -- ranging from 20% to probably 60% of the contents.  Since I purchased these for my own use, this isn't a problem.  The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones. :-)  So far, I've had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents.  But if you're looking for perfect presentation, bear in mind that you're probably going to have to deal with some breakage.

7711	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Did NOT like the flavor of this tea. You have to buy a case of it, and it is not returnable. It has a very strong chicory flavor.  Shared with several friends and they also did not like it.  Does NOT taste like regular ice tea.
Each bag contains all-natural ingredients; and there are no artificial ingredients. The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.

Highly recommended.
The manufacturer writes on the box: "The combination of chamomile and lavender with lemon balm has digestive and nervous system sedating properties useful for nervous stomach and restlessness associated with upset stomach. The use of these herbs alone and in combinations for nervous stomach has been approved by European health authorities and is supported by clinical data. Organic Chamomile with Lavender has a pleasantly aromatic and balanced taste.".

The Amish country popcorn is not very crunchy, no matter how you prepare it. It reminds me of the cheap Safeway brand stuff. Very soft and chewy.

For the price here...they are laughably pricey for 1 pound of beans. But the quality and freshness was superb. Very clean. No split or broken beans. No rocks or soil. And they were worth it because I wanted to make a recipe and I got these shipped in 2 days with Amazon Prime. However, I think I will buy these directly from Camellia next time. I want to try more of their beans and it is cheaper to buy them direct. Plus Camellia offers free shipping when you buy a certain amount. I can stock up!

Much better than those expired little packets always hanging out at the back of the pantry, conspiring to spoil whatever recipe you have on hand. In fact, it works so well that I swear this stuff is a growing fungus in your cupboard, biding its time in adorable red and white packaging to take over whatever bread or pizza dough or rolls you knead.

I will note that the unbrewed tea bags have an incredibly intense smell that I did not find pleasant.  Thankfully, once brewed, the scent changes and is quite nice and comforting.  Another potential negative for some will be the settling that occurs with this tea.  There is a progression of tastes with this tea.  As one might expect, as you get closer to the bottom of the mug, the spiciness increases due to settling of the various ingredients.  This may not be to everyone's liking and a good stir may be needed midway through the mug.
Put it all together, and this has now become one of the staples in our kitchen - love it.

7230	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	It's my own fault for not reading the ingredients.  This product contains sugar (cane juice solids.)  Why anyone would put sugar in a savory chicken bouillon is beyond me.  For me at least, the sweet taste completely spoils it.
8175	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter. When I opened the box, the smell was fantastic. I had such high hopes for this tea, but was sorely disappointed. It was much too sweet for me. I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.

I usually season food I cook from scratch very well; however, this has come in so handy to give less than adequately seasoned foods instant flavor...so much so that I am coming to the end of the bottle and just ordered another one from Amazon.  Especially handy to give flavorless frozen vegetables a boost.
3530	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example.  Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try.  Doesn't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful.

Nutritional yeast flakes are nothing than vitamin supplements and this Frontier is no different. Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements. I consume the yeast which is sold separately as inactive yeast that has no added supplements since for every single spoon, 30g it offers only 30 calories but a whopping 3g of complete amino acid protein.

The Celestial Seasonings brand is a virtual guarantee of quality and freshness. They rarely miss the mark with a flavor, and the True Blueberry is one of their best. Sweeten it just right and you get a delicious tea that goes down smooth and smart on a hot afternooon or a cool, breezy evening. Most excellent all the way around. I've never bothered to try it hot. This flavor just SCREAMS ice tea, and that's exactly how I recommend that you drink it.

3116	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	At a cookout, a friend showed up with this stuff. I was the first to take the plunge. I tried to pour just a drop onto a small plate of nachos, but more than I wanted came out - maybe a 1/2 teaspoon. I mixed it around and dug in; it was good, but packs some serious 5 alarm heat. It is sweetly smoky, but this lasts only for the initial few seconds before the blazing, unquenchable inferno from the pit of hell begins. My eyes watered. Sweat formed on my brow. My nose ran. Brutal... just brutal. Another friend poured this stuff on his burger like ketchup (dripping down the side), and ate it like it was nothing! I can only conclude that my friend has a cast iron stomach.
2784	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a good buy for sure.  You want to make sure to let it sit so you will get as much flavor as this would give as the taste could be on the light side.  It is probably because this one is decaf.  I love this product.

It's also a bit less expensive than buying the New Orleans style coffees.  Because the shipping is less than the big cans of French Quarter New Orleans coffee.
4005	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This was by far my favorite hot sauce until the University of Nevada at Las Vegas released a study identifying this brand as having 0.21 PPM of lead in it along with others - FDA limit for lead in food is 0.1 PPM. It got some publicity so do a search for "hot sauce lead" to read up. Aside from the lead, the use of artificial colors also bugged me. The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process, such as washing the peppers, or not using salt from the earth, but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether. If they're not even washing the peppers before processing them, then they are probably covered in pesticides as well.
This is still one of my favorite teas.  One of my favorite desserts is a pot of this tea to sip while nibbling on a couple pieces of dark dark chocolate.  Tastes like eating a chocolate covered cherry...yummmmm

It will work in a pinch and it doesn't taste bad, but even fish sauce tastes better than this, if you were looking for something closer to a lobster flavor, plus it is far less expensive if you went to an Asian store.

Just so you all know...I buy and enjoy Community Cofee with chicory which is another local favorite. ...I also buy the chicory itself from Community Coffee which can be bought here on Amazon and add it to whatever coffee I am brewing.  I mention this to merely point out I LOVE COFFEE AND CHICORY.  I am awaiting delivery of French Market coffee with chicory now. (which I have never tried.) I simply can't recommend this to anyone.  I know everyone tastes are different but this taste nothing like what they serve.

These don't necessarily distribute evenly because the shapes are rather large and tend to clog up the holes in the shaker.  If this happens, just turn the shaker right side up again and bang it on the counter and you should be good to go.  On one batch of 12 cupcakes, I used about 1/3 of the stars.  So you should be able to get at least a couple of uses out of each shape, making these well worth the cost.

According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.
I'd say that by far this product is the best stevia product I've had.  It has the least aftertaste and best overall sweetness.  Once I got used to stevia (with Stevita) I went back and tried some of the other brands and found that I still didn't like them.

(Cinnamon is known to regulate blood sugar, which is a good thing.) I love it in the morning and when I drink a little orange juice along with it, the combination just makes my palate want to sing.

USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Bravo.
I don't give this a 5, though, because the title is misleading.  There is no beef at all in this broth powder.  It is a vegan product (per label), and contains no MSG.

The last time I tried it, I purchased it from Kroger's Food Store (sorry, Amazon).  I ended up taking it back and getting my money back.  I've tried S&B powder "Wasabi" powder, and it convinced me to start purchasing that brand.  Especially when a 1 Kilo bag of powder is less than $15 bucks!  It's the best imitation Wasabi powder I've ever had.  To make it last (I probably have several years supply of it), I vacuum-packed 1/4 pound bags in the Food Savor bags, and then stuck them in my freezer.

There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.

Although it was shipped to me from England, it arrived quite promptly so the distance shouldn't worry anyone ordering this salt.  I keep a small container on the dining table and just sprinkle it on my food as you would a finishing salt.  I'm one who loves salt, and this less salty version has a very pleasant crunch.  A small box of this salt will go a long way.

9619	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It is no wonder that this is the mustard of French royalty.  I haven't seen this in stores (or tasted it) for probably 20 years now (when it only cost about $7 -- I notice that if you buy six at a time, the price is less than $10 a jar -- good deal.  Gifts, anyone?).  I belonged to a "foodie" group back in the early 80's before such things were popular, and I was always "the designated bringer of the mustard" because this is the mustard I brought.  It makes all other mustards seem harsh, acrid and acidic, as well as puny and washed out in comparison.  There is simply nothing else like it.  Now, if they would please bring back the CORK!!

If you add any of the H&T cinnamon flavors, you probably won't want to add sugar as it naturally sweetens.
A real treat to eat.

6735	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Has a really strong ginger flavor and that ginger bite.  If you're a fan of ginger, you'll like this tea.  The lemon is a nice subtle underlying flavor and supplements the ginger without overpowering it.  I drink this after every meal instead of having dessert, and the flavor is really good and strong enough that I really don't crave anything sweet afterwards, which helps with the waistline.

IMHO, it should be used as a dusting (like paprika might be used) just before serving for greatest flavor impact. It is subtle, ethereal, haunting.  I want to use it on everything!!! It tastes, to me, a little like fennel fronds, a little like curry, a little like flowers, but better than all three!  BTW, the supplier sent free samples of some of their other blends.  They were wonderful too.

Absolutely delicious. I wanted to eat it straight from the jar. The taste of this honey was robust. It wasn't overpowering. It was rich in taste and texture. Raw honey is incredibly satisfying. Processed honey is okay. This raw honey is spectacular. Im using this to sweeten my hot and cold tea. You won't have any regrets with this purchase. It's worth every penny. No more refined sugars for me.

1398	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Chinese black vinegar has very distinctive flavors that come from the fermentation of rice and other whole grains like barley.  This has a nice, slightly smoky, slightly sweet, almost plum-like, piquant flavoring that makes it a great complementary component for a variety of dishes.  This is the sweeter variety of black vinegar that is better suited for dipping (steamed buns, steamed dim sum dishes), rather than the cooking variety (which trends towards being more astringent, with stronger vinegar flavor), albeit it is completely suitable to cook with.
Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

The sad thing is these cannot be eaten raw. The taste just isn't what I would expect for an almond. Its raw and unpasteurized so I guess its what I ordered. I'll just use them for almond milk and add maple syrup so it is a little more palatable. I want to give them 3 stars but I think its unfair because like I said, Im unfamiliar with the taste and some people may think its normal.

8662	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I cook alot and have tried many brands of fish sauce and this is by far my favourite - light and delicate and adds a subtle and rich element to many Thai, Vietnamese and other dishes.  Most other brands that I have tried are more overpowering and pungent and tend to dominate the dish rather than enhance (at least to my US taste buds).  Also tends not to accumulate too much of the sediment that accumulates in most bottles of fish sauce which is even more strong and pungent that the rest.  This also gets delivered very quickly and nicely and after buying half a dozen bottles or so, none have been broken.  Highly recommended.

3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with "lite" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.

Sure, there are hotter sauces out there - Dave's makes some, as do competitors, but this a reliable old faithful, a product you can reach for time and time again and know exactly how it's going to affect your cooking.

5696	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim "Love it or Hate it"  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.

The box arrived well packed so that the tin, and it's cookies, were not damaged en route. Had these cookies been for me, I would not have minded a little bouncing around, dented tin and broken cookies, but not as a surprise for Mom that needed a good surprise. I feel confident from that experience that you can feel assured they will arrive fresh and intact with less potential to be a gift you have to apologize for.

So I went with ordering from Melissa's. I am not sorry I did. Melissa's oranges came from California, not overseas somewhere, and were SO very good. They shipped extremely fast and arrived well packaged. If you've never had blood oranges; you're missing out. Generally not too different from regular oranges, often more tart and with a richer, more complex flavor hinting at raspberry. They also have even more vitamins and are extremely rich in antioxidants. I'll just order from Melissa's again next year to be certain of getting my yearly fix!

I then spread a thin layer of nuts in the bottom of the ungreased baking dish. I place it in the toaster oven, and set a timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, I remove the baking dish with a hot pad, shake the dish to resettle and redistribute the nuts, place the dish back in the toaster oven, and set a timer for another 5 minutes.

Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami.  Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.  Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings.  That hint of umami makes all the difference.

The taste  of Morning Thunder is strong without any bite or bitterness.  Tea lovers will enjoy exploring a brew that is richer than most others, while coffee lovers will love a new, easy way to have a caffeine drink.  I recommend it as your regular warm drink; for travel to hotels where in-room coffee is lousy; and for all travel and camping.  I recommend this for people who do not have time in the morning to brew coffee -- just drop a Morning Thunder bag or two into a travel mug full of hot water and you will have a great morning drink in a minute.

I wouldn't think of eating Ramen noodles normally but with some of this stuff, I will eat it and like it. I think it is better than Schriacha sauce, you just have to be careful and use a small amount till you know how strong it is and then you will be adding  it to everything. I do a quick dipping sauce with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and this oil. Great for dumplings! This is a staple that everyone should have in kitchen.

Didn't alter the coffee the way honey would.  Pancakes  Waffles  on your Tongue  on Ice Cream  on Sausage, in baking,  its like adding almost-caramel to anything.  Butter just brings it forward.

I previously purchased "Milk Chocolate Gourmet Pecans 1 Lb (453g)" by SweetGourmet, and they were just "okay."  I was NOT impressed by them, and since they are a food item, they don't qualify for a return, and I REALLY cannot return items, I am home-bound and don't have anyone to run errands for me.

They smelled warm and they were right out of the ovens. The packing is wonderful also. Very safe. These are almost on par with the special cookies that you find in the malls. BUT you won't find the freshness in them unless you catch them when they're first taking them out of the oven.

1989	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	With its new-look packaging, Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend. The old blend was strong, robust, and biting. It was by far my favorite bagged black tea. The new blend is weaker and maltier; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea. If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.

6175	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It has a very light, delicate taste and goes wonderfully in most drinks.

1931	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The David's Cookies I bought in Princeton and Menlo Park 25-30 years ago were flattish, mis-shapen, came from light brown dough and were very full of chocolate chunks reminiscent of tobler or lindt chocolate. The things that arrived this week were perfectly round, dome-shaped, made from yellow dough, low on chocolate chunks (which seemed more like baking chocolate), WAY too vanilla tasting, and too chewy.

3076	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Finally I found a sauce that is just pure heat with good flavor, if you have dish or even a favorite hot sauce that is just to mild for some applications this is highly recommended as a little goes a very long way. This is exceptionally hot and not super high on the salt or vinegar or just otherwise off putting flavor, a teaspoon of this will not go unnoticed even if it in a pot of chili for 50 people.

I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.

I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties.
2304	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Too many work traces, too much rancid and bitter almonds for the one package.
The first thing to realize is this is NOT a gelatin--it will NOT set up firm like jello. It is a thickening agent. Okay, I can hear you thinking, "...thickening agent?? What kind of a chemical mess is this??" Well, you don't have to be concerned about molecular gastronomy here. Instead, think FLOUR, or more precisely, STARCH. That is what this is. It is an instant product that works like flour, or corn starch, or tapioca flour to thicken liquids or broths or low viscosity solutions. It actually IS a pre-gelatinized form of starch from maize (corn). REMEMBER! This is the 'Instant' version of CLEAR JEL. You need to be aware that it is not the same as the 'regular' CLEAR JEL...see here:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Clear-Jel-1-lb/dp/B00015UC4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Clear Jel, 1 lb.</a>... There are some differences in the products and in the functions of the products. The 'Instant' version (this version..) is pre-gelatinized...sort of pre-softened or prepared to accept liquid and will readily do so cold without much problem. Totally NOT like flour or regular corn starch. Another difference is that 'INSTANT' CLEAR JEL will immediately start the thickening process without heating. The starch granules start hydrating with the liquid and start swelling and thickening immediately upon being mixed into the liquid....which means it is sort of ideal for thickening COLD liquids! Pretty strange, Huh? Yep, I thought so too. So, I bought some to try it out....AND IT WORKS!!
It adds a sweet, delicious flavor to all my organic teas...especially Peach tea.
Add lots of ice to each cup, pour, and sweeten a bit more to taste.
4245	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love easy. This makes yummy chili super easy! Brown some onions and meat, toss in beans if you like (I prefer my chili without) add this sauce and warm it all up and chili is done!
7873	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a delicately balanced blend of hibiscus, roasted chicory, chamomile, rosehips and roasted carob. Cinnamon, ginger and cardamom add background spicy notes to the mostly fruity blend. Highly recommended, I look forward to this tea every year. Just as good iced as hot. I should add that it's available direct from CS at their website significantly cheaper than here - $3.59 a box - this includes shipping - if you order 12 boxes. Normally I buy locally, but for some reason I was unable to find this (or any of the other holiday blends) this year.

FOOD: I used to consume Sun Brand Curry Powder for years since it was the best but not any longer since I mix my own curry powder and more importantly I want to avoid sodium which is added in all spices regardless of the brand. No wonder everyone is selling turmeric in pills since it has such a high nutritional value, manganese 26%, iron 16%, Phytosterols 5.5 for cholesterol and most importantly inflammation factor of 1,523; all in one tablespoon. No need to consume pills since I put few spoons of this golden beauty turmeric into my dishes for its health benefits. Sun Brand curry powder has some 30 spices. If you are after a spice mix Sun Brand is the best but certainly with noticeable sodium.
9510	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This has regular licorice in it!  Most of these products don't. It really help with digestion and gerd.
There were no additional instructions/suggestions on how to prepare it.  Personally, I like making my popcorn on the stovetop.  I have used a method recommended by other popcorn: heat 1 tbsp oil in pot on high with 4 kernels, once the kernels pop lower heat to medium and add the rest of your kernels.  Gently shake the pot every minute or so.  Once the popping slows to 1-2 per second, turn off heat, continue to gently shake pot until all popping stops. Pour into bowl and season as desired.  This method seems to produce the least amount of unpopped kernels as well as reduces the chance of burning the popcorn.
2451	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this tea. I had purchased the peach version first which I also liked a lot, and I wanted to try the raspberry kind. I decided to commit and purchase the six boxes. One of the best things is the fact that you can make this healthy (sugar free) yet delicious drink in under 15 minutes: you're only suppos d to brew for a few minutes, but I let mine sit in the fridge for awhile because I like stronger tea flavor. I sweeten it with natural stevia and it's some of the best iced tea I've ever had! Will definitely keep buying! I use about 12 bags to make theee liters. Yes it costs more than buying powdered sugary tea but it's so worth it!

They didn't need to cook as long as most dried pasta, so check them after 5 or 6 minutes.

The only reason that it doesn't get five stars is because it's a bit weak for my taste, and one bag is only strong enough for a small cup. If I want to drink a big mug I need to use two bags. Let it steep for five minutes before you drink it, which helps get the most flavor out of it. I personally do not need to add sugar to this tea, the cinnamon, carob, and star anise make it somewhat sweet.

2856	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	These are the real deal, not pasteurized.  The american almond has a hard crunch to them.  These have a slight mealy taste initially but are moister in the middle.  They have a sweet taste to them to, never had that in an american almond.  If you want to avoid propylene oxide, definitely check these out.  edit: I originally gave this 4 stars but I keep getting almonds that I believe are rancid.  I'm  not sure what rancid tastes like  but it tastes like the almond is soaked in nutrasweet and then it changes to something very bitter and disgusting like vanilla extract, except these almonds taste much worse.  I had a few almonds that were off but I am now coming across almonds that fit my description of completely inedible.  These almonds are expensive, I would have expected a better quality especially when the label says they are good for another year.  I don't know if I will buy these again.
Tip:  If you are decorating cookies, place waxed paper or a paper towel beneath the cookie you are decorating.  When you're done, it makes it much easier to put back into the jar the crystals that never made it onto your cookies.  That saves you money and time.

When you get halfway through the bottle, this stuff starts coming out faster and faster, so be careful with your pour. Also, it stains like blood! After putting the cap back on, there's usually a little sauce left on the area between the lip/rim. I typically would grab a white hand towel to get this off, and after throwing said white hand towel in hot water laundry with bleach and drying, there remains deep, rust colored stains on the towels. So, just rinse the neck under cold water and dry with paper towels to avoid this problem.

When cortisol levels are balanced at night, you can be assured of a good night's sleep and of waking up restful, but if you wake up feeling like garbage, and that's how I feel, then your morning cortisol needs to be balanced. Rhodiola works for this, or Eleuthro, both great adaptogens.
The product besides tasting good has medical/pharmaceutical properties in that it is a very good expectorant (loosens mucus/phlegm in lungs when needed to address common cold/flu).  Works much better than products like Mucinex and far less expensive.
Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine

I wish it came in an industrial sized bucket. It's such a pure taste and vastly improves everything I put it in. So enjoy and feel free to use it whenever vanilla is called for. It just seems so gourmet. You will get compliments for certain. Also, it may seem pricey at the outset but to get the result you get from this you'd have to use three times as much of the grocery store vanilla.

I live too far north to get them in the grocery more than once in a blue moon, so it's nice to know I can order them when I'm thinking they'd be nice to have, not waiting for that future time when a specialty store finally gets some in.
5258	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The first sign with all multivitamins, etc. is, if your urine turns bright neon. If it does, you just lost everything you thought will be kept in your body.

None the less, it is light years ahead of this one.... let's just leave it at that. Do some more extensive research on MEAL Replacements, you'll stumble across the product I'm currently using with no "neon urine" afterwards :-) P.S: Even tried their pills with the same effect.

I'm not talking just a little bit....it was hard to get off and pretty gross. It was also hard to get out of the counter top after cooking with them. The remaining bit of this stuff went in the trash.

7346	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love the taste of this tea. It is smooth and rich. It has loads of flavor. I am not fond of fruit teas and this is so nice for a different flavor. It doesn't have that unpleasant bite some teas have when you brew them too long. I don't drink coffee in the summer because it raises my body temperature and I just feel too hot, but i crave it. This is a great taste to take its place. I am pleased that it doesn't give me any indigestion or reflux. I can drink it in the evening. It brews a satisfying dark brown color. I love it with a little brown sugar.

2578	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This chai tea has been de-chai-ed. Chai has a specific flavor profile - it's tea, and warm spice, such as pepper, clove, cardamom, ginger. This tasted vaguely clove-ish, no tea flavor, and then ... There is this big hit of fake-smelling (it's as much an aroma as a flavor) vanilla perfume. You know what the perfume made me think of? It reminded me of the smell of my mother's powder compacts when I was a kid 40 years ago. I didn't like kissing my mother when her face was covered with makeup and I don't like drinking this tea now. This odor is so strong that it stayed in my mug even after washing it in the sink. If chai is what you seek, move along.

One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is "Y.S. Organic Bee Farms", and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.
Have a nice day!
3527	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I really wanted to like this coffee, especially because I have such fond memories of the caf&eacute; itself on Decatur Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans from days gone by. But there is no similarity between the heavenly coffee I enjoyed down there and this vile brew. When I opened the can I was disappointed by the aroma, which was redolent of old socks, and the coffee itself looked like roasted, coarse-ground weeds; there were actually what could only be described as twigs in it. But I had to give it a fair go so I went through an entire can before I finally gave up on it. I tried various brewing methods and coffee-to-water ratios but one thing was consistent: No matter how I brewed it, the result was always harsh and bitter, and it left a nasty aftertaste that lingered on the palate for hours.
8664	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I've used all kinds of fish sauce over the years but I think Three Crabs is my new favorite.  It has a nice fish flavor yet isn't overpoweringly salty like some brands.  That's a plus when you want to add soy sauce to your Asian food in addition to the fish sauce.  The ingredients are water, anchovies, hydrolyzed wheat protein (secret name for MSG) and sugar.  I wish it didn't contain MSG, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
I am quite fond of rooibos tea from South Africa, which is the only location where GENUINE rooibos tea should come from, FYI. The brand, however, tastes crap. I've gone through about 10 or 12 bags, hoping that it was a fluke. Sadly, it's not. It doesn't taste anything like any rooibos tea I've ever had in my lifetime. In fact, I know this is marketed as the #1 tea company in South Africa. Honestly, though, I had never heard of this brand. Twig and Ouhuis seemed to be pretty popular brands. Of course, most people in SA buy this tea loose.
7812	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I decided to try Jammin' Lemon Ginger tea because it sounded a lot like Lipton's Ginger Twist. However, I found it was even BETTER, with a more robust and satisfying flavor than Lipton. I first tried it when I had a head cold. The tea opened my sinuses and gave me more "pep." It also settles an upset stomach. Add this tea to your pantry for its wellness qualities and great taste!

Warning: there is a significant difference between the regular Valentina and the so-called "extra hot" (black label) variety. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is quite evident while in the "extra hot" variety it is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the so-called extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label. Keep in mind, the "extra hot" is not much hotter than the "regular" version
7007	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The fruit tea sampler is fantastic since it is easy to get bored just drinking one flavor. You can choose any one of five to match the meal you are eating that day. I like to brew it in boiling water and then add ice to cool it down. It is extremely refreshing and has the perfect hint of tartness in it. Many of these teas also contain hibiscus which has been shown to have even higher antioxidant levels than green tea so it is very good for your health. Also, not all the flavors are completely natural. They do say 'natural flavors' on the list but the term is way too broad and probably contain artificial flavors. However, the addition of the flavor allows this tea to taste in a way that teas without flavoring just cannot accomplish. There is just no way to get the flavor of black cherry or blueberry without some artificial flavors. I only wish Celestial would make an organic line.

9580	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the real stuff - French country-style whole-grain mustard. It's not loaded with horseradish like, for example, Dijon. This is a mild mustard with a thick chewable texture and a delicious mustardy flavor. I like to spread a thick layer in sandwiches. When this type of mustard is not available, I would instead use a very thin layer of Dijon due to its higher spiciness. These crocks used to be sealed with wax and were tedious to get into. However, this one just uses a press-in kind of a cork molded from plastic. To save your fingernails, you pry up the edges with a dinner knife to pull out the cork. It's a good thing this crock is so large, because you'll want to use a lot of this great spread.

Small farmers many times can not afford pasteurization equipment, so this helps reduce competition for the large almond growers by putting the small almond growers out of business.

6282	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This date sugar is very tasty.  I have used it before in making date nut bars, date filled oat meal cookies, bread, and many other recipes as well.  It makes a good tasting alternative to regular or brown sugar in recipes that call for dates, or are date flavored.  Just remember that date sugar is a little sweeter than regular or brown sugar and should be used more sparingly.  Also, date sugar does not melt down and liquify like other sugar either.  When used in recipes it may appear as small brown flakes that give a more concentrated sweetness to cookies, bread, etc.  Date sugar is not cheap, but worth it for the few times you will use it for the special sweetness and flavor it adds. Also, it is near impossible to find in anything but gourmet shops so Amazon is a good bet if you are feeling favorable to it.  The only thing I would suggest is that you either order two or more pouches of this or something else that qualifies you for the free shipping. (If it's still be offered, it was at the time of this writing.) Then it becomes a solid deal and well worth the money.  Recommended...

I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was "yuck" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything.

If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the "best before" dates being passed.

I love the squeeze bottle, the larger size has a star tip when the red cap is removed or mayo can be squeezed out through a small hole by lifting up the top of the red cap.
BUT - this is ABSOLUTELY the best licorice out there! Just be careful if you have high blood pressure: it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person's blood pressure.

I have referred all of my almond loving friends to order from this company.  However, I was extremely disappointed with my last order.  I ordered 2 very large bags, but so many of the nuts were sour! Every 1 out of every 6 was so gross I had to spit them out.  No one would eat them.  I spoke to one of my coworkers, who I had referred to buy these nuts, and she said her last batch was sour as well.  Nuts are so expensive and I order such large quantities I don't want to risk receiving another bad batch and will be looking for a different seller. So disappointed  ):

I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.

I felt like a kid again enjoying my icey cold Choo Choo Cherry (boy, does that date me) on the back porch! It's cherry without the cough syrup back taste - I have no idea how it tastes brewed as hot tea, but throw this in a pitcher of water (1 bag per 8oz) leave it in the fridge over night and you will have a delicious iced beverage! (I leave the tea bags in till it's gone, the flavor just gets more intense)...love it- just ordered six more boxes! woo hoo!!

5848	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Besides being sweet, does sugar -- from sugar cane -- have a flavor?  It does!  And when the sugar boils down into syrup, the flavor comes out.  So, okay -- it IS sugar.  Politically incorrect.  Empty calories.... I know, I know.  But whether you take your sugar "naturally" in fruit or honey or "unnaturally" in hiprocessed candies and sugar-coated cereals, the chemical is the same....And the thing is not to get too much. And if I'm going to have a certain amount ANYway, there are days when this is how I want to eat it.  Ly'les Golden Syrup is  a nice flavor alternative to honey, or maple syrup.  The texture is thick like honey, but the flavor is light.  It has much more "depth" and thickness than corn syrup.  If you like crisp, Belgian waffles, this is great on them --with or without pats of melted butter.  My grandma used to use this more than 50 years ago and I started loving it as a kid.  She put it in frostings and who knows what else.  But I just like it as it is... dip your fingers in and lick them off.  Ummmmmmmm....  So why can't you get this stuff in your local supermarket?  I can't find it anywhere.... It's because most people don't know about it.  And don't know to ask for it, or how or where to get it.  I've never seen an ad for this, and it isn't manufactured by one of the megafoodgiant monopolies in the U.S. , but it is worth having.  I just wish I didn't have to order it in sufficient quantities to justify the shipping charge.  Kind of silly to pay $7 to have a $4 item shipped.  So then you buy several... but who has room to store several?  And it takes a long time to go through one can of it.  LIke, a year.  So, if I get three cans, I have enough for three years.  Still, it's worth the shipping to get two cans...I want some right now. Too bad I have to wait.
7797	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a really tasty, versatile tea.  The flavor is spicy strong in a good way, and wakes you right up even though it's caffeine-free.

Amazon offers this at a good price, too.

  The Extra Hot is hotter than the others, maybe 50% hotter. If you've tried Melinda's Naga Jolokia Sauce or Tropical Pepper Company's Ghost Pepper sauce, those are both FAR hotter than the Extra Hot. The flavor on this one is a bit different than the red and green; probably because it contains tomato paste. It almost tastes like an extremely hot salsa, only without the chunks, and thicker.

Highly recommended.  As long as you 'dilute' this somewhat, and you like licorice taste, I am pretty sure both your taste buds and your body will like it!!
I used to use Alive! Soy Shake Mix, which is also fantastic, but I had to stop because that shake has retinol palmitate in high doses and that's not safe for pregnant women. This shake does not have retinol palmitate. Instead, it has beta carotine, which is safe for use by pregnant women.
This stuff tastes like the oldest, most putrid, rotting vomit to have ever been discovered.  It is, easily, the most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth and that's saying a lot, because I'm a pretty liberal (and frisky) gay person.
As far as the tea itself, it seems to have a very nice flavor and it gives you the stimulation in the morning without the jitters. It is a nice start to the day. A good alternative to strong coffee. Overall, I love this product and hope that Celestial Seasonings doesn't decide to discontinue since it doesn't seem to be a very well stocked item in most places. I highly recommend it.

If you people really want to do something that is healthy for you, drink your coffee and tea without any type of sweatner. Eat your food without sweatner. Your body only craves food when you use the substite anyway because your tongue tasted the sweatness and your body starts producing insulan to stabalize your blood sugar. But there is no sugar there, so now your body and especially your metabolism is all out of balance. The only way for your body to get it back in balance is to get more food in you.

Because the chicory in this blend is fairly prominent, I usually make my coffee au lait style. Actually, I make it more like cafe Cubano with scalded or steamed milk, but that is a personal preference. If you have never tried a chicory blended coffee you may want to at least use a little cream or milk and a touch of sugar, even if you normally take your coffee black. Once you grow accustomed to the chicory you can cut back on the additives until you can enjoy it straight up. I'll forewarn you, though, that once you develop a taste for this you will get cravings at the oddest times.

2218	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is one of our favorite sauces. rating Hottness is difficult to do because every one tastes things different. All I can say is, if original Tabasco is hot to you, then this is not for you. I feel as if this is on par with original Tabasco in heat but has a different flavor. Colon Cleaner is a mustard based sauce with a lot of flavor. It's main ingredients are Scotch Bonnet peppers and mustard. It is not so hot that you can't taste it like some other brands. It is one of our favs! If you like to change things up and have an extensive collection of hot sauce's like we do, this will be a great addition. The price of 12 seems a bit high (the highest I'v seen). I have seen it as low as 5 and averages around 7-8.

It is no trouble finding Celestial Seasonings brand at grocery stores and other places that sell tea bags, but it is a terrible time finding this fine quality tea.

The main headquarters of Lee Kum Kee is located in Hong Kong and has production bases in Xinhui, Huangpu, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Los Angeles.

I have a small, square, Pyrex glass baking dish that fits perfectly into my toaster oven. I set the toaster oven for 350 degrees and turned to the Bake setting. I then spread a thin layer of nuts in the bottom of the ungreased baking dish. I place it in the toaster oven, and set a timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, I remove the baking dish with a hot pad, shake the dish to resettle and redistribute the nuts, place the dish back in the toaster oven, and set a timer for another 5 minutes. At the end of this time, the almonds are deliciously toasted.

The cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen. The palm oil is great for stability in hot climates, so this will be a plus for shipping in hot weather.

I seriously doubt I could ever love another honey as much as this raw honey. I have tried several other raw honey brands, even fresh comb from my friend's family beehives, and its just not as good. This is the sweetest, most delightful honey--PERIOD. It is solidified unlike traditional honey, so at times it can be harder to work with in cooking and smoothies unless you warm it a bit in the microwave, but I seriously could care less about that. I had to buy two humongous jars to keep up with my cravings for it, one for work and one for home.

I highly recommend this quality product and it's great they are raw and organic.
  Having said that, the primary flavor of all of these sauces is chiles. The red, green, and extra hot all taste of habanero. I like the green the best, it's a tiny bit hotter than the red and has a more tangy flavor (more vinegar?). The red just tastes like a basic habanero sauce. It's significantly hotter than Tabasco but not crazy. I wouldn't want anything milder, but the red and green are both hot enough.

Their Honey Vanilla Chamomile tea is good when mixed with a white tea orange spice.

This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.

This offering on Amazon was perfect, six full size boxes of 20 tea bags each (for a total of 120 bags) just as you would buy in the store individually. For those who haven't tried this tea before, they are the "pillow style" bags, meaning there are no attached strings, staples, tags, or individual wrappers, which eliminates a lot of waste. The bags are attached in pairs, 20 bags per box inside a wax paper bag which is self-sealing. I was very happy to see that each box was also sealed in cellophane and has a 'best by' date of 2016 so they're not out of date and will last a while. I immediately made a cup and found it to smell and taste as fresh as it does from local stores. All 6 boxes were in a sturdy manufacturer's box in addition to the shipping box so nothing got crushed. Amazon's price (at the time of my purchase at least) even saved me a few cents from the store price, so I'm as happy as can be with this purchase. I'll absolutely order this again if they still have the same offering when I run out!

After eating fresh, organic, home-cooked meals for a couple of years, I've become very aware of that weird "factory food" taste, like you get in Jello, Twinkies, cake mixes, etc.  It's the same with salt.  Real, unadulterated food tastes so much better, and unadulterated nutrition seems to be unreservedly welcomed by the body, adding to your eating pleasure.  Your body recognizes all the ingredients and knows what to do with them.  When you don't have to subconsciously "tune out" some of the odd chemical flavors, you can really and truly be open to the full taste of your food.
So I bought this rabbit, thinking that 'fresh' and 'whole' were great qualities for an Easter bunny. Sadly, I didn't think about 'alive' or 'unskinned', of which this thing is neither. So my idea of training it to hand out candy sort of went out the window.
9228	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Not many people have an exact preference when it comes to salt. But if you demand quality, if you have a discriminating palate, and if price is not a factor, you will love this salt.

Let me break it down for you. If you dump this stuff straight on macaroni, you'll get stubborn clumps and a thin cheese gruel that's much more watery than your kraft stuff. You need a thickener, I use a tablespoon of flour for each serving. You need to break up the clumps in the cheese powder. I accomplish this with a blender bottle, basically a wire whisk in a shake bottle.

It has the richest and most mellow flavor of all the other brands, consistent quality and longest lasting flavor.  We add a little low glycemic sweetener (also purchased here at Amazon online) and the flavor is amazing!  Relaxing, soothing after a hard day at work or in my case dealing with pain as part of my disability, just as soothing and warming.  Perfect for after dinner to settle the stomach, great for just before bed, a very good tension tamer mid day as well.  This is our good 'ol stand-by favorite and we make sure to keep it on hand summer as well as winter. It's a "must have" in our home, and brewing it smells like "home":)

Celestial Seasonings knows how to blend teas. Mandarin Orange Spice is one of their classic (oldest) flavors. With its perfect mixture of dried orange peel, rose hips, blackberry leaves and natural Mandarin orange flavor, you get a sweet citrus flavor that is beautifully enhanced by the warm, spicy zing of chicory, cinnamon and cloves. I prefer this tea hot, so all its flavors are in full bloom; but I'm sure it could be just as pleasant chilled.

On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.

These could be GREAT as a treat at a potluck >>>  just get some tiny petit four cups, spoon in the chocolate pecans, and become VERY, VERY POPULAR!!  (The petit four cups are just to make transporting and sharing easier, and less messy on the fingers  :-)  )

I love chai.  When I bought the box, I didn't notice that the manufacturer was calling this a caffeine-free interpretation of chai.  While chai was not the first thing that I thought of when I first drank this, I would find Bengal Spice to be an acceptable substitute for the real chai; Bengal Spice has all the right flavors and maybe with some coconut milk, it might be more in line with my vision of chai.

Most honey has high fructose corn syrup in it which makes it too sweet.
6177	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I love honey, in general, and this stuff is 10 times better than any other honey I've tried.  So for taste, it easily gets 5 stars. However, I am rating it only 1 star because it has a negative effect on me that I never would have thought; it gives me headaches. I tried it three different times to see if this honey was indeed the culprit and concluded, sadly, it was.  Subsequently, I read up on it and found that many people have allergic reactions to "raw" honey, even when they do not have any reactions to pasteurized honey (which I do not).  Many of the reactions noted were the same as one might get with typical allergies or hay fever such as, sneezing, runny nose, congestion, watery eyes, etc. Headaches were also noted. It has to do with the pollen in it, which I don't know why, but I hadn't even considered. Apparently, a benefit of consuming it, as I understand it, is that consuming small amounts of bee pollen, can actually build up a person's defense against pollen allergies (much the same way as getting a flu shot can protect you from getting the flu).
5374	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Tastes very good.  Would highly recommend!!
It's pretty good but personally I think the flavors of most of the Celestial Seasonings fruit teas I've tried thus far are somewhat weak unless brewed for a full 5-6 minutes.  The peach especially benefits from a little extra time, after which it becomes very good and most soothing - more peach pie than fresh peach.  The no individual packaging is nice and convenient but, really, would a couple inches of string be that much of a strain on the environment?  Really, really hate having to dig the bag out with a fork.

9796	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Like a lot of other products by Barry Farms, I was first introduced to carob powder way back during my sons scouting days. Camping trips during the fall and winter months always resulted in the evening ending with a traditional "jawin" session around the fire, complete of course with hot cocoa and marshmallows, among other treats.  In the beginning, real hot chocolate was used for it was easy to locate, and of course what the boys wanted and expected.  The biggest problem we had with the real thing was the obvious caffeine high it used to give the boys late at night when we least wanted it.  (As any of you with youngin's in your household can imagine, most kids don't need the bountiful effects of caffeine at any time, but especially late at night).  After the traditional session around the campfire ended, a not so well liked and substandard other tradition would unfortunately follow.  Trying to get the well wired boys to settle down and let the old men and ladies on the trip get some much needed rest.

I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.
1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal.

I'm not sure if it is this brand or all nutritional yeast but each time I used some I would develop a headache a hour or so after eating some.

However, sugar has lots of sugary calories, so, hello Stevia! I mostly use this to sweeten coffee.

I used it for the first time last week when I was preparing dishes for a private-chef client who's on a low, low carb diet for his recently diagnosed diabetes 2 and wanted to make him something punchy and flavorful. Not only did he love the dish, but he gave some to his mother-in-law (who's also diabetic) and she loved it, too. My husband cruised by the kitchen when I was cooking, intrigued by the delicious aromas and was disappointed that it was for Bruce and not for us. So over the weekend, I made green curry halibut and shrimp "burgers," and they were such a success I'm making the same thing for Bruce's wife who's a pescatarian; the first dish featured chicken thighs..

4. One tablespoon of brewer's yeast (15gr) provides me with 70% chromium and 45% selenium. I am into very healthy diet and different sports from mountain biking, surfing, weight lifting, hiking, etc. without any need for any meds for any chronic condition. I do not take any supplements at all since nothing comes close to a balanced diet. Chromium is hard to get due to the depletion of the nutrients in soil.

It promotes body and digestive health, is a powerful antioxidant, strengthens the immune system, eliminates allergies, and is an excellent remedy for skin wounds and all types of infections. Raw honey's benefits don't stop there. Raw honey can also stabilize blood pressure, balance sugar levels, relieve pain, calm nerves, and it has been used to treat ulcers. Raw honey is also an expectorant and anti-inflammatory and has been known to effectively treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma.

(No calories, no caffeine, just a nice little warm glow.)  I like all of these flavors, especially the Honey Vanilla Chamomile.  Celestial Seasonings is pretty much my standard for herbal teas, they are not the most bold in the flavoring, nor are they what I would consider weak.

Instead of drinking something that is not good for your body try these good teas!  And the Chai has the bonus of containing rooibos which is supposed to help us with our weight.  If you want it a little sweeter add some stevia.

After some searching I found Food To Live nuts. They taste fresh, crunchy, and awesome. I almost think they freeze dry the nuts because they end up so crunchy. Either way that would be a great preservation method and keep the nuts just like they were cracked. Their walnuts, brazil nuts, and pumpkins are also super delicious. Enjoy!

I have to say this one is a light smooth tea that provides a refreshing taste and is not overpowering.  It is good both hot and cold.

"Bourbon" gourmet beans, from Madagascar and the nearby islands, have the best reputation for quality and flavor... and to my mind, after experimenting, this extract is the best - rich and creamy.

3621	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I love mayo and all things spicy.  Purchased this twice at my local grocer; a dud.  The initial taste is nicely spiced and tasty, but after the jar is about 1/2 used the mayo develops a funny unpleasant finishing taste.  It did not smell or taste spoiled, rather finished with a stale, kind of dank taste.  (Think of wine that has been opened to the air for too long.)  I used it every day and never left the jar opened, so it was not as if the mayo had sat around for a long time in the frig and gotten old.

I did compare Wilton (this product) and Watson's and to my nose Watson's smells sweeter and stronger while Wilton's smells saltier and weaker.

8695	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love using this as a finishing salt, and I have used it for years. The little pyramids of salt sprinkled over, say, a steak fresh out of the pan looks impressive. Sprinkled over a salad, it adds a little bit of extra crunch and flavor. Very nice salt, highly recommended.

The flavor is the best part.  It's really good, the same way that sriracha has a really good flavor and the spiciness is just a bonus.  I always have a bottle of this on hand.

That being said, I like this gum. It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply. It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wrigleys-Orbit-Bubblemint-14-Count-Pack-of-12/dp/B004DIXSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wrigleys Orbit Bubblemint, 14-Count (Pack of 12)</a>. You can't win 'em all. Truth be told, that is a better gum. This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country. I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby. Review over.
It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste.  The heat is derived from peppers and "pepper extracts" (read: capsaicin).

Finding the delicious Koon Chun Black Vinegar is very difficult to find in my area. There are very few Asian Stores and the two that we have do not carry this Koon Chun brand. When I found Amazon carries the Koon Chun Black Vinegar, I was thrilled. The price is on the high side, but worth every penny, as there is just no flavor that comes close to Black Vinegar.  When it comes to the most delicious dipping sauces that really bring the WOW factor to all our favorite Chinese dishes- Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is it! Our favorite Potstickers never tasted this good from any Chinese restaurant!

My coworkers who sit near me just smell the open canister and comment on how delicious it smells, so I have to buy some for them too so they don't drink all of my chai!

It arrived a few days ago and I've used it daily for 2-3 cups.  Very enjoyable.

The flavor is soo authentic without weird smell. The consistency is good and it goes well with any vegetables.
I've actually come to enjoy the taste, and because it's grown directly on beets in a basement in formerly communist Eastern Europe (or some place like that) you know it's definitely not radioactive, which is nice to have in a yeast product.

MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years.  Because it is a high profile ingredient, MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers.

88	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	We followed the cooking directions carefully, but the curry didn't turn out so well. It was 1) super spicy, 2) extremely watery, and 3) no flavor. Quite disappointed. I'm sure we just need to tweak the recipe a little and adjust to taste at our next attempt at perfecting this dish. Despite the disappoint, this paste is really authentic and smells so good. Our entire apartment smelled like heaven as the paste was slowly bubbling on the stove. Also, it's much more expensive on Amazon - I found the exact same thing at my local Korean market for about $2.50.

Love the texture and taste. Great product.
They are not hard to bite and easily melt into small pieces when chewed.
This tea closely resembles the Gingerbread blend they currently sell, however, it tastes so much better.  There is an added ingredient or taste that just simply is missing from the gingerbread tea.  Bengal Spice tea is my new favorite tea.  I love the spicy initial taste, and depending on the cream you use, the after taste following is very uplifting.  It is a very rich tea and tastes very good with a sweet treat like some peanut M&Ms, or any other milk chocolate.

Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies.

+*Unsweetened:
7891	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Bengal Spice tea is completely intoxicating from the first whiff to the last drop! With cinnamon being the first ingredient, it adds a natural sweetness, and the longer it steeps, the better it tastes (though it does get spicier heat, which I like, but you may not). If you prefer your tea lightly brewed, you can reuse the tea bag for another cup. I usually drink it plain, but if I want a Chai-like treat, I add a little agave nectar and milk (you can use sugar and/or nut milks or soy milk too). It's also delicious cold.

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.

2677	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I'm a South Asian, I know how real, true chai is made. That being said, this chai is overwhelming with the clove flavor. Authentic spice chai includes cardamon (lots of it) and this is lacking in that. There is an extremely subtle coconut flavor but it's barely there. Overall I hate this stuff. It's way to heavy on the clove taste and light on everything else.
8951	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	THE BEST for rimming drink glasses, salting fancy dishes and just eating out of the box. It is crunchy, crisp and nice and salty. I would buy this again and again! Everyone always wants to know where I got this salt - very unique!
309	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I tried this Powerbar with another person.  We both were not pleased with the taste.  We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste, we didn't think we'd ever want another One!  I don't think we are going to finish this bar.  Not the best I've ever tasted and I would never buy this again!

There were a decent amount of broken/cracked almonds, I suppose this can't be avoided but it did seem a little more than expected - I'd say maybe 15-20% overall. Again totally ok to snack on and taste yummy even without soaking so we just eat the cracked and broken ones this way, but it was a little disappointing - could be how these large bags all come though regardless of brand

Here's the deal, in NC we don't use a BBQ sauce like y'all do over in Memphis, KC, or Texas except on chicken, sometimes.  This is a finishing sauce - not a cooking sauce. We use it on pig, after the pig has been cooked. In fact, we're known to cook the shoulder with nothing but the meat and fat and then season it after it's pulled.  It's mighty fine right off the heat plain but some folks like a little tang and a little bite - that's what this is for.

5310	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to hopefully make my uterus tighten more effectively for labor (with my midwife's OK).  I am a pharmacist, and usually very skeptical of the efficacy of natural products but I heard good things about this and was willing to give this a try after going 10 days overdue with my first baby.  So at 39 weeks pregnant, I steeped a teabag for 15 minutes and drank the tea.  I IMMEDIATELY started noticing strong/painful Braxton Hicks contractions, similar to right before I went into labor with my first daughter. I was very surprised as to how quickly I had an effect, and how well it seemed to work.  HOWEVER, I started drinking it a few days later on a regular basis, and noticed only very mild Braxton Hicks contractions afterwards. Not sure what happened the first time or if it even did anything, but I had my baby the day after my due date, and after only 3 hours of labor (and 2 pushes).

8693	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this salt.  It is easy to use, the flakes are much better than grains because it helps from over salting.  I even gave some to family for Christmas stocking stuffers and they loved it.

3137	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	My brother is a chiiehead and he warned me about Blair's being 'hot'. Blair's make a whole range of hot sauces, some of which are indeed outrageously high in Scoville units. This one however is quite good and about 6 times hotter than a Jalapeno. This is noticeably hotter than Tabasco but the flavor is similar to Tabasco. So, if you like that venerable standby but want something more, give this a try.
2792	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the best pre-packaged Chai I've ever found.  Sure, you can get some really amazing blends in loose leaf, but they are expensive.  The clove in this blend really blends well with the pepper and nutmeg.  The flavor is bold but smooth.  It's also very high in caffeine and makes a great tea to sip on in the morning.  If you really want to treat yourself, add some sweetened condensed milk to it.  It's so good, it's a dessert all on its own.

The reason for the exploding popularity of vitamin B-17, and thereby bitter almonds, was all due to the fact, that vitamin B-17 has dramatic and miraculous tumor-cancer killing properties. So, in 2007, the F.D.A. made the claim that raw almonds had been linked to TWO salmonella outbreaks in the past 500 years, and that all almonds needed to be PASTEURIZED For Safety. Almonds had suddenly become dangerous and an enemy of the death squad industry that feeds off and needs its victims (patients) in-order to survive. Versus, the pharmaceutical chemicals, radiation and nuclear poisons that have crippled, mutilated, destroyed and killed its millions, and have committed crimes and atrocity against humanity.

9042	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Maldon salt flakes may seem expensive, but they add a special flavor that can't be had any other way. And the fact that they're so finely flaked means that you only need to use a small amount. This is a finishing salt - for use at the table or just before presentation. To use it for cooking is a waste, since what makes it special (and effective) is the flaking process. Use regular sea salt for cooking. Well worth the money. Just be sure that you're getting it from a reliable seller. Some of those here ship from overseas, and if you're not very careful you could end up waiting the better part of a month for your order.

For about a year, I worked in an office which provided services for mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled persons. I loved our clients and their staff. But one thing about the job I didn't like was reconciling their expense ledgers each month. I am more of a word smith than a numbers person, so checking their math and making sure all the receipts for each household were in order was a nightmare for me. Hence, the need for Tension-Tamer Tea. I found a box in the break room at the office, and it really did help me mellow out for this odious task. It wasn't long before all the staff made the connection. They knew that when I had a cup of Tension Tamer Tea on my desk that they needed to be extra nice to me, because it was ledger time!

Still sweet and a little spicy, which mainly comes from the ginger. It has some pepper, but like the Original it's just enough to detect in a subtle way. It shares the same thick, rich base with the original, but has a 'tropical' flavor that I cannot fully identify. Probably because more mangos were possible used. The 20mg of sodium is less than half of what the Original sauce contains, which is a big plus for me. Despite the low sodium it still has a salty characteristic that makes it ideal on just about anything.

Recently I purchased a brand of Rosehip& Hibiscus tea that I was unfamiliar with due to the price point.  It tastes good, but gives me heartburn and is a lot more tart than my usual brand.  I decided to try it with this and I do like the combination.  I no longer get heartburn from drinking the Rosehip tea either.  My regular brand never gave me heartburn so this Bengal Spioe tea makes that bargain Rosehip tea a very palatable substitution.

8790	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I have used a screen popper over heated coils for 50 years...then add unsalted butter and popcorn salt.  Perfecto!  Too many of these did not pop fully to cut the mustard.  Perhaps hot oil fans will have more success.  Or hot air poppers--but being so small my guess is these kernels will exit before popping?  I ended up with too many old maids that tested the ivory.  Also, I usually use 1/3 cup of popcorn to fill the screen popper.  I used OVER 1/3 cup for this and only filled the screen 3/4 full--my first clue that too little popping was going on.  My guess is that the smaller kernels are trickier to pop fully.  My search continues.  Next up is their Baby Rice.  My dentist is loving it.

Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

In terms of sustainability, I think honey is one of the best sweeteners available, together with maple syrup. There is less processing (energy and materials) involved in producing honey compared to sugar, corn syrup, brown rice syrup, etc. Y.S. received organic certification for honey way back in 1995, and they are now quite a big operation, sourcing their honey from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and New Zealand. Id like to see more information on the Y.S. Organic website about how they monitor suppliers to ensure that they have good bee keeping standards. But they do say that hives are well isolated from any areas where pesticides are used, and they also avoid the chemicals that are used in conventional hives. The big problem of colony collapse disorder and the decline of bee populations has been in the news a lot recently, and I think that organic certification is important for the following reason: Organic certification requires that enough honey must be left in the hives to sustain the bees over the winter  conventional honey farmers often remove all or most of the honey and provide a substitute syrup (often high-fructose corn syrup) for the bees to eat instead. Research (published by May Berenbaum in PNAS in 2013) shows that depriving the bees of honey (and the propolis and pollen that comes with it) leaves the bees with weakened defenses against pathogens and also a reduced ability to cope with pesticides they encounter. On top of that, bees have been shown to store the high-fructose corn syrup, so some of it can end up directly in your honey. Also, some big conventional honey producers ship their bees around a lot and this can stress them, reducing immunity, and also spread pathogens around.
9538	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have many reviews for Barry Farm products here on Amazon.  Maybe a dozen or so.  If they are not the largest distributor of dried veggies, spices, herbs, etc, than they have to be very close.  I became familiar with Barry Farm products many years ago when I first started doing a lot of hiking.  Their freshness, convenience, and flavor has made them a regular staple carry along on my hikes.  This dehydrated celery stalk and leaf is one that I probably use the most for any camp cooking.  Simply because there is not a soup or stew that I make that doesn't include celery at home. This stalk and leaf product is an excellent alternative to fresh celery that for obvious reasons is not a practical take along on the trail. This product is very flavorful, and a little of it goes a long ways.  I would even  venture to say that in the wilderness, or even at home, this dried celery has even more flavor than fresh any time.  I think it may have something to do with the fact that this is dried from both celery stalks and leafs.  The leaf being something that most of us don't bother with at home.  Every time I have used this in a stew or soup I have easily tasted the celery distinctly in the most delicious of trail concoctions.  As I said before, a little of this goes a long ways. A 2 oz. package gets me easily through three large one pot meals on my hiking trips.

I do use ground meat to make jerky using a jerky gun to form it into shape. By doing this, you get flavor throughout the entire pieces of jerky. The best thing about these packet compared to others that I have used is the cure also comes in individual packets that are pre-measured. Also, it is not too salty like some other jerky spices that I have used that make you measure out the cure from a bulk packet. Bottom line, I will order these again when I run out.

I used a stove top popper with a hand crank to stir the popcorn as it's popping, and I simply dumped in the ingredients and started turning the crank.  The very fine grain salt was very uniformly applied to the popcorn and it adhered very well with no loose salt in the bottom of the bowl afterward.  I used 1/2 cup of popping corn, 1/4 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon of popcorn salt.  Delicious!  It's also a fairly healthy snack.  If you want some variety, try adding garlic powder, onion powder, nutritional yeast (sort of cheesy/savory), smoked chipotle powder (caliente!), taco seasoning, etc.
I would advise those sensitive to hot sauces to first test this on a toothpick. Also when cooking with it, make sure to pour the sauce into a spoon first, because a little bit of this sauce goes a long way, and the heat does take a minute or two to start to dissipate, you wouldn't want to ruin an entire dish by adding too much heat.

8377	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.

Be careful when purchasing, if you want this exact sauce. Lee Kum Kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce, but this is the best one they make, their "premium" oyster sauce. Still, I wonder why it's so expensive, since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it's made, getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they've been doing it for so long. Why so expensive. I imagine they charge so much because they can, since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.

France (I lived in the Touraine for seven years) and the salts from Maldon, UK, the Himalayas, Hawaiian Black Lava salt, Swedish Falksalt and many others. After all my trials, and I keep multiple salts on the table, I still come back to Le Saunier De Camargue as my favorite finishing salt. I recommend that people experiment with multiple salts to find out which is their taste preference and which works better for specific purposes.
My only complaint is that where the water-based and oil-based substances meet - there is a yellow line forming against the plastic bottles.... in other words, the dye appears to be staining the bottle itself or precipitating out of solution?

Mr. Macho didn't want to admit that it was super hot, bottle is still full lol.  It's pretty damn hot.  I smelled it and my sinuses were cleared (for me at least).  Enjoy your sauce, seems to be really good.  He said it wasn't vinegar tasting like most sauces are, it's just really hot.  Don't touch it and then your eyeballs or anything else... you'll be super sorry!  Also milk helps alleviate the pepper taste, water makes it worse (if you didn't know already).  Water swishes around the oils from the peppers, while dairy dulls the peppers.... good luck and enjoy your sauce!  Shipped perfectly and it was well packaged/sealed.  Thanks!
This flavor of Morning Thunder contains Mate and blend of black tea in a convenient tea bag in just the right mix. A very flavorful, in my opinion, basic tea. Notice I use the word tea without quotes, as the mate is not a real tea as per definition, but black tea is.
4471	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I was complaining to my friends in the cake community about how much this brand has gone up in price, or in general, how much good vanilla has gone up in price---but this is just worth the money. I can't say anything negative about this brand, besides (again) how much you must be willing to invest to get your hands on it. At one point this heavenly paste was under $40, now, you are lucky to get it under $80. The price has almost doubled all over the country, and believe me, I have been looking for it. I use this for cakes, buttercreams, anything I bake that requires vanilla. I only refrain from using it in chocolate cake/brownies, anything dark enough that the true beauty of the vanilla specs won't be noticed or appreciated. I use the legit Nielsen-Massey Pure Vanilla for those items. The first time I tried this brand I was hooked, and honestly it is going to take them taking it off the market to stop me from ordering it. If it ever goes back down in price, I am buying it by the case. Please, stop using that super market crap. Try it. Your customers will love you for it! Questions? Ask me :-)!

This is much more economical and I don't notice any difference in flavor. I love the fact that it comes in a large amount so I don't have to be ordering it every week. Lastly it comes as unwrapped tea bags in a box that's sealed wrapped. So once I opened a box, I just put a handful of tea bags in a Ziploc sandwich bag that I have out near my tea kettle. The rest of the tea bags in the open box I put in a large freezer size Ziploc bag (entire box fit ) and store in a cupboard.

I didn't want to try to explain the artificial coloring and artificial flavoring in the Flavacol.  I popped a batch of popcorn using organic popping corn (Great Northern, available on Amazon), organic coconut oil and this popcorn salt.  I was impressed!

It will knock you down, it will punch you in the face. It can cause delirious reactions as your body reacts to heat it's never experienced before. This makes normally 'hot' sauces taste like ketchup. Even a tiny toothpick full of this will set you on fire.. First your tongue will burn, then your lips will burn, then your entire mouth will flame up and your eyes and mouth will start draining massive fluid. Then as it slides down your throat your entire throat will flame up and become infused with blow torch levels of heat. If you survive you will not likely remember much of the delirium you experienced which rivals an out of body experience.  Think I am joking? Then prove me wrong.

4112	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I typically like anything lemon; however,this is a big disappointment.  It has a "fake" lemon flavor and is a bit too sweet.  Sometimes makers of products containing non-sugar sweeteners have a tendency to overdo it.  Although the chocolate and chocolate cappuccino flavors are wonderful, I would definitely skip this lemon version.
6125	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  It is rich tasting, and full of healthy goodness.  It is USDA Certified Organic so you don't have to worry about pesticide contamination or any of the nasty HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup} that most other 'honey' is polluted with. This is pure raw honey with all the goodness you would expect from a great natural product.  I use it to sweeten my coffee/tea, put on toast or bagels, sweeten oat meal... etc. etc.  It might just be the worlds most perfect food.
8948	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this sea salt! It has an almost addictive subtle crunch which adds a layer of delight to the tongue on top of whatever I am eating it with, and it has no harshness or chemical after taste that I have experienced with some other salts. I take a small amount of the salt and store it in my two mini salt pigs on the table where it is easy to take just a pinch of salt when I want it. I then store the rest in a strongly sealed container, because I find that if it is not stored well, it loses some of its snow like consistency and gets too hard.

BUT - and I am not sure why - if you use it in something like Tea or Coffee, it doesn't take a lot to make a nice sweet taste without any of the bitterness or aftertaste when it is tasted by itself. This is great in Tea and a great alternative to Splenda and other sweeteners. Also, the price of this item is unbelievable at the $1.99 for 50 packets as it was when I purchased.

It may be different for you depending on how often you make curry.  The ingredients for this paste are clean and are whole30 and paleo compliant.  The flavor is amazing, and I usually only need about 1 tbsp of this paste to deliver all of the robust flavor I need.  This container is about the size of a pint of ice cream, but not as tall.  But yes, it's large.  The paste comes in a sealed plastic bag inside of the plastic container.  I just cut a corner off the top and squeeze out what I need.

I like that it has Aspartame (Equal) as a sweeter because of the need to watch my glucose levels. Unfortunately, so many people have been taken in by controversies spread through elaborate health scares and Internet smear campaigns involving hoax e-mails.

If you like a very sweet tea and you never get sick of 'sweet', I'd try this. I think it could even calm a raging sweet-tooth.

3920	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	It seemed like forever before this item got here and when it did the bottles were much smaller than I was expecting. Knoor usually make a decent product but this tasted a tad stale. I'll stick with Tones.
1034	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The jerky made with the basic recipe is OK. I would suggest adding some additional spices if you would like more flavor. This is basic jerky made with a mixture of beef and pork.
5770	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I use this in food recipes and in a recipe for a body wash. It is wonderful!
FYI-read the ingredients, this product does not contain tea leaves. The base (after cinnamon) is roasted chicory and roasted carob.
1637	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	the best I could have not got anything else better freshly and the taste is awesome
3200	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The bag was open.  Great product in the past.  I work in retail and your business won't make it you don't have employees who truly care.  Won't be back.
7827	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Hello. I just purchased this product today. I won't be using it for about 4 months. I was wondering how long it will last unopened in a cool dried area. Should it be put in the fringe? I am confident that the product is going to be great help in the kitchen, just hope I make it in time.
Highly recommend this to all!
5246	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	You won't find this quality and spectrum of ingredients in any other product and price
On the positive side this stuff does seem to give me energy. The first day I took a teaspoon i felt like i drank a giant cup of coffee. I don't know if it was this stuff or not but i felt pumped up for awhile.
9551	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this to make cookies with red color, not wanting to use an unnatural red dye.  The flavor was off-putting and the color was not what I was looking for.
2910	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	They are wonderful!!
8924	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product. Light, delicate and great addition to desserts.
8631	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It's good for certain foods. Helps relieve joint inflammation.  I really didn't notice any difference.  Maybe I need to use more.

3838	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	First, I ordered on 3/2 and received on 3/4.  Now that's service!  Second, this is incredibly good stuff!  I had been looking for golden syrup specifically to make a recipe called British Flapjacks, but it was not to be found anywhere near where I live, not even at Whole Foods.  I made the recipe using brown rice syrup and was pretty pleased, but I really wanted to make it "authentic" as the golden syrup is supposed to make all the difference.  So I decided to check at Amazon, and here it is.  I should have known.  I must say that the packing was not the best, 6 bottles just rolling around inside a box, but all were intact and no leaking, so I lucked out there.  So I'm off to make my British Flapjacks with my golden syrup. Yum yum.

4783	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I started making my own sushi, and this pickled ginger is a perfect accompaniment. It has a very nice, sharp tang (and it's not the really fake pink of some pickled ginger I've seen in restaurants). I can't find this in my local stores, so it was a good buy for me.
7467	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	One of my two favorite teas !
In general I do like this royal jelly in honey and I am happy to have made this purchase. I might not replace it as soon as it is empty, only because I have neglected honeys in my pantry that would enjoy the attention of a daily spoon.
1674	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this for a close family member, and they invited me to enjoy it with them. Boy, oh boy. I ended up sneaking back to the fridge to munch on this stuff. The Cahills went first, but all of them were enjoyable. Mostly sharper cheeses, but not extra sharp.

7402	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love these. We mix them, 4 cups to a gallon of decaf tea, and use it as flavored tea at lunch and dinner. Everyone seems to like it.
3343	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My daughters got me hooked on Jelly Belly after they took the factory tour in Fairfield, California.  I've driven past their factory many times and never had time to take the tour.  But I did stop a few times just long enough to buy the licorice jelly beans in bulk - taste so good  I eat them in moderation as a snack while watching my evening movie.  And now that I moved to Texas I buy them via Amazon.

6092	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The only honey that I consume now that I have had a taste of it. Good in tea or coffee also. Would recommend this product to all those who love honey.
3435	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Bought for my husband. He loves it. Great price too
She is thrilled.
Here is your solution! Brew this tea strong, I do 1.5 cups boiling water for two tea bags, steep, remove bags and add a touch of xanthan gum and stevia. Then add a cup of ice and stir to chill and dilute.  BAM! Calorie free and sugar free Peach Nectar!  Great alone or with vodka and fresh lime juice for a great summer cocktail.
8394	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this to try & replace the more expensive non-fortified Sari brand we usually buy, so far we are happy with our purchase! :)
1374	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Despite the bottle size, there isn't much content. But for the price, it's a good way to try working with dashi. Like the other reviewers, I agree that it has a very strong fishy smell. But once its in water, the smell is pleasant and the flavor is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of salt, so I tend to use prepared stock items very sparingly, which is the perfect plan for this item as well.
8310	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Good product and good packaging
8698	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Wow...tastes like no salt I have every had before.  So good!  Just takes a small pinch...it can be overpowering if you splash it on  like regular table salt.
This helpful herb can assist the digestive system and can sometimes prove beneficial for seasickness, morning sickness, and chemotherapy.
9186	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This salt is good for putting on top of focaccia.  It looks good and has a nice crunch without getting a "rock" in your mouth.

2803	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I've had to cut back on caffeine, and diet soda in general, so I was on a mission to find an alternative. This tropical fruit tea fit all my needs....good taste, sugar free, and caffeine free. I use an extra bag or two, and brew it a little longer, and it tastes just like fruit punch. The cold brew feature makes it so easy and convenient. I highly recommend it to adults as well as kids.
1842	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Cookies came package very well and might I add delicious cookies nice and soft I had to place another order love them.
1892	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	delicious
8954	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this salt. I am a salt fanatic and use at least 15 different types. This is the one salt that I use every single day. The flakes are quite large and thin so it really adds to the dish from a presentation perspective. I won't serve a steak or tomato without a pinch of this salt. I just wish it came in better packaging. I don't use salt containers. The majority of my salt comes in fancy containers. This one has a simple plastic bag inside that is not resealable. Moisture has never been an issue for me. I do live in an area with high humidity but the salt never picks up the moisture.
3386	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Good flavor but it takes a lot to give that vanilla taste I love. We do use it in our breakfast shakes.
2391	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	gr8 use in coffee
5234	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product and it literally warms our memories from another place. It arrived in good condition and fresh. However, the shipping charges on my entire order was way out of line and extremely expensive!! This company is efficient to do business with, but the shipping charges are a rip-off!
3532	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What is better than the smell of strong coffee in the morning? This reminds you of mornings in New Orleans. If you love strong coffee this is the one for you.
4413	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I thought this was pure clear vanilla extract and it is imitation.  I will continue my search for pure clear vanilla extract.
2238	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this plant for my husbands desk 5 months ago. It is still alive and thriving. When we received the plant it was packaged nicely, and did not loose many leaves. People ask him where we bought it!
8173	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What can I say?  This tea is delicious and calming....it is wonderful during any season!  Love it!  :)
6782	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is to die for!!!!! Really adds to any seafood dish you are making! Highly recommend this product! Yummy!

Nice flakes!
Honey is great for natural skin care. I use it sparingly in my face masks since I have oily skin. It is amazing and leaves skin nice and soft afterwards.

out across the popcorn with a hint of salt.
8061	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this variety pack because it contains no duds whatsoever. Each flavor is enjoyable. It also has remarkable ingiridents in each flavor. I tend to let it steep closer to the 6 minutes that is recommended. Doing that I get a nice fruit flavor and a very relaxing and enjoyable drink. With fall here and winter coming up these are GREAT to have on hand. Quality ingridients and great taste = a very nice value. Recommended.
  Iced (4.5) - slightly thinner taste, this is likely attributed to the melting of the ice when I poured it over. The flavor is still sweet and taste is good I could easily drink this with no sweetener.
8894	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Took a long time to arrive from the UK,  but I have to say,  the flaky-crustiness of this salt is excellent for finishing your finest baked goods or for topping off a finely prepared dinner.
9180	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	A Chef recommended Maldon's as a must have for the serious cook.  I couldn't agree more.  Not to be wasted, it provides a excellent finish to serious dishes.
That said, it's fine salt. It's neither better nor worse than any other salt you may have ever tasted. So it's usable, but just supremely overpriced.
2936	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Good quality product
Buy with confidence!

3971	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is perfect for fresh fruits! I LOVE cucumbers and this makes them even more amazing. Yes cucumbers are fruit. Mix in some honey crisp apples and oh my gosh yum! Put it on oranges, mango, watermelon, pretty much any fresh fruit and you won't be disappointed. I always have a stash of this in my pantry.
3498	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have six different types of Cajun coffee in my kitchen cabinet and this is my favorite. Strong, slightly bitter and creamy all at the same time. Buy this AND buy the Beignet mix then close your eyes, eat, drink and take a quick trip to NOLA.
3109	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	decent sauce, not nearly as spicy as i thought it would be. if you have ever had a straight up naga jolokia and expect this to be as hot, you will be disappointed.
2511	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	good.

I'll definitely order them again when the time comes!
1061	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	good tasting
In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce.  When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date.  It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid.  They wanted me to mail it back to them.  If I could do that I wouldn't have ordered BBQ sauce online.  Not everyone can get to the post office.  What a complete waste of money and time.
9222	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Excellent!
1606	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	wonderful,  tasty and moist

1044	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Just what I expected.
9395	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is completely different from other black licorice. Soft black chews that don't have that strange harsh burning flavor you'd expect but has a mellow smoothness. Somehow it retains intense licorice flavor. Mildly sweet, not cloying at all. A look at the ingredients list is very revealing:
3992	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Everybody should have a bottle of this stuff on the counter. It's salty - touch of heat -sour from the lime. Perfect to sprinkle on fruit, sandwiches, rice and beans, salads. The more we have this around, the more we use it.  Our Mexican friends have a point with this stuff.
To me, this sauce is hot hot hot, but, not way too hot to force you jump into cold shower...it leaves a very pleasant and torturous after effect that last no more than 15 minutes...it actually tastes too..
3687	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I like it when the only ingredient is Pecans!  Nothing else!  Expensive though I am not sure I will buy again unless the price gets lower,
Even if you do not have asthma the tea will also help you breathe better with respiratory infections.  Just recently I had the flu for several weeks with much coughing the tea was AWESOME.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BREATHING AILMENT.............

Hopes weren't dashed!  This is a really good tea!  If you don't like licorice, then there's probably something wrong with you... sorry.  I like licorice and don't really understand why it gets a bad rep.
pan.
8958	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is some top of the line salt. These crystals are formed in a shape of a pyramid, which gives them excellent texture and crunch. This is a finishing salt, meaning that you don't cook with it, but rather sprinkle on your food right before eating.
241	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	just like I remember as a kid

3086	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a review on Swedish Fish the candy, not the online sellers. I do not buy my candy online if I can purchase it fresh in stores.
Amazon's price for this is super, too.  The 8.5-oz box lasts a long time for me.  Definitely my first choice in salt.

9888	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	So glad finally got some great yeast.  The initial and final rise on my bread was so much better.  The crumb came out great!
Just not for us. We were trying to be healthy-ish so we thought a small amount of salt might help.
8088	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We order by the case. This peppermint is clear and strong tasting. Celestial Seasonings is great at packaging the taste as if you just picked the leaves. During cold winter months we drink this tea every night.
963	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great product! Never waters down my icing!!
2565	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Incredible tea, I buy it in these 6box packs every few months. I drink several cups a day. Delicious tea that I now worry over if I run low on it!
4477	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love this brand. sad vanilla prices keep going up but its a great quality product
1682	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Third years in a row
345	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Stains your skin really bad! The colors are not accurate. I didn't get patriotic red and blue, I got a funny shade of pink and teal blue. It also is just a jar and not a dropper so it's extremely messy. The jars are pretty little. Not a fan of these at all!
279	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Banana is terrible. You can taste the crushed up vitamins and minerals more than the banana flavor. Wild Berry is delicious, the 2 stars are only for the banana.

If you know how to use these lemons then they are great, but don't buy them thinking they tastes like a regular lemon. If you plan on substituting these from regular lemons then be sure to use HALF the amount.
4856	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a repeat buy for me. I find this brand by Spectrum essential is a very good one. It is organic which is what I am looking for. I take this mainly for constipation but also for the omega 3's in plant form.
7197	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We really like all Celestial Seasonings teas.  I mix it with regular tea for a little extra flavor.  Great price and all  of the flavors  taste wonderful.
The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.
5924	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my 2nd order, Iove the taste and my husband uses too much for his hibiscus tea!

We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful! It tastes great (I enjoy it  myself) and it is an effective breathing aid.
1415	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Once I had the time to learn to cook my favorite Chinese restaurant dishes from scratch, it didn't take long for me to find the best Chinese cook books and the best ingredients. Some of my family's favorite Chinese restaurant dishes are Potstickers, Broiled Wings, Egg Foo Yung, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Fried Rice and any chicken dishes. I found all these in my favorite old cook book from 1983- Better Homes And Gardens Cooking Chinese.  To say the recipes are exactly like our favorite Chinese restaurant dishes would be an understatement. These recipes are THE BEST and even better than the restaurant's dishes.
4079	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I actually first had this stuff in Disneyland, of all places. My husband bought a bowl of cut up fruit at a snack bar and there was a little packet of this stuff in there. I love it. It's spicy, not unbearably hot (I can only take so much heat in my food, and this is bearable), has a bit of sour from lime and counterbalances the sweetness of fruit with salt. I eat a lot of apples with this stuff on it. I slice a whole apple up, and sprinkle it on. I probably have about 7-10 apples a week now, because I prefer this type of snack to chips or ice cream!
4384	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Amazing, my favorite vanilla extract. Delicious flavor. A high quality product. Madagascar vanilla beans are manufactured into extract at two locations: USA and The Netherlands.
3379	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	great color and taste - used for a batch of vegan matcha brownies and it tasted amazing!

 However it compensates for that with trucktons of chile flavor. Which make it perfect for more delicate foods such as plain yogurt, sushi, cheeses,sorbet, you name it!
PS: I use less bags to get solid flavor than any other tea (6 instead of 8 in a pitcher) so it's well worth the price, just ordered 6 more boxes!
828	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Last night I  bought a Luna Chocolate Peppermint Stick for dessert with my evening meal. The texture was somewhat like saw-cutting grains stuck together but the flavor was quite good, one of the better-tasting nutrition bars. Not bad at all. I guess the granular thingy indicates a lot of fiber, and I can stand that. My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market had them on sale for a buck each. Good deal.
* To treat allergies the honey should be local so the bees have made the honey from the local pollen.
7693	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Very big disappointment because there is so LITTLE cherry taste. will not be buying  again.
My second favorite cook book is also an older book- from 1981-Betty Crocker's Chinese Cookbook by Leeann Chin. There are no Potsticker recipes, but so many delicious chicken ones are in here. The Potstickers are a very time consuming labor of love, so I learned to put a day aside to make them. Once you make the delicious dough, you seal the cooked pork or beef filling inside, not cooking the Potsticker yet, then I wrap up 6 at a time in saran wrap. I then double wrap them and seal them in a freezer bag. I keep them in the freezer until I need them. Because they take so long to prepare, I make a double batch- having dozens to freeze- they stay perfect for a few months in the freezer. When I want to make them- I just take them from the freezer to the refrigerator, and leave them in the refrigerator all day thawing (at least 5 hours). They are then ready to easily cook- I just brown the bottoms for a minute with a tiny bit of oil, then add water, cover and 10-12 minutes later, they are ready to eat.
9657	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this because I had a cake order that required black sprinkles of course by the person that requested the cake. Nothing different than all other sprinkles, since I didn't have black I needed to order it. Its tasteful if you like sprinkles, which I don't, but customers sometimes want it
Since this has sugar in it, I do not use at night after I brush my teeth so no sugar will be left on my teeth as I sleep.

1976	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Thank you  This is so close to what I make The cookies are just a little harder than mine but yours are so good 
I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me. I really wanted to like this tea, because it smells so great, but I guess I'll be on the look-out for something else.
8529	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Freaking delicious. I use NY in my salads, dressings and pates I make with almonds or sunflower seeds. This has a rich, deep semi-cheesy flavor. Great product!
5414	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Tastes great, best deal I could find!
8527	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I recently found out about this and have used it several times a week since. I love adding it to vegetables and fake Mac & Cheese. No problems with this brand, have gone through several bags.
8190	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I performed a side by side comparison to the Kraft powder.  No comparison!!!  This cheese powder is far superier to the Kraft.  The cheesiest.

7734	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love this peppermint tea! The 25-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) is perfect if you're like me: you love the Celestial Seasonings teas, but prefer your tea bags to be individually wrapped with a string, so the freshness is ensured, but also so you can throw a few tea bags in your purse to work without dragging a whole box of tea around or stuffing them in a zip lock baggy! Also very good if you use a tea bag organizer /caddy, since they're wrapped individually. As much as I understand the logic of going stringless, etc, there are moments in time where you simply don't want to mess with that.  The string is good for those who don't like to leave their tea in past the steeping time & who may not be equipped with a spoon (at work for example) to remove the bag.
1478	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the only shrimp sauce that I can use since I am on a strict elimination diet because I am breastfeeding my son.  I cook with this and he wouldn't break out.  It makes my so upas and salads more flavorful since I don't have many choices of ingredients to cook with on my diet.
Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.
One note, however, Amazon really should list the ingredients here on the site.

8567	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I used to consume Yeast for folic acid. Lewis Labs was the best till few years ago Russian chose to play with it since it became so valuable for the production of their alcoholic beverages. After the fermentation process is completed the yeast is harvested, thoroughly washed, pasteurized, and dried on roller drum dryers. The B vitamins are both naturally produced during fermentation, and added to the cream prior to the drying process. Riboflavin (B2) and Cyanocobalamin (B12) are created during fermentation. Additional Riboflavin (B2) and Cyanocobalamin (B12) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine (B1), Pyridoxine HCL (B6), Niacin and Folic Acid. Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements, where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements.
1981	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	It takes 2 teabags of this to make a single 12-oz cup of tea steeping for 5 minutes.

Almonds have a host of health benefits, and are a great addition to a trail mix. They're also great slightly roasted or for use in an almond milk recipe. For anyone considering these, opt for the larger 2-3 lb size as the value is much better, and the quality does not suffer. If you don't mind picking out a few bad ones, opt for the 5 lb one.

6328	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Since I have always loved the taste of malt, I grew up drinking malteds, made from real malt powder.  My faves were chocolate and banana.  When I became an adult, it occurred to me that you could hardly find a real malted any longer--only "shakes".  Also, as an adult, I begin to bake my own bread and discovered, through reading a lot of information about bread-baking, that "barley malt" was an ingredient that artisan bakers used in their loaves.  At first I purchased the liquid form of barley malt and didn't even connect the fact that this was real "malt", only in liquid form.  I added it to some of my bread recipes and the result was a positive one, in yielding  richer tasting breads.  But the problem with the liquid is that you refrigerate it, and subsequently, it is a sticky, syrupy substance--difficult to measure out.  Hence, my interest in the powder form of malt.  This product is the real thing.  It has NO ADDED SUGAR, like most other products do.  Other recognizable-named products work well, if you just want a "drink powder", but if you want the most nutritious substance, able to enhance your yeast baking, AND to make divine malteds and ice cream sundaes, GET THIS PRODUCT.  I will continue to buy this pure Barley Malt Powder.  Love it!

In conclusion, I highly recommend carob powder for anyone that prefers a little healthier alternative drink to real hot chocolate, and without any of the caffeine. Or, if you just happen to be one of those poor unfortunates that is allergic to chocolate. I still today buy it from Barry Farms and take it along on my own hikes here for I am so used too, and have taken a liking to its flavor over the years.  If you decide to give it a try, I recommend buying two or more pounds at a time to make the shipping a better deal.  The Barry Farms carob is a very good quality product, and has been around for many years.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I had some pizza with Volcano Powder (powdered Bhut Jolokia, also ordered from Amazon) dusted all over it until it looked like cinnamon toast, and then sprinkled liberally with the Daves.  Man, oh man, what an amazing combination!!!  I'm not really a big pizza fan, but this was pretty incredible.  The Volcano Powder gave it an added smokiness, and with the fruity flavors from the Daves, it was just a glorious chorus of heat and flavor.  And I do mean heat - whoa, Nellie!!!  I didn't get quite to the snot-slinging, gasping and choking stage, but I had a pretty good forehead sweat going on before it was done, and I think my sinuses will be clear for a week!

When I first opened a box, all I could smell was cinnamon, which made me think I was going to hate this tea. As soon as I poured hot water into my mug, the smell changed completely and so did my expectations. The cinnamon scent wasn't as dominant as it was when the tea bag was dry, and there was a wonderful chicory scent that gave me hope. The hint of allspice and star anise compliment this tea perfectly without overpowering it. It tastes like nothing I've ever drank before, and even though it doesn't taste much like coffee to me, I like it so much that I drink a cup almost every day.

It is also very easy to make, and the cost per serving, which works out to 35 cents per serving is incredibly low (but I think most folks will eat a larger serving than what is suggested on the box).  I also recommend the strawberry flavor of this product. However, the key lime flavor had a bit of an artificial taste to it.

Since then, any time I'm attracted to a new Celestial Seasonings product, I first read the ingredients. They used to be a company I trusted -- not anymore -- although I still love their (as-yet) soy-free Bengal Spice; India Spice Chai; Nutcracker Sweet Holiday Tea; Sleepytime; Echinacea Complete Care; Vanilla/Strawberry/Rose Ceylon Black Tea; Moroccan Pomegranate; and Red Safari Spice.  But I now carefully check those labels too whenever I buy a new batch lest Celestial Seasonings have pulled a fast-one and added soy lecithin to them as well!
Sweetness dominates the flavor profile. It's definitely not syrup sweet, but is thick and viscous and gets that aspect from the cane sugar and raisins in the mix. The lowdown comes from the balance of tart and sour that the cane vinegar and tamarind contribute. Also, although this is not by any means spicy there is a hint of pepper that adds the lightest touch of the piquant.

I have converted people just by putting a pinch on their food. I recently got this one, and it is great. A real Fleur de Sel should be moist, and this one is. I DON'T use this for cooking, I like it best at the end. It's like adding a touch if fine flavor. Plus, one can have the amount of salt preferred this way.

7146	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I first tried Celestial Seasonings tea when I was a kid, their Sleepy Time tea. It wasn't until this year that I discovered their Jammin Ginger tea, I am so glad I did. I bought it because I deal with nausea daily and it's one of the worst feelings in the world. I'd always heard ginger was great but I tried the candy and fresh ginger was too much for me. I also tried other brands of ginger tea- which helped but just didn't taste good at all. Some had a spicey taste that didn't agree with me. Luckily I happened to see this lemon ginger tea at the supermarket and figured I'd try it. It was expensive, a little under $4 but cheaper than a prescription. I could not believe how great this tea tastes- but knew if it was Celestial Seasonings it would be good. It didn't have the spicy taste like every other kind I'd tried and I honestly started feeling my nausea go away in minutes. I've been paying way to much at the grocery store, but when you find something that works so well it's worth the money. Since I usually drink at least one cup a day, usually two, I was thrilled to see it on Amazon- and the price was half of what I was paying. I ordered 8 boxes, I often give it to guests when the visit, so many people have told me how great it is. It's not just for nausea, for me it has a calming effect as well, not sleepy though.

8410	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I bought mine elsewhere, but the expiration date is far away so it is not old or stale. In the past I've used nutritional yeast, including Frontier brand, and liked it. However, my latest bag of it was terrible. It has a nearly gagging effect when tasted - strong and foul. Adding seasoning, etc. did not help. Last night I started a batch of kale crackers with the nutritional yeast in the food dehydrator, and my home has been reeking of the yeast, despite the lemon juice, garlic, and chia seeds that were added to the cracker batter. It's just disgusting, so this morning I threw out the remainder of the yeast.
Following the instructions, I added a bit of almond milk (which I discovered can curdle a bit), but opted to skip the extra sweetener.  While still good, I actually liked it better without milk added.  Though I am not a latte drinker, and have had some less than stellar experiences with mate, this tea gets the thumbs up.

While two outbreaks may bring bad publicity and economic losses to the almond industry, it does not prove that almonds are inherently unsafe. Is it justified to impose these onerous regulations on an entire industry, impacting all consumers, because of two relatively small outbreaks, one of which has been traced to Paramount Farms, a giant, industrial-scale farming operation raising 70,000 of acres of nut crops, that is by no means representative of the industry as a whole?"

QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.

This definitely has a strong fruity taste and it's a lovely reddish-purple color.  The aroma carries in a small room and, when I wrote this, my office smelled wonderful as a result.  This does get a bit tart if you leave the tea bag in for too long.  If you're using sweetener, you probably won't even notice the tartness.  Personally, I drink this without any milk or sweetener.

I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME.  It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores, but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment.

The things that arrived this week were perfectly round, dome-shaped, made from yellow dough, low on chocolate chunks (which seemed more like baking chocolate), WAY too vanilla tasting, and too chewy.

My cat doesn't seem to notice this particular ingredient though - which is a good thing because we'd have to fight over this wonderful tea. It has a smooth, unique flavor.

Seems like great quality, and I've never been disappointed.  I used to buy Bob's Red Mill brand, but was concerned about the possibility of MSG being a by-product of the process.  From what I've read Frontier's method gives less potential for MSG.  If anyone can back that up, I'd appreciate it.

I wanted this tea to see whether it could help clear my vocal cords which seem to think they still have a rotten cold that left the rest of me weeks ago. I don't know whether that will work - hate singing in choir with a raspy voice - but can report that this box of tea is delightfully fresh with a code date somewhere in 2018 and it makes a cup of tea that has no caffeine but great zing hot or cold. Most pleased.

2543	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I have been a Celestial Seasonings fan for years and the old versions of their Peach tea I used to make iced tea the traditional way were great. I make iced tea of some type every day and I had high hopes for this. But truthfully, this tastes terrible, and I am accused by friends and family of liking almost anything! The up front taste is bland at best but the aftertaste is just strange. Peach? Peach is my single favorite flavor and this tastes nothing like peach. I figured out the problem. Take one of the bags and put in in a cold glass of water by the string and watch carefully while you dip up and down. What you see is very different than traditional tea leaves. You will see a powdery substance disolving in the tea. So aha! That is how they have it ready in 5 minutes. This is mostly a powdered tea, not steeped from real leaves like traditional tea. Yeah, there are tea leaves in there, but the flavor is coming from the powder. Then the tast problem hit me. You know that horrific Lipton powdered ice tea stuff? Are youi cringing recalling that strange taste? Well, that is the same flavor, albeit much weaker in this stuff. As usual in life, there aren't many short cuts if you want the really good stuff. Make tea the right way and skip this stuff. In the interest of truth in labelling, this should be called powdered instant tea.

To get the really full bodied flavor that I like, I only get one cup of tea to the tea bag; for that reason I have this on subscription so that I will not run out.  Great product.
We tried to eat a few of them, but they were just too bad to eat.

Overall, this syrup is some of the best around. And the price is pretty decent, esp. if you use the "Subscribe and Save" option. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal in the store, and Coombs is probably the best offering here on Amazon.
2399	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends.  This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea.  The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice.  Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.

In terms of making mac and cheese, I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk (as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I picked this up from my local grocery store because it was only $13 for the same quantity.  I like to drink Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Tea at work.  I use 3 bags, add 2 or 3 teaspoons of cream and 1 teaspoon of sugar for my 22oz mug.  I did the same with this and the taste was far too light, not enough spice.  I will try it in my mug without the cream and perhaps in a few days, as part of my iced tea brew then update this post.

One difference between the two is that the Celestial Seasonings tea bags come bulk packages in each box, with the tea bags group in tear-apart two-bag pieces.

When I do not have time, or the local supermarket is short on peppers, Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper edition is the next best thing.  I add about a dime size drop to my bowl of chili and it brings up the heat right to where I like it, and also adds a very pleasant smokey flavor to boot!

But this stuff....  this is like dropping the bomb.  I was in love with this stuff before I hit the end of the first cup, and dreading the end of the box.  I've flogged around since the end of that box and tried Stash's salted caramel mate'.  Nope, not even in the same class.  This stuff has the slight hint of real chocolate (not artificial) and that lovely buttery taste of mate'.  If you're enough of a chocohaulic to buy chocolate tea, then I recommend hunting up a box of this stuff from somewhere.  I doubt you'll go back to those other chocolate teas, even if it's significantly more.  Me, I'm hunting around for an online deal where I can push the price down as far as possible.

300	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted "like vitamins", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar.

 My opinion of the qualities are somewhat middle of the road. Overall quality, excellent. The flakes are smaller, which is not a big deal to me. The flavor is not as "buttery-cheesy" as some I've had. Good, but not the knock-your-socks-off wonderful. Still, I've ordered it twice on here.

That was my first experience with salt other than kosher salt. Of course it had Fleur De Sel.  7 different to be exact. I liked the "Velvet" gray salt's texture But this has been by far my best salt. It feels almost damp and the crystal sizes vary. I grilled two steaks the other day and decided not to salt before or while cooking. I used my other favorite seasonings but waited until the steak was plated to add this salt. I watched it melt on the surface of those still sizzling steaks,  It was so excellent.  Morton's girl still has her spot in history and this isn't for everything (like using this to pickle would make me miss a mortgage payment), don't miss a payment!  but try something different every now and then.

Eleuthero has been shown to be effective as a treatment for the common cold when combined with andrographis in a formula sometimes referred to as Kan Jang. Preliminary evidence also suggests that eleuthero may prove valuable in the long-term management of various diseases of the immune system, including HIV infection and chronic fatigue syndrome. Healthy people taking 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of tincture three times daily have been shown to have increased numbers of the immune cells (T4 lymphocytes) that have been found to decrease during HIV-infection and AIDS. Further human clinical trials are needed to confirm that eleuthero may be helpful for this disease.

3570	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	 A review from Mrs. L. My father-in-law was such a grand soul. Highly educated, well read, artistic, Loved classical as well as contemporary music. Recited poetry from memory at the breakfast table. He did not tolerate cooking very well, preferring to load the table with sumptuous feasts purchased from the deli or local bakeries. BUT! Every Thanksgiving and Christmas he soaked a bag of gigantic Lima beans. Then he painstakingly cooked and stirred and spiced and annotated a huge cast iron pot of those limas. When the concoction was mysteriously perfect, this gargantuan pot was shakily hoisted into the oven to bake for what seems hours. "Get outta the way!" he would yell, "I gotta get this thing in the oven!" My first Christmas at his house, I mistakenly wondered why there was such a reverence for this cooking endeavor with a bunch of dried Lima beans. The pot of limas took preference in the oven to all other dishes. Even the turkey AND THE HAM!!! Oh. my . Word.
9560	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the first time ordering this as I use it in my husbands egg muffins and he liked it.  I will be ordering more.  Nice to have around for tacos.

Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.

Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.

Kept in its bag and original cup in the fridge.  Green is the hottest and all have very distinct  and different flavors. It's easy to whip up a tasty, authentic dinner, usually with cubed chicken and eggplant or zucchini, carrots and bamboo shoots. I like it hot, so I use a good amount. If you don't like spicy, use very sparingly but be prepared for less flavor.  Serve over cooled Jasmine rice

As Earl Gray, this tea just doesn't measure up. However, because I enjoyed the tea so much anyway, I've decided to rate it as "excellent" black tea with the subtle but distinct flavor of oranges. I would add this to my grocery list of they still made it.

Because it hasn't been heat treated, the natural enzymes haven't been denatured, none of the nutritional value has been lost, and the food is still completely raw. In other words, this is what bees eat.

I know someone who went to a function and put a big steak on his plate. He then just happened to "pour" a bit of Dave's Insanity Sauce on his steak. Well he must have thought this was Tiger sauce or something for nothing could prepare him for what came next. He took a bite of his steak and instantly felt like his mouth was on fire. This experience lasted hours and hours. This person claims they will be more careful next time. A few drops is probably all you need. But the story was great and I remembered this sauce because of it. So unless you want a good story to talk about with your friends...be very cautious. And have milk handy.

7706	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Celestial Seasonings is a very good company.  Blueberry tea is my favorite type of tea.  The flavor of the blueberry in this one is much better than the Carrington tea.  And I think, it's equal to the Stash Blueberry Superfruit tea.  The price was very good, 14 cents per bag is great.  At Shoppers, Giant, and Safeway, we pay about 55 cents per bag.  My only complaint is the same as with Carrington.  I wish they would individually wrap each tea bag.  Instead, it arrives in very good packaging.  You open the cardboard box, and there are the tea boxes, like what you see in the picture.  Very nice.  Then, you open that box, and there is a simple little bag holding the bags.  There are 20 total tea bags.  The bags are each connected to one other bag.  So, there are 10 strips of (2) tea bags each.  You open it, love the first tea, but then feel the clock running as the freshness leaves the remaining 19 bags.  It's a premium product, I'd individually wrap them.  Or, at least have little packages with two in each, that would save 50% of the cost of individual wrapping, and resolve 90 percent of the problem.

I could only assume it to be a single dose bottle and so I continued to consume the medicine, only stopping to occasionally clear my sinus palate with sorbet. Approximately half gone, my straw beginning to dissolve, I looked at the bottle and found that the Professor's picture had become animated and was telling me to turn around and to look...and there was my dog...with Jack Nicholson's head upon it's body! Grabbing my cape and cane I hurried out, flagged down a handsome and spent the night performing death defying leaps upon the rooftops of London...or so I thought.

I purchased this for recreational snacking, no other purpose. I like trying different super foods, and I really like this particular royal jelly. I often get tired and become useless around 2:00pm, but that has changed. If I take a teaspoon of royal jelly in the late morning, before I normally get tired, then I have more energy and can power through an afternoon without espresso. This may simply be the effect of the sugar content, and I won't be surprised if that is the case.

I would recommend taking some time to research it if you're interested, it makes many claims of benefits, but I am not informed enough to say whether or not they are true. Either way the use of this ingredient would not sway my purchase one way or the other unless the alternative was extremely high in g of sugar or made with the sweeteners known to cause issues.

Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).
2642	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	To me this tastes a lot like an unsweetened version of Hawaiian Punch. Of course, whether you like this or not will depend on what sort of flavor profile you are looking for and I was looking for a very fruity tasting beverage without all the sugar...so this is exactly what I was looking for.  However, if you are looking for a subtle fruity flavor then this is NOT it as this definitely has a robust fruity flavor. After having purchased and tried quite a few different flavored teas this is my second favorite.

6097	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this honey. I like the glass jar it comes in. and the flavor is so good , not your honey you get in supermarkets . This honey has all the nutrients and vitamins in it .
I've found that sauces that use extract are of course very spicy, but generally have a pretty awful flavor.  I've tried plenty of different brands, and I see the same thing.  Extract seems to completely ruin the flavor of the sauce.  From what I'd guess - using extract is the CHEAP way out for the manufacturer (make things hot, for cheap).  I grow several varieties of hot peppers at home, and have made batches of sause easily on-par with the spice of dave's, but they have actual flavor (really good flavor).  It just takes a healthy dose of whatever hot pepper I'm putting in (butch-t's, red savina, etc).

6786	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'd been using Kosher salt for my pretzels and the flavor was ok, but they just didn't seem right.  Picked up this salt and it's really completed the recipe.  The salt sticks well has the right "salitness" and looks great. I know looks don't matter so much, but the kosher salt would kind of blend in and you couldn't even see it.  Kind of sad when the pretzel doesn't look salty.  This stuff is great!

We usually go out to a local French restaurant, but a flood last summer had put that out of commission.  Ransacking local markets produced numerous blank looks and a few comments along the "Snails??!!  Eeewww!!" line before yielding one small can of "medium" escargot.  Amazon and Escal saved the day.  These are great escargot, with a good flavor and texture.

2707	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I hate to write a bad review, but unfortunately these just aren't great. I am guessing it is because they are shipped all the way from Spain and I understand a third party can not legally sell unpasteurized almonds from a US farm. We just opened the bag and the almonds are very dry and shrunken. I can live with that knowing they are raw and organic, but several have been bad. My husband got a bad one and so did my daughter and now they are both gun shy and won't eat any more. I was trying to save a few bucks and didn't get them where I normally do, direct from the farmer (Bremmer Farms in California) via mail order. I learned my lesson and won't be buying these again.

Almond milk was easy to make.  We just put them in the Nutribullet or you could use a blender and add 4 times as much water and blend then use a nut milk bag or cheese cloth to strain the almond milk out and then you can drink the milk and use the almond meal for flour if you put it in the oven on a baking sheet at a lower temperature.

This IS the KRAFT cheese powder! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags.

You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price, given that shipping is free with Prime membership.  What a great deal!

I always have to tear those things off anyways.  The bit of honey and vanilla flavoring make this tea really tasty without adding a bunch of sugar.  I will not buy another type of chamomile again (after learning the hard way).

The one criticism I have and it is something to be aware of, the bottle is a normal bottle. This means getting a drop or just a few is virtually impossible. It flows out. It is also a great price.

My mistake (and I'm only mentioning this, because this was my first time using agar, and I learned a lot) was in assuming that agar powder and agar flakes could be used interchangeably in the recipe (which called for flakes).  My pecan pie slices came out like bricks - haha!  So, I plan to make the recipe again, but probably with only half the amount in powder, in the hopes that my second attempt will be much more successful than the first!

Firstly, using stainless steel utensils does not affect the great taste of this caviar at all. Also, comparing this product with others is foolish because its like comparing horses with cows.

I think I do like my chili a little more tomato-y than some people, so you might be just fine w/o the addition of the paste.

I don't know how Celestial Seasonings manages to find such perfect peppermint leaves and cuts them so they release such heavenly flavor. I DO know they have an entire room at their factory in Colorado Springs dedicated to storing nothing but peppermint, so it doesn't get into the other teas. If you've never been there, you gotta go. The tours are free and they have a gift shop with bargain-priced goodies and samples of their teas.

4270	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my second box.  Since I use a home iced tea maker, I cut a few pouches open at a time and store in an air tight container.  You could use the whole pouch but it's a waste of tea.  I put 4 rounded teaspoons in the basket with a coffee filter.  I always use filtered water instead of tap water, and the clear cubes from the grocery are hugely better than tap water cubes although I usually end up using tap water cubes and the result is still great.  To my taste, it doesn't need sugar.  I love this tea so much that I go through a pitcher every day. I even take it and my iced tea maker on vacation.  Once you've had China Mist, there is no going back to mediocre tea.  This tea was what enabled me to get off the Cokes.
The bergamot is light and citrusy, not heavy and perfumed. The tea brews up light golden to red depending on how strong you made it; I used 2 full cups (450ml) of water and 3 small tea measures and brewed five minutes (recommended time.) It came out a medium red and a bit weaker than I like. The taste was sweet, no bitterness and a light bergamot scent.

I used this Clear Jel to make a beautiful Apple-Cherry Pie filling ,since Clear Jel does not begin thickening until the liquid/filling starts to cool.

Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)

When I received it the honey was rock solid so I called the company who told me to put it in warm water to soften it up a bit.  Well I did as they suggested but I wasn't watching it carefully so by the time I took it out of the warm water it was more like liquid honey instead of paste consistency which is what I was aiming at.  After a few times playing around with it I finally got it to the consistency I wanted it to be and it did stay at that consistency with no problems whatsoever.

2283	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Best almonds I've bought on here and ive tried all the popular brands on here. Basically when I say best I should say freshest.
8301	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Every bit as good as what you buy in the grocery store, but only a fraction of the cost. If you can can split the order with a friend, the deal is even better. This is a lot thyme!

637	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Tastes like an old ashtray. Scorched and garbage-y. Even half and half couldn't mellow it. I actually threw the rest of the brand new bag in the garbage after making just one small pot.
9161	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I've been looking for some nice sea salt flakes that can serve both as regular salt and add that special crunch as a finishing salt.  I would highly recommend this salt!  In a pinch if I've ran out of my other salt, I use this and it works great!!
8094	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These teas are so yummy and a great introduction to the Celestial fruit teas. Individual tea bags are placed into larger wrapping in the box. When you unwrap the larger wrapping, the teas smell so fragrant. The teas don't come with individual tea tags, which I thought was kind of annoying at first because I would have wanted to take the tea bags out once they steep, but in consideration of the teas being eco-friendly, alright! My favorite among the bunch was the passion tea.

4802	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Like most country folks, I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property, arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels, shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner. This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars, I can feed all.  It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat, hat or bed cover, after tanning the skin.  The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits.

This is on my list, but I bought Frontier brand because I have learned in the past, they are high quality on everything I've ordered from them.  I have many more items to purchase and hope Frontier makes them.
8470	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a delicious product! I had been using a different brand, which was good, but when I got this Frontier brand yeast because of a better price, I was really surprised!  It has a really good cheese flavor and the smaller flakes adhere to salads better and blend into stuff better.  I will continue to buy this as well as other Frontier spices and herbs and teas.  They have really good quality.

The root beer has a fresh, clean taste, that seems to cut through lingering food flavors. It's a very satisfying, and truer tasting drink than the diluted "hint" of root beer offered elsewhere.  There is a distinct peppery aftertaste which is only partially moderated by ice; I enjoyed this  although it took a while to get used to.  (This taste may be due to the yucca extract.)  ALl together, this is both a thirst quencher as well as a unique "brew" that can be sipped slowly for the utmost enjoyment.
502	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love Orbit and this is my favorite flavor. I like that you get a ton of gum in this package. I would definitely recommend it.

9643	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I bought CK's crystal sugar, sanding sugar and jimmies to try to decorate a cake. This crystal sugar was a little too large to use with a cake-decorating stencil; it was too big to fill in the lettering properly, while the sanding sugar worked perfectly. However, if you are using the crystal sugar to add color by simply sprinkling on, this will decorate cakes and cookies nicely. The color was a true black and it tasted ok -- there was no strange flavor because of the coloring -- but it turned my fingers black when I used it, so I deducted 1 star. For comparison, I have included a picture of these crystals (in black, at the top), along with the sanding sugar (purple, in the middle), and jimmies (in purple, at the bottom). I struggled about what size to purchase for my project, and as it turns out, these weren't the right size. However, hopefully this will help you better decide if this size is appropriate for your needs.
3558	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Good as always
7886	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Very nice blend of mint.  I usually use peppermint in Celestial Seasonings, but this is another really good alternative flavor if you want to mix it up!  I just heat water in my Keurig (no K-cup in chamber) and put in the flavor of the day.  Really good brand.
7329	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am one who has a natural strong desire for sweets but who dislikes the side effects of so many of the things that satisfy. Loading up on sugar is never a good idea and I don't use any artificial sweeteners so am I ever happy with this tea. One glass of iced tea = zero calories, zero carbs, no negative effects and a hushed craving. My local stores quit carrying this - and I live in a not-at-all remote area - so based on supply/demand I can only surmise that maybe I do have a more vicious sweet tooth than most but this tea makes it as tame as the tiger on the box.

thumbs up. Enjoy.
1609	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Without a doubt, the best cookies ever.  I purchased the variety tin to see which I liked the best.  Oatmeal raisin were my favorite but wouldn't refuse any of them.  Large cookies, chewy and delicious and the chocolate chip ones had huge hunks of chocolate.

Lots of flavor which is great for my snacks and homemade Cashew Almond milk (2 cups Food To Live Organic almonds + 1 cup Food To Live Organic cashews makes 2 Ball jars) which I discovered at an amazing boutique coffee roaster / shop in Denver.
6763	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite holiday tea. I have been drinking it for three years.

6942	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have been drinking Tension Tamer for years. Ever since I developed an anxiety disorder in High School, I have been able to count on Tension Tamer to help me relax. I have recommended it to many people, and so far everybody that I have recommended it to has loved it! I personally microwave a mug of water for two minutes, let this steep for about 5, and drink it when I can tolerate it. The tea itself is so flavorful that I never need to use sugar or sweetener. It has a very calming and spicy taste to it. If you're looking for a tea that will really help you relax, this is it!
A nice treat

For some reason, a lot of the best sauces come from FL. If you want something hotter, my suggestion would be to try the famous Scorpion fruit used in Fat Cat (brand) Chairman Meow's Revenge. But Gator is pretty excellent, and just right for those people like me who are a little picky about their hot sauces (and have tried a ton of them).
6041	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The iced tea maker runs all summer long and this is the tea of choice for the family: ten bags make a solid, tasty brew.  I wish it came in the larger box--the ones friends bring from South Africa!

Not because the product is not good, because it is more candy than my bride and I together would eat in a year.
This is Very Hot but has a terrific and very distinct flavor. (Almost like a refrito smell to it. Unlike any other Hot Sauce I've ever tried, and I've tried Hundreds of them, I'm a spice junkie!)
2246	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This was a replacement that I bought for the one that my son gave me for Mother's Day.  That one came from [...]., and it was healthy, but I somehow managed to kill it.  In the meantime, I became very fond of the idea of having a bonsai plant, and I'm planning to buy a more expensive one later on, but for now, I love this one. Unless he notices, I'm not mentioning that it's a different Azalea.
It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss.
888	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	LOVE this product! I used it on a three layer rosette cake. Spraying a lot of silver at the bottom and slowly easing up toward the top for an ombre effect.

7321	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	i love peppermint, and pretty much hate spearmint, so i didn't want to buy mint magic. i saw this tea and was very curious. i love and trust the brand, which i use all the time for other teas. so i decided to try this one. and i love it. its got a very smooth, fairly strong mint tast.add sugar to ur tea, and its like drinking candycane. for those who say its not strong enough, u won't find stronger elsewhere and u need to ensure that u are brewing ur tea correctly. I use atleast two tea bags for even just a medium size mug because i like stronger tea. one teabag for different mug/ounce sizes simply won't work unless u like weak tea. u r supposed to double up or triple up when u get to larger mugs. that is how tea brewing works. a small 8 oz mug shld suffice with one tea bag, but the rest, no. tea brewing is tea brewing and peppermint is peppermint. its a matter of how many tablespoons of tea per ounces of water..and a good, trustworthy brand with all natural ingredients. i also love that there r no strings attached to bags with this brand. i usually let my tea bags stay in the mug while im drinking anyways, plus less waste. i have used celestial seasonings for years, and will continue to do so. u won't find a better tea brand and a better price. if u want just one box for cheaper price, i suggest going to walmart or ur other local grocery store.

I have bought other organic grains from Barry Farm and I am very satisfied with the quality of their products.
2455	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these to make my own almond milk.  The resulting milk tastes great.  I use the left over almond meal for baking and has made some excellent paleo chocolate chip cookies.  My kids are usually avoidant of eating nuts, but they will gobble down those cookies just like any other chocolate chip cookie.
8189	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This makes a delicious cheese sauce, very similar to kraft.  Others who have said it doesn't dissolve well maybe just need to add a little more liquid? I found it dissolves just fine. Also, it DOES reheat much better than the boxed mac n cheese.  Really good on popcorn.  My main incentive for buying it was that I have recently had to stop eating gluten and the gluten-free mac and cheese kits are so expensive!  It has been really convenient to have on hand with some pre cooked noodles I keep in the fridge for my 2 year old also, who asks for Mac n Cheese almost everyday lately! My only complaint is that it does have the artificial coloring...the ones kraft just took out of theirs.  Otherwise really happy with this product.

7001	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I buy this tea in quantity now. It is the only non-caffeinated tea I drink. In the summer it is great with ice and lemon slices.

924	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The "Violet" is not a true violet, but instead, more of a navy blue.  Besides that fact, it is NOT good for use on cookies.  Unlike airbrushing, the spray goes everywhere and has a horrible, chemically smell and taste.

6144	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I came back to order this a second time.  This honey is thick, unlike the syrup honey in the store.  I add this to oatmeal, with organic coconut and cinnamon.  I have no problems with energy.  I am 54 and have healed acne, infected eye and an infected toe.  Honey is antimicrobial and that is wonderful.  Put it on sores, scrapes, whatever and it will begin healing over night, seriously.  It seems to be a natural band aid.  I am waiting on cholesterol numbers and I really am curious about this.  IMO you can't  go wrong.
Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!
Here is a quote from the second link above to an article on almonds, pasteurization and salmonella: "no scientific evidence exists to show that almonds are an inherently risky food. In fact, Salmonella contamination of almonds can only occur when livestock manure or fecal matter is inadvertently transferred to the nuts through contaminated water, soil, or transportation and handling equipment. Almonds may also be infected by poor employee sanitation either on the farm or in processing facilities.

3065	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	It's super spicy, which is why you want to buy it (ultimate insanity flavor).  The flavor is terrible, however!  Oily and weird - I prefer hot sauces that are made from pure pepper and delicious ingredients - and to be honest, I wish they were a touch hotter, but overall, this stuff doesn't create a pleasant experience for me the way the natural ghost pepper and habanero sauces do.
Really glad of it.. I am used to flax seed oil on fava beans and when I told my aunt about this she was quizzical as to how it can come in ground form but it does hurraahh.

4698	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite vanilla for baking, by far!!! I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick, syrup consistency, so when added to anything you are baking (especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe, which is a must for me) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does. In addition, like all Nielsen-Massey vanilla products, it has a robust vanilla flavor. Accept no cheap substitute. This is worth the price; your taste buds will thank you.

8201	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the sampler to purchase if you like Celestial Seasonings teas. All of the flavors are terrific, especially the 'zingers' which are the cream of the crop. Enough for over 100 cups of tea, this will last you quite a while if you just drink them yourself.

7964	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This peppermint tea tastes better than I expected it to. It has a type of menthal to it, where you can feel your lungs opening up.

My mom is not a baker but she has a sweet tooth and very much enjoys cookies, like most of us. She was much pleased with the variety, while her favorite was the classic American chocolate chip cookies, she ate them all and did not feel the need, or want, to share with anyone. The cookeis are soft with some chew without being cakey or chemically soft that you find in packaged grocery store "soft" batches of cookies.
Since this is not real butter, it is understandable such substitution may not suit every recipe. Some baking would not come out the same without fluffy butter. But for the ones that simply requires the butter flavor, the Wilton butter flavor helps. It is not the same, but it helps. I have not used this in things that are not cooked. So can't really speak to that. For anything artificial, I only use in moderation. So far, it's been working great. This is not easy to find in local stores. Luckily, Amazon has in. For anyone who's trying to cut down on butter or animal fat, give this a try.

This is the 2nd tub of these I have ordered from Amazon and both of them have been ridiculously fresh. 10 times fresher than any pack I have ever gotten locally. There were quite a few on top that were actually broken into pieces because they were so soft. I kept a stash at home and then brought the tub to work to share the love with my coworkers. Recruited some twizzlers people (You can't even compare Red Vines to twizzlers). I might go for the black ones next, although I think those will probably last longer since only a few people like black licorice. I will be buying these again. And again.

I've added a few Tbs of black pepper to a couple lbs that worked out well, and even added habanero to some.

Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.

His slaves had inadvertently discovered a method of producing salt from sea water. Still produced and hand-harvested to ensure the old world traditional salt with the distinctive flaky texture and taste that lends a certain piquancy to virtually any dish. flake salts have dry, thin, parchment-fine brittle crystals that create bold, sparks of taste when eaten.

Each individual bar is roughly 1.25" by 2.5" but they are jam-packed with flavor!  The second that one is out of my mouth, I am already craving it again.  These Pulparindo are sweet and full of that lovely tamarind flavor, but are not cloyingly sweet the way many American candies are.  There is a hint of saltiness, as if they have been infused with saltwater (they aren't; they are made with sugar, tamarind pulp, corn syrup, iodized salt, citric acid, ground chili, and sodium benzoate).  I am a big fan of salt, so others may find it a bit salty (honestly, I would love them just as much without it), but it is subtle enough I don't think it is enough to be off-putting to anyone.  The spice level is also very low.  I like things a bit spicy, but cannot tolerate higher levels of spiciness, and this did not bother me at all.  The chili is really a subtle back note, so unless you have extreme sensitivity to spiciness, you will barely notice it.  It brings out the earthy, richness in the tamarind in a lovely way.  I may try the spicier version of this at some point, but I have a feeling I will return to these regularly.
1137	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	i have tried various jerky spice premixes and i tend to like the the nesco brand best. i make jerky at least 1 or 2 times monthly. the spice mix comes in a two-package mix. one with the spices and the other with the cure (salt). the only thing that i have an issue with this brand (and with many the others also) is that i find the jerky has too much salt for me. so i only use a 1/2 - 3/4 bag of cure when making a batch. i feel that this is safe because i normally eat the jerky within three weeks. hence, i do not need the cure for a long-term consumption.
Anyway, I phoned the company's customer relations department and asked what was going on with the soy lecithin. The woman had no idea what I was talking about so I explained, step by step, what I had found on a Zinger tea box I had nearly purchased that day. She said she had heard nothing about it but she checked her computer for company updates. After scrolling through many items, she came to a small notice in, as I recall, their in-house March 2008 entry (a year prior to my call), which stated that soy lecithin would now be added to selected teas; no reason was given. That struck me as very odd -- that even their own employees had not been properly notified. The woman apologized for the mix-up. That wasn't very satisfactory from my point of view but I let it go. That's all the info she had and it certainly wasn't her fault that her company obviously wanted to fly under the radar on this one.

Oh & to the people worried about the temperature when shipping. They don't keep this in the fridge in Japan so don't worry, well we don't put it in the fridge in the US until it's open so as long as it's not opened it's fine to be out of the fridge.

8153	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I saw this in my local Wholefoods and decided to give it a whirl. What a wonderful surprise - full flavoured, spicy, sweet and very satisfying - I have never had another herbal tea that comes close to this one - and even better can have it at any time as there's not any caffeine in it (or any calories which defies logic as it has quite a sweet flavour). The blend of spices is masterful - although cinnamon is listed as the prime ingredient I wouldn't say it dominates - the combination of ingredients used in this is a work of art!! Very pleased to find it sold in bulk at a good price on Amazon!!!!

5812	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	A great tasting honey and my current fav.
Another thing about this one - it's not that thick and gooey ketchup looking stuff you'd pour over some ribs or brisket - this is a thin vinegar base.  There's no sugar and fat in here to caramelize on your oven baked "BBQ Chicken" - that's not what this is for at all.
The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.

I'm not sure why they added in "Supreme" when the taste is delicate and profoundly different from the rest of the Earl Grey teas that you find in the market.

It is convenient for me to get our nuts through Amazon. I like these especially because they are packed as people food not bird food, and through Amazon I can get them year around..... However, while I order them for my parrot, I must admit that I have dipped into the supply myself a time or two, and the treat requires reordering before the Christmas rush is on.  We also add pecans (and almonds) to our morning granola. Nice crunchy addition. Nuts are good for you.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

 I live in a high humidity area so I always remove my salt from the cardboard box and into jars to keep the moisture down. I opened and closed this "canister" three times and the lid no longer fits tight because the hardboard has rolled a bit. The sea salt is imported and will enhance any dish calling for a sprinkle but at this price, save it as a finishing salt, not to be incorporated into a recipe. The taste is not that prominent to stand out.

Once the honey has set on your skin for about 10 minutes, press your fingers (flattened hand) against the honey and pull.  Yes, sticky.  Do this for several minutes all over your face.

We absolutely love this cheddar cheese powder! Since Jan 2012 we have ordered 7 bags from this company. Sometimes the color is lighter or darker than the previous batch but it always tastes the same. It is strong and delicious. It doesn't take much to flavor something and is excellent for making mac & cheese. We mostly use ours on tacos though. There is a taco place that my husband and I have been going to since we were both kids and they use powdered cheese on their tacos. For the last 4 years (ever since we found this here on Amazon) that is how we've been doing our tacos at home. We both like a lot of the cheese on ours so we put as much on as we want and enjoy them so much! Even though we do use a lot, a pound goes a long way. Unless this company stops making it, we will always order Barry Farm.
This is a must have coming Japanese food so I'm always buying it though it lasts long. The taste is great and I use it with Saracha for sushi rolls. Never had a problem. Better to ship it quickly with two or one day shipping to ensure freshness. Make sure you put it in the fridge.

This one seems heavier on the heat than the salt, while the others are heavier on the salt than the heat.  They're all good, just different heat/salt ratios.  One advantage to this brand is that the container is much larger than the S&B and Momoya jars I've seen, so it lasts longer.  As with the others, give this a good stir before you use it.

As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite.  Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins.

2031	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea takes me back in time.  When I was really young, my mom used to brew up big batches of iced tea.  First, she would get the jugs ready, and then pour hot hibiscus tea into them, and add a lot of ice.  We'd set them out in the sun and the natural light in mid-day would make the tea naturally sweet, as it brewed.  Those were definitely good times.  What better past time in the summer, than to brew a nice pot of iced tea on a sunny afternoon?  Tazo Passion Tea doesn't fail to disappoint.  For starters, one of the main ingredients blended to make it so delightful is hibiscus (along with orange peel, rosehips, cinnamon, lemongrass, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, licorice and red poppy).  If you like your tea on the (slightly) tart side, I reccomend you drink this unsweetened and relish its wonderful, natural flavors.  However, if you prefer some sweetness in you life, add a teaspoon of honey or your favorite sweetener for a different flavor note altogether.  Doctors are now reccomending people drink five cups of tea daily, for improved health.  Make Tazo part of your regimen!  It's a great way to take care of your health, while making an excuse for a much-deserved tea break.

If you crave extra heat you should really like this sauce.  I am always looking for a sauce that will light my mouth up and this one does the trick and has a decent flavor.  Also the price is really good for such a hot sauce that will last a long time.  Great stuff from Dave's.

As you can see from a copy of a previous order above, this item was priced at $2.45 not to long ago. I guess Stevita thinks it's OK to jack the price up to $6.20 during Christmas season. That's almost 3 times the usual price. Like we don't have enough costs during this time of year. They assume you are going to be doing more cooking, so hey, why not act like thieves and stick it to it's loyal customers during the season of giving.

I wasn't so sure I wanted to try it due to the thick waxy looking appearance. It just wasn't what I knew as honey. Once I had one, I had another, and another. This stuff is amazing. I have found myself craving it, but unable to find it any local markets or stores. The waxy appearance is actually a hint at the super creamy texture, and the flavor is so yummy. I am excited to have finally found it, same brand and everything. There are so many ways I want to try this beyond smearing it on a cracker.

6682	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I really enjoy this tea. It actually makes a nice iced herbal tea and it's fantastic for a cold or upset tummy. Its is not overly tart but stull has a nice rich lemon flavor coming from several sources, lemongrass gives it an umusualfullness of flavor, a spectrum of lemonyness. The ginger is zippy and prominent but not overwhelming. Other herbs round out the taste making a complex but pleasant flavor.  I've sweetened it with everything from honey to sugar to agave to Stevia, it's tastes great with them all.  I wish celestial seasoning sold small travel tins or pouches as I often carry tea with me, and I also wish they had a string and tag on their teas, makes it easier to remove after brewing.

This product is an add-on to an order of $25 or more. For a 20-count box for this price is a good deal. Especially, if your trying this tea for the first time. Lot's of other lemon ginger teas cost way more or only give you the option to buy in bulk.

I mean it's odd in the best sense of the word. There is something to be said about the unique texture it gives to your finished goodies. It's snow-like; I'd even say glass-like. It especially looks cool when you match the color of sparkles to the color of icing (e.g. pink icing with pink sparkles). I can't think of anything else on the market comparable to this.

Some reviews did not read the label pictured or the heading that clearly states " Royal Jelly In Honey ".Even the pic I took while writing this STATES" Royal Jelly In Honey.."!  Fresh Royal Jelly is extremely difficult to KEEP fresh & potent in shipping especially. If the temp is too warm it will go rancid quickly! Besides that, Royal Jelly is best assimilated when TAKEN WITH A TEASPOON OF HONEY( it will say that on the labels of fresh Royal Jelly!) ..  Raw honey of course is best. So people don't want to pay $25-$40 easy for a Ounce of Fresh Royal Jelly and its rancid when they get the package , also they would need to purchase Raw Honey for it to be best absorbed and utilized in the body the way it is intended. So hence why companies started putting the Royal Jelly INTO Raw Honey ( by itself or along with pollen, propolis ,ginseng etc.) to keep it from spoiling quickly plus you know it's getting utilized correctly mixed in with the honey. Also you know exactly the amount your getting & what to take instead of mixing it yourself. On this label it states: ROYAL Jelly 675mg per serving/ 40,000 mg per jar & below that it says IN HONEY  ( also at the top of the page as well..) So I do not believe the company is misleading anyone, some are just looking at the big words " Royal jelly " and not reading further. Besides there is NO Fresh Royal Jelly that your going to find in a 21oz jar or close to that for THIS PRICE! Just 4 ounces of Fresh Royal Jelly will run you a min of  $60 +.

3830	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I recently started using golden syrup as a vegan replacement for honey in certain of my recipes. I have found that when baking my No-Knead Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Honey White Bread that I can substitute Lyle's Golden Syrup for honey at a 1:1 ratio, with no change in the quality of the finished loaf. My latest project in a housemade lacto-fermented tomato ketchup, in which I use Lyle's Golden Syrup as the sweetener. It provides a depth of flavor which would not be attained with table sugar alone, and puts my mind to rest, as I need not worry about the antibacterial properties of honey preventing proper fermentation. I also plan on trying this with a mixture of Golden Syrup and Black Treacle.

It cuts that too sweet flavor just enough to make the perfect combination of sweet and salty and hot. I must admit, I'm not crazy about the amount of salt in it - as someone trying to cut back on sodium intake, it means I can't use this as often as I'd like to. But like most  things, moderation is the key. And this stuff is tasty enough to be worth cutting back a little on salt in other things the days I use it to compensate.

Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea.

Pudding-like gelatin deserts made with milk (or real 1/2 & 1/2), gelatin, and vanilla can be lower calorie (particularly with stevia) and more nutritious than egg and starch based puddings.  Vanilla is the base to which you add other flavors, just as you start with white paint and add tints to make colored paint.  The basic recipe is one pint milk, one packet of Knox gelatin, 1 teaspoon of vanilla powder, and sweetener to taste.  Then add flavorings if desired, such as mint or lemon zest.

3038	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Extremely hot! This sauce is no joke. My dad tried a spoonful of it while he was working up in Alaska. Big mistake. He couldn't breathe. It nearly sent him to the hospital. I was smart enough to put some on a spoon and then dip the tip of my tongue into it, not try and eat a whole spoonful. This sauce is extremely thick and concentrated. It barely runs out of the bottle without some shaking for encouragement. It has a very bitter pepper extract flavor up-front, with a touch of smoky habanero. If you can get over the nasty bitterness, you might even be encouraged to try some more. Don't. Then, the burn hits. After tasting just a little of this, you will need milk. Like, five glasses of milk. And it's oily and the milk just spreads it around your mouth and makes the burn worse, at first. If you like spicing up your food, this is very economical; a teaspoon will make any dish almost inedibly hot for most people. One bottle will last a very, very long time. Don't be dismayed by the gross flavor; when diluted in a bowl of chili con carne, the bitterness vanishes.
Anaphylaxis - Death <-- Death may result from a severe allergic reaction from taking royal jelly. Although uncommon, anaphylactic shock may occur within seconds of ingesting royal jelly. according to the website MayoClinic.com. The body overreacts to the royal jelly and unleashes a flood of chemicals to fight it off, but results in sending the body into a state of the shock. Your blood pressure drops suddenly, making you feel faint, dizzy and pale. The lungs quickly close, restricting your ability to breathe. You may experience anxiety, severe chest pain, a weak but rapid pulse, nausea and vomiting. If you experience these symptoms, call 911. An injection of epinephrine may be required to alleviate the symptoms.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I have been making a lot of sushi lately, so I got 50-sheet packs each of Sound Sea Vegetables nori and Sushi Chef nori.

It tastes like tea with some spices is all. It has maybe a hint of cocoa, but it's not the full on chocolate taste people are going to expect. So keep this in mind before sipping, or you'll get a little disappointed. It's a really mild tea, no bitterness at all, and it has a great scent and flavor. It even wakes me up and gives me a bit of energy in the morning. I took off one star because of the price, I wish it were a little cheaper. Overall I recommend anyone try this.

First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt.

I may well be allergic to it according to some websites info which i posted below. I hope not because  I do like it. I think perhaps there should be more clear warnings on the label however.

6237	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Ugh, I feel like an idiot saying this, but I saw a magazine cover claiming you could lose weight with iced tea.  I already drink iced tea a lot, so I wanted to see how I could use that to my advantage.  This was actually my third pu erh tea and was the better of three.  The bags were substantial and held together really well during brewing.  You might have read how many folks don't like the taste of puerh, that it tastes like dirt, well, ya, I can see that, but of the brands I've tried this one tasted a lot less like dirt. Honestly, I don't think pu erh tastes a whole lot more dirt like than cheap oolong.  Anyway.  So, for weight loss, well....  OK, the article I read says two cups with or just after each meal and a cup of green tea between meal.  I did not use this way, just can't fit that much in time wise what with brewing and all.  I made sun tea, 32 ounces of water in a glass bottle with three pu erh bags and one green chai (chai is my favorite tea of all time).  When done I'd put two packs of stevia in the raw in and I was good to go.  I'd have one cup with each meal when home.  I found that as long as I was not bad about my eating this regimen would result in a tiny bit of weight loss, a few pounds, but I just couldn't keep it going, eating out and stuff.  If I was bad with eating then drinking this tea  kept me from gaining.  I can only imagine if I really followed what the article said or if I could just keep drinking it three time every day then real weight loss could happen.  My current weight is quite troublesome as it is hormonal (perimenopause) and doesn't respond to much, even exercise.  To see what little I did see with this tea gives me hope.  I do plan to try hitting it again and try to stick with it regularly enough to affect my weight for real.  In summary, of the two pu erh teas I've tried this one was definitely better tasting and higher quality, so if you are shopping for which brand I do recommend this brand. If you are looking for a recommendation for weight loss, then I think I can say yes, pu erh can help you lose weight, but you have to drink enough of it regularly enough and paired with green tea to get it to work.  If you are looking for a healthy tea, then look no further, pu erh is higher in polyphenols than any other tea, and based on my latest cholesterol tests it really does help keep that down too.

As far as characterizing the taste, I would describe it as very "earthy". You definitely can detect the habanero, but there is a complex multitude of other spices that come out after the initial heat subsides. Other sauces this hot I find sacrifice unique taste for heat. A good sign is that if this sauce was not spicy, I would still use it.

2785	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	When it comes to Chai tea, this Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea, Sweet Coconut Thai is my favorite. I really love the Indian and Thai fusion of flavors in this tea. A perfect combination I must say. I like the coconut taste in this tea, and when it comes to Thai-inspired at-home teas, this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Chai definitely tastes better than Yogi Tea's Sweet Thai Delight tea. It's also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated, and as the other Amazon reviewers have said, this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed. If you like Thai-inspired teas such as this, I also suggest trying Harney and Sons' Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors. It's an excellent, delicious fine tea with coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Thai-picked Lemon Chamomile, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, and Spring Peach Oolong Teas. Another tea with some Thai influence is the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' Organic Berry Berry Caffeine-Free tea. For cold Thai teas, I highly recommend Taste Nirvana's Real Thai Tea Latte and Real Green Tea Latte. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and thus I'm Thai American. If you actually visit Thailand, which I have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there, then I highly recommend trying Thai Chrysanthemum tea. I had the best tea I've ever had in my entire life in Thailand. And that's saying something because I've actually traveled up (sometimes my small traveling party and I had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of 30 minutes to a whole hour. Even actor Blair Underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly Chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time, and claimed they were in better shape than him! That's how I felt as well. If you visit China, you will see that a lot of Chinese are very physically fit - they walk, hike, bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and Tai Chi and fan exercises in their parks) the tea-growing terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China and tasted tea from those Chinese regions and also tasted some tea when I traveled to Japan, but those Asian teas don't compare to the Chrysanthemum tea I had many years back in northern Thailand. (I haven't traveled to England and India yet, but would love to. I bet the teas there are amazing. But like I said, from all the countries I've traveled to so far - Thailand has the best teas, cold and hot.) When I think about it, I was very young then, and I should have asked the Thai waitress where they got their tea from. All I know is that I drank that tea at a restaurant at a Thai hotel resort many years back in Northern Thailand not far from Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle region. Anyways, I have given boxes of this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai Decaf Tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years. The fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great, and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family. My verdict is that this is a nice aromatic, delicious tea to unwind for the day.

626	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this coffee when I ran out of my favorite espresso coffee, Goya. It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes, so I figured it might be worth it. First, it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine. Second, it seems to be among the more bitter of any grocery store espresso coffees that I have ever bought. Even with milk and sugar, I could not mask the bitterness. I won't be buying it again.
The taste is amazing.  Everyone who's ever tried my jerky says they like it when they taste it at first but then each of them has come up to me later and told me again how incredible it was.  This stuff literally makes you crave more.  It's evil in the best kind of way.

It really is good though.
Sure enough, they told the truth.  The product arrived just as assured, fresh as a daisy.  It was a pleasure dealing with these folks and I will most definitely do it again.
My least favorite was the peppermint one which reminded me of toothpaste. You might react differently, as flavor preferences are very personal.

Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.

Is this the BEST Royal Jelly? I like the brand but probably not the BEST ( it takes 3party testing of products to prove potency, purity, levels of any heavy metals or unwanted additives etc)  but you will PAY more for better... , best... quality like with anything else. Is this a good brand? Yes, I started out buying the 1 & 2 ounce jars of the fresh Royal jelly ( not in honey!) for $25 & $42 or so dollars and liked the benefits . Then reseaching more and finding that it would be best assimilated  & I'd reap better benefits taking it with a teaspoon of honey, I did that. Well then I found it all ready & done for me . This jar would be like putting about a  2 ounce jar of fresh Royal Jelly into 19oz of raw honey. So , this IS REAL ROYAL JELLY! It's just put into the honey so your body can assimilate it properly as well as preserve all the wonderful vitamins/minerals/etc their peak & not spoiling or losing potency.

9016	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Fantastic flavor. Nice, big, white salt crystals. Nice as a finishing salt and is particularly fantastic on fresh tomatoes. This is not my everyday salt as I find the flakes to be too large for that. You don't always want texture with salt, so I tend to use French Grey as my daily salt, and this for things like seasoning pasta water, tomatoes, salads, and other foods where I either want, or don't mind, there being a slight crunch to the salt flakes (or things in which the salt is going to dissolve anyway). I gave this 4-stars instead of five simply because it's just *good*, it's not mind-blowingly amazing. There's nothing wrong with it at all, I just personally rate it 4/5.

I did deduct a star because I think the artificial color is wayyyy overdone. This is real cheddar cheese without fillers, but the artificial colors make it look fake and unappetizing. I guess I understand they're going for that "mac n cheese" look with this powder, but honestly, I think it would be more appealing if it weren't fluorescent orange. Maybe with just a touch of anatto to give it a warm tint, or even leave the coloring out altogether and market it as "white cheddar". The bright orange just looks... odd, especially on dark green vegetables.
If you loved Almond Sunset, you will like this tea.

However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.

General hypersensitivity  is another term for an allergic reaction. Common allergic reaction symptoms include complications in the digestive tract, the skin, respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Digestive tract complications includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain and cramping. Medications will not help these symptoms until the royal jelly is removed from the body. The skin can become inflamed, causing eczema, hives or general rashes. Allergic skin conditions cause redness, swelling and severe itching on the surface of the skin. Respiratory problems may include sneezing, watery eyes, nasal congestion, throat irritation and sinus pain. Common cardiovascular symptoms include dizziness and lightheadedness.
(With many thanks to Mark Bittman.)  One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina--let sit for several hours, covered.  Preheat oven to 450.

So I took a large drink of it plain like I do all my sauces to try. (I do use a spoon) WOW! It hit my hard and fast. My tummy was hurting as sweat pored from my pores. In short, it was awesome! This is a real hot sauce and is the first one I have tried that I would grab over Habanero Tabasco. I am use to really hot things so those who are not should use caution and not try to drink it by itself. The flavor is also wonderful and I enjoyed it on my simple salad of some lattice and dressing with this. It does need to be kept refrigerated which means I cant keep a bottle in my purse for when eating out like I do with Tabasco so that's a shame. Otherwise, this is a new favorite. 9 out of 10.
My family recipe calls for mixing chopped black olives and pimentos into a soft cream cheese, spread on celery and dribble a little of this sauce on it. It's both delicious and healthy.

If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath.  I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies.  After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top.  The icing will hold them in place.  The two layers create a beautiful, richer look.  Think of a precious stone.  Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle.  But, with facets and light, it comes to life.  That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing.  I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.

It came down to a VERY close race with McCormick and Watkins neck and neck, Watkins had a lot of points for its fullness in contrast to McCormick's thin plain simplicity, but in the end McCormick won because of what it did NOT have - no after taste chemical or otherwise, no non-vanilla flavor additions. It may be thin and simple, but it has nothing that takes away from the basic vanilla that it does have, and it doesn't even taste artificial. One pro, no cons.
What really ruins the flavor of Mint Magic, however, is the other ingredients--roasted chicory, cinnamon and orange peel. In combination with more robust teas, chicory is a nice, nutty additive. Cinnamon and orange peel are wonderful with fruity teas, but not with mint. These ingredients change the tea from a refreshing, cool flavor, to something more warm and spicy. Clearly, they don't go together!

Followed by incinerating heat, building up over the next minute or so.  Personally, I like to mix it into barbecue sauce.  Also good directly on enchiladas.  Pairs well with Indian and North African foods too.  Highly recommended.  Scoville 650k estimated from what I have read, so it's about 50% ghost pepper or a bit more.

  I think it is important here to distinguish between natural glutamates and MonoSodium Glutamate, generally an industrial product which is produced by GMO bacteria, typically on GMO wheat and such. MSG is very concentrated and has factors related to the source materials. Natural glutamates are found in practically anything with PROTEIN. Some people lump all glutamates together with MSG.

If you find yourself balking at the taste and/or consistency, I suspect that you are overly accustomed to the cheap crap you find in a general grocer's aisles. They add a bunch of nasty chemicals, fillers, and thickeners to their products. Or worse, as is the case with such brands as Aunt Jemima's and Mrs. Butterworths, there is ZERO actual maple syrup in the "formula." That is not an exaggeration. Look at the ingredient list and you will see it's basically high fructose corn syrup with a synthetic "maple" flavor.

This Fukien Tea Bonsai arrived and looked awesome but soon started shedding all of the leaves so I was a bit worried.  After a few days most of the leaves were gone and at the 2 week point there was only 1 green leave attached.  I gave it to a friend who also enjoys bonsai trees because I hated that it was starting to die.  I can report after a couple of months of total TLC it has started to regrow some of the leaves.

Well, I was walking through the Asian supermarket and found this on an isle. I had never seen it there before, or at all, for that matter. I first fell in love with the can. Our home is filled with vintage things so it called out to me. I immediately looked it up here and read the reviews and noticed it was in my hand for under $6 so I had to have it.

You could ground the flax seeds yourself, or you can buy a great product like this one by Spectrum.  Ground flax is a wonderful addition to your diet--just 2 TB adds protein (3g), fiber (3g), and healthy fats.

  Hot (5) - I have never come across a tea with such a naturally sweet flavor to it (likely attributed to the 2 natural sweeteners).

The products do not have a strong cheesy and are a little more salty than I would like, however it is powder cheese after all.  I tried both water and milk in the preparation, and not surprisingly, milk yields a more favorable result.  As a standalone cheese sauce it OK but not great, however I find it works well as a flavored binder or thickening agent with marinara or spaghetti sauce.  The long shelf life (if stored correctly) makes it a nice product to have around, Ill buy more.

The flavor is not what I expected, it is much eggier and tangier than regular Hellman's mayonnaise. Th flavor is somehow also lighter, and doesn't linger as much in your mouth. It is much less oily.

9179	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	There are many different varieties of sea salt out there.  What makes Maldon unique is its large, pyramidal flakes.  Some people use it for general cooking, but it really shines best as a finishing salt.  That means cook with less salt, but sprinkle salt on the finished dish.  You really get a chance to experience the unique characteristics (primarily texture) of each salt that way, and Maldon has a light crunch that I find very pleasant.

The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety, and they're definitely moist with a 'fresh baked' look, feel, and taste to them.  When not on sale I think they're rather expensive, but for the price I paid (25% off regular price) I think they were worth it.  My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.  So, if you're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you're sending them on your own as they most likely won't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies.

Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.
It is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good.

Truly natural glutamic acid -- as it exists in its unadulterated form in nature -- is an acidic amino acid.

I love this brand!!!  it does smell like cinnamon out of the box but it stated to smell simmalar to coffee once i slipped it into water, once it was brewed though it did smell like coffee but close to it. it is a bit weaker compared to coffee at one bag per cup, even if you seep it for a long time.  bitter,black, hot, ya that's like coffee.

It actually got a bit too thick, I used a little less clear jel on the 2nd batch and cooked it less.  It never came to a boil as the instructions state, it thickened up nicely when it got hot.  I poured in the apple chunks and mixed it all around then canned the filling.  The apple filling came out great, apples are not too soft, since I didn't boil the filling.

From Wikipedia: "Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native), although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India, parts of Southeast Asia and the American South, particularly in New Orleans. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "coffee crisis" of 1976-9." Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.

6095	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This is a good raw organic honey, HOWEVER, this company is dishonorable because they use their good reputation of selling quality, organic honey to sell a contaminated/non-organic honey. They put it in the same packaging and brag about how they are "organic pioneers". This is a dishonorable profit-boosting tactic of a typical american company. This honey is not organic for a reason: the bees that made it are in close contact with farmers that use heavy pesticides and/or other industrial facilities that crank out pollution. The bees pick this stuff up and it ends up in the honey. You don't want to eat this, it will lead to bad health problems later on in life and a shorter life span. The honorable way to boost profits would be to: a) expand the truly organic bee farms to produce more of the truly good stuff, or b) create a completely separate company to sell the polluted/non-organic stuff and put it in completely different packaging and don't brag about being an organic pioneer because it has absolutely nothing to do with this particular product. They chose neither of these, and instead went the typical, dishonorable route. It is now up to us as customers to punish them by taking our business elsewhere. Yes, I know it is hard to find another brand of raw organic honey to purchase, so I went ahead and made it really easy for you. Check out Trader Joes raw organic honey - and heres the best part - its even cheaper than this crap at only 5.99 per pound with no sales tax!  No I don't work for them, and trust me, if I catch them doing something dishonorable I will be throwing them under the bus right along with Y.S. "organic" bee farms....

9038	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoy the flavor of this salt for seasoning.  It doesn't have any sort of bitter taste that some salts have, and it seems to be pure because I haven't had any cross contamination issues as our family has food allergies (wheat, corn, guar gum, dairy, eggs) so it has been safe for us to eat, unlike some other salts I have purchased that have corn derived dextrose or other traces of impurities that have resulted in allergic reactions.  The Maldon Sea Salt Flakes are just really nice flavored, pure salt.

The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.
4226	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Since I didn't like the flavor of this tea I am not a good person to judge this particular brand. There are so many black fruit teas that I love, such as Black Current, Peach Coconut and Pumpkin Spice to name a few. I would always reach for those before I would go for this tea. Luckily, I only had to purchase one tin so unlike many other teas on Amazon where the cost reflects 6 boxes, this time I took a chance and it did not pay off for me. I do wish this company and other companies would indicate whether the flavorings in their teas are natural or artificial. I have a feeling that if the flavoring in this tea is artificial that would negatively affect the flavor but I can't say that's the case because the tin doesn't make that clear. If you know you love Huckleberry Tea then you should give this one a try.

6851	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love Mint Magic; it's mellowed by the chicory.  I'm back for another six boxes.  Try this: brew it doubly strong, add sweetener, heavy cream, a tiny bit of vanilla, and a splash of dark rum.  Yes, it's decadent but it's less decadent than dessert.  Alternately, you can stir a touch of cocoa powder into sugar or sweetener and add that.
I have to tell you, I went to the Supermarket to seek out decaffeinated tea bags.  All they had was Lipton tea.  I bought a box and began drinking it over the last month.  Not bad, but I knew I could do better.

Also bought this a few years back & this tea stays fresh even past the expiration date. This is now the second time I ordered since I ran out of this tea. My hubby & I drink this most evenings to unwind and help digestion along, but it's perfect for any time of the day.
1289	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought several Harney & Sons teas when I ordered. This blend was easily my favorite and the tea that disappeared the quickest. This is a delicious Earl Grey tea, full bodied, with the pronounced Bergamot richness inherent in great Earl Grey teas. I find Harney & Sons to be a superior purveyor of teas and I have tried many of their varieties and blends. All have been excellent, with the Earl Grey being my favorite.
I was surprised to see bad reviews for this frosting because I love it so much that I changed my own frosting recipe to mimic it. It's a heavier frosting, but lighter (weight/sweetness-wise, I have no idea if it has less or more calories) than pure buttercream frosting feels.
9632	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	ohhhh... this stuff is WONDEFUL!!!  Nothing else is quite like it.  The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.

870	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this oil!  I love garlic and adding this oil with infused flavor to most dishes really adds to the taste.  For example, I make crostinis and instead of regular olive oil, I use Annie's and it makes them sing with flavor.  I even use it for the oil when I'm roasting garlic.

2. Unlike ordinary brewer's yeast which is grown on grain and hops liquor, brewer's yeast which is called nutritional yeast is derived from sugar beets not hops, barley or grain.
I know there are other companies with similar products, like Cinnamon Plum tea, etc. But none have the exact flavor of this one, and some of the closer in taste to this also have caffeine.

9933	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Fortunately, I've been able to try several Stevia products a packet at a time due to some really nice Health Food stores that have sold it that way to try.  Every one left a funny aftertaste I didn't like.  I tried Truvia, but found it also contained other "natural ingredients" that are not listed and it's distributed by Coco-cola Co, so who knows what's really in it.  Based on the reviews here I bought a box and love it.  I use it in coffee and iced tea without any of the aftertaste.  I have given packets out to friends and they like it too.  Really great product.
I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

First time I read about this online I decided to try it out. I stopped by my local Publix and checked to see if they have any in stock. They have most of the flavours here except for a few and some (6?) pack boxes of certain flavours. They're $.79 each, not including tax of course. I bought quite a couple, I think 6. I'll try to dig up the wrappers and see which flavour, but the chocolate peppermint blew me away!

3043	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a sauce to be used sparingly, too much and you will feel the burn. The sauce does actually have some good flavors if you use an appropriate amount and don't over do it. I find that just a few drops is plenty for me to add loads of heat and really get that tingly hot pepper feel in my mouth. This bottle will last me quite a while at the rate I am currently using it.

I had to use more than I expected while coloring white fondant but the colors were nice and bright and the farm cake turned out beautiful! Caution, wear gloves as these will stain your hands.
The cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen.

9129	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this salt for a recipe for pretzel bread, and now it's starting to show up in other recipes I've been looking at! The flavor of the salt is strong, bright and clean. I would advise to use sparingly!
1) Yes, it most certainly does exactly what it is supposed to do. It thickens 'things' beautifully and without too much difficulty in use. 2) Whether it does it 'better' or not is a very subjective thing...although there are certainly some quantifiable differences between it and regular corn-starch. After using it for several fruit based liquids, I found the end results to be remarkably clear. Far clearer than any flour or corn-starch product that I have used in the past. Another real bonus, is its ability to maintain its thickening power after repeated heatings. This makes it ideal for canning purposes where the end product must be first cooked, then canned, then used at a later date. Some thickeners won't hold up to repeated heating very well. Another point to note is this product (Clear Jel) has been used for many years in commercial applications. That doesn't necessarily make it better, but it does indicate that it has been found to be remarkable consistent and repeatable. 3) Ah, the real question is about cost-effectiveness. Clear Jel is not inexpensive (at least in these quantities..). I would be very interested in knowing what the cost differences are to a commercial account. In any event, the cost-effectiveness question can only be answered by you. I find it to be okay....not spectacular mind you....but then again I don't use it every day. But, when I need something like this to make a thickened compote or a berry pie filling or......well, anything that I want to can or preserve and still be colorful and CLEAR (or anything that I want to reheat or do a secondary cook, then it is probably worth the cost...at least to me.

This is how you should be taking your Royal Jelly. So don't give 1-2 stars because YOU didn't not read the listing OR picture correctly. That's not a review of the product, but your mistake.

9539	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am on disability and do not get out frequently (once every 3-6 weeks) so I have been experimenting with longer shelf life foods that I can buy for a reasonable price that are delivered to my home.  For years, I have been making quick microwave soups from scratch and I have found that while meats can be easily frozen, vegetables can not be bought in bulk for long term without a lot of waste.  There are all sorts of veggies available at Amazon, a bunch at this vendor, that are remarkably flavorful AND economical.  This clelery tastes to me just like fresh when used in my soups and for $2 you can't go wrong.  Barry Farm Foods also sells dried jalapenos (excellent--kept for cooking only cause I ALWAYS have 5-6 cans on hand for table use), onions, shallots, sour cream powder, cheese powder, etc. which I have all tried and endorse.  There are also dried mushrooms but I have not hit on the type that suits me as yet.  The trick to these dried vegetables is to soak them before hand in boiling water, if planning to cook the entree quickly, to ensure that they get fully rehydrated. Longer cooking times don't require soaking.  Beef stew made with dried vegetables, frozen peas, frozen strips of beef and some sour cream powder makes a wonderful dinner in less than 1/2 hour, with prep since anything dried will already have been chopped, diced, sliced or maybe smashed to ensure effective drying.

I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats, and I give a partial stir fry to mine, to give it a little color, before adding it to my curry mixture. Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry doesn't have time to penetrate it.  I use light coconut milk, so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat.  Add sugar and to taste until you get it where you want it.

Nutritional yeast has many health benefits and it is very high in nutrients. A standard serving of 1/4 cup has only 60 calories, with 4 grams of fiber and 9 grams of complete protein (it has all 9 essential amino acids that our bodies cannot produce), and as such is an outstanding source of protein for vegetarians and vegans. It is very high in B vitamins, selenium and zinc. People who are allergic to the active yeast found in bread are rarely allertic to this variety of inactive yeast.

Unfortunately, while this is a good honey, it is basically a crystallized unprocessed honey with nice smoother creamed texture than typical aged granular honey. While it is marginally better than store-bought processed honey with flatter flavor and caramelized stronger aftertaste, it ultimately left me wondering "What's the big deal?" The Y.S. Organic raw honey is a product of Brazil & Canada, and it's worth a try if you've never tasted raw unfiltered honey before. However, I recommend that you lookout for fresh unprocessed honey from your local bee farmers instead, which may also help you ward off allergy symptoms to your local allergens. Those will taste more like the popular Honey Spoons candy (sold at Cracker Barrel) without the distinct complex flavor of aged crystallized honey which is what this honey ultimately tastes like. Many may prefer creamed aged honey, but I personally prefer the taste of fresh liquid raw honey.

First, let me say that this is delicious black tea. I have never tasted a better black tea. I will add that the slight flavor of oranges is also very good. However, I believe the product is mislabeled or something, as I could detect no bergamot flavor whatsoever. Bergamot oil is what's added to regular tea to give it the flavor Earl Grey is noted for. I have worked with pure bergamot oil and have had a number of brands of Earl Gray. Bigelow is the best I've found for pure bergamot flavor and aroma.
7743	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea is so good.  We drink a lot of it in the cooler months.  Not so much in the summer.  This makes a great gift along with a cute mug or teapot.
I definitely recommend this product to all my friends who enjoy using honey as a paste instead of a syrup liquid.  If you don't like your honey crystalizing than this honey is not for you, however if you like your honey in a spreadable paste form than this would certainly be for you as you will not be disappointed, mmmmmmmmmmmmm gooooooooooooooood.

This seems to be the classic brand but I feel like the chili flakes are not as fine as I'd like them to be, which can make the dried pepper flavor overpowering. It's more of a flat/bitterness issue than a heat issue. I was spoiled by the market-made version that I found in the fruteria, I guess! Trader Joes just came out with a TJ's version of this spice and it's great, the lime and sugar flavors are more prominent.

As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $3, but never used it fast enough so it would get old. I figured a powder would be better, so I can mix it as I needed it. When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can, I started looking for the hidden cameras ...  thought this HAD to be a joke. Nope .. and it's NOT returnable either.

My favorite part is the spectacular NEBARI! This tree will give me a jump start on a red wood bonsai piece. The only complaint i have is there is a bare spot on the lower part of the trunk... it will require some branch grafting before i can begin training it for bonsai. I think i should also mention that other than the bare spot on the trunk, the top of the tree has an excellent start on ramification. The tree comes in a very sturdy ceramic pot. If you are a bonsai enthusiast like myself, the pot that comes with the tree is only training quality, it is not a presentable display pot for showing off your work of art. However if you are not a bonsai enthusiast and want this item for home decor it is still a beautiful pot. Can't wait until the spring so i can plant my redwood in the ground to thicken up the trunk!

7980	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I took a big chance on this tea, as I have never had it before. I am not a huge fan of chamomile, but was seeking an herbal tea to enjoy either hot or iced. And because Celestial Seasonings is my preferred choice, packaged without strings/foil packets, but in manageable sized boxes so that you are not leaving the package open for very long periods of time, I decided to give it a try. I love chai teas, and usually drink a caffeinated choice, I was wanting something to enjoy that was herbal/caffeine free. PERFECT! Very pleasing smooth fresh apple flavor, without the bite of cinnamon or black pepper, often found in other choices. Absolutely wonderful. I may have to order to receive on a regular schedule!

Luckily I found this on Amazon. It's a case of 6 so it should last me until next winter, I hope! A friend of mine tried it and thought it wasn't strong enough BUT I drink tea without adding milk or sugar and leaving the bag in my cup instead of removing it. So I can definitely taste it and I prefer flavors that aren't overly sweet or spicy anyways! This is a great soothing tea that genuinely tastes like cookies (to me anyways!)


While I NEVER look at the ingredients when taste testing - yet now - as I write this review, I can finally look at the ingredients on the label.  The major ingredient in this sauce is water - the next major ingredient is acetic acid (a refined, chemical component of vinegar) and finally there is the chipotle pepper followed by various other ingredients (such as salt, etc).

5138	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Ground flaxseed is recommended by Dr. Oz, WebMD, MayClinic, and other health experts. Flaxseed is packed with Omega-3 essential fatty acids, "good" fats that have been shown to have heart-healthy effects. Each tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains about 1.8 grams of plant omega-3s. It also has Lignans, which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities. Flaxseed contains 75- 800 times more lignans than other plant foods.  Also, it is loaded with both soluuble and insoluble fiber. This is the main reason I started using this product.  I found that once I started using 1 tbsp. in the morning and 1 tbsp. in the evening, the frequency of eliminations improved by 50%. I mix a tbsp. in unsweetened cranberry juice, per Anne Louis Gittlemans "long-life-cocktail" recipe.  Also, I notice that Jillian Michaels from the Biggest Loser, also recommends flaxseeds in a cranberry drink as well. If you do this, be sure to use unsweetened cranberry juice.

Do not be fooled though, this stuff IS hot. And if you aren't seasoned this is plenty hot to put you in serious pain. But since this is ghost pepper sauce I was expecting something hotter than original Insanity Sauce and this is not it. It's a step below on the heat scale. Not a big step below but still below. With Insanity Sauce I have to be more careful about how much I put into my dish. But with this ghost pepper version I find myself erring on the side of putting in too much rather than not enough. This one is more forgiving. Also, while the original insanity sauce is thick like lava, this is runny like regular Tabasco Sauce. Whether that is better or not is a a matter of personal preference.

I can't say that for the Starbucks brand espresso...actually at all.  I still put cream and suger in my americano's but I use less water, more espresso, and less sugar and cream.

So I moved to Lewis Labs from Red Star, it is very different, more of a toasted nutty flavor. Very different and I like it there are foods where I think the cheesy flavor of Red Star works better. My body seems to like the Lewis Labs a little better.

The instructions said if you're not going to eat within next two to three days, to freeze them.  There are six layers of fresh baked, yummie, scrumptuous cookies.  I ordered the variety package.  I can hardly wait to taste all the different flavors. I will definitely be ordering these cookies again.  Great job!
9085	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love salt...even though I know it's supposedly bad for you.  I have all kinds of salt at home, pink, black, sea salt, etc.  I read about Maldon Salt and have to say it's the only salt I'll use now.  Has a very mild taste and, well, just love it.  If you're a salt lover you need to try it.

Mighty tasty! As with ALL things, the PROOF is in the PREPERATION:
7953	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Hot or cold I love this tea.  I make refrigerator tea by the gallon in the summer, lots of different flavors. This is one of my family's favorites so I like the large boxes and that its a 6 pack. In the colder months I enjoy this in the evenings and don't worry about getting to sleep as it is a big help to me. I should have plenty now for a nice long while.

3078	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Yes it's HOT.  It's not the hottest I've ever had but it's still hot.  However, despite it being spicy and has a great flavor.  A little goes a long way.
2807	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit, so I needed a strong replacement.  Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me.  There's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it's a tea, you don't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it.  For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.

I am also one of those people who, maybe because I love sweets, have to watch what I eat.  This Mousse mix provides a feeling of fullness and is a satisfying sweet to finish a meal or even for an in between meat treat.  I have only used the chocolate Mocha mix and I really loved that.  In fact I ordered some Libbey 6 1/2 ounce glass covered containers to be able to stock up in the frig so these will always be on hand.

5200	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I had my mouth all set to enjoy these, opened the package and they smelled like red vines, they do not, however, taste like red vines.  They aren't fresh and the texture has a strange harshness to it.  This is unlike any red licorice I have ever tasted.  I bought one for my family and one for my brother's.  Now I don't want to even give them to him so it's 2x's a waste.

Gave up using all other bouillons.
Update: i forgot to mention that i often wonder about the cinnamon as an ingredient in there. i have recently learned that if a product contains cinnamon that it doesn't always mean that it will be the true cinnamon from Sri Lanka. Honestly i would drink it way more often than i do now if it would contain the true cinnamon. Cassia cinnamon from Vietnam and/or Indonesia is cheaper, but contains more coumarin and too much is not healthy for you.....

Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a "just warm enough" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.

The blend is yummy all the flavors combine really to make it a great tea. I'm thinking about brewing it with ice to drink it cold. Very nice flavors, really flavorful. The flavor is strong and delicious. I have tried other Celestial Seasonings teas and it is my favorite so far, happy to get it ahead of schedule. Really good buy. Definitely a good choice.
I like that the only ingredient is peppermint.  Nothing else which is fabulous!

But I didn't want a sugary offering; sugar-free is the way to go.  And Orbit from Wrigley, offers up the best price /taste combination. While the flavor does not last nearly as long as I'd like (wouldn't we all want it to last and hour or so), I still enjoy the brand and it's plethora of flavor offerings.
I love drinking these teas on a cold winter day -- the fruit flavor jolts me back into the warmth of summer, even when the wind is howling and it's below zero outside.

I start my day with a quad espresso and switch to tea after that.  I added this to subscribe and save to get my total to five, which means that Amazon gives me and extra 15% off!  Better price, free shipping, extra discount, and no tax (at least for a little while longer)?  What's not to like?
This tea mix will be in my kitchen from now on.  And when I travel I will take a few bags with me.  In fact I'm going to put a few in my travel bag right now.

4551	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I live and bake by this product,  I am a home baker and ever since I started using this paste I have given up the traditional extract, which has a more alcohol flavor.  this is the warm vanilla flavor that you are looking for as it uses actual vanilla beans in your dish.  The paste is more liquid then you imagine when you think of the word paste, but this makes it better for pouring, measuring etc anyway.  It mixes in better this way as well.  I have this on auto subscription, as I really do need this every 3 months.  Use it in pancakes, waffles, cakes, any pastries or dessert dishes to give it a warm delectable vanilla flavor.  My next thing with this will be vanilla ice cream, which I can't believe i have not done yet.  Definitely a necessary product in my pantry.  Buy it!  You will never want to use extract again.

I use a very large tea mug and these bags can be used twice by me and still taste darn good. Granted I let it sit in my mug the whole time I am drinking the tea. I also make gallons of refrigerator tea in the summer time. Most of the family likes this unsweetened, but it also tastes amazing sweetened. I am very happy with the size of the box and that you get a 6 pack. I will have plenty for he summer and the winter.

I will say though that we've started buying 2 of the smaller 22 oz. jars each order instead of 1 larger 32 oz. jar. Including the 99 cents each jar shipping, it comes out a little cheaper per oz.  Not sure why the 22 oz. jar description calls it "gel".  It's the same solid honey as you get in the 32 oz solid.
7986	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the first time I've finished a box of tea ever, much less in a very short time.  I recently purchased a whole case and am sharing with friends and family.  It is refreshing hot or cold and the flavor is delicious!
4439	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I use the Wilton no-color butter flavor in baking, pancake, waffles, but not by itself. For recipes that call for butter, I use half or 1/3 the butter that's called for, and substitute the rest with vegetable oil. And with that alteration, I add the Wilton butter flavor to supplement the butter flavor. I love butter and use to eat loads of it all the time. But some recipes call for so much of it, I want to cut down. This butter helps me achieving that.

2038	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Tazo's Passion tea has been one of my favorite teas for a decade, and is the one that introduced me to Tazo teas in general. On the whole, Tazo teas are beautifully fragrant and flavorful teas. They are as aromatic as they are delicious. In some cases with non-Tazo blends, the alluring aroma makes promises that are unfulfilled by the taste. Tazo doesn't tease!

8726	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love this salt.  Give that extra crunch and not too salty.
The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached.  I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process.  I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.

Ive re-ordered twice. Same prompt shipping and quality packaging/delicious salt. Ill continue to be a repeat customer.
Overall, I'm very pleased with this order, and it went smoothly, I can recommend ordering from this experience, and I likely will, as Mom has requested more, "If you get the chance." Things to keep in mind, the 1lb size is best for one or two people, an office, group or family would do best with a larger size to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy them.
BTW -- The cookies are not packed as shown; they come in the same tin but it has 4 plastic dividers inside so you do get a few less cookies but it probably helps  keep them from breaking up.

I bought the 2 x 4oz bottle deal that Amazon had, so I have another whole bottle of this. I'm considering getting some Mexican vanilla beans and soaking them in it as a way to pump up the flavor. As I said, it has the right flavor, it's just really weak.

Pros:
3546	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It's summer. It's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement. Yep, you're in the semi-tropics now. It's New Orleans and the living is easy. And it is 8 o'clock in the morning. Time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar. It's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust, mellowed down flavor.
If you are looking for maximal healthiness, then do not buy this and make a real cheese sauce.  Those are great too :)

A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises.
REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.
I realized that the only reason I have been buying that brand is because it's the only one at my grocery store, when I saw Cafe du Monde on amazon I decided to give it a try.  I wish I would have tried it sooner.
3863	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is absolutely my favorite hot sauce. But it's really hot. Not for the faint of tongue. It goes great with burritos, steaks, and hotdogs, adding just the right blend of hot and peppery flavor.

179	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My acupuncturist said Bi Yan Pian is good for allergies and sinus problems.  I suffer from extreme allergies and am going through acupuncture to get rid of my body's reaction to these allergies.  In the meantime going off antihistamines this tea really works wonders. The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins.  Antihistamines dry you making the toxins stay in your body and oh yeah it lowers your immunity so you get sick.  Good reason to go off anithistamines.  This tea tastes very good with the combination; I use honey with ginger and that is amazing.  I will continue using this tea as needed because it works so well if I drink too much I'm actually too dry...but then the acupuncture is part of that too.  Hope this helps you decide.

3393	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The problem with most vanillas is that you can taste the alcohol that is used to leach out the flavor.  Not with this.  It's just pure vanilla flavor.
I use it in a wild rice mix, and it is delish.  I found if you mix it in stuff, hot stuff, and let it sit a minute or two, it is sometimes easier to sort of smooth it out.  If you really HAVE to eat it lumpless, mix some ahead of time in broth or liquid by adding liquid a little at a time to the powder,and smooshing out the little tiny lumps. It'll probably take you quite a while, but if that is what you want, that is what you will have to do.

I even tried it with Coffee mate liquid creamer and that was  yummy. i make this tea both hot and iced. Both ways its a nice tasty treat. The only down side is the bags don't have a string attached, so you have to use a fork or spoon to get the bag out of your tea cup. Not a big deal, but wanted you to know.

Everyone I shared them with thought they were delicious as well.  The tin of cookies will make for a wonderful treat for my niece to share with her friends.

I did find it much cheaper elsewhere practically half the price so I might try the other brand see what the extra dollars are all about. I am hoping they're all the same I'd rather save the extra money. But there you've it, even folks on a regular diet can enjoy this as well.

I know I'll find more uses for it and it will be very handy when a person is ill and needs to make sure they get enough liquids in their system since this is so easy to use and so tasty as well!

It has such a delightful, spicy sweet flavor (Bear in mind that I always add a dollop of honey or a single bag serving of Stevia to my cup.) It's a lovely tea that just tastes so Christmassy.

We love the sweet full-bodied flavor of the peaches, enhanced with blackberry leaves, orange peel and passion fruit. Serve it ice-cold, with honey or Stevia, for that down-home taste of the deep South during the summer. It's equally wonderful as a hot drink to warm you up on a cold winter morning. The chamomile makes it a great option, when you need to calm down after a tough day at work or relax at bedtime.

9050	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It has interested me for many years that in a society where we know sodium contributes to health issues, our supply of assorted gourmet salts is increasing.  In all honesty, for average cooking as in salting water or soups, I grab the old standby of Kosher salt,  For applications where the salt is added after the preparation, I often add Maldon Sea Salt Flakes from the UK.  My arsenal includes salts from all over the world, but there is something about this one that is my favorite when chocolate items are finished off with salt.  Caramels made with salt really pop when the Maldon is used.  I've had Maldon sea salt flakes in my cabinet for many years and doubt that I'll ever be without it.  It's that good.

I was right. These salt flakes are more coarse, perhaps a bit larger than sesame seeds but certainly not on the level of corn flakes. They taste fine, have a very nice texture while pinching, and give a delightful crunch when chewed. It's tough to argue with all this.

So, we were determined to recreate the recipe. We found giant limas at the local store. Back in the dark corner in a dusty plastic bag. We soaked and soaked, but no amount of ministering to them turned them into the plump, melt in your mouth limas we craved. Finally, after several years of searching, I finally ran across these limas on Amazon. And they are perfect. Creamy. Hold their shape, but are tender when cooked. Delectable flavor. Eureka!

El Yucateco produces a large number of hot sauces - a dizzying array and among their lineup are a number of what I would call "pure" hot sauces. By "pure" - I mean - the chile (in this case - the Habanero) is up front and center. Looking at the ingredients listed on the label of this particular hot sauce - the first ingredient (which means it is the main ingredient, as required by labeling laws) is the Habanero pepper. The next ingredient is water. That is unusual - most hot sauces have water as their main ingredient and often feature large quantities of vinegar too. All too often, the actual chile pepper becomes a minor ingredient in many hot sauces including some El Yucateco sauces.

I often use applesauce as a substitute and still do but for some reason it doesn't emulsify as well. With this not only am I pleased with the nutty earthy taste but you practically can't tell the difference between this and recipes that use eggs.

Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude.

7054	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	OK, so I was a little bit skeptical of purchasing this  since as you know, a mushroom sauce can taste either delicious or horrible. I only use "better than bouillon" brand for chicken and beef bouillon.  I was not disappointed, and this makes an amazing cream sauce.  This is best with fresh mushrooms, but canned mushrooms can also be used.  Rinse the mushrooms, then pat dry as much as possible, followed by a saut in oil of choice. I like to mix olive oil and butter. Mix with a little bit of red or white wine after they have been sauting for about five minutes, depending on what meat you are going to be putting in the sauce.  You can skip the wine if you're not a wine drinker.  I have also used beer which was surprisingly good.  Make sure that you allow it to soak up the mushroom so that it is very little liquid left in the pan. Add your mushroom bouillon, followed by cream, half-and-half, milk, or Greek yogurt (my personal favorite).  This is the most amazing mushroom sauce I have ever made!  This should be done on low-medium to medium heat to avoid curdling the milk.  You can then add cooked meat of your choosing. It also helps if you cook the meat in whatever oil you plan to use, then use that or oil to saut the mushrooms ( first step of the recipe).  Good luck, and I hope you enjoy this product as much as I do!

I received 4.4 ounces of this marvelous salt  in a Paris Package of fine food samples sold by trytheworld.com. Amazon apparently does not offer this company's ware -- boxes of fine foods from different locations around the world.

So, this time around I purchased the larger size container.  We use a lot, as we make a lot of french toast for our kids, and I bake a lot of banana bread.

I see some complaints about too salty - I don't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)...the hot sensation goes away very quickly...we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat.

1. Brewer's yeast does not contain vitamin B12, an essential vitamin found in meat, fish or dairy products. Vegetarians sometimes take brewer's yeast mistakenly believing that it provides B12, but B12 is animal source not vegetable. One tablespoon of Spirulina offers 67% vitamin B12 in comparison to 2% in brewer's yeast but regardless even the spirulina does not have any B12 beneficial to humans. The B12 in spirulina is purely worthless since it is not the needed B12 like in sardines. I consume mainly consume greens as well as salmon, sardines and sprats. Only canned small fish for me, no tuna, no chicken, no beef.

Give the added bonus that it does induce a gentle calm that allows for a smoother bedtime and you can't lose!

Taste, of course, is a matter of taste! Well this is the one for us. I really have to wonder about the reviewers (of other brands) who say the yeast tastes like cheese. ???? I think they've been vegan so long they don't really remember cheese. Anyway I'm not looking for imitation cheese.

A huge hint might be the picture of a pig on the bottle.  Use it on pork!  Pulled pork.  Another hint is the color, it's not exactly "sweet and mild" - it's sharp and hot.  Not hot sauce hot - you can add that too if you want.
I was totally unprepared for the enthusiasm a new and very close friend expressed on the telephone yesterday. She was born and raised near Paris, is a superb home cook, and has exquisite sense of taste, especially for French foods. As well as I can remember, she said:
Important: There is a significant difference between this "extra hot" variety of Valentina and their regular version. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called "extra hot" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the "extra hot" is far superior.

I went through the first small bottle in no time but I believe this 33 oz. bottle will last a long time. This can be used whenever you need vanilla. It is not really a paste but it is thicker than regular vanilla. Now that I have all that unused regular vanilla I  may dab it behind my ears.

1119	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	This came in a 10 ct variety pack that I ordered from Nesco's website.  This is seriously chili flavored, not buffalo wing flavored - not even close.  It's not even a good chili flavor - it's like imitation chili flavor.  Also, I used this seasoning with ground beef in the Nesco jerky gun, and it prevented the beef from binding and caused the strips to break apart while ejecting the meat onto the rack.  Very difficult to work with.  I'm SO glad I didn't get stuck with a whole box - ruining a pound of meat was bad enough.

I bought the 7.9 ounce jar. It's excellent. Just yesterday I made a beef-flavored soup/stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent. Everything turned out perfect.

but the tracking lied. It said that this package was "handed to the resident". UM NO, it certainly was not! it was handed to my front doormat.
I updated my 2 stars to 4 stars because I found a wonderful use for this date sugar & it is in smoothies it works perfectly & now I am going to purchase more for that reason & I will try to make other things like cookies, brownies & other sweet goodies. Now that I have found a use for it, it works into my healthier diet really well. I think it was because I actually grounded it into what ever I was blending which made the dried date sugar blend very well. Now I am thinking of taking my tea & putting date sugar in & then blending it in my magic bullet or main blender & seeing if that helps with the tea situation & I know that sounds silly & weird, but it worked for the smoothies & it just may work for everything else. Plus there is nothing better to sweeten something like dates or organic natural fruits, rather then using regular sugar. So worth a try in my book & if it does not work I will still continue to use it for other stuff & also use the date sugar for sure for my smoothies & hopefully future other things. Will see!

I rarely recommend buying something that's more expensive than any "regular" type, but organic is well worth it as far as I'm concerned. Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.

2758	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'm really fond of this chai.  I like a lot of chais, but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea, sweetened with coconut.

The difference you may wonder?  Its the fine bits of seeds.  All other extract is pure runny liquid.  This stuff has small flecks of vanilla seeds and its "not" a runny extract.  Rather it is a thick syrupy extract that is less bitter and sweeter than other Bourbon Vanilla Extracts.

I normally buy Minor's Clam Base because it helps me to prepare a really fine seafood chowder. As of late I use the very same ingredients that go on a Boston Clam Chowder but I add lots of fresh seafood. It comes out creamy white, with diced potatoes, celery, onions, peas, carrots, corn and it taste very nice.

3407	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I've used Maggi seasoning sauce ever since I was a little kid. My parents are Thai-American, and we eat a lot of dishes with soup, noodles, and rice. We also make our own Thai sauces, using some dashes of Maggi seasoning. The times that I eat rice or even eggs, I always dash/splash this Maggi seasoning sauce on. This sauce is delicious and great and adds flavor to vegetable and meat dishes. A lot of the Thai people I know use this Maggi seasoning sauce. Plain soy sauce just doesn't compare to this Maggi seasoning sauce. In the past, each time I visited an Asian restaurant, plain old soy sauce just didn't cut the mustard for me. Once you have tried Maggi seasoning sauce, you get spoiled, and think that the typical soy sauce is bland and blah blah. The taste of Maggi seasoning sauce is special and unique. Maggi seasoning sauce is a staple in our household, and I couldn't imagine life without this Maggi seasoning sauce. If you want to have an idea of the kinds of dishes/meals you can create and make with this Maggi seasoning sauce, check out some recipes from one of Maggi's websites - type "descubremaggi" in the URL. Then click on recipes. Once the next page pops up, mark the box for Seasoning, and then mark the box for Search. Then a list of recipes pops up to give you some ideas on how to use Maggi seasoning sauce. This website features a lot of Latin American dishes, but you can use Maggi seasoning sauce on any kind of cuisine as well - European, Asian, American, etc. Try Maggi seasoning sauce. It will bring some flavor to your life!

I drink it every night--straight, no milk or sweetener--within an hour of bedtime; the chamomile helps me sleep (along with the magnesium tablet I wash down with the tea).  I buy the 6-pack online because it's not always available locally in stores.  The teabags smell like pot pourri, but I store them in an airtight container on the counter rather than stash all the boxes in the cupboard.  After use, the bags go in the compost and there are no staples to remove.

From Barry Farm you're going to get things cheaper, much cheaper. I've been buying products from Barry Farm for several years and they have been great to deal with. Their shipping is fair, but unfortunately, flours and starches weigh a lot and shipping isn't cheap. I purchase items from them that are too expensive to buy locally, things I can't find locally (finely ground white corn flour, sweet rice flour and Ivory Teff) and items that are better quality than what I can buy locally (the best sorghum flour anywhere). I usually order 25 or 30 pounds of product at a time and that reduces the overall price per pound to a reasonable cost.

It is great on a roast beef or pastrami sandwich. Excellent flavor profile. You should be thinking of things mustard might go on when using this. Not really hot at all to me, but I just stomached a dollop of Da' Bomb The Final Answer so I can't really be relied upon in that aspect.

8125	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I was never much of a hot beverage drinker until recently.  In fact, these are the first tea bag products I have ever tried! But I must say that the Fruit Sampler is both a great variety and great value.  Each of the flavors are distinct and aromatic.  I typically combine 1 packet of Splenda, 8 ounces of boiling water and 1 tea bag to a ceramic mug and wait about 5-10 minutes for the flavors to seep while the beverage cools.  When I reach the bottom of the mug, I often pour in an additional 8 ounces of water and a bit of sweetener and the second cup is equally flavorful! My pleasant experience with these teas caused me to expand out a bit and try some other flavors and varieties as well (see my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Celestial-Seasonings-Madagascar-Vanilla-Red-Tea/dp/B000E63LQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red Tea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Celestial-Seasonings-Cinnamon-Apple-Spice-Tea/dp/B000E65OII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice Tea</a>).  I am especially partial to the blueberry and cherry flavors.  These teas lend themselves well to additional little seasoning.  For instance, I sometimes add a bit of lemon or orange peel or perhaps a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg to give them a little extra pizzazz.  Overall: I'm very pleased and continue to keep my pantry stocked with these refreshing and flavorful beverages.

340	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter.  What I got was a GARISH collection of these that were FAR TOO UGLY to use on anything.  I do not recommend these to anyone. They do not match up to the picture shown.  Shame on Wilton for even making what they sent me.

According to the label: "1 Tbs. vanilla paste = 1 Tbs. vanilla extract = 1 vanilla bean".  In reality, my guess is that the paste is about half the strength of "extract".  Caveat, the alcohol in vanilla extract is probably a substantial portion of the vanilla-ish flavor in "extract".

4813	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	As advertised.
6238	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is by far the best honey I have ever had! I have many kinds, as I drink tea throughout the day. Not only does it taste good, but I don't need as much of this as the soft honey. I am hoping that I ingest just a few less carbs this way as I have to have my white and green teas every day. I just ordered 2 more. It will not disappoint.
These two bite crumbly cake/cookies are delicious. The butter and pecan flavors are subtle - don't expect shortcake sweetness. They accompany both tea and coffee perfectly. The only problem I have with them is that they are very crumbly. I was breaking off a piece for my 18 month old grand daughter and the thing just exploded all over the place. She loved it though. So did the dogs. The wife has eaten about half of these already in a couple of days.
Try it; bet you'll love it!

4391	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Yes this is very expensive but it doesn't hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle. The extract will make or break your recipe. It doesn't matter what brand of flour, butter, eggs, sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap, it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap. This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron. It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla, no alcohol aftertaste. However, the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it. You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabar's or any baking store.

3040	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	One of the best hot sauce on the planet. There is alot of flavor in a small bottle. Not that boring at all.
5900	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I was tempted to give this fewer stars, but it wouldn't be fair to blame the product for Amazon's poor packaging. Lyle's Golden Syrup is an outstanding and delicious syrup. If you make any kind of traditional English desserts, there is no substitute. If you simply use it in place of corn syrup, you'll never be satisfied with anything else again. I can only say: taste it. It speaks for itself, and it's immediately obvious that this isn't just something you use to add sweetness. It has a distinctive and delicious flavor all its own and will enhance any recipe where it can be used. Or, just dribble it with butter on muffins or toast. Divine!  Now, as for Amazon's packaging: terrible!  This product comes in a sturdy tin that could probably be stepped on by an elephant without being harmed, and yet Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived half caved in and pretty useless. Because it's a small and not expensive item, I won't go to the trouble of returning it - but I'll find another source to buy it rather than Amazon. This is carried by many specialty stores and health food stores.

890	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	This Color Mist was disappointing -- it just looked like an odd purple, not black. Despite repeat applications, the color never appeared black. The extra sprays made it seep under the cake stencil, so it just became a purple mess. I was able to scrape away the extra purple/blackish color and repair the whipped cream frosting, but I regret trying this product -- so I caution you if you need a dark color. When I was ordering for cake-decorating, the Color Mist had seemed likely to be the easiest way to decorate the cake top with a stencil. As it turns out, my back-up plan -- colored sugar -- actually worked much better. I cannot recommend this Color Mist, but CK's sanding sugar (if you want a very fine sugar with color) and crystal sugar (which is larger than granulated sugar) are excellent decorating products. I gave this Color Mist 2 stars only because the sprayer worked.
If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.

9918	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	After trying NuNaturals NuStevia, this one tastes almost like real sugar! It is actually the closest to the real thing among the ones I've tried. I will buy this brand again but of course will try other brands to see if I like it better than this. If I have to rate the sugar taste similarity (10 being exactly the same as sugar), I would say:
3617	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is really good mayo! The Tabasco flavor is not to much and I am very happy with the purchase. If you like tangy, spicy (and I do), one of the best tasting mayonnaise that I've ever had. Not best price, if you are merely comparing cost and ounce to dollars and cents, and comparing this high-quality specialized one to a cheap store-brand generic one, but if quality and flavor matter to you, this is a very good product. Makes sandwiches or snacks taste extra good. Adds a little zing to life -- I've used it on snacks, with pretzels -- just about anything you can think of,,,,and it only makes things taste better. Am sooo glad I tried this product and do not now want to be without it. I like hot food and often add Tabasco ,,,, but this is not too hot at all in case you are wondering. Not anything like Tabasco by itself, in fact I find it very tame.
445	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The expiry date is Jan 15, 2015. I ordered this just a few weeks ago, so this is very out of date coffee they are supplying! Will try coffee tomorrow and report further.
Not only is the tea caffeine free but it is Gluten free and Kosher Certified. It also makes a great tasting ice tea for the summertime.

1 pound, raw unpasteurized, organic almond, Best if Used By Date: May 2017, Country of Origin: SPAIN, Lot Number SO-03490 had a strong, offensive anise taste.

5326	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great for women.
The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.

Although Amazon does not have the best price, this is often an economical buy, especially helpful for busy bakers.  This is considered a quality yeast.  Recommended.

I would imagine if you're elderly you wouldn't be able to open or close this jar and I really think that's unfair and something that should be thought of. I'd hate to think when I'm 80 years old I have to resort to mustard out of a plastic squeeze bottle. I won't knock a star off because I'm reviewing the mustard and not the jar, but beware.

 Also, don't throw the teabag out after making a cup---I use a tall coffee cup, and it makes4 or 5 of those cups for me...first cup, heat water and steep teabag partway with a few dips, second cup, heat water and steep teabag a bit more, 3rd time heat water and let teabag steep for a minute or so, 4th and 5th times, I put teabag in water before heating in microwave, and when taken out, stir around for awhile...and still end up with dark, spicy tea!  I keep using the teabag this way unti it's not so dark, and time to get another! It's a good thing the teabags make lots of tea per bag, you probably won't stop at one cup!

8981	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This salt is a little luxury that really adds some texture and fun to everyday dishes.  These are very thin but large splinters of salt -- they almost remind me of snow flakes in that they start to melt the moment you place them on hot foods.  But enough of the flakes stay to add  crunch and saltiness.  There are no other salts quite like this.  Great on asparagus, salmon, tomatoes-- everything, but especially warm things where the flakes melt a little but not too much. When I purchased my first box I wondered how long it would take-- seemed like it would last forever but we like this so much that we found we were using it very frequently.  Came to Amazon to order more and discovered that the price here is really good -- the sticker from WS on my old box showed me that I paid about twice there as I did now on Amazon.  Maybe that is an outcome of the strong dollar?

It worked perfectly for my recipes and I received several compliments on the jellies and jams - you could say it was the recipe, but more technically it was all of the ingredients that made them turn our perfectly.
