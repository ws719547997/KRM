--The Suunto has one thing no Casio has--it's stylish.  Very European/high tech looking and built like a tank too.  Make no mistake, I'll still wear my Casio if I'm diving, because I don't want to scratch the Suunto (kind of crazy isn't it?  I'm not concerned about my Suunto dive gauges, lol).
1634	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We did a bit of shopping, before we decided on this purchase. It seems to have a heavier weight pole, than some of the competition, but they are all a little lacking in quality.  For the price, it was actually nice to have something that looked like it might last outside.  Some of the others were very flimsy, while the institutional ones were over priced.

3120	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very comfortable (I am 6'2" and 200#). It is the size of a raft (for a pool). Perfect for the price.
First test was an over-nighter where I walked maybe 50 yards from the car.  It's not really heavy for this purpose, but if you are worried about weight, it's not something you are going to want to put in your pack.  I'm not at a point in my life where I care about weight because I refuse to do miles and miles of hiking and don't mind carrying a 50lb pack for shorter distances.
With me I can overlook the cons that I listed because I am more interested in the actual operation of the binoculars.  I was very impressed with the field of view and the magnification.  For the price I don't think you can do any better!  They are really lightweight for the size and even if they work for a couple of years they are worth the cost.  They came well packed by Bushnell with everything you need right out of the box.  I'm sure you could spend a lot more and get much better quality but I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase!  All photos in this review were taken by me.  I hope this helps you make an informed purchasing decision.  [...] Thanks for reading!

Someone at SOG (or, more likely, one of their components vendors) couldn't be bothered to consider what happens when you stamp lettering right at a stress concentration point then harden a bit that will be subjected to considerable torsion (note in the picture that the crack follows the letter "A").  SOG's own parts listing is full of complaints about this and of course these aren't covered by the warranty.  If this is an example of their engineering or quality control, I can't wait to see what happens next.

6415	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Amazing! The best part is also the worst - they fly ridiculously far, which means they get stuck in trees, on roofs, or sink in a pond / lake. But totally worth it, just buy extras!

So all in all it's a nice multi-tool to have for the price...but if you don't want to muck with the sheath you can just get a better one.

I got these bands to facilitate some rehab exercises for my back post surgery.  I think they are a great value for all that you get and they seem to be very well constructed.  I looked around before I got these bands and there are really a lot of choices out there.  I think this set is one of the best values for the money.  They would also work well for travel as an exercise system in a very small bag that comes with the kit.  I really like the adaptor that allows you to hook into a door jamb v. having to us a door knob.  Also the ankle piece is nice to have as well.

3607	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The Aerobie Superdiscs are just terrific for use with disc catching dogs. The soft urethane edge will protect your pal from painful injury. Just as important, the discs fly very well: straight, with good distance, hover, and predictability. I've gotten frustrated with my own lack of skill in throwing other discs, but, these are almost perfect, for me. They work pretty well in no wind, but, if you can throw into a light head wind, the flights are impressive. I typically throw 100 feet, for my Brittany girl. My best throws are about 4 feet off the ground, passing her right shoulder... she'll catch every one of those. One minor annoyance is that the edge becomes difficult to grip firmly, when wet, as from dewy grass. I've made some wild throws trying to get used to that.
I hope this was helpful to somebody.

For example, I have a Swiss Champ and love it, but this model fails in the form factor department. It has so many tools on it that it is too wide and heavy to carry in the pocket and who really wants to carry a knife on their belt? The Swiss Champ also has a few tools on it that I would never use and to think that I cannot carry the knife because of tools I will never use kind of spoils it.
This board is different than other balance boards that I've used, and I really liked that. Even if you have another balance board, I'd recommend this one, too. It's probably most similar to skateboarding or snowboarding, but it will help your balance in any sport. It took me about three weeks to get to the point that I am today, but I started out super uncoordinated. You'll probably pick it up much faster. I thought it was a great balance board to learn on, too. I definitely felt a sense of accomplishment after I got my balance enough to stay up on it for a minute or two.

7131	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful scooter. My daughter has already had hours of fun on it, and due to the adjustable handlebars I anticipate that she will be able to use it for years to come. She is 5 years old and on the shorter end (about 36" tall) and it works well for her. The handlebars could even be adjusted a bit lower for a shorter child. The quality of this scooter is exceptional for the price, and it is easy to fold up one-handed. As a bonus, when folded it fits easily into the bottom of my umbrella stroller, so she can scooter to the library or store when I push her little brother in the stroller and it can go in the stroller when we go inside.
1826	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use these with a team of 13 little leaguers that are 7-8 years old. We use these before every game and every practice and the boys run around them 4 times per event. So, that's about 50 touches per event. We've had about 30 practices and games so that's about 1500 touches so far. They're getting real dirty but they aren't breaking and I'm very pleased with them. They're quite heavy but that's necessary to make them last. I am very happy with them. They make a great warm-up station. Have your kids run around them and practice their base rounding technique, checking for signs from the 3B coach as they run, etc... I like being able to set them at a shorter distance so we don't tire the kids. We're just warming up. After two round trips we do a full round trip doing shuffle steps and then we finish w/ a "4 step combo" which is a run to first, shuffle to 2B, back pedal to 3B and criss-cross to home. It is far better than running out and touching the outfield fence.
It is heavy, yup. It doesn't fit in my sink very well, but then if you've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill, he does it right on the stove. So while the giddle is hot, give it a good scrape with the spatula, and wipe it with a paper towel. You'll get 90% of the food/grease off the pan. Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest. (In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things.)

It's almost every bit as powerful as the corded Bulldog, and works great for smaller size holes. Combine this tool with a Makita impact driver, and you've got an ideal cordless solution to driving Tapcon fasteners into concrete and masonry. The part of the tool that accepts the battery is mounted on rubber to insulate the battery from vibration, and feels a little bit too loose. The battery still can vibrate against the tool itself. I think Makita could have put a little more work into their battery mount on this tool to better isolate the vibration. Otherwise, i'm very happy with my free tool!
2198	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I read several reviews for different binoculars on Amazon before buying these for my husband for Christmas.

1989	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	My wife was so proud that she found some binoculars at a descent price, all I was thinking was- OH NO! I opened them knowing bushnell is an ok name for cheap optics, not good, but ok. Upon viewing through them, my fear was confirmed. These were terrible and had to return them, luckily we could return them. Both pairs were the same. The parallax is completely off with no adjustment possible to fix the issue. Looking through them, you start to form an instant headache then realizing the image shift from one eye to the other is several feet off at 100'. all distances even up close the images between one eye and the other are off making these useless unless you decide to keep one eye closed at all times. Having said that, they make an ok scope, or if you have an eye patch, born with one eye, or just blind in one eye, cyclops, then it will be ok. As for anyone not in that category, you are best suited to hit your local shops and test some until you find a pair that actually work better than a mono scope.

We searched locally and were having a hard time finding what we wanted. Luckily for us Amazon had exactly what we needed. This mat is 2" thick and 6' feet long making it the perfect size to practice gymnastics moves at home. The added bonus of it folding in half for easier storage makes it perfect, since we can easily slide it under our couch when not using it. Highly recommend if you need a home gym mat that actually provide cushion.

It seems to be less bouncy than the mini trampolines I remember from childhood.  I attribute this to the use of elastic bands instead of springs.  But, I am willing to trade a little bounciness in exchange for my son never having to experience the pain of landing on a spring and getting pinched.

8254	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This review is from the perspective of the user of an old Silva Type 4 baseplate style compass (over 30 years!). I am impressed by the improvements made to compasses in general, but this is a real gem. The global needle really makes walking/hiking/etc easy while using the compass, as there is less of a need to really hold the base level. The needle just freely swings without any hangups. The built-in declination adjustment is very nicely done: a micro screw driver (on the lanyard with the compass) makes the adjustment from the back side of the compass. It stays put. If you're hiking the AT, then you'll need to make a few adjustments during your months of hiking, but otherwise, most people will likely leave the declination as it is for long periods. The built in inclinometer is nice and truly functional. The mirror system with notches at the top AND the bottom is a great modification allowing for easier sighting. The notch also allows altitude measurements in the field (height of trees and mountains), as long as you like doing tan calculations in your head... or carry a slide rule or pocket calculator with you. Good compass. I like it, and recommend it.
Pen:  Usually me or someone around me is asking for a pen.  Early versions of the MiniChamp and most other SAKs other than the Signature have a toothpick here, on the second generation, the pen was removable, and finally they utilized a retractable design. The retractable design is farily easily used.  Pull the gray lever towards the tools, then slide it down to the second slot.  If you want it longer, pull out the cuticle pusher. I don't use the toothpick as such.  Typically it's a general purpose poking and pulling doohickey.  I only need this on 91mm models.  A pen is a much better alternative to the toothpick.
9891	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use it for surffishing as well as on the causeways around the Indian River lagoon and it's a great companion for my Okuma Bait Casting reel.  I've landed fish nearing 50 pounds with it.
Can't speak for the more experienced bow shooters here, but for me this device is perfect.
Initial sight-in was done using maths and a military-style M-4 25m sight in target at 25 meters.  The rifle was grouping center of bull on it's thrid three-shot group.  It would not have done so had the Tasco's windage and elevation dials failed to move point of impact the quarter of a minute of angle per click that they're supposed to.
8194	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've used a variety of Silva compasses and sadly they too often end up with air bubbles inside them in consequence of poor sealing. Suunto has a reputation for very sturdy manufacturing and so I decided to give their product a try. The reason this is a "global" compass is that in some parts of the world, notably the southern hemisphere, the Earth's magnetic pole will tend to "drag" the needle down as you stand with the compass level with your waist. This can lead to a false reading. So the global compass is designed such that it gives a clear reading anywhere. If you plan to travel outside Europe and North America it's worth paying a little extra for this design feature.
9768	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love it.

5885	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased 2 sets based on all the reviews on these. I am very happy with them but they are a tad big for my kids still age 3 and 6. I know they will grow into them but they still wear them and they never fall off. They have a really nice feel to them and the gel seems to work good. They do come with its own carry net to store them and that is a bonus. I would recommend these to anyone.

Its locking lid makes it safer from spilling and the lid will flip open to either side for easy access. The cooler is rugged and the molded handle makes the cooler comfortable to carry. We have had ours for many years and it is still as good as the day we purchased it.
8004	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	On time delivery, the kids in my son's school loved to play with it.  Although the picture is more attractive and the colors online seem more vibrant them the ball itself, it is still a beautiful ball, It holds air for long time; size 3 is for preschoolers, and size 4 is ideal for 6 to 10 y.o. Size 5 is heavy for small kids; It's better for older kids over 12 (depending how big they are). For those who pay delivery, I would suggest to check your local sports stores/toys selling stores for good deals before buying it. There are many colorful balls out there for less($). The product plus shipping may be pricy compared with other brands in stores.  By the way, it doesn't  really glow in the dark. I bought the dark blue and green ball. How could a dark-blue ball glow in the dark? The green part was more visible but still is not really glowing how one would expect. Therefore, reduce your expectations about a "glowing-in-the-dark" ball. I thought about sending it back, but my son and his friends love it and that is really what matters.

When these are turned on, I can hear everything almost as if I weren't wearing them. And when a shot is fired, it protects my ears perfectly well and goes back to normal hearing immediately. I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have preferred an easier method of changing the batteries.
4222	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Once you get this tool you will use it for years.  Mostly for electronics and around the house tasks.  Can be used for camping but not really recommended as the little bits can fall out rather easily.  A coworker bought me one of these years ago.  Has been one of my most highly used computer accessories.  I've updated alot of RAM and many hard drives using this.  And watch out for times when the price is reduced, frequently around/before Thanksgiving.  A must have item for anyone tek.

The 1175e never really wobbled with my 250lb.+ weight--on the other hand, the 1100HR/A can wobble somewhat under such weight (max. weight is limited by the mfr. to 275 lbs). Until I shed significant weight recently, I even considered cutting up plywood into rectangular boards, bolting on metal straps to the boards, and attaching such makeshift "extension" feet outward onto the "legs" of the 1100HR/A, steadying it somewhat. Lighter-weight people, including most women who desire to use such machines, should have fewer problems with unwanted lateral machine movement....

2425	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a very nice little boat.  My daughter wanted it to play with in the swimming pool and it does the job nicely.  Keep in mind that it is small, really a childs raft.  My daughter is 14 and kind of tall - 5'7" - and somehow (barely) makes this work with two oars.  Surprisingly durable too for such an inexpensive raft - definitely happy we ordered it.

9301	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've used many different lines over the years.  Stren mono is my favorite.  It's relatively soft, with fairly low memory, so it behaves well on a spinning reel.  Fishing a lot of plastics, I find the line casts well and is easy to watch in the water.
but my favorite is to throw it in a reverse circle because it goes way higher and loops around several times. It's fun to throw as hard as you can so that it flies straight up and loops around almost unpredictably at first. Lots of fun! I love these
Baseplate Feet - the K&R had 4 grippy feet in the corners.  I made it a bit more stable when holding it down and drawing a line on your map.  The Silva and Suunto have 3 trippy feet.

I did my test two different ways and then compared the results. First I had my 90 lb. son blow each whistle 3 times while I listened from 1/4 mile away, over a small hill. We could not see each other, but we used walkie talkies to communicate. Then we traded places and repeated the testing. We both wrote down our scores which were based on how loud we perceived each whistle, and we did not show them to each other until all testing was done. Here were the results:

I bought these yellow ones to strap to my kid's jackets when we ski.  We like the glades and the bowls, so getting lost or getting hurt is a real thing.  These are loud as can be (did I mention the tinnitus?) and they work when wet (no pea).  Somehow the standard safety whistles you buy for kayaking or hiking always use a pea, which is a problem in wet or dirty conditions (like kayaking or hiking).  These are great and super reliable.

110	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I was unimpressed by this product.  It arrived in a box that was already splitting open, so I worried that I did not receive all of the pieces.  Luckily I did, but I could not put the thing together.  The screws seemed too big for the nuts they were supposed to go into and too long overall for the bar itself.  Had I been able to put this product together I would have had extra long screws poking out of each hole.

In order to use this dvd, I recommend being constantly aware of what your body can and can not do on any particular day.  Do NOT push in order to keep up with someone in the class ~ you can easily hurt yourself.  Prepare to modify poses if necessary (some days I modify, some days I don't), and you'll be able to enjoy all of the benefits Yoga has to offer.

Lastly, yes they are not heavy. I use 30-35 lbs dumbbell (in each hand) for biceps curl, it takes two purple bands to get close to that resistance; but not a constant resistance. So I'm going back to dumbbells for most of weight lifting workouts.

In the end, I'm very satisfied with the knife and also the service provided by the seller on Amazon.  The problem was a factory defect. It was not something the seller could have anticipated.  Had they checked out the knife before shipping it to me, I would've complained that the knife wasn't new.  Case made the mistake at the factory.  These things happen and as Case has a life time warranty, these things get fixed.

We have used them several times and it has been a lot of fun. They are tall boys and are able to stretch their legs out completely.  The boys had a hard time paddling at first although we have gone canoeing several times and they are accustomed to paddling. We figured out that the boat is much easier to maneuver if you sit in it backwards so that the front of the boat isn't so high out of the water. I recommend this product for a fun time on the lake.

There are many knock-off Aerobie products and they mostly fly like crap. The genuine orbiter is a great toy.  When tuned properly it will fly and return very well.  It is soft and mostly harmless to the young and old alike.  It is fairly ambidextrous and easy to get a reasonable flight out of.  Generally, it is a great entry-level boomerang, and a lot of fun.  I personally don't like it as much as harder 'rangs, they tend to hold a tune better and are more reliable, but also much more painful to catch improperly or for an innocent bystander to take to the back of the head.

If there is a negative, I guess it would be that it produces too much heat! I have a means of obtaining a simmer that involves covering one burner with foil.

The "computer" must be installed/wired correctly to work well. For the 1100HR/A, attaching the the heart rate sensors into the inside the  fixed handles indicates better design than those inside the removable handles of the 1175e--I haven't had problems with wildly inaccurate readings from either machine. The display offers many different "programs" for working out--programs are facilitated by differing placements of hidden magnets of differing strengths inside of the elliptical's mechanism: This offers differing levels of resistance for the differing programs (using magnets is very common for such machines).

there's only one single thing I dislike about this excellent compass - the tiny declination adjustment tool is easy to lose...magnetic declination changes slightly each year and it varies quite a bit depending on where you're located..if you like to take readings with the declination already adjusted properly or you travel frequently between states you'll need to regularly adjust it and that tiny 'wrench' iis easy to misplace...either secure it to the compass on its lanyard or tape it well to its case...

It's pretty simple. You just roll back and forth and balance on top of it. If you got really good at it, you could do tricks and turns, but I'm not good enough to do much more than roll back and forth.

This respirator offered what I needed at a decent price (and better selection on Amazon than local places).  The one size was a little concerning at first, but fits my big mug as evidenced by not smelling what I am spraying while wearing it.  I am sensitive to latex after wearing latex gloves for too many years, so I also needed something that would not make me ill, and thus far no issues.  I tend to sweat like mad, so it does get quite a bit of condensation buildup, but that is to be expected for passive protection like this. Unlike paper masks (and I use "good" ones at home), the moisture does not cause fogging of glasses, both plain safety and prescription safety.  I do not use it for extended times, usually less than an hour at a time, but it is comfortable in the Southern heat, so I recommend this wholeheartedly.  Don't skimp on safety gear, I must add.

I like having a set of bands around for when I can't get to the gym or I am traveling.  Everything easily fits in the bag that is included and they are compact.  It's very easy to switch positioning or add bands thanks to the quick release clips. I enjoy using bands with handles versus the therapy bands that are used by Physical Therapists or Yoga instructors.  Those tend to pinch the skin, and it's definitely harder to get a good workout in!  These bands almost feel the same as working out in the gym with the cable machine.

It was so impressive that I have ordered another 13-inch ring and 4 10-inch rings so I can pass these around to each of the kids families and family back in Iowa. The 10-inch ring is even easier to throw and goes a long ways. The 13-inch ring goes further, but the 10-inch ring is no slouch to distance. I think the 10-inch ring is better for small hands and is a little easier to control. But both sizes are a blast.
5.  Lanyard - The Suunto  lanyard is woven with reflective material, and really reflects my headlamp light!  It would be super easy to find this compass if you dropped it in the dark. A very nice feature indeed!  I did not use the included plastic attachment thing on the Suunto, as I read it could fall off and you could lose your compass.  I could easily see that.  I just larks-headed it on.  The Silva just had a plain red cord.  Both had a little stainless steel flat "screw "to adjust the declination.  The K&R lanyard was the most comfortable, and easily removable from the compass using the quick release buckle, but it "flapped" in a breeze, as a ribbon will do.

It doesn't hold up so well at the track.  Without properly damped shocks ("friction damped" by default), the car bounces around all over the place and frequently loses control.  It has a high center of gravity compared to its big brother, so it flips over all the time, and even with the 7-cell pack, doesn't have the speed to clear any real jumps.  Also, the turnbuckles are small aluminum threaded rods, and bend very easily.  There are a few companies that offer replacement shocks and turnbuckles, but that's up to you to decide if it's worth it.

The good part of this product is that those who need "less" resistance can use this , and then work up to the higher levels.  The instructions don't mention that.  This is really good when you have only a few minutes at a time.  5 minutes here and there adds up.  I recommend this highly.  The reason I don't give it a five is the door jamb piece.  I am not sure I can trust that.  I use large eye bolts that I screwed into the studs in the garage.  Those are very solid with no chance of slipping loose.

I have been using it for a bit and the bristle still looks new. There are two sets of darts included and these are good for guests or if you are new to throwing darts. They are nothing special, but a good bonus that is included with the dart board itself.
We've had the basketball for some time, and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have, this one holds air well. It has a good bounce, and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court, but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball.

One of the reasons I ordered this was for the waffle air pattern on the mattress rather than the standard tubular design on the more common mattresses. Well, I received the standard tube design air chambers on this mattress. I was miffed to say the least. It is too cheap to hassle with a return, but this is happening more and more on Amazon and I am getting frustrated. I feel a bit deceived by this practice. The mat is ok, just not the design I wanted, this pad is no where near as comfortable to sleep on. I have used both and much prefer the waffle pattern on the sleeping pad.

PSA: always check your bands to see if there are any cuts/fraying.  When they fail, they fail quickly and it hurts!
I mention this bit of history because Wenger always had one advantage over Victorinox, in my opinion, and that was the design of the scissors in their knives. The Victorinox scissor uses a spring steel piece that will eventually be subject to metal fatigue and break. They can be replaced (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Victorinox-Scissor-Spring-replacement/dp/B0031PHOFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Victorinox Scissor Spring replacement</a>, for example), but it is a nuisance. The Wenger scissors (for example, see&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wenger-16916-Esquire-Aluminum-Money-Clip-Red/dp/B0013AQHB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wenger 16916 Esquire Aluminum Money Clip, Red</a>) used a different lever spring design, that I think is actually more durable. Unfortunately, with the combination of the two brands, it seems that Victorinox is continuing to stay with their scissor spring design, which is what this particular knife uses as well. If you plan to use the scissors on the knife heavily, then I recommend buying a few scissor spring replacements up front to keep for when they are needed. The tweezers and toothpick that insert into the frame of the knife are another two pieces that are easily lost, and replacements can also be found easily.

To test this I have put snap caps in each of my firearms and installed the locks.  I then try to pull the trigger by pulling back on the lock as hard as I can.  None of my firearms will fire with these locks installed.  For the revolvers I even tried to cock the hammer manually with the lock installed, and the hammer would not come back.  If the hammer was cocked first and then the locks installed the revolvers might be able to be fired by pulling hard on the locks, but this would be a foolish way to store the handguns anyway and so I have not tested it.

Once you have it figured out it is pretty nice for regaining and maintaining balance, and probably good for board sports but that is not why I bought it.

Time will fly and you will have a great time with family and friends. You can get pricier boards and set ups but this will do for the occasional get togethers with friends and family. They also have a wall protector that you can get that is a good idea if you are putting this somewhere where you are not wanting the wall to end up looking like a pin cushion.

And as a result of the better rubber compound, 3M mounting tapes will not sure to it... I bought this to add a lip to my cars as many others have done but no 3M mounting tape (permanent outdoor, Extreme outdoor, etc) will work, even with properly cleaning the surface and heating the tape.

2617	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've owned my Kreg Pro Pack K2000 for about a year now, and wonder how did I ever live without it. I built myself a computer desk, and my wife a sewing desk. I find myself trying to think of new applications for pocket hole joinery. I still  use my biscuit joiner ocassionally, but I haven't used my dowling jig since I got my Kreg K2000, it's now retired for good. I think of all the time I've spent on debating the purchase of some expensive new power tool, and I've gotten more good out of my $125.00 Kreg K2000. I would recommend that any novice woodworker get a Kreg K2000 Pro Pack early on, and save the money you would have spent on a doweling jig for some pocket hole screws. You will be amazed when you build your first new cabinets or a desk and you can finish it in a couple of days instead of a week. Pocket hole joinery is fast and strong. I would say that it is my second favorite tool, just behind my table saw. Buy a Kreg K2000 Pro Pack, and you won't regret it.
Bottom line - I can not recommend this compass.

Given the much smaller size of the Sonik Blast, compared to the Storm, this would  be the whistle of choice for those preferring a smaller size. I will still keep the Storm attached to each of our kayaks as the whistle of choice, because I prefer the larger size for this purpose. For a backpack or pocket, however, I will be using the Sonik Blast. Having said all this, I would like to emphasize that none of these whistles are much of a "life-saver", for the following reason. Although we were able to hear these whistles at our test distance, it was only because we knew they were being blown and we were trying to hear them. Had I not known somebody was blowing these whistles, including the Storm, it is very doubtful I would have ever been able to distinguish the noise from the sounds of nature itself. In other words, whistles are only helpful at fairly close range, unless there is no other noise whatsoever going on, such as wind and birds. Bottom line: A whistle may save a life, but don't count on it.

I can't say for you, but for me this is better. Other thumb releases are overly complicated and way too sensitive. This is responsive enough for me without being a hair trigger. If I lost it I also would not be heartbroken at the price. A wise man told me archery is a sport that can be as cheap or as expensive as you make it. I shoot a seven year old Bear Element, use $80 a dozen Beeman carbon arrows, and this release and shoot well enough that my arrows rarely hit anything other than yellow, and I destroy far too many arrows stacking them.

This thing FLIES! Wow - with little effort, it goes high and long. You need a big yard/field or have a place where there aren't any tall trees. I can guarantee that it will get up into a tall tree if you aren't careful. I have had to get the ladder out several times after my 7-year old granddaughter got it over our heads and into the trees. This thing is very easy to throw. Our 7-year old granddaughter can hold the ring easily and can get this ring going some unbelievable distances for such a small kid. She has trouble with a regular frisbee and we were constantly chasing her misdirected throws with the old style frisbee. But this thing is so easy, she has learned to float it and throw it so the other end can catch it without running for their life.

9834	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this rod for shark fishing. Used it for the first time last night. I was throwing half a bunker and a 6oz pyramid in a fish finder. It doesn't cast as far as I'd hoped but I do get more distance than I could on my earlier setup. After some trial and error (and losing a rig getting snapped off on a cast), I found the trick was to use an extra long shock leader. 3-5 wraps on the reel is not enough. After I put a dozen wraps (65# mono), I could cast with full power and believe me, 6oz sinker and half a bunker far exceeds the load rating. I think the reason I got the snap off had to do partially with the small number of guides and also the size of the guides - especially the first one. It's kind of small and I think it caused some overrun which got my knot caught up in slapping the guides. With the extra long shock leader, once the rod settled down well into the cast, the line flow stabilized and didn't have such an effect on the knot. I'm using 30# braid main line connecting with fg knot.
5275	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Been using these for about four years.  They are perfect.  In the sun I use the blue tinted ones.  The material is flexible and seals to my face well.  They seem to last for about 1.5 year of swimming 3X a week for about an hour.  They can get a little foggy and start to turn black in the lens seams. I could probably do a deep cleaning, but I usually buy a new pair.  This is common with many goggles.

The frame is fairly strong and is definitely strong enough to hold the net. Though it is easy to set up and take apart, it does take some time. It's not a quick up and down set up. The net is not as strong as I would like it to be and it seems a bit tighter on the frame than the picture shows and doesn't fit as well. If you have a really strong kicker the net may not last long. Other than that, it's a good practice net for the backyard.

It looks identical to the one in this description, although the description does not include the model number.  The description provided here suggests it as a stove for backpacking, but this would be a ridiculous item to take backpacking.  There are much more compact & lightweight stoves to use for backpacking than this one.

The boat's parts list showed the original cable to be some obscure number which I could not find anywhere. With a bit more research, I found this cable in 14' length and took a gamble. This cable seems to be identical and it is a direct match, and fit just like the stock one. The steering is now back to normal. The gamble paid off.

At home I get a very good, full body workout. I like the handles and the ankle band... I only wish it came with two ankle bands.

I gave 4 stars because the cord takes some self tuning (it coils a little and doesn't grip well under my shoe when it's pressed to the floor). I guess in time I'll adjust to it, but I definitely have to buy a different color because the blue is limiting in exercise options due to its heavy tension. Also, the door attachment is a bit misleading in what you think it might be. You actually place it halfway inside the open door space and then close the door so the loop sticks out... problem with that is: I'm afraid that the 'knot' part inside the closed door will snap somehow and pop out--thus injuring me in the process (probably totally in my head but it's a scary thought for me nonetheless).

The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.

You've read about flimsy construction, dents, leaks and the like.  Mine came with a couple of dents and a slightly bent top lid, but the paint was in good shape and the parts fit together well.  I just finished test firing it, and the main burner boiled just over a pint of water in about 4 minutes -- not too long to wait for hot coffee or tea!  I had no leaks, the pan was stable on the cooking grid, and the whole assembly cooled down quickly after use.  I gave it four stars, but only because I am *slightly* disappointed in the thinness of the metal forming the body of the stove.  My dad had one from back in the '60's, and it was of MUCH better construction!

1007	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These bands are great.  The only room for improvement would be better carabiners/clips.

It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees.  Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to.  This set comes with an exercise guide.  These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups.  Isolate the hips for those ab exercises!  Have fun, mix it up!

3711	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use it for inflating kiteboarding kites.  It will not completely inflate the kite when it gets up to higher pressures needed.  However, it's great for saving a lot of the initial pumping time just to fill the bladders with air.  This is especially helpful with my bigger kites that take forever to inflate by hand.  I just hook up the pump, turn it on, and then layout my lines while the pump takes care of about 2/3 of the inflation needed in the kites.  Once the lines are layed out, I just finish off the remaining pumps needed with my hand pump.  This pump keeps a pretty good charge so far and can easily do initial inflations on 3 kites with just one charge.

Toothpick--a word of caution.  Unless your knife is a really old Swiss Army knife with the (now illegal) ivory toothpick (in this case, don't remove it!), I recommend replacing it for sanitary purposes, but keep the older one.

Call me impatient, but I don't enjoy standing there as long as I had to, just to fill a 16 oz. glass of water. So we basically just use this to wash our hands/face and brushing our teeth. We haven't had any problem with it rolling around or the flimsiness about it, but that's because we always hang it from a tree for easy access, and never used it on a table. It's probably flimsy so it can collapse for easy storage. I'm about to order a new one, and if the water flow wasn't so slow, I would have purchased this one again. But I'm trying a different one that looks like it has better flow.
I love these things, I'd highly recommends them to anyone that doesn't need a high dollar pair, and really, these should be double what they cost, they're that good.

4284	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The Suunto Observer is quality as are all Suunto products,the only drawback is the resin band,as I read in the reviews,they need to replace this band with a soft rubber band like you find on Reactor Watches!  Ihad my Observer only two weeks when the band clasp cracked and I don't think that is covered under the warranty!
--One reviewer stated that the battery life on the Casio's is far superior to the Suunto (even I did at the start of this review).  That IS an accurate statement.  What they left out though, is that the Suunto has an EASILY replaced battery that doesn't require the back of the watch to come off (Casio's DO require the back to be removed).  So it's a toss up.  I find on my Casio's that with regular backlight use, they get eaten up pretty quickly too.  Realize, Casio only rates their batteries at ONE use of the backlight per day, and who only uses a backlight once a day?  On their top rated G-Shock (which I also own) the battery life drops 2 YEARS when you use the backlight just twice a day.  I'll take Suunto's approach any day; just use a dime to remove a separate cover for the battery and you're back in business.

Ever since I've made a practice of procuring a Delorme gazetteer before exploring a state. I find them most valuable for that purpose. And so, a few years back, when I knew we were going to be in the greater Phoenix area and were then heading to the Grand Canyon, I figured I would make sure I had an Arizona atlas so I could see more than just what I could observe from the major highways. With this Arizona gazetteer I discovered backroads that aren't found on a regular roadmap, hiking trails and trailheads, and other points of interest. Plus, because these are topographical maps, I knew in advance what sort of terrain we would be getting into before we headed into it. This was especially useful for when we were hiking.

This is a great lure for walking the dog.  In fact there is almost no presentation that won't make the bass hit this.  I highly recommend it and if another big pike steals this one I'll immediately buy another one.
All in all, I would recommend the Paratool for anyone who needs a smaller, lightweight tool for tightening the occasional screw. And cracking the occasional beer.

9945	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Some time back I bought a Fenwick Methods Bait Casting Rod. A great versitle rod that comes in five pieces and can be made up into any of  4 separate rods each with a different power and action. I use this same rod to fish for trout in Wyoming as well as Bass in Texas, I just put it together differently for each situation. However, I have had trouble finding a quality closed face reel that fits it. At first I tried a Zebco Omega Pro3, (a quality reel), but the foot is to thick to fit the Fenwick. Other reels fit but didn't have the quality I was looking for. To make a long story shorter I finally happened on this Daiwa and it fits the bill. It's foot is thin enough to mount on the Fenwick and it's a quality reel like the Zebco Pro3. I gave it 4 stars because the line it came loaded with wasn't so great. Even though the write up billed it as a good professional line. Well, not compared to the Trilene fluorocarbon line I replaced it with. Also there is a lot of play in the drag adjustment dial but it functions. It doesn't have as smooth a feel retrieving line as the Zebco but this observation is a pretty picky one. So, all and all I'd say it's a great real and I would recommend its purchase. By the way my Abu Garcia Revo SX fits on the Fenwick fine, (it also has a thin foot), but it's not a closed face reel. Hey Zebco, why are the feet on your reels so thick.

VERY sturdy locks. I am sure they will fit any other gun out there as well, besides a lever action. I recommend these to anyone that is broke like me and can't get a gun safe, or simply wants to be more secure. Accidents suck, but they are always preventable. You are not getting these bad boys off without the key or harming the firearm. They come with 6 keys that fit all 3 locks. They have a nice rubber padding inside and on the rim to protect from scratching your beauties. They are easy to slip on and off (with the key of course) and they are adjustable by width. There are little teeth on the bolt that ticks as you put it on, allowing you to make a very tight (or loose) fit on your firearm. Last but not least, the keys. The keys are little gold keys with real teeth on them just like a real key. The keys are not from a crappy material either. If you are considering buying gun locks, try these out. I am sure you'll be happy.

A dime size drop of wax will clean a 24" x 18" section.  Wipe it on with one rag, buff it off before it dries with another rag.  Repeat until you get around the pool.

7820	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I got this compass because many on the net have referred this as the best compass on the market. I think this may be too much for most users but if you want the best this is it. Its a professional grade product with a lifetime warrantee so you cant really go wrong. Its a little bulkier than most other compasses I have used but it does have a nice rubber housing which doubles as a pencil eraser (for erasing pencil marks on topo maps) and a bunch of referenc cards housed behind the compass. This compass includes an inclinometer for measuring slope grades but I have not had the opportunity to use this feature. Good for orienteering, SAR work, professional pursuits....but might be overkill for general outdoor use.
The magnifying glass is also powerful enough to light char-cloth and can really zoom in on tiny map details. Also, the mirror can be used as a signaling device as well.

9087	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this 1.5 inch seat for my kayak (SOT that did not have a seat at all).  It stayed in place just fine on a 2 hour paddle and my rear end and legs felt much better.  However, because it elevated me so much, it interfered with the position of the seat so that I no longer had appropriate back support while paddling. I think I should have purchased the 1" one.  Anyway, it got wet during my paddling and the water just beaded off when I got out of the kayak and dried completely within minutes.  If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable kayak seat I would recommend this one as long as you get the correct amount of cushioning in inches.

Got it home, and got the kid suited up.  I certainly didn't want this thing to be the culprit of an emergency room visit.  The first task was just to get him up on it.  The green base certainly assists with getting up on this thing, but it still requires a good deal of balance to stay on, especially for one that has never done this before.  We probably worked on that for about 10-15 minutes.  Just step, step....hold it...and balance.  My 5 year old is somewhere around the low 40 pound range and when he steps on this, it doesn't move an inch from his weight.  The spring's tension is able to support him and I am wondering to myself if he is even going to be able to push down on it with his body.  After going through the "get on and balance yourself" trials, I then started to encourage him to use his weight to push down on the spring.  At first, he wanted to jump up and down, like you do on the floor, with his feet leaving the foot rest.  This, of course, didn't work so well, and we started working on using a combination of knee bending and pushing down with the arms.  This was more successful for him, but he certainly wasn't bouncing like Curious George.  His weight, or lack thereof, could only produce some meager bounces.  If I stand off to the side of him, placing one of my hands on the handle with his, and one hand on his back...I can assist with pushing down and that definitely gets him airborne.  As of right now, when he is doing it by himself, the green base plate never really leaves the ground and he is essentially bouncing in place.  The good news is that he is certainly working on balance and coordination.  He was getting frustrated for a while and was ready to toss it but I decided to make a little game of the whole thing to keep him interested and practicing.  I simply asked him to see if he could stay on it for 10 bounces.  I'd count them out loud and I would just increase the number every time.  He liked the challenge and after an hour of doing this, he made it to 105 independent bounces.

Fortunately, the Bell light has a sturdy enclosure where the top half slides backwards to open. This makes it almost impervious to front and vertical impacts.

I can jump on this thing without bottoming out, but not very high (~10-12"). If I jump any higher it bottoms out pretty easily. On the other hand, it does serve it's purpose and seems to be well built. I don't think I'll break it and it's a fun toy to bounce around on. The knee problem is there, but it's pretty minor. I didn't have bruised knees, but you can feel the pogo rubbing up against your knees as you jump. Good product.
The only problem is the glossy surface seems to be a bit sticky and collects dust from the floors, not really a big deal to me.
Seventh:  In an ideal situation I always recommend using a scope in the field before purchasing.  I was lucky to be able to do this.  Each person has their own needs and what works great for one person, might not be the best for another.

763	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	If you are on the go and are looking to get a good workout in, This is the band kit for you!  The clipping system for adding the resistance band is excellent.  You can get up to about 175 lbs of total resistance. It comes with a door mount so you can mount the resistance bands on a door way to get many additional exercises.  It also has the ankle attachment so you can work your legs mainly the adductors and abductors. While I was skeptical at first, you can really develop a good workout that will work the entire body.  The book it comes with shows you many.  Also I have found many YouTube videos on using bands in workouts.  Band for your exercise buck, you can't go wrong with this kit!
I've recommended this set to my friends and have bought one as a present for someone who was starting fitness for the New Year. Great product all around!

8155	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I looked at compasses in every price range and found more than a few I would love to have just because of their beautiful artistic designs. The old naval ones are by far my favorite and among the most expensive on my list. For my camping gear I chose a good quality, low priced compass with all the features I will likely ever need.
It does fit, although not perfectly centered, and I definitely could not use both at the same time.  (That's with the lid up and side protectors somewhat in position.)  That's okay.  The 10000 btu burners aren't going to bring things to temperature in an instant--a full water bath canner with quart jars of product can take up to an hour to get back to boiling after starting with near-boiling water.  As aggravating as that wait is, it is still far faster than my electric cooktop can manage indoors, and I also don't have the heat in my kitchen. (Mississippi is hot in the summer!)

She drew a whole scene with deer and game birds with a point system for hitting certain areas on our large glass sliding doors. We bought a bunch of the cheap nerf darts and they work perfectly with this. Hours of fun. Both have no trouble loading and firing on their own.
Action of the blade is smooth, and allows for quick one-handed operation.  The lock is secure and given the smooth action of the mechanism, it allows for one handed closure, also.  I can open this knife one-handed in about 1 second.

68	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Arizona is a deceptively big state with lots of wide open spaces and some specially rugged terrain, including the Grand Canyon.  This atlas should allow the average traveler to navigate pretty much anywhere on the road network, and to gain some appreciation for the terrain along the way.  The scale of the map is 1:260,000, which is reasonably useful for the size of the state.  Major roads are identified, and many minor roads are at least visible on the map.  The multicolored presentation enhances the terrain relief.  The map sheets are marked with latitude and longitude for GPS grids.

8841	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have tried many different brands and types of exercise tubes. This is one of the best and also happens to be the least expensive -- the only brand I buy now. The "very heavy" rating is accurate as it is heavier than many of the exercise tubes available in stores. (However some online specialty fitness stores offer tubes with even heavier resistance but at almost double the price.) I like the fact that the handle rotates. Some of the more expensive and fancy solid plastic handles do not rotate which makes bicep curls, rotator cuff exercises, etc., awkward.

After initial sight in, I shot another 49 rounds at a 100 yard target, then cleaned and dried the barrel, and "shot the square" to track elevation and windage adjustment.  Point of impact appeared to track the clicks at 1 M.O.A. per four as they're supposed to and I ended up where I started, grouping center-black.  I shot another 150 rounds, shooting some at 3X and some at 9X.  In retrospect, I wish I would have shot groups at every power setting to see if changes there affect point of impact.  Going from 3X to 9X, I didn't notice any change.

If you hit wires and it bounces back then throw better and do not hit the wires... That is what I tell myself anyway...
I am not an expert on glasses so I won't (and can't) get too technical.  Lens very clear at all magnifications.  I was a little surprised nothing was included for "clicking" the elevation/windage, but my pocket knife did the trick quite nicely anyway.  My local indoor range only goes to 50 yards and it took me about maybe 15 minutes to get it sighted in pretty close to what I wanted.

I would say the #1 annoying thing about this device is getting the ball in and out.  One method I have used to solve this problem is that I just bought a elven dollar soccer ball that just stays in the net.  I also use this for my 5 year old and it is perfect for him.

* Assembly was pretty quick and easy.  There is one step where it is nice/necessary to have someone else hold one side while you do the other.  The tension is a little scary at that point but then it pops into place and it's done.  I also messed it up because I put too many bands between two of the legs (make sure there are 5 bands between each pair of legs before the last stage in frame assembly).  I threaded a rope under and pulled and was able to get it over.

I used it for a week and played a few games and found that it has many dead spots. Dart will bounce out even though they are hitting the board and not the wire. Most of the bad areas were closer to the bullseye on numerous numbers. Also the double bullseye had  bad spots which is not cool. Hopefully I can find a better one.

I experienced another issue that I think would cause a greater issue.  Keeping the compass in my pocket or rucksack, I found the declination shifted quite a bit after some time passed.  I don't know if my experience is common or if mine is "looser" than normal.  Fortunately I noticed this early on and was able to monitor it/continually reset it.  However in my opinion this is a real problem.  If you constantly have to reset your declination, what is the point of making it adjustable to begin with?  You can't trust it to be at your set point, so you always have to double check it.
I have no complaints, really, except that the board is not as "self-healing" as boards I have owned in the past. But while it shows some of the holes, it still works fine for my uses ... just having some fun with or without friends.

Disadvantages: No sizzors. The file blade dosen't  have that grove for sharpening hooks, the tab for popping out the plier  head pokes holes in my pockets so I have to wear it on my belt. Because the  handles don't do that "leatherman T" the ruler is short, just the  length of one of the handles. I did a sawing test in the woods one day and  a 3" blade is too short for firewood. I've kept it incase I need to  cut away something while sailing. Otherwise you'll still need a regular  saw.

In usual outstanding Amazon "Prime" manner, the package for my Kastmaster arrived promptly yesterday...and..you guessed it! ...it contained a single Kastmaster Lure!
It's also the favorite disc of my teenage children.  My daughter likes that the edge is made of soft rubber which reduces the sting when I get overzealous and throw it too hard to her.
Phillips Screwdriver/Can Key.  This was why I picked the Craftsman over the similar Handyman, as the corkscrew is useless if I don't drink wine, unless I want to carry the little eyeglass screwdriver that screws into it. I always am using the Phillips screwdriver on my Fieldmaster.  Older ones like mine have a can key slot cut inside them, in which the cans that required them fell out of popularity long ago.  However, there are other uses for the can key, such as using the slot to roll up a tube of toothpaste.  Problem is, the can key Phillips doesn't work as well as the more modern one that's solid.
One of the drawbacks of years long usage is that the red markings on the baseplate are fading, as they are being rubbed off, etc. I'll do some research if there is a clear resin that can be applied in order to protect the markings. If anybody who reads my review has any suggestions, please feel free to share.

5551	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This ball is exactly what's pictured.  I don't expect it to be as durable as those with rubber outer coverings, but those aren't the "official" material and don't bounce the same way.  It's stitching is visible, which is unusual, but it still bounces and reacts the same way I expect a ball at this price point to behave.
Despite missing the rubber, I give it 5 stars. I highly recommend...

The bright orange material is great for visibility, and seems to be reasonably thick and durable.  The material  should stand up to sand at the beach, but probably isn't tough enough to withstand scraping against a rocky reef.  If you take this boat to the beach, you will need to be very careful.

3609	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love these things. We use them for ultimate Frisbee. Very forgiving when thrown by beginners and they don't hurt as much as getting hit with a real Frisbee. They aren't indestructible though so try not to bend them or step on them, or they won't fly as well. Also some die hard frisbee players don't like them as much because they fly differently than a normal frisbee.

For storage, we've been using the cardboard box it came in.  Obviously, that is not a great long term storage idea.  Unfortunately, I have not figured out which bag would fit it, nor was the Coleman website any help.  Apparently, this is an orphan model.  So, either we'll make a case from wood or sew one from fabric to protect the stove when not in use or for traveling.

2384	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This mylec net is a fun and cheap alternative to buying a metal version. The net is good quality and the only downside I've experienced is a quick wrist shot or slapshot will dislodge the bottom pipes and do so regularly. This can be fixed with the glue/apoxy that is commonly used with PVC but you'd lose the folding aspect of the net.

However, when I go camping it seems my friends (whom are mostly urban city dwellers with little to no camping skill have trouble with the whole pump up the gas thing. I've picked up this stove since using propane is easier for everyone else (I'm usually on the boat fishing while other people are using the stove). Also, I refill my own canisters so it's cheap for me to use.
5968	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The design on these things is horrible. This was bought for and used by a 2 year old so we're not talking about a lot of weight. First, the circular frame is actually two half circles that are bolted together. The bolt doesn't hold the circle frame flat, so it causes some legs to hit the floor while others are not. When the legs are not flat on the floor, the angled pressure cause them to bend and bending them back risks breaking them right off.

7722	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Comfortable and does the job well.
One other tiny note, the extra $$ for the Titanium model just isn't worth it.  Because the wrist band is only PARTIALLY metal mixed with elastomer, the weight difference between the Titanium and the Steel version was almost non-existent.  The Steel version is virtually identical and (I personally think) looks better than just the elastomer band -- but I realize this is a personal preference, so make sure you are able to compare the models side-by-side before making that purchase -- also keep in mind the elastomer version will be really snug for some guys who have rather large wrists.

I am in my mid-40s and at home I lead a sedentary life... home, office, home again. On the weekends, however, I am quite active, but my office lifestyle has resulted in a pretty bad case of arthritis in my back. I can't kayak all day and sleep on a thin ground pad. I have slept a lot in a hammock, but sometimes I succumb to a weird phenomenon of bladder pressure (meaning I go, get back in the hammock and two minutes later, I have to go again and have very little to go with). I also am not a narrow guy. I am amused at 20 inch pads. Heck, I wear a 48 coat. I also tend to be frugal.

6166	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I own a Victorinox Swiss Champ, Super Tinker, Midnight Mini Champ and now a Craftsman. In my opinion, the Craftsman is the best model to get. It achieves the perfect balance between containing all the really useful tools one will actually need vs. maintaining a form factor that is not so large it discourages carry.
1184	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great quality with a lifetime warrantee. The bands have metal d-rings that are sturdy. Not like the plastic ones they had at your target and walmart. You get 5 bands of different resistance and other goodies. I enjoy using them and it gives me a great workout.

329	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	After a couple years of very easy indoor use of maybe three times per week, two of the bands just snapped in one weeks time. One snapped and hit me in the face, so I'm not happy. I want a refund or replacement set.
812	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I ordered the bands because they are similar to the ones I am using in physical therapy.  I was happily surprised that they actually appear to be higher quality that the ones I am using in the office.  I also considered some carried at big box stores and they were single or double band slotted handles while these are simple hooks.  They are simple enough that my 9 yr old can swap out the band for exercise.

You know, sometimes babies will "faceplant" as they learn to crawl or even fall as they learn to stand.

Best of all they fold up and store under the couch and the handles really help to move them around easily.

9205	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Let me give you a good visual as to the solid build and quality of these inversion boots. I am 6' 6" tall and weight 289 pounds and use these daily. I first put these on and had visions of me landing on my head so i had my hands down to absorb the fall but there was no fall. I would watch the rivets to see if they would bend at all or if the hooks would as well. They are solid sturdy construction. Hard plastic and steel. The padding is fine.

3762	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is probably the best dart board I have ever owned. This is great for hanging in the basement and having some friends over or if you own a pub or billiard this would make a great addition. I used to play darts with my family when I was a kid so I was so excited to finally have a board of my own to be able to play with my own children. It is such a great stress reducer and when our little one starts to get upset or throw a fit, I let her throw a couple under close supervision of course and she just seems to forget whatever she is upset about. The corking in the panels seems to be really sturdy and well made. I would say this could definitely withstand whatever strength you put behind your throws. It's great for a home entertainment and I love the Viper brand. They seem to be a quality made product which is rare these days.

8406	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great scope for the money. If you want something good enough to hit deer at 250 yards this is good enough.
 This set sure saves a lot of time. You don't have to wait for hours, or overnight for the glue to set up. Also you don't have to contend with lots of clamps. The trade off is that you have to contend with the fact that their is a hole on the inside face of your work. They sell plugs in different types of wood to fill them. Then you chisel, sand, or whatever to get them flat. You could cut your own with a plug cutter. Do them deep, then cut them on a saw at the angle of the pocket hole jig. If you are exacting, you could glue them in flush. The other alternative, is in the case of kitchen cabinets, to attach the face panels, you cut your pocket holes,on the outside of the cabinet, so when they are joined together you do not see them.

1667	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Surprisingly high quality.  I wasn't expecting too much given the low price on this item, but was pleasantly surprised.  The posts are made of thick metal and the net is easy to adjust and connect.  This is a good size for a back yard or for peewee leagues just learning the basics of footie! UPDATE:  After leaving this out for about 10 months, 7-8 of which were in the full blazing hot south texas sun, the velcro straps that hold the netting to the metal frame have pretty much succumbed and have frayed beyong purposeful use.  I've reattached using zip ties and hope those last a bit longer than the original velcro attachments.  Otherwise the frame and netting have done quite well otherwise.  I'll keep this at a 5 star rating because for what I paid (less than 25), and the conditions it has endured, it has held up remarkably well.  If this were used indoors, I could see this lasting indefinitely.

After a couple of uses sitting on picnic tables or the ground, multiple punctures have developed, that I have had to patch.  The plastic is cheap and easily punctures.  Its depressing to get to the middle of nowhere and find an empty container with water all over the floor of your trunk.  Coleman products are cheap, you get what you pay for.

6277	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This particular whistle is a Chinese knock off and does not perform as well as an authentic Fox40 whistle.  I received this whistle and was concerned that it took significant power to create a sound, so I contacted Fox40 and they confirmed that this whistle was not manufactured by them.  The seller "Poolweb" is obviously selling defective Chinese knockoff whistles which could prove useless in a crisis situation.... DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WHISTLE FROM POOLWEB!!.
So one star off for customer aggravation on what is otherwise a 5 star product and 5 star service.  If you collect Case knives, then you know what you're getting.  USA quality at a USA price.

No, it's a ring, not a disc, it's made to do one thing, and that is to fly straight and far really well, and be easy to catch. the smaller one does do this pretty well, but the bigger one does it better, plus, you can catch the bigger one with your head which is more entertaining than it sounds

They won't and haven't fallen apart through all the boxing matches we have held in our living room.  Both by six and two year old love to wear them and they fit both.  One size truly does fit most.  The gloves are soft and the padding is thick to ensure that our children, daddy, and grandfather won't be injured.  The gloves come in a zipper bag for storage and has also held up the past 7 months with no signs of wear.  I highly recommend these gloves for all ages.

I find it insane that a company expects you to shell out $30, $40, $50 and even $100+ for a sleeping mat. I am not going into arctic weather, hurricane conditions, or trekking the sahara.

Nail file with nail cleaner--this is the only nailfile Victorinox makes that still has a cut (metal file) style surface.  It files metal and nails equally well--which is excellently.  Nail cleaner doesn't work as well as on the 58mm series, but is an excellent No. 1 Phillips screwdriver.

That said, when I caught my 6yo and her cousin hanging from the top bar like a pair of monkeys, it still took that 90-ish pounds of weight without bending or bowing at all.  The poles lock together with clip pins, ensuring it stays securely together through play and them pops apart quickly for travel or storage.

8600	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This replaced the same tubing I wore out after regular use over a year. I like the resistance level and the tubing is nice, high quality. The only reason my previous unit wore out is because of an abrasive attachment point I used; I'm sure it could last twice as long if I had a better wall attachment method. I did not realize I bought the version with no foam on the handles, which I prefer. But, I simply cut off the foam part on my previous unit and wrapped them around the plastic handles on this one (I could not switch out the whole handles). I could probably glue them, too, but they are staying on just fine. Not sure if they are still making the foam grip version, but they wanted what seems like a lot more just for some foam. You can come up with something yourself with a little thought.
3367	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use these for my dogs.  They are lightweight and fly true.  You can't throw them very far, but that's ok for working a dog.  They are the lightest real frisbees I could find.  Obviously, I don't want to hurt my dogs teeth.

4346	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	My first comment will be positive.  The mounting clamp is good and works well without tools.  The flexible arm was also solid and held nearly any position desired.  Even with the really large mirror, this stayed in place and the vibrations were adequate.

Great product. One bit of advice, do not leave it out side. It will rust. I place ours in the garage while not in use.

2145	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love these binoculars. Great value for the price and exactly what is was looking for.
649	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is one of the nicest workout equipment I got! I've been using these for about a year and a half, and they still work fantastic. The handles at the ends are able to rotate, which could be good or bad, depending on whether you want to workout your wrist, but I like it because it is appropriate for resistance bands. It comes with the bag as shown, so you are able to conveniently store it or carry it around. I haven't used the ankle strap much, but it is secure. I like doing bicep lifts with these, and I notice the results more quickly than using traditional weights. However, it won't help with lifting weights, as weights require you to use your wrist as well, which you don't get much wrist workout with these. I use them in addition to lifting weights.
1739	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Its a Year old today....  and Its a great Goal worthe price.  I would recommend using Zip ties the Velcro wears out.

9905	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I love this rod! Like others have said, I had to sand down the butt end connections, the tip end connection was OK. When I received the package, the box was mashed and mangled and made me worry that the rod was broke, but upon opening and checking the rod from end to end, was OK. There could be some peanuts or scrap paper packed in around the rod to protect it in shipment. For those that don't know what peanuts I'm referring to is Styrofoam  pieces. Very good price and product seems to be made to last of good quality and would recommend to anyone that  is in the market for this type of rod.

7299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Daughter loves the scooter. It's the perfect size for her (she's 47" tall). My only complaint is that there is no kick stand so it ends up being put down on the ground. Bad idea since the foam on the handles will get all ruined because of it. We ended up buying a separate "scooter stand" on amazon so it doesn't end up thrown down on the garage floor.

The rear adjustable strap has a quick release.

8172	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have other Suunto compasses, but I really like the settable declination on this model.

232	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have had 3 sets of resistance bands made by others, and the ones I have from BMP are simply the best by far. They are stronger, more durable and, most importantly, so much smoother is use. When I first got them (this one is just the strongest one that did not come with the 5 band set I bought last year), I noticed that they were shorter than any others I had used and was quite concerned. But, once I used them, I found the range of motion was the same and the smoothness of the motion was so superior that I can feel I am getting a much better workout.
Well Made: Top quality materials, stays sharp and easy to maintain, blades are sandwiched between two polished brass plates for smooth operation.
7578	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We bought this as an inexpensive replacement scooter for my son's stolen expensive one. It is a nice little scooter, though the standing board is much shorter and it doesn't expand to as tall as the other ones. It easily folds in half and then the handles pop out (via cable and steel button) for very compact storage. It is very simple to fold and unfold (my 9 yr old can do it without help, even the steel buttons). Wish it was taller..but it does go fast and manuevers smoothly.

My son is 13 and these are similar to the one's he used on his high school team.  All of them were in very good condition (individually wrapped) when they arrived.  I use most of them for hitting, but I set aside 5 or so to practice his pitching with non scuffed balls.  This is a good set if you are looking for a baseball similar to what is used in leagues for 12 years old through high  school.

6988	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The handle won't raise more than a couple inches. It says "For 5 and up, and 143 lb weight limit." I assumed this meant the handle would raise as high as our old Razor. My daughter is 4'11 and 85 pounds. Tall and very skinny.

1573	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this for my 14 year old nephew's birthday.  He got it all set up and the netting ripped after the second time he kicked the ball at it.  Not sure if it was a defect or very cheaply made, but I was not very impressed with the quality of this product.  Unless you're buying it for a young child who can't kick the ball very hard, I would avoid this product.
The 4ft x 6ft is large enough so that an adult can play, too. We haven't used a regulation soccer ball on it yet, since kids like to play barefoot, but those cheap $1 grocery store balls (about the size of a soccer ball), work well too (and no one gets hurt).

If you purchase the "SPRI ES503R Xertube Resistence Band (Purple, Very Heavy)" and do not expect it to substitute for your gym membership and the equipment available there, you should be satisfied with your purchase.

2911	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 8 yr old son loves his scooter again.  The rear wheel on his original scooter was so worn out from using the brake that it was making a noise every time he used it.  I decided it was time to replace his wheels.
lastly, I've read some reviews where there clearly seems to be a confusion of who manufactures the most popular brands of compasses and where...
5186	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son is a basketball fanatic.  And at 15, in just a year and a half of playing seriously (pickup games, etc.) he has become quite the fanatic.  He already had 3 previous balls he plays with.  But when he saw this one he said 'yep, that's pro quality' with a long smile.  The grip is so good, the response is up there also.  If you want to bring a smile to your players face you can't go wrong.
3528	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very nice frisbee. My son likes to throw it when I'm not expecting so it's not as bad when it hits me in the head.... He just turned 3 so we're learning how to play frisbee. It's got soft rubbery edges but is heavier than a typical plastic frisbee so I'm still worried about him getting hurt by it.
The best part is the kids love these. They can go fast with minimal effort. The learning curve for a 5 year old is about 10 to 15 minutes to be able to ride. In addition, we see young teens still riding them at the local skate park doing tricks. So not only does the product last but so does the fun.
3241	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I took it to the headwaters of the Amazon in Ecuador to camp out. I made the mistake of not trying it out before I left. When I went to blow it up I noticed that the tube which would admit the air to the mattress was blocked. I guess it was an manufacture defect. I tried several ways to punction the obstruction but could not. Needless to say not having it made life difficult in the Amazon.

4856	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I use to camp with a full size carpet that was so heavy I could not carry it.  I have two of these (I need 1 or 2 more) that go on the floor of my tent - it makes it easier to clean out & adds some insulation.  These are light, they fold up super easily, they have handles.  Be flexible when you pick out colors they are not really true.  I ordered the black and white striped ones, they come a weird dark green and cream.  I've seen these in a few places and that IS their black and white.
1720	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These bases are the thick (I would guess about 5/8 of an inch) rubber type with a waffle like structure underneath to help with stability. I thought they seemed a bit expensive, but after purchasing and using them with my son, I believe the price is justified. These work much better than the flimsy cheap bases which migrate all over the field as they are used. These bases are heavy enough to stay put. It would have been nice to have a Pitchers rubber too, but it isn't like you can push off any non stationary base anyway. Still, it would be nice to have a reference point for the pitcher.

4093	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good price and a good lock for my guns
This mattress worked well and I generally recommend it.  The thick vinyl construction is noticeably better that the thin camping pads you'll find in big box stores.  While any air mattress has the real potential to leak, I didn't experience any leaks in five days using two new mattresses.  (I do recommend packing a bottle of Coghlan's 8880 Airstop on any trip that depends on air mattresses, just in case.)  One possible downside to the heavy construction is an air mattress that is probably too heavy for backpacking. I also agree with other reviewers that the pool float valve isn't inspired, but I was able to make it work (with a bellows pump) without major problems.
3497	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue,unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy,wrong! This product is as shoddy as most "BEll products" are. The rear light went out first,then the front light shorted out after a minor drop. Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of "Bell products" ever again. That's why i'm now a "Cateye's" and "Nite Ize" product fan.

I'm glad to spend the extra few minutes inflating this mattress for a solid night sleep.  Can't beat the price!

As a Veteran who wants quality field equipment for land navigation Suunto is my go to product because it works better than most. I bought three Suunto compasses, #1 the Orienteering compass with the flat plate, #2 the Ranger style compass and #3 the clipper button size compass that clips onto a map or watch band. If you buy a cheap compass you need to learn how to use a shadow stick because it would be more accurate. Suunto makes a quality product. The price was fair for the quality.

393	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Purchased these primarily for my wife to use. I ran them through the paces of doing some HIIT workouts, ranging from doing curls, lateral raises, and lunges to using them for unilateral work. The quality is good and I think this is a great starter set with a good reputation from Black Mountain. I like the fact that you can stack bands to increase resistance and that they are build on clips. The carry bag is pretty flimsy, so don't expect to use this for more than a stuff sack. Mine had the zipper break the second time I used it. Handles are good quality and their is a nice instruction sheet and reference guide for resistance. Black Mountain does offer a more robust set of bands, which I would recommend if you are an avid fitness person. I am and I abuse my gear. I will need the upgrade! This is also a lower price than I paid, so it's a better deal financially! Regardless, good product and the only change I would make is a better carry sack for taking these on the road.

My only gripe with the Suunto (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that the compass housing could be a tighter fit in the baseplate.  It does move a bit side to side in the baseplate (maybe 1-2 degrees worth of "slop").  My work-around is to make sure the compass is firmly up at the top where the direction pointer is.  My bearings are fine this way.

4328	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly, it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat.  It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material.  That was it, it was ruined.  It lasted one season of riding.  Felt good when it worked.  It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat.  After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine.

I would recommend these if you are looking for good quality bands at a great price.
We also have the Jump-o-lene (an inflatable jumping toy). Although we enjoy that as well, it takes up a lot of room and requires a lot of push to gain any bounce. I am hoping this is the next step up in strengthening leg muscles and increasing one, and two footed coordination.

1999	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These are quite good for the price.  I have 5 sets of binoculars of various sizes ranging from 10X25 to 15X70.  These are good all around utility binoculars for daytime use, looking out over the water from the beach or for a day of hiking.  They are comfortable in the hand and comfortably light to carry.  I have never gotten them wet but they are not advertised as waterproof so I would not use them in the rain.
501	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased these as a Plan B for exercise while traveling, for my off days from yoga, and a nice outdoor stretch/workout on the weekends. I've only used it a couple times, but it seems really sturdy and haven't had any issues. The door anchor works great too! My only complaint is the straps do rub on your arms when doing certain resistance exercises. For example, while standing on the band and doing bicep curls, the straps rub on the forearms, but It's not too terrible.
4007	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	So far so good. I will update my review after a few weeks of use. **Update** I rent these balls out at our park and they have held up very well against other brands. People also seem very excited to get a "Wilson" ball so, they take better care of it.
Even though most of the aforementioned pedometers were 3-4 times more expensive than this Sportline Step Counter, they soon went into a desk drawer and became mere collectors' items.  The Sportline, on the other hand, has seen a lot of use.  It has a strong spring clip and is quite durable and accurate.  It may not be very smart, but it can count.

Pick and pluck foam is FANTASTIC!  It's the next best thing to having an expensive custom cut.  Be sure to use silk fabric between the foam and your expensive equipment, as the foam has tendency to flake off in very small pieces.

1668	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Got this for my 8 year old soccer fanatic.  It was very quick and easy to assemble without assistance (maybe 5 minutes).  I'm disappointed the net is extremely loose and saggy.  The velcro straps you use to attach it mean you can take the goal apart if you need to (which is nice) but they don't hold the net very well.  I may switch to zip ties and just snip them off if I ever need to take the frame apart.  He's had it for like 3 days already and has only broken one velcro strap (I have no clue how).  The frame appears sturdy enough even for my wild child.  The entire goal is relatively large (for a kid) but it's not heavy if you need to move it.  Overall, seems like a very good purchase.

I lift 5 days a week, and love to incorporate cable machines for full range of motion resistance.  Only problem is (was) that I don't have access to a cable machine at home or on the road and getting to the gym at 0530hrs was an exercise in self-discipline.  I looked at several other band sets from many other manufacturers before selecting Black Mountain.  At this price and with a 90-day return policy and lifetime warranty, if I didn't like them I could return them or let the wife and kids use them.  Throw in "Made in the USA" and I figured they were worth an audition.

That's right, you can really build muscle with these!  If you have no weights and want to work on building muscle, then these are a great replacement to start using.  Have weights and don't think you need these?  Think again.
Considering that the Xertube resistance band is cheap, lightweight, and versatile, it's hard to see how you could possibly go wrong with it.

3024	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Very difficult to inflate and deflate.  I bought this and a self inflating mat to test out the difference.  I ended up not even using this as I didn't have a pump to inflate it.  If you buy one, make sure you have something otherwise you will end up light headed from trying to blow the thing up.  The valve also made it very difficult to deflate.  I think it will work for some but I found it more nuisance than it was worth.  Somewhat heavy and awkward when compared to the self inflating mats.  If you have a few extra $ I would spend a little more on a better one.  I will probably give this one away or use it as a pool float.
2221	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This pair is really good for the price you pay. Serves it's purpose well.

The competitors foot switch is not rated to support 50AMP. Installation was easy if you can splice wire (most boat owners can).
BUT they do not row well because the oars push into the sides even when fully inflated. Difficult to control and slow moving.

Overall, I think this is the best compass on the market, though a bit pricey and I don't need the global needle.  But it will last, have used it many hundred times and it still works as good as new, the declination once locked in stays locked in (Just remember to reset it when you travel or you might end up being 20 degrees off your mark before you notice, like I was ;) ).

However, after lots of practice, and holding techniques, my wife and I was able to get it to come back consistently.... until it got stuck on the roof of a three story school. So we are purchasing another one. All in all, its a good toy, but not for those who lack the patience to learn it.
1589	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I only wish I bought this rebounder a few years ago, I think this is a great value, and very useful training tool.  I've coached 13 seasons of youth rec soccer between my children, indoor and outdoor, and have seen the full spectrum of skills and abilities on our teams.  I've recommended this training device to several kids on my teams who need extra  touches to improve their passing/trapping/shooting, and general foot coordination, I think they stand to benefit the most, but advanced players can benefit as well.

8101	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	For the life of me I can't get this boomerang to come back perfectly or consistently even after hours of trying. I've had this for over a month and probably have thrown it and caught it no more than three times but it still is an extremely fun toy to play with. Part of the fun is attempting to get it perfectly and having all my friends try to get it. I don't think this boomerang would see much flight time if I actually got it to come back easily though, that would bore me if there was no challenge. It is still much easier to throw than a real boomerang just not as easy as I initially thought which is a plus.
I'd definitely recommend giving this a try.

7519	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Well, not really. The thing that I had weighed more than I did, didn't have brakes and could not fold up on itself. But that was over sixty years ago and times have changed. I didn't get this for myself, but the young man who did get it loved it. He's mobile around the block, he's getting exercise and he's state of the art on a hi-tech well engineered piece of steel. What's not to liove?
For me being able to actively use the mask in a high heat environment and not feeling like I had a mask on has been great. I will likely also use this work staining the next wood project I work on.

My son, who is nervous about balancing on two wheels, saw my daughter having so much fun, he tried it out and they both fought over it. So, I had to go out and buy one the same day. Okay, I didn't have to, but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.

However, on my two lever-action rifles, it's not very effective -- probably no surprise, given the design. On an older Winchester 94, I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together, with some effort. On a Winchester 9422, it attaches itself to the trigger guard, and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded, cocked, and fired with the lock still in place.

The problem with the bed is that it has a hard time keeping its shape.  The pump will blow it up so that it appears to be inflated, however, it will need about 15 to 20 additional blows with your lungs in order to bring it to an acceptable density (I like it a little softer).  Once you lay on the bed for more than 1 hr you notice that it starts to deflate a bit.  The first 5 times I used it only lost 10% to 15% of its air after sleeping on it for 8 hrs.  During my most recent camping trip it lost 100% of its air within 2 hrs.

I liked that the elastic waist didn't dig in (no muffin top).  Two things to note though:  (i) it is a little long; I cut about 8 inches off, but it was really easy to do; and (ii) it is see-thru b/c unlined - I had to get a pair of yellow shorts to wear underneath which I hadn't planned on doing.
518	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have never used resistance bands so I can't compare them with other brands but I really like using these. I mostly only lift but I am limited at home because weights and benches are expensive. When I need to get in my workout but the gym is not an option these are a good substitute. I love that they come with a door holder so I can place the band I'm going to use at any height. The ankle strap and hand pulls are very good quality, actually this entire set is good quality and I can tell it's made well and made to last. I didn't think that using bands would ever compare to lifting but if I'm creative enough with the workouts I'm definitely sore the next two days. It also comes with a huge list of exercises to help you get started.

The two minor flaws.  The leather sheath has an internal plastic scabbard and it is sometimes difficult to re sheath the knife.  Even after repeated practice, the blade sometimes get hung up. If you remove the plastic scabbard, the blade will bounce around too much and the knife can more easily fall out of the sheath. This really isn't a big deal but if you're buying the knife, you should know about it before hand.

5133	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We got this for my son for his 6th birthday, and he loves this toy.  Having the base on it helped him to learn how to jump without it being too difficult.  At first, he could do maybe 2-4 jumps in a row.  He was already asking to take off the base.  I told him that when he could do 20 jumps in a row, we'd take off the base.  Well, after 2 weeks, he mastered 20 jumps in a row, so my son got his wish.  To my surprise, he can now jump on his pogo stick without the base.  My son is very energetic so this is excellent for having an outlet for his excess energy. :)
2021	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For this low price, one would expect a toy. This is no toy! Definitely the real deal. I'm not an expert but I have played around with binoculars and telescopes enough to recognize a solid, well-constructed, precision instrument.as opposed to a cheap plastic toy. It has a good clear view. I like the focus control that you tilt back and forth to adjust rather than the traditional knob which you twist. And the separate adjustment for the right eye allows you to dial it in to balance the focus correctly for both eyes. One other note: I have a small head and most binoculars are too wide to fold close enough to cover both eyes well. These Falcon's do! So they could be used by children as well as adults.
1731	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Wow! This is a very nice goal.  I had to upgrade because the kids were blowing holes through our picket fence when they missed the smaller goal we had for a few years. The dimensions are correct as stated. The poles and net are heavy duty and can take the strongest kicks so far.  It took a better part of an hour to set up as the directions were not exactly correct...and it was very cold!  Anyway, the kids are totally happy with this goal and I will not need to replace it for a long, long time.  Good job, Franklin.

2322	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am not a heavy user of a multi-tool.  I carry them on outings due to their versatility.  I bought a new one as I needed something more heavy duty.  I was very pleased with the SOG PowerLock right out of the box.  The overall quaility is good and it feels substantial.  It has a decent set of tools for what I want and the pliers are powerful. I most often need the pliers, the screwdrivers or the knife and all of those work well.  The scissors seem fragile.  I also bought the bit set.  I don't carry the tool on my belt, rather a backpack or daypack, so it is not a problem for me that the bits don't fit in the same sheath.  However, they really need a sheath as I suspect they would be easy to lose from the plastic holder. For durability and quality, I think this is a great tool.

6545	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	First of all, you can throw this thing 80-100 yds easily.  It's a workout to try and catch it when someone chucks it.  I made the mistake of leaving it on the rear window dash of my car in the las vegas heat and believe it or not, the thing is ruined.  It doesn't fly at all anymore.  Let that be a lesson to you if you buy it, which I will do again because it is awesome.  It is affected by extreme heat.  But you have to remember the temps here are 106 daily.  So probably won't effect too many folks.  Otherwise, totally legit.  Would and will buy again.
The only slight thing I wish I could change is that the blue edging cover is not particularly attractive.  I'd rather it was black, or not so shiny.  This is a small detail that doesn't ruin the trampoline.  The important part is the nylon mesh material that you jump on, which is very nice, black, slightly shiny, and sturdy.

8896	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My family and I have all enjoyed these resistance bands.  We feel we are getting as good of a work-out as a gym can offer.  The bands are comfortable although strong and seem to be made of very good material.
8900	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This works very well for me.  Its great when traveling to maintain fitness since it weighs about a pound, and I use it as part of a weight and aerobic workout at home as well.  It is a nice change of pace and allows you to do some expercises not easily done on equipment.  As another reviewier rightly observed, its not a substitute for heavy weights to failure.  Its a high rep toning device that will mininimize backsliding when you cannot work out otherwise and add to a full workout with a little something different.  For the price it certainly earns its keep.
9752	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Always useful, my unit did not come with wrench, the pins are a plus.
My husband and I worked on this for over an hour.  We got two pieces together, and finally gave up.
Good value, everything great still after a few weeks of hard use.  I can see me wanting more velcro straps as they wear and age from outdoor exposure, but that is an easy one.
Love these, and great price! This is my first pairs of Soffe Authentic shorts. I'm not a Junior size, so I was concerned by the sizing, but Amazon offers free returns, so I took the risk. I am 121 lbs and size mens medium, women's maybe 10, but I wear these boxers low on my hips and I like them LOOSE. I don't want the short shorts look either, I'm an adult, not a teenager or millennium. So I decided to buy the XL and I was happy I did, they are very roomy without falling off. If you are a size 10 and want loose, you probably could buy the large, but I wanted extra loose!
It is THICK enough to absorb the difference between a wooden floor and my sensitive bones. It is FIRM enough to support my back when I'm doing leg lifts etc. Having just ONE fold gives it a consistent smooth surface.

507	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a good product and the company seems to sell only quality. The bands can be stretch by 400% their original size without breaking.  the handles and the elastic plastic feel nice and are not flimsy.  My only complaint is that i needed bands with higher tension, but the red tension band at thirty pound lets me train my muscles, but the yellow and blue band are very low weight. I don't know what i would do with those
on the plus side, i was surprised that i didn't have a stiff back after sleeping on this - many air mattresses are hard on my back but this one was good.  maybe BECAUSE it's not super-thick, so the ground offers some support.
5185	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This ball is better than many balls that cost twice as much.  Very soft feel, wide grooves, great for kids.  Been coaching youth basketball for several years - my ball bag is full of these now and gave away everything else.

98	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This toy/sled is the biggest piece of garbage! It has been hyped on U-tube and it's really not worth a crap for anything! To start with I'm a father of 2 active and sports oriented kids, a son who's 10 and a daughter who's 9. To get an idea of our outside activities we ski, snowboard and go sledding every year and both children play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago. This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best). All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck! The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap. As a final note what a piece of garbage this thing is: Since Christmas when my kids and their friends got these they have been sitting in a pile outside my garage and have not been touched once, the kids have absolutely no interest in these.

9800	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We had these when we were kids, and that's why I wanted to get them for my nephews.  They broke them by the second day, but having had them we were able to rig them fairly easily. The metal tab that hold the actual bow on broke off, and we replace it with a bigger piece of metal.  Then on the other one, the string holder broke and we replaced it with a washer and a boot shoe lace because there wasn't enough slack to retie the string.  It also allowed us to slow it down a bit... These are pretty fast little darts.  I am giving 4 starts because, with simple fixes they will last a long time.  They would have gotten 5 if they hadn't broken so quickly.
7645	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this to replace a Nalgene I'd used for 2 years, I finally got concerned enough about the chemicals leaching from the plastic.  It works well, is easy to drink out of, and looks good.  The only things I miss about the Nalgene are: the loop that kept the cap attached, and the ability to put it in the freezer.

Please note, the complaints about the tools and the locking mechanism... very true.  When you pull out a tool, make sure every other tool is closed back in just right and then make sure your tool is locked. It's very easy to pull out the knife, push the other tools back, and forget to make sure the knife is then locked.  The "piano style" lock SnakeStrike77 mentions in his review, and as seen in the pictures would be very nice, but they don't exist on this model.  The single plate as seen in the video does.

97	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this calendar for years, ever since I discovered it on the shelf at Borders (I now order it from Amazon).  My family runs by the "If it isn't on the Calendar It doesn't exist" rule.  Lots of room to write in each box for appointments, reminders, celebrations, etc.  About every other month is a color pic, but that is not a problem as my daughter loves to color in the months not color printed and it makes the calendar even better.  I think, I would actually be sad if they had full color and I couldn't have her "fix" it for me as she has been doing this for years!
3504	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Very poorly constructed switch. Press it just a little too hard and its internal glue breaks. After that it lets rainwater in to short everything out. Not a terrible unit for the price if you are very careful with it and never use it in the rain. Flashing mode is adequate for letting people see you, but not otherwise particularly bright. It's an inexpensive unit that may last a couple of months.
6199	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	That is simply unacceptable! Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.
6532	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	If you haven't used an Aerobie Ring, they really do fly well.  They are fairly easy for kids to catch since they are open in the middle.

382	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I enjoyed my bands very well put together.
3772	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great board, very heavy and well-made.  I hung this in the garage and my husband likes to go out and throw with the older kids, looks like fun and they get into competitive mode and play for about an hour every few days.  The board does not look too bad after them using it for days and I could see this lasting for quite awhile.
 - Leather case is crap. The leather is nice quality IMO but it has a plastic clasp and enough head room for it to slip out on the job. (Easily fixed by taking it off and moving it down a little the it becomes very nice)

1173	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought these bands a few months ago as a way of diversifying my workout - I'd been a dumbbells and chin-up bar guy until then.  I find the bands to be well-made and sturdy, and I like the design of the clips and removable handle.  It means that I'm dealing with less bulk, of which I'm always a fan.  Plus, because the clips swivel, there's never an issue with "going against the grain" that I've felt with other bands.  Ultimately, though, these are better for someone needing a lighter workout than I.  Thus, my girlfriend loves them, but I have limited use for them.  This is probably my own fault, though, so I will get a band of higher resistance from BMP and I think it will have greater utility.

So... be warned... if you're going to be REALLY working out with these bands for an extended period, you'll probably wear them out in a few months.  At first you'll notice little white areas where the rubber has begun to fail.  Once a hole develops, use care, because it doesn't take long from that point for the band to be in a position to snap during exercise.  I didn't heed my own better sense of judgement the first time I went through the program, and had a blue band snap on me mid rep.  This was my own fault as I KNEW I should have discontinued use.

The tent is brightly colored and has handles for the kids to hold onto as they are lifting and spinning it. There is a lot kids can do with this parachute: make wind and bounce balls on the top of it as they raise it up and down, make tents/forts, drag each other around on it, and lift it and run underneath, and the kids can come up with some more fun ideas to do with it. This is really something that works best with more kids, so there is a teamwork element to it by lifting it in a synchronized way. The parachute is lots of fun on rainy days and is small enough to where you can use it indoors.
9223	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased these fins four months ago and based my purchase on the reviews for this product.  I have used them with my float tube on five separate fishing trips.  My first trip they seemed to work fairly well, but on subsequent trips became increasingly disappointing.  The strap releases, which are typical cheap plastic clip types, began to release while in use.  The first time it happened I nearly lost the fin (they don't float of course) and I was fortunate enough to catch it before it sake to the bottom of the lake.  Last week (my fifth and last trip with these fins) They released five times because the rubber (flubber) straps kept come out of the plastic clips.  Being constantly concerned about whether or not you fins are going to come off is no fun. At the end of the day while I was return from the far side of the lake I felt a strap let go and rather they try to reattach it (again!) I limped to shore with one fin. As I pressed the releases on the remaining fin one of them broke.  These fins are poorly designed for float tube fishing.  The rubber stretches with use until they become useless and the plastic clip attachments are easy to clip on but are not strong enough to last beyond a few uses.  These may be adequate for scuba diving, but they DO NOT serve the float tube fisher.  If I could return them now I would.  Unfortunately the return period often doesn't provide for actual use of a product and customer dissatisfaction.  Don't waste your money or precious fishing time on this disappointing product.

The only downside to this package is the door anchor.  It doesn't seem to be very forgiving if there is a tiny gap in the door.  Other bands that I've used with a door anchor have a larger, harder foam piece about 1" square so that if there is a gap in the door, it won't easily slid through.

I've built it into the programs that I use with clients (particularly my "road warriors" who need a small profile exercise equipment set when travelling), You have to see the heavy duty guage of the metal clips and feel the stretch/resiliency of the tubes to appreciate just how good this set is.

We only traveled with three bike, but a fourth bike would have fit perfectly.  It took about 20 minutes to attach the mount and mount the bikes the first time, but I was able to do it all in five or ten minutes for the trip home.  I would recommend the tension bar adaptor for a women's bike.  Although we did not take my wife's bike on the trip, the tension bar will be necessary for our next trip when we take all four bikes. If there is a fault, I would say that the bracket(hook) that attaches the rack to the vehicle should have some kind of pad to prevent scratching the vehicle.  I don't know that it would have scratched the door, but I took a preventive measure by cutting pieces of cloth to place between the door and the brackets.  The cost of the rack and tension bar was far less than if I would have purchased it through the local bike shop.  I am very happy with my purchase.
9799	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I've never been a big fan of toy guns but my teenage sons are big fans of The Walking Dead. My thirteen year old wanted to dress as Daryl and go trick or treating. His friends weren't going this year and he was too embarrassed to ask one of them, but he didn't want to go out alone, so his sixteen year old brother said he would go and dress up as Rick. I was so touched by this display of brotherly love I just had to buy them all the violent accessories they needed. I'm not toy gun expert but it is decent quality and served the purpose and it was  a lot cheaper than at the costume stores.

616	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so I could compare the quality. The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I've been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven't as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I'll replace them with Black Mountain products again.
Also, chasing the disc while it's flying towards you provides good exercise.

I chose this Schwinn 12-function computer over the Cateye Velo 5-function computer [the only other option at the military store] mostly because of the display size...the Schwinn's is larger, and much more readable for most functions.  I use reading glasses, and was concerned about being able to read the small Cateye display.  As it turns out, it's difficult to interpret the "Speed Tendency" function while cycling [it uses a small bicycle in the top left corner of the display...its tiny wheels turn "forward" to show accelerations, and "backward" to show deceleration].  All other info is easy to read & interpret.

I pumped it up with a Shrader bike pump, so there was no need to purchase an additional pump.  I've only had it a few days, but so far no deflation whatsoever.  Several people at work told me they're now thinking about getting one.  And I just bought another one for my husband.  I am 5'5" and bought the 65CM size.

8300	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Heavy duty bike rack.  The U bolts are very short.  If you don't tighten them at exactly the same rate and keep them even, you might pop off a nut trying to tighten one side with shorter threads, and screw up the threads on the shorter side.  I had to have Swagman send me another U bolt because of this.  I've only tried the rack for a short distance.  I'm anxious to try it for long-haul trip.  I use it behind an older Honda CRV that has the spare tire mounted to the back door.  The rack just barely clears the tire.  I like the design that keeps the bikes fairly flat.
Heats things fast and the wind shields stay put once you insert them into the slots.

Unfortunately on this one the latch that holds the head unit to the handlebar mount is very weak and the unit will come off all too easily.  Sometimes it works loose while riding.

I was not able to fill with air initially because I discovered during the manufacture they failed to remove the bottom of the air inlet so it was sealed off.  A simple matter to use a screw driver to open it up but a quality issue none-the-less.  I hold back 1 star for that.

4. The wheel spoke magnet has four little plastic 'tangs' that hold the magent into that mount. The problem is the tangs can actually make contact with the sensor. I was hearing a faint 'clicking' noise and discovered it was one of the tangs cutting a nice groove into the sensor. Fortunately, I was able to move the magnet away from the sensor and it still works, but who knows for how long?
1045	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I took these to Physical Therapy today, and my therapist was impressed with the quality and durability of them.

They are well made and seem to be holding up quite well.  I like how the bands attach to the handles and/or ankle strap.  There are so many different types of exercises that you are able to do.  I did enjoy that it came with a range of different strength resistance bands but I would enjoy if more were included in the set as it would be nice to have more resistance for some exercises.  It would also be nice to have more than one ankle strap/cuff.  The bag included is a very nice thing to have to keep everything together and clean when not in use.  The product arrived on time and in good condition.  The company does a good job of presenting itself based on the quality of the product as I was unsure at first thought of purchase because I had not heard of the company previously.  I guess it may have been the logo that gave me an initial impression that it could be an inferior product but I was incorrect.  The company did a great job and I am excited to try another one of their products!  I will have to wait before I give everything the long term thumbs up but initial reviews are all headed in the right direction.

 All in all, you can't beat the strength of the screw holding your piece together by itself, or as an internal clamp with gluing.

7738	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I saw this item suggested in a review for an epoxy paint kit, suggesting its purchase. I've never worn a respirator for a home project before, but this paint - and the fact that it was being done inside a shower enclosure - encouraged me to save my brain cells with a mask. It is AMAZING. I put it on before I opened the two cans and mixed the activator into the paint. I kept waiting to smell something. I worked with the paint for a half hour and was still convinced that the paint smell was probably over-rated. Then I left the bathroom, went into another part of the house, and took off the respirator. OMG! The residual fumes in another room, separated by two closed doors and lots of open windows, was really potent. I am so impressed that this respirator completely eliminated the smell!

1212	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have always been wary of resistance bands because I've heard so many horror stories of bands being made poorly and people getting hurt badly when they break. However, after reading the great reviews on these, I decided to try them out. By the end of my first workout I was no longer afraid. It is quite obvious how well they are made. Others that I've used can't even compare. The door anchor and ability to attach more than one band to a single, sturdy handle only adds to their awesomeness.

If I have any complaint its that the seat height adjustment is a bit lame. Its no more than a thread rod that tightens against the seat post. My son is tall and heavy (at 3 most people think hes 5) and the post tends to wiggle its way down and need to be raised every few days. Not a big deal, and a functional solution for infinite adjustability, but mildly annoying.

4351	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother's house.  It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical.  There is very little resistance.  It is squeeky.  The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical.  It take sup a lot of space.  I found no value to it since it didn't get my heart rate up, it wasn't working any muscles, and it didn't provide a core work out.  Not sure what the purpose would be.  I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot.  So, I don't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.

I bought a 24 piece button battery kit for $5. It has six different size batteries in the package. There are 4 of the LR 43 batteries. And a lot of common batteries for watches and other stuff. Also the least functions for me the better. I just wanted a simple one. So with only two buttons and 12 functions I thought I would try it. For $10 this is a very good deal. It seems very well made and solid. It locks onto the holder very tightly and feel secure. Before I installed this I sat down and read the instructions twice and set it Up before I installed it on the bike. Just take your time and look it over very closely all the parts. The arrow on the sensor is obviously where the magnet should pass by. The battery cover is very well made and solid. It has a "O" ring to waterproof it from the rain. The instructions do not list all the tire sizes. With the calculations mine came out to be 2055 for a tire size of 26/1.95 hope this helps.

2945	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works great on a 1994 Volvo 850 Wagon. It attaches tightly to the rear hatch. My only concern was that the hatch hinges, which are a bit rusty, wouldn't hold and the whole thing, 4 bikes, carrier and rear hatch, would drop onto the freeway. Lucky for all those drivers behind us during 6 hours of driving, no such thing happened.
The blade could have been a little sharper right out of the box, but I don't mind putting my own edge on a new knife. It was still quite sharp, but it could have been a little sharper. Overall, I'd say this is a knife I'll have for a VERY long time.
Pocket hole jigs are a great way to build cabinetry, and the Kreg  jigs make all the difficult bits- like aligning the parts for assembly- trivially easy.

All those problems made me finally break down and say I'm going a new route.  I'm so pleased with the 97044s.  They look sleak, they feel sturdy and they fold up to a compact size.  They fit comfortable and tight.  The amplification of my hearing ability is awesome!  A real upper hand when hunting.  Battery life seems to be decent too.  I will agree with the review that said battery placement and changing is difficult and could have been better designed, but I've got it down now, so no more problems there.
As I looked at the Bodylastics I could see it would be hard to know if and when the band was wearing near the handle, one of the first places a band will give. That could cause problems down the road.

8159	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I don't do many reviews, but I purchased this compass and after actually using it in the field have a couple comments on it.  I brought this compass on a rigorous 2 day land navigation course.  Like many others have stated, the compass housing shifts around, maybe by 1 or 2mm.  This can cause an error of a degree or so in your readings.  While obnoxious, the margin of error is very slim and in my experience was not the cause of any real life navigation mistakes.  If you always "set" it to the same side, your offset will be consistent and should not interfere with your measurements.

This inflatable mattress survived a night on a very rocky surface (my tent floor, OTOH, was punctured in a couple of places - FWIW I am probably 180 lbs and I was by myself). It was certainly comfortable, though the end "pillow" was best with an actual pillow on top of it (at least for me). This was perfect size for my Coleman Pop-Up tent (where headroom is at an absolute premium, it is important that your air mattress is thin). It folds into a smaller space than a typical air bed, so it's more portable.
I looked at many, many options - from the high end ultra lightweight backpacking mats to full blown air mattresses. Sadly, I'm on a strict budget and as cool as the high tech mats are, I couldn't justify spending the money. The air mattresses were all too big for my ULW backpacking tent. So what's a girl to do?!

155	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my girlfriend because she wanted to do resistance training but was bot comfortable with weights. So far she loves it.

They have been used for over a month now and so far they show no signs of damage and stretch quite far.
8232	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For serious orienteering. You could do with just a baseplate but the lid with the mirror makes for more precise bearings and mirror can be used as a signaling mirror. The lid also protects the compass.

Just before the last time I visited home, she'd fallen out of bed.  She had a back surgery coming up quickly and the last thing I wanted was her falling out of bed directly onto the floor after surgery or falling out of the bed and breaking a hip.  The length of the mat is long enough to extend the full length of a body and it is just wide enough to fully cushion a person if they fall out of bed.  The mat easily folds up and can slide under her bed for storage.  And it can also be used for exercises too.  Mom had mentioned that she had a yoga type mat that she could put beside the bed, but those aren't thick enough to properly cushion a fall.

Through use it's starting to soften up and she's been using it a couple months. It's not super super soft but it's not as hard as before.

7401	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Favorite thing Santa brought. Doesn't look like all the other razors at school and the metal brake is nice.
2793	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use it to carry stuff from my bigger raft. It can hold one skinny adult on it good. My friend weights about 200 lb and it did hold him fine. But when he got of the raft he fell into the water. I tow it from my bigger raft which can fit 5 people. on this small raft I put beers, air pump, and other stuff I might need. Excellent, easy to patch. I did not use the patch that came with it when it had a hole. I used a better one with cement boat repair. Nothing can beat its price. very very happy.

Convenient to take with you anywhere!  This brand contains NO High Fructose Corn Syrup so it's healthier. Great deal! $19.95 ordered on 8/3/2011.
We had very fast delivery and the price was better that buying pedestals, swivels,and then the seats. Seats of equal quality to the deck chairs were very hard to find and very expensive.

I purchased this one for a backup because I know nothings lasts forever. When this one did not hold air overnight with no weight on it, I filled out the Amazon thing to return an item. The seller contacted me asked me what was wrong with the product and sent out a new one

The pads have straps that can be tighten to fit her knees. However, I found them bulky on her and thought they could limit her moves (actually, I  suspected that when buying them, based on the picture of the boy posted on the product page).

3080	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	High quality. Somewhat heavy for backpacking but other than that a superior product.
2742	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	A great price for a simple little 2-person dingy.  It easily held me (175 lbs and another child up to 60 pounds).  Rated for 210 pounds according to the hull.  There are two separate inflation chambers, the floor and sides.  Two oar locks that are well built and solidly attached.  Durability - we had a group of 7-11 year olds beat up on this craft over a 3-day weekend at the beach and not a single snafu.  Be aware that maneuvering the craft is not easy, as there is no fixed rudder to counteract the oars.  So kids tend to spin in place unless their oaring action is perfectly synced left and right.  For the price it includes two oars that break down into 3 pieces for storage, as well as a small two-way hand pump.  IMO the pump's output was fairly worthless with a raft of this size though perhaps appreciated by those with small lungs, we were fortunate to have a battery operated pump on hand, and otherwise used our lungs.
4564	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	classic coleman, doesn't have the ignitier built in though.

1154	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Plenty of different band widths, and since you can combine multiple bands on handles, you have a large variety of resistances.
PROS:
My children, 5 and 7, have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.


January 2013: My son is 5 and we are still using these. They must be comfortable because he doesn't complain about them at all. As a random bonus, we have been using the elbow pads as knee pads for my 2 year old daughter. This was my husband's genius idea and it works great! Now we have knee pads for both kids :)
2739	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Awesome. My 6 year old son lived in this raft for 8 days at the lake, last summer. We tied it to the dock, but he rowed around easily, had no problems with it deflating. We could get in it with him (my husband or myself, one at a time). We left it in the lake overnight, every night, it held up well even with thunderstorms. We got it out this summer and it is still in great condition.

To me, these are the last line of defense to keep irresponsible hands from doing something stupid. I am a strong proponent of using a durable locking cabinet or safe.
I bought this to use as an adjustable training weight in my backpack and it works great for this.
7850	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Got these for my husband as he was looking to get a new ear protection for the range... had lots of good and bad reviews but like most things its best to test it yourself.
If you're looking for a good utility "buck knife" you might as well get something like this.  The flipping action and one-finger lock disengage means you can easily use it one handed and it seems rugged enough for everyday use in the tool belt.  No more dropping what you're doing so you can pry the blade out or safely close it, just a little wrist and thumb action will do it.

8306	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love the bike rack.  We went over 600 miles one way through NY City and was no problem for the bike rack.  Never had one problem the whole trip.  After loading and unloading a few times you start to get the hnag of it.  Only thing is, if you have a bike with an oversized frame, mountain bike, kids bikes, you will have to go puchase an add on bar for each bike.  They attach from handle bar to under seat and then you raise the seat as high as it can go.  Once these add on bars were purchased it was a cinch.  But we were dead in the water, until we purchased those.  The cradles only fit the regular size tubing or slightly larger of bike frame.  Loved it though.  Thanks Swagman

Earlier reviewers mentioned loose packaging.  I got this trike undamaged and well packed, so Radio Flyer appears to have listened.  It doesn't look like a contemporary kid's toy.  It looks like something I might have ridden as a small child many years ago.  Maybe it is sneaky of me, but I found it convenient that the place they print "Made In China" is on the annoying safety decal where they say you have to wear a helmet and various other things I didn't bother to read.  The decal is top center on the main tube.  It peels off reasonably easily without damaging the paint, and a little odorless mineral spirits (paint thinner, charcoal lighter) takes off the residual glue.

2.  Luminous attributes - The Suunto luminous dial glows for 20 minutes or so after just a 10 seconds of exposure to my Princeton Tec Remix headlamp on the lowest setting.  I can still easily read the numbers on the dial for about 10 minutes or so.  The needle and north indicators luminous points are very easy to align, and hold a useable glow for about 30 minutes.  The "dots" on the cover at the top and bottom at the aiming Vs are actually rods about 3/8" long of solid luminous material.  This is nice because when you have the compass cover in position to use the mirror to take a bearing, the rods still  absorb light from the top and glow nicely.
5955	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very low impact on joints.  I jog in place on it and bounce as well.  It helps with balance by causing the brain to constantly adjust in keeping balance.

I wouldn't compare this with a good Nikon or Leupold scope, but then again this scope is for an AK, and you wouldn't use a Nikon or a Leupold for a gun like that. 250 rounds throught rifle after mounting the scope, and no problems with zero at all. Easy to adjust, and it has "resetable" zero (if you want to fiddle with tiny scews, and washers).

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it has the biggest numeral display for speed of any of the cheap speedometers. But that aside, save your money and invest in a slightly more expensive, better speedometer like Cateye or Sigma that are carried by an LBS, big-box sports store (like Dicks), or online.

1453	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	A year and a half after purchasing this knife I couldn't be more pleased. The knife has a very nice wood handle.  Specifically, it is a dark brown, rosewood handle with a gloss finish. The sturdy blade came razor sharp and has maintained a great edge. This full tang knife is complimented by a great sheath that is of a quality deserving of the knife. I have purchased two of these knives, one of which I gave as a gift. My sheath came a very dark, oil finished brown. The one I purchased as a gift was much lighter in color, which I would describe as a medium brown. Both looked great, but note there was quite a color variance.  What impressed me most about this knife is the quality wood used on the handle and the thick, sturdy spine of the blade. This knife is built to last. I own several American made fixed blade knives and consider this one of the best overall in appearance and quality at this price point.

You really can't go wrong with this multi-tool. Sure it's a bit heavy, but that's the trade off to pay if you want to have a real multi-tool. If you want something lighter I would personally suggest looking into Suisse Army Knives instead. The great thing about a multi-tool is that you have a good set of pliers (needle-nose and regular) in your pocket.

That day finally arrived two years later after moving to a new home!  This grill was meant for the open flame of a gas range.  Keeping in mind the mess/damage created when cooking with the grill or oversize pots on the electric stove, I purchased a Kenmore Elite Duel Fuel range that has a really nice recessed range top that helps keep your hot cookware away from the finish.

3854	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I gave this as a present to my son and he loves it.  The darts are cheaply made (as can be expected coming with a set). The top of one of the darts came off within a few hours of him playing.  He plans on buying nice darts anyway.
With this set, I can use the door kit and get in a decent work out while keeping an eye on my kids and even talking to them.  If something happens and I need to intervene, I can literally just let go of the handles and run to wherever I need to be to fulfill my parental duties.  If that means taking one of the kids to the potty, I don't have to worry about the other throwing a dumbell at one of the dogs while I'm in the bathroom.  These bands will just hang out for me.

5418	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The last time I bought swimming goggles was probably 1992, so I was a bit leery of these goggles at their relatively low price point. They fit great, and they don't leak much at all. I exert myself pretty hard when I swim (i.e., I am out of shape), and they don't seem to fog up very badly. Every now and then I need to de-fog them, but mostly they're great. They stay in place, they don't leak, and they're adjustable. I particularly like that adjusting them is not particularly easy to do -- yes, I like that it's hard to adjust the length, because that makes the length very stable and secure. They're good goggles, particularly if it's been 20+ years since you've bought goggles.
This tool includes a pouch with a belt clip. For me, the clip is very convenient because I can put it on or take it off without undoing my belt. The clip itself is made in a way that it won't come off easily when you move around. The tool fits tight into the pouch.
2527	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This tool is though compact has been proven very useful over the years.  I received this as a gift from my grandmother many years ago, quality product that has stood up the test of time in my book.

The 3M Primer 94 worked wonders on the EPDM. The 3M VHB extreme mounting tape I bought stuck instantly and permanently away once I rubbed the primer onto the seal and let it dry. I treated my wife's car bumper bottom with it as well and then stuck on the garage door seal and made a very nice looking lip for her front bumper. It's been on there a few weeks with no sign of it coming off or getting loose.

This Suunto is just that compass.  It is well made and has many features for the price.

The pros: slim design, individual volume knobs for each side.  Negatives- they are always turning themselves on.  I have to replace the batteries almost every trip to the range if you forget to double check they are off when you last put them away.  Trying to pry off the ear pieces to get to the batteries means your screwdriver will slip and cut open the vinyl covers.

The blade has a serrated edge for cutting through hard material very easily.  The Shark Tooth Tip adds to its potential use for defense, as well as for its ability to cut anything with ease.  This looks like a double edged knife, but it is not - only the tip is.  The knife is razor sharp and resists corrosion.  The matte finish is useful to eliminate glare or for avoiding bringing attention to its user, if unsheathed.  The handle is durable, textured and feels comfortable in my hand.

My son really wanted it but he needed 3,000 points at the arcade and wouldn't give it to him for the 400 points he had.  It's not worth the 20 dollars. It's also not full it's more on the flat side.

They're just getting busted but I'd recommend these ones for sure.
4249	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My wife made fun of me when I bought this and added to my keychain but she quickly admitted that it's proven useful already on several occasions.  Most often it's great for opening the impossible to open plastic clamshell packaging that almost everything is packed in nowadays.  It's also opened the fancy beverages that come in old fashioned glass bottles without screw tops.  Removing tags.  Opening mail without having an envelope that looks like it's been mauled.  Filling out the order menu at Din Tai Fung when they don't leave a pen, signing a bill when they don't leave enough pens for the table...  Best of all it's small and I don't feel like it's made the keychain more unwieldy.

My only complaint about this mat is that it's a few ounces heavier than my old inflatable trail & stream ground pad. BUT, and this is a big but, my Intex mat is a hundred times more comfortable, so I'm more than willing to carry the extra weight in my pack.

I kept patching my old one with clear duct tape until it finally became too scruffy to use anymore.
6702	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent value.  The knife's design was put through grueling test to meet NSW requirements, from submersion tests for rust to strength tests, etc, and will accept tons of abuse while keeping a good edge.

8848	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It's not really to difficult to review an item like this resistance band. Basically what needs to be said is that it does what it advertises. It offers very heavy resistance. Its a strong band, with good hands, and good length. The only negative is that when you recieve it, once it comes out of the box it is covered in this strange white powder. I presume that it is meant to keep the rubber from sticking to itself however it rubs off on your clothes and is a bit of a pain to get off, as it comes off slowly over 3 to 5 uses, meaning multiple laundry trips for no other purpose. Regardless, its a good band that offers a good amount of resistance for a good price.

7623	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great water bottle - especially for use at home. I find it's pretty slick and slippery, so you have to pay a bit of attention when you're using it. But, I was just looking for a water bottle for my home office and home gym, and it works great for those uses. I bought this and another Sigg bottle for home use, and haven't been disappointed. But, again, gotta pay attention when using, as they're pretty slick, esp when wet.
I still keep the grill on top of the stove, and I use it daily to toast bagels lightly spritzed with olive oil.  Both sides of the grill are seasoned and neither seem to be affected by direct exposure to the flames.
I've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now, but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle, which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of, but that would definitely have shattered by now. The little dents don't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine. I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse, and this has never once leaked on me. It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too.

6525	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is the easiest disc to throw and it goes super far and I love it.  Further, I use it for playing with my Golden Retriever.  First it goes super far and when it runs out of steam it floats gently to the ground and my dog can easily grab it in flight.  While it's not designed for dogs it's made of  a material that's easy for them to catch.  If your dog is a super chewer this probably isn't the one for you; my guy does chew stuff up but only if I leave it with him.  He retrieves it and brings it back and gives it to me and we love using it.  I especially love how he flips it over his head so it's both in his mouth and around his head as he runs back with it!
The raft comes with a short length nylon cord, which is practically useless as a tether line.  Most will probably want to upgrade this.  Unless you just want to drift or splash around, you will need some oars.  I bought a set of&nbsp;, which are well made, and not that expensive, if you can get them on sale.  The Explorer 100 has a nice set of plastic oarlocks, which are designed to work nicely with the Intex oars.

You have a little fuzz around the edges about 7x-9x. Again not a big deal. I wanted a budget scope so its cool. Im gonna hunt with it this season and I may step up to a Nikon. Honestly its impossible to get a great scope under $200. You have too many tradeoffs in quality below that price point. If you have a cheaper rifle or are under budget constraints this scope is hard to beat for the money. You will like it. I have no reservations that this scope will help put meat in the freezer.  Update 6/22/13.. I finally got the crosshairs plumb and level. I fought it with a plumb bob for a while but I got it. I am satisfied. I think it was more scope mounts than scope. It was a pain in the butt to get right! Im going to order one for my Marlin 1894 .44 mag for deer season in Indiana.

1235	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	its a cute little knife. but it is even smaller than it seems like in the photo. I wanted a super small karambit similar to some of the hidden karambits used traditionally. While the blade is just where I want it to be the handle is so small that it makes the whole affair a joke. There is no way to get a four finger grip on this thing, and I have small girly hands. Also the ring is so small as to make it not possible to get the ring over anything but the first two phalanx of the finger. It makes for a cute little utility knife only. Something cool for a small person learning about knives would be an ok use for it.
1394	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I remember playing with the giant parachute in gym class and thought the kids at my daughter's bday party would have fun with it.

2315	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Smooth opening but sometimes the tools stick to the knife and scissors.  I'm going to try adding some oil but I'm hoping it is just due to the fact that it needs worn in.  I was cautious of the sheath at first since it just slides over the belt but it stays on very well and actually requires a decent amount of effort when taking the holster off at night.  It has proven to be a trusty and reliable tool so far.
6040	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Sensor does not work. Period. I have installed at least 6 other bike computers. All worked after adjustment;
I couldn't see anything, everything was blurry. It really was a life saver,when we  were in the balcony,using these made us see the show. For what I paid, they  seem like so much more. I really got more for my money on these. I'm leaving this one in my car, for sight seeing
Despite my boys being drastically different sizes, the pads stay on and don't seem to impede their movements (they say).  It looks a little funny to see my 4 y.o. outfitted like a goalie in ice hockey with his knees almost touching, but he doesn't seem to notice.
I haven't frequently used 1:50k maps since my military days, but even though I received the wrong model of the MC-2G with 1:25k and 1:50k Romer scales, I'm well-versed in land nav/using a map and compass, including MGRS, so the metric version is just fine and in no way impacts the overall functionality of the compass when using a 7.5 topo. Having the 1:25k and 1:50 Romers referenced vs. not having 1:24k Romer referenced on this particular model is not a huge issue and definitely not as important as knowing how to properly use a compass and map together. And since this metric version does have an inch ruler broken down into 1/20ths (nice feature) along the right side of the compass, you can still deal quite easily with a 7.5 minute topos based on 1-inch = 2,000 feet, which is the scale of a 1:24k/7.5 minute Topo map.
8898	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've worked out at home for years, but only recently have I begun incorporating exercise bands into my strength training.  I've had a few flat-type bands that have wound up getting worn and snapped over time, so I wanted to invest in a higher-quality band.  Happily, this SPRI tubing perfectly fit the bill WITHOUT breaking the band!  This is a very sturdy, very versatile little piece of exercise equipment.  You can use it to replace weights in your usual workouts, which allows you to work your muscles in some new and unique ways (refer to the included exercise chart for ideas).  When at home, you can actually use the tubing WITH your weights to add greater resistance throughout the entire muscle movement, OR you can pack your tubing with you when traveling--so light and convenient!  Finally, the included door attachment is easy to use and allows you to perform an even greater variety of exercises.  I wasn't sure which strength tubing to purchase, but I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser, and the medium (red) is perfect for me, as it is easy to adjust for either more or less resistance when needed.  Highly recommended!
The blades and body are stainless steel and came straight out of the box with a nice edge.  The color of the handle is subtle and bone colored with nice tone on the side with the Case insignia.  The other side is less colorful but still nice to look at.  Overall I think this will be my new daily carrier and I am VERY happy with the quality and the price.  It is the perfect size for carrying around in your pocket for opening packages and envelopes and when you just need a blade.  I like this knife better than the other "small" knives like the mini stockman and the peanut because the main blade is wider and more heavy duty.  This is a great addition to any knife collection for guys who just love knives.

9056	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am short & worse yet, I have short legs. Most shorts are just too long & wind up making me look fat and squatty. these are short, so if you have  really big legs, don't get them. but if you have average or slim legs, these are ideal!  Comfy, pull on quickly, launder well. They are so inexpensive you can do your outside work and not worry about ruining them. they are made, I believe, for younger women, but I'm over 50 and I think I look nice in them. (I don't have a lot of flab or cellulite).  Good for canoeing, lawn care, hiking, bike-riding, walking or just about anything in the summer . It's HOT down here, and the very light material allows you to do work without the shorts giving off extra heat (like blue jean or thicker shorts)

8493	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ordered this scope for my Optima 209 .50 cal inline muzzle-loader, and was quick to site in and very accurate. I was able to get 1" grouping at 100 yards. Scope is also very clear. I stayed at the range until dark, and even with very little light I was able to see the target clearly. I just ordered another one to replace the one on my .22. Can't beat the quality and price.
4. Great for the money and beginner (even with a new door anchor)
Thin rod to thick rod adapter (required for the .22) you could possibly use the thick rods to clean a 22 but it would bump against the edges of the barrel for sure. Adapter is aluminum so not incredibly tough.
6041	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased one a couple of years ago the the wires got tangled a coupld of months back. The wire broke and there is no way to fix it. I bought these that are identical to the old one because I like the scan feature, the large numbers in the panel and the small size. It works well. If I can say something back is that the mounting only allows a handle bar position and it does not sit very tight on the base. My handle bar is not very large and even being small it takes space there. I also have my headlights in there and of course those have to be a the front. Sometimes, it will stop measuring if you touch it forward. It will not come off since there is a plastic stopper at the end but it will move out of the sensors and stop reading your ride. It has happened with me several times
1003	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this band set just over 2 years ago and I guess I've been too busy using them to write a proper review.  I take these bands with me literally everywhere.  They live in my bag and when I get bored or need a quick stress reliever, I pop them out and enjoy a little workout.  The build quality on these bands is really top notch.  The rubber has not weathered at all in the two years I have owned them and I cannot see any cracking of any kind.  The handles have good foam padding that shows little to no signs of wear from daily use.

2703	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	This boat was fun but the 2-person label is very misleading.  This is two person if it's one lighter adult and a child, two children, or 2 adults weighing in at 105 lbs each.  It only holds 210 lbs and they mean that.  More than that and it starts to fold in on itself.  Because of that, we didn't get to use it as we had hoped.

880	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Let's just say there is a good reason why ( as of the date I am writing this ) there are about 2500 reviews with an average 4-5 star rating.

Some people say that regular gas, especially with ethanol in it (which is associated with water in the gas), makes gasoline not as dependable a fuel source. It could foul your stove, they say. However, we treat all our gasoline with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sea-Foam-SF-16-Motor-Treatment-16-oz/dp/B0002JN2EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sea Foam SF-16 Motor Treatment - 16 oz.</a>, which was recommended to me by a highly experienced small engine mechanic. Using it in my gasoline has gotten rid of the "old gas" and hard-start problems I used to have with our various infernal combustion engines, from weed-wackers to chainsaws, to ride'em lawnmower, compact backhoe, and our vehicles.
8937	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are super comfortable. I think because I am no longer a junior, I've had to go up a size and order the large for more comfort. I have a few pairs in medium and they fit but I wanted something looser for night time wear so I bought the large. The color is right and the length is perfect for me - about knee length and I'm 5'2". I do roll the waist band twice - I just always have with this brand of shorts and they hit around mid-thigh. Loose, light weight, and comfortable for lounging and if I need to run to the store.
4891	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Really nice mat especially for the price. My girls immediately were doing flips and having fun!! Thick mat, heavy cover should hold up to the flips and flops of my girls without any issues. Would definitely recommend.
2310	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Confession time:  whenever a new multi-tool hits the market an irresistible compulsion forces me to get it.  Of all the ones out there, this is hands-down the best, in my opinion.  It contains components for every situation, from a woodsaw to a set of screwdrivers to powerful gear-driven pliers to scissors that really work, as well as the requisite saw, files, etc.  In addition to aforementioned gears which generate force to  make the tool work like a pocket monkey wrench all components "double-lock" with a sheet metal foldover that works in addition to the standard locking system) to insure the saw, knife or file don't close over your fingers.  I also admit I take a power plier whenever I'm out (survivalist Rule # 7: "The farther you are from (home)base, the larger and stronger the tool you may need - JUST IN CASE").  Since by definition crises are unexpected, (otherwise you'd pack a machete, a filled tool box, etc) I carry one on drives both long and short).  Unless you've visited a flawless psychic recently who's warned you of disaster, you're better off just automatically carrying your tool kit in your pocket or on your belt. Having worked as a New York State clinical inspector for years, I appreciated knowing I had at least one piece of quality equipment I knew I could count on, no matter what the emergency. These days I've seen citizens from all walks of life wearing heavy duty multi-tools, from Leatherman to SOG to SPYDERCO.  In this era of women's equality, especially in nontraditional jobs, I've seen several ladies wearing one on their belts too.  The safety of locking components, coupled with the significant torque generated by the gear-driven plier system, makes this the one tool you should take automatically along with your keys when you leave the house.  (If I go to a dressier affair I can still carry the diminutive but strong Crossgrip without drawing strange looks.)

9101	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	As described.  It was a reasonable price, maybe a dollar or two cheaper then in stores.  I haven't used it yet in the cold but it is what you would expect and would be a nice seat to take both hunting and for bleacher games!

Better to be safe than sorry.
The SPRI bands are dependable and last a long time. While you do have to buy a separate band for different resistances and the handles do not come off as in some of the popular brands, you can trust SPRI and get a great workout with them. They're also priced right.
As for durability. This mat reminds me of the high school gym mats they used to stack in storage until we did sit ups for physical fitness testing, not to be confused with the wrestling mats the had the distinct rubbery bounce. I expect overtime that the edges or corners may crack just from age, moisture, and temperature change. Those are the edges where it's folded over and the seams run across. As for the seams themselves, its a nice double stitch all the way around and adequate single stitching to reinforce the fold. I can do jumping jacks on it, it distributes weight nicely. It also seems like it has some breathability because it doesn't disperse  the trapped air when you put weight on one end. Unless my dog has a go at it or I personally stab it with a fork it was designed to take the abuse that it's supposed to. (My dog has torn up 4 leather couches already hence that example. lol)

So the call arrived. I practiced for a while to get the hang of it. I stepped out on my deck and saw a several gray squirrels working the forest floor. I gave one short set of chatters. All of the squirrels immediately took to the trees. My first thought was I scared them away but pretty soon I saw them peeking around the tree trunks at me. They'd stayed hidden and worked their way towards me to check me out. They also were very curious and did not bolt from me when I moved.

2946	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We have tried several bike racks over the years with limited success.  A hitch mounted one and another that attached over the rear spare tire on a SUV.  Both of these racks were made by "Bell" and were junk.  This 4 bike "Allen" rack is sturdy and well built.  It sets up quickly and I like the two extra side-straps instead of 4 mounts (two top and two bottom) that most trunk mount racks have.  On the down side, its hard to get 4 bikes onto the rack but we have had success with 3 adult sized bicycles.  Maybe with a mix of adult and kids bikes would fit four.  We have used the rack for the past 3 weeks everyday after work.  In fact it has not come off the car nor have the bikes except when we are riding them.  The rack stays in place with bumps on the road and taking corners and turns.  Nice piece of mind when you are hauling costly bicycles.  The rubber saddles strap the bikes securely and don't scratch the bike frames.  We are very happy with this quality bicycle rack.

5053	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I gotta say that I felt like I was rolling the dice on this, because I was not sure if it would be firm enough.  It is soft, but also firm, but not as firm as the commercial type blue mats used for things like gymnastics.  Really that is OK though since for a exercise and stretching mat it does not need to be that firm, and this mat is a good balance.  I think the quality is OK and there was only the faintest of odor up close which is not a minus, just an observation.  The size is also good, I doubt many people would need something bigger.
8869	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great band, just like the one I use at the gym. I didn't realize I could have gotten this a little cheaper at the store. I had been looking for them and didn't see one until after I had purchased online. Saw them at TJMAXX for about $7.
I've had this knife for almost 2 years now and I still like it.  I use it frequently (primarily for cutting open boxes from Amazon... *cough*) and can't get enough of the wrist action on it.  It's so nice to be able to open and close it without having to pry the blade out 2-handed style like other utility knives.  Can't say I can really comment on the whole "knife fighting" aspect other reviewers mention (don't do much knife fighting myself... you know... busy busy...) but as a simple utility knife, it's hard to beat.  Still sharp, too.

It took me a little while to set it up on a Saturday afternoon but the kids were thrilled Monday morning when I took them out to see it. My students are all obsessed with soccer lately and this was a welcome and very popular addition to our PE repertoire. They all line up and take turns kicking the balls into the net. They are figuring out where to aim so that the ball comes right back to them. It has already become the number one activity during outside free time. The girls are loving it just as much as the boys so everyone is happy. Franklin Sports sometimes makes products of questionable quality but this soccer rebounder is top notch. It is well-made and very sturdy. I anticipate it lasting several years.

I've only used this about 10 times and I don't have an electric pump so I would definately recomend getting something like that. I underfill the mattress a pretty good amount because I tend to sleep on my side and it's way more comfortable that way. I'd recomend getting this especially if you see it on sale. I got mine for $8 but it is currently $20.95.
6146	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I had recently experienced my first ever camping trip in my 31 years of life. I must say it was a blast. While we were there we went with my in laws who had an established setup with a pop-up camper. They were using a Coleman propane two burner stove in which something clogged up the gas line and we had to resort to using the open fire pit as a stove. Not a good combination. I wanted a simple stove that would not require the extra weight or expense of having to either dispose of portable bottles or making sure large tank was filled prior to the trip. I researched many brands and types and this Coleman powerhouse dual fuel was the one for me. You can cook evenly and the temperature is amazing. I will primarily use camp fuel but if in a pinch I can siphon some regular unleaded fuel from a vehicle and this too will keep my stove ready for the family to enjoy either hot food or in an emergency heat to boil water to be safely consumed.
7295	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Well, built scooter that my daughter loves.  This is a good scooter that I bought on sale for a good price.

Everything about the scooter feels well built and rugged enough to last. Would definitely buy again.

8170	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	WARNING!!! I ordered the MC-2 360/D/L/IN/NH compass, but received the MC-2 USGS compass.  When I looked at the packaging, it is evident that someone put a MC-2 360/D/L/IN/NH sticker on the outside of the plastic packaging, over the original Suunto UPC/description for the MC-2 USGS label.  (See photos below.)  The only real differences are the scales printing on the baseplate.  As I am in the US, I still like the USGS compass, but it is not exactly the compass I wanted.  I contacted Amazon, and they started a free return of the USGS compass.  On Amazon's advice, I ordered the MC-2 360/D/L/IN/NH again.  We'll see what I get this time.  The price dropped about $3, so that was good at least.

My suggestion is to have one of these, but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag.  If you have the energy to blow this, do so, if you can only blow the other one, even though it isn't as loud, it may still save your life.

All you have to do is use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the knobs on the valves.  Then unscrew the brass nut that secures it to the front of the stove.  Now back out the valve stem using the knob and remove the stem that has two O rings and the brass needle valve.  Take a clean paper towel and wipe the gunk or the valve lube off of the O rings thoroughly.  I blame the lube for the problem.  The rings were in good condition.  I then applied a tiny amount of silicone based plumber's grease, but you have to be sure you don't use one that is petroleum jelly or it can ruin the rubber.  I bought a tube for a few bucks on Amason.  Then I twisted some of the paper towel into a point and swabbed out the inside of the valve, but don't leave any paper in there or you are in trouble.  Don't use a Q tip either or the fuzz may come off in there.  Here is link for the silicone lube:

I was a bit intimidated by everything this watch can do, but thank heavens after my initial shock at how GOOD it looks, I got down to studying the manual -- and if you ever hope to get ANY practical use out of this device, you are going to HAVE to read it, maybe several times, in order to fully appreciate what it CAN do.  Is it absolutely perfect in every way?  Nope -- but can you find me a product that IS for the same amount of money that also looks this good?  Hardly.  The closest would probably be the Triple Sensor Casio Pathfinder -- which DOES come with one really nifty ability that Suunto has yet to incorporate into their wristop computers: solar power.  Casio watches are also much cheaper, but if you are going for good quality PLUS good looks, you will do no better than Suunto's Observer.  This watch is simply beautiful.

The folding feature is great, it's simple and hassle-free. Just click and fold! And it's not heavy or bulky. It fits right on the floor in the back seat of the car, or sometimes we carry it when we are in a store or building. It's never been a problem or hassle thus far.

2469	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	At first, I was disappointed in the apparent quality of this cooler. I had owned an earlier version which seemed more sturdily built. On the very first day, I accidentally dropped this cooler and the top would not "click" detent into position. I did not know it was a simple dislocation. I tried fiddling with the latch mechanism without removing the cover with no results. The cover would simply slide from side to side without locking in the center. I was tempted to return the unit when I realized I could disassemble the cooler top from the main body. When I disassembled the unit I could see that the latch assembly was dislocated from the track on the interior side. I positioned the latch so that it was centered on the track and reassembled the unit. It still didn't latch properly. Turns out I reassembled the top with the track on the wrong side. My bad! After I repositioned the top, the cooler works great! A bonus is that this cooler is a little larger in the interior than my previous unit.

Normal weights cause to much stress on our bodies and these give you a workout twice as fast, with less impact.  It has worked great for my family and would defintely order another set in the future!  Black Mountain sells some great stuff!6
417	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These resistance bands are perfect for anyone because they come with bands of all different "weights". Set up is easy and the bands are all very durable. One thing that would be nice is if the weight of each band was written somewhere on the band so you could easily pick it out without checking the instructions.

5807	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I like these, my son is almost 3, height 49 and he is a solid boy of 42 pounds, so the knee protectors are just a little bit big, but they still can be adjusted and he will grow in them, the elbows are right size, also adjustable and can be used for long term. If your kid is too small, use elbow protection for the knees, they also fit perfectly...quality is good (not professional perfection) and they do the work, my son has fallen several time and NO SCRATCHS. These ones happily match with my son's hat also. I recommend these pads, te price s great and it is what a parent would like to protect the kid.

The last time we used it got stuck in 2 trees. The first we climbed, the second I got a basketball stuck in when I tried to get this down. Luckily a man with a football helped me knock them both down.
So, I put it together.  Assembly was easy.  My eight year old and I slapped the thing together with a minimum amount of cussing.  He knows I don't like him cussing.

It is pretty sturdy with her riding it but did it begin to tip a little when she was on the grass. She now rides forward, backwards, turns it and handles it well at nearly 18 months.

I had to do the math on the wheel circumference since little 14" wheels aren't on the supplied chart (1117mm, if you're wondering).

The nylon sheath is very nice and has a plastic insert inside for the blade so that the blade won't cut the nylon sheath when inserting or removing.  The blade is made in Taiwan...

The only minor criticism I have is that some of the detailing was messy. Cinderella had lipstick that was smeared across half her face like a clown and also her sister Anastasia was cross eyed, but other than that, we love this set!
8106	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a fun toy. For children and adults. It actually does fly through the air in an elliptical path. Very well designed and very rugged. It slams into trees, the ground, and walls and it continues to work. I have destroyed every other boomerang I have ever owned, but this is survived so far. Great product.
They come with 1 set of grips that attach to each of the bands via a metal clasp. If there isn't a weight that you like in each of the bands, you can combine multiple bands and customize the weight yourself.

8872	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The Xertube purple (very heavy) resistance bands are perfect for their purpose. The purple band provides resistance equivalent to about 20 pounds. The great thing about this band and other bands in general is their versatility. They're very light so you can take them just about anywhere, which makes them perfect travelling companions. They're much more useful than weights (not to mention cheaper!). With the band, you can do regular curls just as you could with dumbbells, but the band helps you go beyond that! With the band, you can take part in many various exercises that involve the core that are impossible to do with dumbbells. I've always had a strong throwing arm, so it's something I take pride in. Resistance bands like this one help me work on all my "throwing" muscles at one time!
7287	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 4 year-old loves it!
4726	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my weekend escapes. It is great to have coffee just 16 minutes after waking up, or rather after getting out of your sack. Easy to assemble even in restive darkness, easy temp control, and packs away in a little footprint in my camp box. Still need to get some lighter pots and pans for this, but it handles my 12 cup percolator like a champ and does not complain about the 10 inch cast iron skillet I put on it. I feel it will be a great addition, not only for my weekend camping trips, but for my SHTF  kit.
Overall, the 150+ reviews should be enough evidence that this is a good piece of exercise equipment. I'm just contributing to it.
7867	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I am very much pleased with these muffs!  This year I had so much trouble hunting.  I shoot a 7 mag, thats a loud mother but I always want to be able to hear. In the past I have kept my muffs pulled up above my ear slightly.  Problem there is, it starts to hurt your ear, it bends the ear's natural fold to where I can only hear whats directly beside me and you run the risk of scaring game when repositioning them. My fiance has sat with me to be extra eyes and ears and she wore no muffs, luckily I never took a shot.
7712	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a superior mask in terms of fit and being able to get a proper seal around the face than the North brand I tried.

8517	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	There are better scopes out there for the money and I think the Tasco World Class series are one of Tasco's best if your going to go with Tasco.  What I disliked about this scope was it started getting noticeably dark around 10 power.  It never seemed clear either.  Also the eye piece focus adjustment was stupid to say the least. Seemed like I turned the adjustment ring around and around and never could decide which position had the best focus for my eyes. Then once you find the best focus you have to tighten up the lock ring to hold it there.  What a dumb idea!  The Nikon Prostaff series scopes which have a simular adjustment are easy to find the precise focus without the miserable locking nut.  Don't waste your time with this scope.  The crosshairs on this scope seemed larger than than they need to be.
3574	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Had the same one on a through hike from georgia to maine. I LOVE frisbees and nothing beats this one. Had to get new one because sisters dog chewed up my one that has lasted me through hell and back. THIS IS THE BEST FRISBEE ON THE MARKET. Just sayin.

3188	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Worked great overnight. Just a lil bit hard to inflate
A pool toy, mind you, not a boat.
Everything about it has to match MLB standards: fabric, stitching, texture, color, everything inside the leather. Then there's the weight, and so on.
I would definitely suggest having these around :)
To clarify, it does NOT come with any kind of an electric or battery powered inflator.  Just a small pump-action one.  That does the job but it's slow.  I am going to bring the compressor for my air mattress next time I bring this out.

Update 4-10-12: I was provoked to purchase, and add the Fox Sonik Blast to this test. Since there was no real need to compare it to all the whistles already tested, we tested it against the top 2 contenders - The Storm & the Fox 40 Classic. We tested using the exact same test. Here is the result: We both rated the Sonik Blast louder than the Fox 40 Classic. I perceived the Storm to be louder (easier to hear at that distance) than the Sonik Blast, while my son perceived the Sonik Blast to be louder. So, perhaps we could call it a tie, as far as which one was heard more easily under our test conditions. Although these two whistles may be about equal in loudness, they have very different tones. The Storm is a lower pitched tone while the Sonic Blast is a higher pitch, which made it more difficult for me to distinguish it from the nearby birds that were chirping. This is likely why the Storm sounded louder to me. Either way, based on this update, I would move the Fox 40 Classic into 3rd place.

6585	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very good knife. Especially for the price. I like my blades between 41/2 & 51/2 inches. Anything bigger and I find it to awkward to handle. Mine has the nylon/cordura sheath with the pouch. I keep a leatherman wave in the pouch. The two knives make a great team.
All in all I'm happy with it and would order it again!
6230	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	It is not possible to modulate the volume on this whistle. This whistle only has one volume, which is extremely loud. The whistle does not make noise when you blow softly or with medium pressure.

Maybe I am strange for my love of freeze dried sweets but I have to NOT order it often as I will eat 2-3 packs in once sitting.  The 3 flavors are distinct and not artificial to my palate.  I'm thrilled Amazon sells this so I can get my fix in every so often!

4932	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I find yoga mats to be terrible for doing abdominal exercises at home.  There's just not much support.  After doing some searching, I came across this awesome mat by Everlast at a very affordable price.  It is the perfect size, and since it is thicker, it offers a more cushioned support.  I am incredibly glad I purchased this!
The "Exercise & User Guide" that comes in the package explains how to use the band, and of course it includes the obligatory cautions, warnings and legal disclaimers ("Always use safety glasses..."). The step-by-step instructions feature small but useful black-and-white photos of each exercise. You can find many more exercises, including the lower-body ones that I was particularly interested in but that are not in the User Guide, on the Black Mountain Products website.
7870	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Update 1/8/13- Now having these for 2 1/2 years, I am downgrading this recommendation even more. It is incredibly frustrating that they cannot do the basics such as having some kind of indicator showing when the device is on or off.  Even without that, it should have a marking on the earphones indicating on/off.  Lazy design, lazy engineering, lazy thinking.  They really don't deserve your hard-earned money!

Then, sometimes you get that mattress with a leak so small you can't find it, but after a few hours on cold ground with 210 (or 320 if you're lucky and Mrs comes along) pounds forcing it out, you get a less than firm sleeping situation, and neither option seems very appealing at zero dark thirty in the cold.  This one is right there next to you, so you can adjust the bed any time.
9466	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I bought a couple of these, and wound up throwing both away.  The pads stuck ok to the bow, but not to the rest.

It is easy to install, accurate (within + or - 1 mph of all speed signs I have passed), and functional. I recommend spending some time learning how to scroll through the functions and reset them before riding. I assume this would have alleviated the reviews that people wrote about the interface not being intuitive; I think it fair to say that those individuals associate "new and unfamiliar" with "not intuitive," which is unfair to Schwinn.
9679	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	nice
9532	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The squirrels don't like it and it sounds like a child's toy.
1. The attaching mechanism on the mount is a flimsy, rubber strap with eyelets that hook around a nub. Other reviews have stated that bumps will cause it to pop off. While it hasn't happened to me (yet), it certainly seems plausible.
It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well, you can do long, straight throws with it.
I took it to the YMCA and shot with it for about an hour, that's about all someone my age could handle.  It keep true on my shot from deep, and was well on target for free throws even with some spin.  Bank shots worked, but the ball has a lot of bounce to it, so a few of them bounced out on layups at least until I got used to it (or maybe I was just tired and my shot not as strong).  I'm pretty sore today, but this will help me get in shape doing a little more exercise on the weekend.
6403	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is the only 'frisbee' I've ever been able to effectively throw. It is so easy and fun, and it doesn't hurt if you have a bad catch.

You do not need to slam or hit the bellows to cause the call to emit these sounds. The key to making the call work is knowledge of the squirrel, without it the call will not be of any help. With knowledge of your prey, this call will help you fill your game bag. All in all, a great sounding call which is well made, durable, and worth the price. I would suggest it to anyone.

I have decided to keep this compass as an example to my students as to why you should always check your compasses at a known azimuth station (check with your county surveyor to see if there are any azimuth stations in your area).

2656	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was MUCH too heavy for this raft and it held me.  I made it down a river, mostly dry, went over two waterfalls, got stuck in low water with lots of randomly shaped rocks scraping the bottom of the raft, and got hung up on those rocks several times, squishing the raft against the rocks, and it would seem to deflate a little because my weight squishing it was stretching the plastic out, but once I was back in deep water I would blow it up a little more and hop back in, and it would keep me floating for another 20 minutes until I crushed it against more rocks.  Considering my weight and how I had a backpack full of stuff in it with me and the oars survive being used to push against giant boulders as I went over a waterfall, I would say this was worth every cent.  If you're under 281, it will hold you just fine.  It smells HORRIBLE if you leave it in your car while driving to wherever you want to raft, if it's blown up, but after three days in the hot car it aired out.  It's also a good idea to blow it up a few days before  you need it and leave it full of air until it stretches out a little and seems more limp.  Then add a little more air and keep doing that every day until the day you use it.

I have since started using this on top of the grill grate of my Weber Kettle for grilling fish.  Since nothing else seemed to prevent fish from sticking, no matter how clean, hot, or how well oiled the grate.  I decided to try this on the grill since fish doesn't stick to it when I cook with it on top of the stove.  I grilled a whole salmon fillet(with skin) on it and scooped the whole thing off with my fish spatula with no sticking!

My only- ONLY complaint with these locks is that they stick out too far. I get that they are supposed to accommodate a wide range of makes/models/customizations of guns, but that nub you see sticking out in the pictures, is kind of long. It's a hassle to put/find a case for my handgun and even more of an issue for my shotgun. I had to settle for a scabbard carrying case for my shotgun which barely provides clearance. I'd say they are maybe...1 1/2" - 2" long? I can't think of any workaround (engineering wise) for the length. I'm sure if they made this shorter, more people would have issue with compatibility with their guns.

4649	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	No ability to adjust the flame. It either operates on full blast or its off.  Perfect, if you're looking for something to burn your morning eggs with. It also lacks an igniter, so you have to reach directly into the propane stream to light it. If the cover were 1/4" deeper a griddle could fit nicely inside it when closed up.

These work GREAT on the smooth surfaces.  I did try it outside on the sidewalk--do NOT get these if you want outdoor skates and you're a beginner.  They are much much harder to skate with on cement.  This is probably due to the fact that I am a rookie, but I imagine there are MUCH better skates for the rough surfaces.  These are perfect for rink use.

If YOU come up with a better solution, please let me know, but for now, this is the best I came up with.  Because it is flexible, it bends as the door opens and closes, keeping a pretty good seal on the glass.
I bought a second set along with two atomic green (70-75) bands. Fantastic training tool. I found several videos for using RBs and I love it! I now have four handles, two ankle straps, and two door anchors so I can double up on stuff like "heel to hand" for hamstrings or I can set up to do more than one exercise without having to change everything in between sets.

I would suggest you buy one of you need a bit of extra tent space, provided you are capable of getting up off of the ground. I'd also suggest having one if you're hiking for days/weeks (and want something better than a "pad"). This is much thinner overall than a typical air mattress, so if you do not put it on a cot or platform, prepare to "pick yourself up off of the ground"... but, to some people, that's not a bad thing.

Edited review: after using 4 times in more that ideal conditions it sprang a unfixable leak.
I love it because it's portable and folds up so easily, taking up next to no space in the car. It shipped in a small box, and literally clicked together out of the box. We end up taking it along a lot of places and she gets in extra riding time during otherwise boring events where busting out a big bike would be a little much. It is also so so cute. Much to my dismay, my child is in the thick of a princess phase and she was so happy to get this.

All in all, it is a beautiful toy... perfect for someone turning one.

BUT... BUT BUT BUT...
Now, I haven't yet used up a cartridge, so I don't know which one is inaccurate, but the online advertising, copied here and a zillion other places, says each cartridge lasts "at least 120 hours".  However, the product package says they last "up to 12 hours".  Big difference!  I've emailed the company and will be quite interested to learn which is the actual specification.

Now...the only thing I'm worried about is that it is 6 feet long. and I'm worried she will trip herself.  That's my fault for buying it for someone too young.

The bike looks really nice and the fine workmanship is still there plus it really lives up to the Radio Flyer name. I wish I had one when I was little but we couldn't afford one. Now that I am able to give this to my granddaughter I guess everything came full circle (I am very pleased with that outcome). I would definitely recommend this little tricycle to all children age 3 to 6.

3882	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I was so excited after reading all these reviews. A $22 great board. Well, the good thing about the board is just that, the board. It's made of good material and heals nicely.  The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs, the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable. That's no big deal, I painted mine white.  There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous. It can't simply be re-anchored....because... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be "off".  I gently removed it and took a picture. If I had to do again, I would probably buy the same board. Obviously, I'm one of the unfortunate. Oh, mounting instructions would have helped. 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out.
OK REALITY SET IN AFTER 17 MONTHS OF EVERY OTHER DAY USE.....HAD IN ALL FINISHED BASEMENT. NO WATER DOWN THERE EVER.....FOR SOME REASON THE BULLSEYE SWELLED SO BAD IT NO LONGER HOLDS SHOTS. BOUNCE OFFS DIDN'T BUG ME BUT AS BOARD AGED THE WIRED BENT UPWARDS ON THEIR OWN AND CAUSED MANY FRUSTRATING BOUNCE OFFS. I SWITCHED TO A BETTER BRAND AND BOUGHT A WINMAU BLADE 4 FOR 60 BUCKS.....HOPE IT STAYS IN BETTER SHAPE. GET THIS BOARD IF YOH DON'T USE MUCH....EVERY OTHER DAY DART PLAYERS NEED TO SPEND THE EXTRA CASH AND GET SOMETHING NICER.

The metal of the green box part of this stove is a bit thin, but any heavier and it would be difficult to carry. I needed this because when camping above about 9,000 feet (and windy) in the Rocky Mountains, my Weber 1141001 Go-Anywhere Gas Grill could not get hot enough to really grill meat or heat a cast iron griddle.

6091	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	There is a reason that the Coleman stove has been THE stove of choice for campers since the 1920's with very minimal design changes. In fact, the Coleman stove has remained almost completely unchanged since 1960. The only thing better than this Duel Fuel two burner stove would be the larger unit Coleman stoves that give you more space for cooking. The Duel Fuel capability is accomplished primarily by increased diameter fuel tubing in the generator. In other words, there is no magic or rocket science that makes the use of automobile gasoline possible. It is well known in camping circles that Duel Fuel stoves will technically work with automotive gasoline, but they will become testy with use as the automotive fuel additives start gumming up the internals of the stove. Even with a Duel Fuel stove, you are well advised to use Coleman fuel unless you are in a pinch and cannot find Coleman fuel. Given a choice between this liquid fuel Coleman Stove and the propane models, I prefer the liquid fuel stoves.

6780	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Skateboards are funny things.  For some, they are athletic tools and for others they are toys.  But for all, they need to have a basic functionality.  I was a little disappointed that the Hot Wheels Green Ride Skateboard purchased from Amazon was not really ready to ride when it was received.  Now since I sent it to Boise, ID and I live in Sioux Falls, SD, I could never have discovered the skateboards dysfunction, if it weren't for the serendipitous family reunion that occurred 3 weeks after the recipient's birthday.  I discovered that the skateboard had not been ridden, because it couldn't be ridden.  It had 2 wheels that were stuck because of overtightened bolts.  One of the Trucks was tightened so tightly that it was unresponsive to turning attempts when this 260 lb former skateboarder attempted to ascertain the lack of use.  The other truck was fine, but a skateboard requires 2 trucks to make a good turn.  I fixed the board and was finally able to introduce my nephew to a sport that I used to love, but this wouldn't have happen without an uncle's housecall.  From the store, this skateboard would have been left in the corner of a garage, providing no value for the investment.

I purchased the blue (heavy) band and it has provided me with the perfect amount of resistance for the workouts I use them for. I have short arms so many times I will wrap the band around my wrist and grip it lower, which is double-great because it also makes the exercise that much harder, yay! It's hard to really describe how much actual resistance you're getting and which band is good for you as, well, there's no physical number attached to how much weight it is. However, you should also know that most exercises can be tailored to your fitness level, simply by changing where you grip. Case in point, my wife has also used this same blue band for some exercises I showed her by changing where she grips and altering her stance as well.

1.  It should have an LED indicator telling you if the earpiece is on or not.  That's annoying and can drain your batteries if you're not careful, especially, since each ear turns on and off.  In addition, it should at least give you an on/off indicator, even it it's not an LED!

3189	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I picked up four of these for less than $30 total thinking they would be great for camping.  They are basically heavy duty pool floats.  I would not count on blowing these up using your own lungs unless you have an hour to spare and don't mind passing out.  They inflated easily enough with an electric pump but you must have an adapter that will work with the "pool float" valve.  I took a bicycle pump camping and even with that it took ten minutes of steady work to inflate one mattress.  Deflating them is equally difficult because of the valve.  These are big enough to sleep on unless you are huge but I don't think they are comfortable.  I did not sleep well on this and had a lot of sore spots when I got up.  I let a it of air out halfway through the night to make it less firm but that didn't help much.  I wound up cutting them with scissors and tossing them just so I wouldn't have to spend an hour deflating them.  I've got one left over, I'll use it as a pool float in the summer and spend more money on nicer camping mattresses.

I use them for batting practice - off the tee and soft-toss.
The rebounder does tend to tip over for harder shots, and shots that hit the frame, especially when the rebounder is in a more reclined position.  I see the need for using the included stakes, but I haven't tried them yet.

Same fine quality as in the past.  Customer support was really outstanding.

This set is perfect for travelers or people who have down time at work and can set aside a little time for a quick workout on the fly.  Fireman, Police officers, outdoor workers, office workers, medical professionals.

I can set the resistance level between 2-4lbs up to 75lbs. The door anchor and comfortable ankle strap add a lot of variety to my work out that I didn't have before. Hand grips are comfortable as well. Instruction and exercise example booklet are helpful and easy to follow. I wish there would have been exercise examples for the leg muscles, though. However, a quick google search and I was good to go. There were some stray strings on the handles but other than that, there were no issues. I called the owner with a few questions. He was easy to reach both times, kind and professional. Great company and great products. Highly recommend.

Iv been way lost before while looking for a lake on a map me and my cousin starting to doubt if the compass was lying to us 20 miles to go and bam 20 miles later and two days we hit our lake. The mirror is great for shaving or signaling even looking for ticks. I love my lensetic military compass as iv down hundreds of land nav courses with it but this compass is still better in my opinion. I have 3 suunto compasses and there all rock solid all accurate an easy to use if your looking for a compass you can learn to use and advance with I'd get this one! I always carry a backup like a m30 field compass or even a MCA compass. The lume this compass has is great at night while backcountry skiing or hiking iv used it to get back to the car no issues I mean I usually wear a head lamp so I can see the numbers anyway but still wonderful if your headlamp died. Put some clear nail Polish on the underside so the letters and numbers don't scratch off! I would recommend getting the global version just because the compass needle can dip more and makes it easier while walking. All in all this is a great tool my wife and my son both know how to use it and they love when it comes on outings with us a long with our GPS; -)

The heat output isn't fantastic, but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned, the flame adjustment isn't the greatest, but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove, highly recommend and would buy again.

I use it regularly, about 4 times a week.
When using this outdoors take note of any hooks you might have on fences and stay in the middle of the yard. This would work well for boys and girls for parties and events at the park.

Factory packaging for my example was of the cardboard box type, rather than the "blister pack."  Inside, the scope was wrapped in foam sheeting and sleeved in a cellophane bag.  Amazon's packaging was top-notch as per usual and my scope arrived to me without damage.  Removal of the packaging materials revealled the cosmetic finish of the exterior of the scope to be shockingly good -equal to any of the few mid-range to higher end, gloss-finish Bushnell scopes I've owned.  My initial impression upon removing this scope from the box was how much it resembled the old mid-80s vintage Bushnell Trophy 3-9 X scope in terms of appearance.
1069	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've had these just about a week. The quality is excellent and exceeded expectations.  It's very easy to change out the handles from band to band, and equally easy to combine bands to give different resitances.  I've tried out the ankle strap and door support and both are good quality, and easy to use.  The quality level for the price is great.  These cost me about the same as one co-pay at the physical therapy center!!

We have a nice paved 13.55 mile trail in town, and using this bike computer has made that trail that much more fun. I can know how far I have to get to the end of the trail and how far it is back to my car, and I am really pleased with it. For the money I think it is one of the best little computers you can buy!
9009	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great for cardio use!
The cons I found with this multi tool were odd, didn't affect it's daily use, and with care (and in my case brains :P) could easily be overcome. The tools don't actually 'lock' into place, when they fold out they seem to be held just by compression. This is fine for most uses but just be careful not to go trying to break a stubborn bolt loose, or you will ruin your knuckles. When using the pliers, think carefully about where you want your hands to go when the head folds up or down unexpectedly. I have used the angle headed feature maybe a handful of times, always just to grab something that fell, never to try and loosen something with it. I was slightly disappointed with the number of tools available from SOG to swap out. Sure a seatbelt cutter is awesome, but I feel that they really could use this design as a skunk works to test new concepts in what a multi tool could be. swap out all 5 tools on one side for a spring loaded window punch? Why not? Instead of pliers, have a RG45 crimper? Crazier things have been tried, and who knows maybe it changes the world of multi tool forever.

The gauge of the steel may not be what it was 50 years ago, but it's the much the same as 21 years ago, with an added feature: the steel is textured, which adds strength and resists scratching.

I have a Berkley glass trout rod in the same condition. Depending on how much it will be to strip, equip, tie and finish these poles is what determines if I will keep them. This Okuma advertises it is made of glass fiber. We will see. To me glass rods have greater casting distance, and unlike as advertised, all other constructions of blanks are not as sensitive to light bumps as the glass. Many of my acquaintances want to go back to glass only. They are looking at garage sales to find glass poles to rebuild. If this Okuma is truly glass construction maybe I will be wondering if I should rebuilt it in 25 years.

Balancing on one foot in stocking feet on the Airex is really good exercise for the muscles in the bottom of the feet -- much more so than balancing with shoes on or on a solid floor.

There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band, so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want.

It doesn't have a starter, but it fired up easily with matches.  I even used an old long nose click lighter that ran out of fuel.  The click portion still provided a spark to light up the stove.

For canning, I like to do it outside to keep from heating up the house.  It's hot enough just being around the canner and stove while the process is underway. Many people use the larger patio/camping stoves for canning, and they typically produce far higher heat than this stove does.  However, for cooking smaller portions, those stoves are a bit of an overkill, even if they do come with their own legs rather than needing a table to support them.  As an older person, I don't have the mega sized garden or the need for case after case of home canned food, so I just felt that purchasing a larger stove was not cost effective for making a couple of cases of this and that.  I also can smaller quantities than I used to, seldom over a single small batch of any particular thing. My only concern was whether the large waterbath canner or pressure cooker would physically FIT on this stove, as well as whether the weight would damage it.
If you know how to turn a dial, you can turn these off and keep them off.  They will not switch on while in storage.

That being said, I purchased these to use while hunting.  I have yet to test them in anything but good conditions, and I will update my review accordingly if need be.  The item is bigger than expected, and heavier too.

5951	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this originally to use in my home gym.  I wish I could say that that is what it is used mostly for, but I can't.  This is the perfect size to have in a home gym or to be used by toddlers and small children.  I'd be careful if using it for toddlers since it doesn't have a hold bar or a net.  If you use it on a carpeted area or grass, as I do, you probably won't have a problem.  It is also very durable.  I have a toddler and a preschooler.  They use it more then I do and It has survived for almost 2 years unscathed.

I can actually hear better with these on than without. There is some white noise when you do crank up the amplification all the way so play around with it. They are light and compact, and you barely notice them after a while. As for field experience, I took them out duck hunting and was in a small blind barely big enough for the 3 of us. I put these on and cranked up the volume to full. Everything loud was muted down to a pleasant level, including the shotguns fired in close quarters, and everything quiet was very audible. Great for a first set of electronic muffs, hunting, and shooting in general.

But in the end this mirror is completely useless.  I do not recommend buying this mirror for bicycling.  The problem is the convex mirror.  The convex mirror does not allow you to see cars approaching until they are directly next to you.  I was hearing cars and looking over my shoulder to see cars less than 1/2 block behind but they were completely non-visible in this mirror.  I presume the convex mirror was selected to assist with wider coverage, but on a bike your peripheral vision is adequate to see cars directly over your shoulder.  The safety purpose of a bike mirror is to see cars approaching, which this mirror does not provide.
2. Because of the cheap design of the mount, it can only be oriented (mounted) one way. At most, you can angle the speedometer a little one way or the other, but can't rotate it a complete 90. IOW, if you want to attach it to the handlebar stem to save space on your handlebars for something else, you're SOL. This is not the case with other, better bike speedometers.

6031	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Doesn't really have the flexibility to work with very many different size bikes very limited with tire size with this model. And if you are researching bike computers you know that to get accurate results it requires you to put in the proper size tire to get the proper readings this bike computer only has a half a dozen tire sizes and because of that I would not recommend purchasing this product

note: these binoculars have been purchased and used only in mild weather: 40-80 degrees fahrenheit. the true test will be using them in 100+ degrees with humidity. these would be good glasses for arenas and football stadiums when you have to buy nosebleed seats. im sure you can use them for lower bowl/deck viewing but i think the magnification would be too close to the action and you would be almost out frame (too close up). ill update this review once we get back into regular florida heat.

An alternate suggestion was this Fisher-Price Pogo Stick. It seemed like something he might enjoy. Ultimately, he did, but he was a bit bewildered at first. Now, he's off and bouncing, but there'll still be a period of time before we remove the "training pad." In any case, he enjoys it. The toy seems sturdy and well built and the durability should be good. He weighs 46 pounds, so the pogo will be good for some time up to the 60-pound upper limit. It's a nice toy for a young kid and should get him a lot of needed exercise, quite unlike his electronic games..
9955	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The GC80 works really well, little fussy on how much lines spooled in there, but that was minor. Casts a pretty good distance and once you have the right amount of line on it is very smooth in my opinion. GC80 works best with 6lb Line, 8 lb was ok but not that's great. My recommendation would tell you to get some "reel magic" from Blake more and spray it down good with it. line on the spool and the guides, also recommend using the reel in Ocalation mode rather than keep the ati reverse on get better casting distance and a smoother retrieve without the click, click click noise, plus it easy to flip the switch when you need it... Well that was my Tow cents on it, I also have the silver cast which are great reels as well...

As far as looks, we love the bright red color and classic style.

My son can't get enough of it and loves to go up and down the street ringing the bell.  Even the neighbors can't help but smile.
It's still a fun little car to play with.  With a few upgrades to the suspension and motor, it will hold up much better on a track.  It turns well and is very nimble.  It's so much fun to keep up with the other drivers because you can make much quicker turns in smaller spaces.

625	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I looked at several similar sets of resistance bands, some boasted beautiful packaging and high quality materials for 10 or more dollars then this product. The packaging was basic and the carrying bag was mediocre,  but inside was a very high quaility and complete set. Exactly what I was hoping for when looking for a set, I also really appreciated the booklet on possible exercises and the thick foam handles; although one more set of handles so you could work with a partner would be nice. I really want to give 5 stars but couldn't,  the point off is for the conflicting information in the booklet. Inside the booklet it states the band's can be stretched 400%, even saying that translates to 1 foot of band can be stretched to 4 feet. Then in the back warnings section, in slightly smaller font it states to only stretch a maximum of 3 times total length. Just saying some clairification or a rewrite are in order. Although , if properly using the band's it seems unlikely anyone could even extend the band's that far. Thusly 4.5/5 stars if I could.

It is a good compass, but I decided it would be easier and more accurate to read if I had bought the version (Suunto MC-2DLIN Compass) with the mirror.  I like this mirrored version so well that I bought another just like it as a back-up. This compass is easy to get a reading using the mirror.  The scales provided on the see-thru base are nice and adjusting for declination is very easy; just flip the compass over and using the supplied tool, make a slight adjustment (East or West, as apprpriate) and then you are true North!  I had to adjust for 7 1/2 degrees West declination and it was easy to do.

Needless to say, I at 60+ was not looking forward to sleeping on the ground.  I looked around in various stores for an inflatable mattress - the cheap pool mats were non-existent or too small.  REI offerred several great mattresses, but required a dollar investment I wasn't willing to make for what could be a one-time need.  I was thrilled to find these mattresses on Amazon.  The price was within my budget and the reviews were pretty good.  I bought 3 of them and they were delivered as expected.  On first seeing them, I was surprised at the quality giving the cost - not flimsy plastic; they looked sturdy.  I slept comfortably every night of our camping trip. Mine lost a little air after a day or two, but nothing I wouldn't have expected from any air mattress.  I was very pleased with my purchase and recommend them to others.

We tightened it and it came off again the next day. Exchanged through Amazon, and the new one was even worse. It lasted a day. Very cheap. The only plus was Amazon's quick exchange and customer service.

7845	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I teach map reading and orienteering. I tested the Brunton 15TDCC to determine if was an inexpensive compass for orienteering courses. I found it was satisfactory for basic orienteering. Like many compasses however, the instructions are inadequate and do not clearly explain all the features on the compass and how to use them. The compass is reasonably accurate. One thing that is poorly explained is setting the declination which is extremely important. The instructions are for all Brunton compasses but just what applies to this particular compass is undecipherable. This compass sets declination using a tiny screw. A sheet metal screw driver is attached to the compass lanyard but it is useless because the screw is tight. If you think that the screw is to loosen the bezel so that it can be adjusted, you are wrong. What the screw does is turn an inner dial to set the declination but even after it is set, it doesn't help you sight the compass. It is only helpful in orienting a map. There is also an inclinometer inside the dial but no instructions on how to use it. But I like this compass because it is clear lucite and can be placed on a map where you can see through the compass. And it is an easy to read compass.

2791	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes, coolers, keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it, it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2" -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again, I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft.
389	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good product. Came with everything stated and the instruction booklet had good suggestions for some exercises. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 starts is that there is no indication on the bands themselves for how much resistance they apply. The booklet explains which is which and you can kind of tell by the diameter of the band itself, but some type of brief indication on the band would be appreciated. Overall exactly what I wanted.

I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) .

1828	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For the $20 that I paid for the full set (did not the include the pitching rubber strip), I'm very happy with the heaviness and quality of the bases.  Each base probably weighs a couple of pounds and seem very durable.....much better than the real thin, lightweight, flimsy base set.  On a flat gym floor, these will stay in place a lot better because of their weight.  They do a good job on the grass and are wonderful to throw in the trunk for possible pickup games with the kids (or their friends) or at a family picnic.  I guess if you really needed these bases to stick in the grass, I would recommend purchasing some 3/4" or 1" wide white webbing that's about 17" long.  Use the poly/nylon webbing and some spikes to hold the webbing down over the bases.  You don't want to puncture the rubber bases because that puncture is just going to rip bigger and bigger.  My boys are only 5 and 7 yrs old so these are just fine.  If playing in the grass alot, I may have like to see Franklin make this same set in a neon/construction color orange.  The orange color would help make the bases pop a little more in the grass, and probably make them a little easier to see.  If the boys continue show interest in baseball and get older, I will make the investment for a more durable home plate with the 3-5 spikes in them so the home plate is thicker/heavier and stays in place during batting practice.  One improvement that I would like to see Franklin make on these rubber plates is to manufacture some heavy-duty "tabs" on the outside of the bases.  The tabs would have small holes in them so that you can use small ground spikes to anchor the bases down in the grass.  For home plate - use three tabs, you could have tabs on the front corners and at the back tip.  For the other bases, you could use four, but at minimum, have two tabs on opposite corners.

3807	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Well made, and hangs well on our wall.  It is really heavy, so use a good strong stud to hang this dartboard on.  It holds the darts well in the fiber bristles when playing.  I appreciate that, because that means the darts are bouncing out all over our game space.  It looks exactly like it does in the picture.  It has nice bright colors and scoring numbers  We intend to use it often.  It has made our basement  game room that much more fun!  Glad we made this purchase!

5890	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am an average size woman, dress size 6-8 (5'6" and 130#) and these fit me with no trouble at all and some room to spare.  They would easily fit someone larger too (but probably not a large muscular male---he might be able to wear the kneepads as elbow pads though!).  They have stretch velco straps so the size is adjustable.  The velcro straps are comfortable, not so tight that they cut off circulation. I like them a LOT better than my old ones, which were not straps but stretchy elastic and hard to get on and off, especially if one was sweating!  These are simple, fast and easy to put on and take off.  These seem well-made;  I've had them for about a month (with usage 3 times a week, for biking) and I expect them to last a long while----but even if they didn't, at this price it's affordable to replace them.  They probebly would work equally well for skating.  They don't hamper one's movement---when wearing them, I pretty much forget that they're there.  For the price, these can't be beat!  I'm very pleased with the purchase.

This  is one of the best designs for the pliers. As you can see in the photo the  smooth part of the handles is on the outside so when you bear down on the  pliers the handle doesn't cut into your hand. Also as you can see the head  tilts. You can get some pressure at the tip at this angle, and you can pick  up those little screws that dropped behind the exhaust manifold without  burning your fingers.

The purple tube is 36 inches in length and seems to offer somewhere in the 25 - 30 lb. level of resistence.  I am basing this on its similarity to my ability to use that weight range on a Bowflex.

2909	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	received on time, worked very well.
First, the good.  The circle-in-circle system is easy to use.  Gradations are, in contrast to many compasses, 1 degree, and  are crisp and clear enough it's possible to actually see and distinguish them.  The little "magnifying" bump helps with this.  Declination scale adjustment is easy to set without tools.  Bezel moves smoothly and easily but not too easily.  Flip up mirror has nice crisp line and the usual notch.  It sort of clicks into position at about 45 degrees.  I would worry that this would lossen up and get sloppy but I've used my other one for 10+ years and it hasn't so assuming this one will be the same.  UTM and mile scale for 7.5 min serries USGS topos on the base is a plus.  There are others for different scale maps on a clear plastic page in the little booklet thingie that comes sandwiched between the base and the rubber bottom cover of the compass.  The edges are all rounded over so no sharp corners which is great if you tuck it under coat/shirt to keep it from flopping about.

9907	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ordered the Okuma Fishing TU-150 this is a 15 foot surf casting rod. For the money this is impossible to beat the price!!! I have use the rod on two different days at the ocean. I used a 3oz sinker. Cast easily. If you can get a good knack, this rod zings the bait way out....Sets up easy, 3 piece makes the rod easy to carry. I use elastics one at the top end and one at the bottom end to sort of hold the rod together when going to and from fishing area. On warning when you are putting the 3 piece rod together, wiggle the rod pieces slowly into the male and female fitting. take your time. Try to allow the air to like escape that is getting compressed. You will find little trouble this way when you tear down the Okuma Fishing TU-150, 15 foot rod when you want to move or go home. If these pieces are places together fast and just pushed in, you WILL find yourself with a mated one piece or two piece fishing rod. Take some fine sand paper and just lightly sand down the male ends of the 3 piece rod, not too much, or when you cast so will part of your rod. This will help prevent the suction you will create by hastily setting up your rod. You will not be able to remove the pieces if you put this rod together hastily. TRUST ME. USE the sandpaper as needed on the male end of the 3 piece rod. Of course you will have only two male ends to worry about. And I would take this seriously. Besides that you have a $300 rod for good money........Love mine. I have 3 of these rods and will not take no when I ask someone to join me, the excuses get slim, when you have the equipment. And at this price, I feel great about the price and value. Rocky shoreline...this rod will keep your bait from getting jammed in the rocks with its 15 foot length

This chafes way too much when riding.  It's a severe design error that should never happen.
Just a note on the case: initially I thought with the clip it may not stay on my belt all too well, I've had problems with those plastic clips just being too flimsy or something.  Not so... It stays quite well and is strong; and the bottom of the clip has a hook-like end and catches very well. I'm quite pleased with it also.
In my opinion, these are better than the low quality brands I see at most sporting goods stores.

Not the most comfortable piece of protective equipment I've ever worn before but I haven't encountered a mask that is comfortable when strapped to my face.. This mask tends to put pressure on the bridge of my nose, much like a pair of sun/glasses that fit too small. The mask itself doesn't seem or feel to small tho. I think it's just me. But It took several attempts and trail and error to get the fitting adjustmented right.

3) The plastic lanyard attachment is concerning. The design is flawed and doesn't give me warm fuzzies that the lanyard attachment will keep the compass attached to the lanyard in the long run. I've decided not to use the lanyard attachment and instead have attached the lanyard directly to the compass with a larks head knot. Now I don't need to worry about the lanyard detaching from the compass.
This pad should fit one average sized adult reasonably well, though it's probably best for back sleepers, as there isn't much extra room to roll around. Inflated, I measure it at almost exactly 24" x 72".  I find the mattress to be much more comfortable if you inflate it to only around 70% capacity. Less air makes it less rigid, and it will better conform to the shape of your body.  Though not a premium camping pad, this mattress delivers a big improvement in comfort for campers on a budget.

The hydrospex goggles seemed to do everything right. The only thing that I don't like about them is that they do start to feel tight after a while.
I've only had them for a few hours, but I'm already in love. If you can't make it to the gym these bands are PERFECT!  In the time it takes to get to the gym your workout can already be over. Plus, they aren't limited to one location like an expensive machine is. Anywhere there's a door, there's a workout. As I mentioned I'm currently a student, but if you work in an office without a gym on site these would be PERFECT! You could easily set them up and get a good workout during lunch. The bag they come in is compact and light, so when you buy these bands you have NO EXCUSES not to get a good workout.

431	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	It's a shame because I mean they work well enough, but the clips that you use to hook the bands to the handles are very cheap and weak.

Ideally, the manufacturer should have included a little molded thing that fits the intake valve and that could be customized according to how the user intends to inflate the mattress, but that would have no doubt doubled or trebled the price.  I'm happier with the current price and my little invention.  Money saved is money to buy a new one should the need arise.  Oh, yes, this mattress does not have any unpleasant odor, even in a confined area.

It works well as a top lure and simulates a dying fish well. Good sharp hooks ensure your fish won't get away (nor will your thumb if not careful). Good Amazon Price Too - recently saw this in Bass Pro for $7.99.

Happily, I can profess that I made the right decision and that I actually get use out of this model long after the bed decided to enter the plastic graveyard. In fact, it was the main reason the bed lasted as long as it did, holding its charge for days at a time while I tried to find the looming lungs that seemed to only exhale from somewhere inside its interior. Equally quaint was the accessory that let it work as a deflation tool, allowing me to take air out in moments instead of having to work and maneuver the last gasps out of something that wished to defy me.

The darts fly well, but will be easily damaged when hitting each other. The board can be a bit challenging, but a novice will not notice since half their throws will be misses or not stick anyway.

9268	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The best fishing line for the price.
In short: The mat itself is great quality, but it's probably best suited to certain kinds of workouts. (I eventually wound up getting an oversized yoga mat for Insanity because it has better traction and is a bit more stable for sideways movements and push-ups/planks.)

They actually cover the entire elbow and knee area and stay in place. The kids fell a lot and the plastic scratched up pretty easily, but the kids didn't even cry!

3328	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a camping trip in yosemite.  I cannot sleep on the ground and I wanted a mattress that wouldn't take up half a tent since we had 3 people in a tent.  This mattress helped me get so much more sleep than the other guys in our tent.  Also it was better at keeping me warm as opposed to sleeping on the cold ground.  Best of all it was $100 cheaper than most camping air mattresses, which seems ridiculous to me to spend that much money on a camping mattress.  The only caveat to this mattress is that the nozzle is not the most robust, it's just a typical pool inflatable nozzle that can pop open if the nozzle is wet.  I just put some duct tape over it and it was fine.  You'll also need a flatter piller to put on top of the inflatable pillow

They aren't the fanciest shorts, but they last forever and are great to lounge around in. I ordered a M since those are the sizes I own already. They are more like Women's size; I usually wear 8-10 and a medium fits great with extra room. love the price and will order more.
If you would prefer to make this a Triple Fuel stove via propane, you can buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Century-Regulated-Propane-Converter-Grey/dp/B000GPLIZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Century Regulated Propane Converter (Grey)</a>&nbsp;and use it with propane canisters or, with the addition of a hose, a propane tank.

I purchased them primarily for astronomy.  Many people never think to turn their binoculars toward the night sky but they will show you a lot more stars than you can see with the naked eye. These gather about 25 times more light than your eyes so dim stars become visible and some very nice star clusters become visible.  Also 7X is easier to hold steady than my 10X or 15X binoculars.

Have not had the chance to test it out yet but, assuming it works, will be using this stove extensively on future camping trips for years to come. I have used several Coleman products in the past.that used the liquid fuel and they always performed very well. I have not been able to do any camping for years and lost track of all my old Coleman gear. Now, I am about to retire and have planned the camping trip to beat all camping trips.....sixty days and sixty nights tenting out west (US). I trust this stove will work as well as my old one did. If not, I will be updating this review.
One warning - make SURE you use the correct screws - coarse screws WILL split hardwood and fine screws MIGHT strip in softwood.

At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two.
Absolute waste of money, do not buy, you will regret it.

5564	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My tall 80 pound 7 year old granddaughter started pedaling her new 2 wheeler wearing these pads. They didn't restrict her movement and the size fit her well. My very small 6 year old grandson wore them for the same purpose. He is 3'10" and 48 pounds. They were big for him but we made it work with the adjustable velcro. He was happy to take them off after our second day of riding because they weren't comfortable, however they accomplished exactly what we wanted- preventing skinned knees and elbows, adding a bit of confidence for the rider and helping parents relax a little. Very pleased with this quality product.

The only complaint was of the sleeping bags slipping off, but there is a smoother side and a rougher side and I suspect those complaints came from those that did not listen when I was explaining that. The star off is for some difficulty inflating and because they could stand to be a tad wider.

Additionally the SOG has a gear system for the pliers that multiplies your strength two fold.

In general, my older Craftsman has omissions and additions as a part of running changes  that make it both better and worse than a modern Swiss Army knife, but in general this is a great knife and has everything I'd likely need with no fragile or useless stuff the Champ has like the magnifying glass (which I'd likely scratch or break) or fish scaler (which I've been told that multitool fish scalers aren't too good).  The pen would be too awkward to use (they don't use the knife itself as a grip like the smaller SAKs like the Mini Champ) and I see no need for the provision for a pin slot under the Philips, as even though I bought one to put in the pin slot on my Fieldmaster, I rarely use it.  Eventually, I'll likely end up getting a modern one because of the improvements to the file/metal saw, scissors, pliers, and Phillips.  My advice is, if you find an older one cheap, but in good condition, buy it.  It still has lots of life in it.  You'll eventually get used to the stuff that wasn't improved until years later.

3075	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I could not believe how great this was.  I took this camping and luckily a friend of mine had a pump to help me blow it up. I'm not sure how long it would've taken me on my own. Once it was blown up it was great. It stayed inflated for the entire weekend and I slept comfortably each night.  Deflating it took a little bit of time, but I was able to fold it up in packet back into my duffel bag. This inflatable camping pad was so much better than sleeping on the ground in my sleeping bag. I found that it was firm and it didn't wobble. I recommended this pad to several people.

As with many other competing high-quality machines, the 1175e had the elliptical mechanism in the front--I think that idea may be superior to having the mechanism to the rear of the machine (for one thing, the front mechanism design often saves space). One the other hand, I prefer the front panel on the 1100HR/A to that of the 1175e.

Cons:
7963	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is the real thing -- made to league specs.  It's actually manufactured in Costa Rica, but you couldn't tell from the materials or stitching -- this is top quality work.

Adjustment knobs can be fincky - either on full blast or off.  Also, a spark ignitor would have been nice (has to be lit with matches).  That said, it boiled water quickly and was able to cook eggs.

If you get this thing, don't store anything on top of it or wedge it tightly against anything else -- the foam has a memory for those insults and it takes weeks or even months for dents created overnight to fade away.  Standing on it doesn't create those problems -- but putting weights on it or sticking it in a tight space for a few hours will mar its surface.

1575	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Kids love it, shoots the ball back much harder than I anticipated.  Went together easily, kind of difficult to get the last few fasteners on to hold the net.  But that's not a problem, it's actually what makes it work so well once it's together.
It comes with 2 U-shaped aluminum pins to anchor it in the dirt, but it's hefty enough that it takes a real wallop (something a 12 or 14 year old could do point-blank) to move the goal.  The heavy-duty black bungee cords work well.

5112	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son is 8, and lately, he has been really in to Rocky. These gloves were perfect for him. They come in a zippered case which is good for storage. They are easy to put on with my help. They are the real deal- They don't look like cheap "toy kids gloves", even though he is only using them to play-act. I was really happy with the purchase.

A full set of bands are available with difference strength levels though I only tested the "extra heavy" red set.  For a beginner, probably a progression of strengths will be more effective and allow for a better workout while learning the exercises.
These scooters ride smoothly and kids learn quickly. I'm amazed at how fast my kids go on them and truthfully wish they'd go slowly.

8770	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Most of the reviews here are from people with balance problems, or rehabbing serious injuries.  I'm not in that category; I do have some joint problems, and have had some PT, but I'm working out again and I see this as a piece of equipment that serious athletes, or anyone,  can benefit from, not just patients.  I'm using it to work my foot, leg and core muscles, not so much for balance per se, although it certainly benefits that as well.

9832	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	TU-120 looks like a decent rod but has major construction issues : after one day of pier fishing one of the rings broke. Later, I noticed corrosion on the rod tip (and yes, I do rinse all my gear with fresh water after each day of salt water fishing). I'm done with this brand. From now on I'm going with Tsunami or even better Ugly Stick.

I recommend this product.

5182	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop, so we decided to give this one a try.

5417	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I wasn't that familiar with goggles when I bought these but they work well. They are the "over the eye" kind as opposed to fitting "within the eye socket" kind.

with removing them.
I experimented with this thing for over 2 hours with my right hand and an hour with my left.  To be clear, today and yesterday, the wind was under 5 mph.
Now, the not so great.  So I REALLY wish this compass had more parallel lines etched into the base, like my old beater Silva from 25yr ago.  Those allow you to short-cut taking map bearings by aligning compass edge to line of travel then rotating bezel so lines on face of bezel are parallel w/ North gridlines (ideally, overlying one).  That saves the step of "orienting the map" and is great for the field where you are all geared up and/or in rough terrain and don't want to bend over to set the map on the ground.  Bummer on not having that.  Second is why they had to make the base rubber case thingie DARK gray??  So, if I take out the booklet above, the face of my compass is now dark (from the rubber behind it) and I can't see the circle or needle to use the compass!  So I either have to leave the booklet in and risk ruining it in wet conditions or put in some other "white" card or something.  My old model had a light green rubber cover so it was fairly usable without the booklet.  Why not make the rubber base thing bright yellow?  I mean, if I ever dropped it, that would help me find it too!!  Lastly, the way the lanyard attaches worries me.  There are pins that move back and forth to capture the cord.  The rubber case holds them in place, but if you take that off, uh-oh - If that happens while you are hiking ... ooops ... there goes your compass.  When I go the places I do, my compass is as vital to me as the means by which I'm going to secure hydration, so that makes me paranoid.  That means I have no choice but to leave the rubber case on when hiking and futz around taking it off to use ..... grrrrrr.  The one I got developed a bubble at about 8000 feet - about 3-4mm which I think is significant.  Still useable, but not sure what will happen at 10k feet or over...

2335	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	One of my favorite knives just to carry.  Smooth opening, intuitive.  I took off the clip and just keep it in my pocket.  One word of caution:  Don't carry this in the same pocket as your loose change.  A DIME can get stuck between the blade and the frame and you would NEVER get it open if you needed it fast!

476	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are a nice set of bands. I had shoulder surgery and they work great for rehab.  You can add more bands to increase resistance. I have used some other brands before but this is a nice set and the bands don't lose their resistance like some of the others I have used. The door anchor works great and the metal clips are nice compared to other brands.  I was always a free weight only guy but I can get a good workout with these bands and now supplement my free weights with them. Hopefully I will not have to use their warranty but from what I have read and seen Black Mountain stands behind their products.


The case is a soft material and I would be careful packing them with anything that might damage the binoculars.  The case gives some protection from damage and has straps, so I carried them in the case at times around neck.  There are also straps for the binoculars.  I would not carry them for long around neck as I'd worry about damage.  The case closes with a single velcro fastener and anything small could easily fall out and get lost.  This is probably the only downside on this buy.  I am looking for some additional velcro I can attach to the case.

2459	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for river tubing in some gentle rapids. Works great, even better than a tube because this one leaves you closer to the water for easier paddling with the hands. The one disadvantage is you will have to bail water out yourself since there is no way for it to get out otherwise. Also one note of caution, I inflated this while it sat on the hot asphalt. The air chambers on the floor of the raft got too hot and expanded under the air pressure. Now the floor is lopsided, though this is not much of a problem.
I've had mine for years but don't carry it everyday. I do take it along whenever I fix things especially when I'm not sure what tools I'll need.

4547	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Like other reviewers, I've had to fiddle with the knobs to get this stove to simmer rather than boil at top capacity. Hence four stars rather than five.  But once you address that issue-- and it is a small issue indeed, this is the best all-around stove for heavy use. I use it in my work as a field biologist, where there are typically 4 or 5 people boiling water or cooking meals twice a day for 8 days at a time. While it lacks the bells and whistles that some of its (higher-priced) competitors have, such as electronic ignition, I note that this is the stove that keeps on functioning year after year. It's also the stove that works best with an adaptor, allowing you to hook it up to a propane tank instead of the small bottles.  It isn't the prettiest, it isn't the flashiest, and it isn't the lightest stove available, but it is the true workhorse of the group.
4509	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Received one of these as part of a package deal with our little camper.  Honestly, only came to own one due to the package deal.  Had I set out to buy one I probably would have picked one of a more modern design that was more expensive.  I read the reviews here, including the leading review that discusses cleaning the valves.  I did that little repair (sure enough, my valves were caked with dark grease), and fired it up.  I have to say, I'm impressed with the heat this little monster puts out.

When you're using Resistance Bands you're demonstrating a type of training called "Dynamic Resistance Training."  This refers to the fact that throughout the entire movement resistance is being applied to the muscle that is being worked.  A Biceps Curl is a perfect example.  When using a resistance band for a biceps curl at the top of the movement (meaning when your arm is up towards your shoulder) there is still resistance being placed on the muscle because of the elasticity of the band.  If you were doing the same biceps curl with a standard free weight barbell, at the top of the movement there is little to no resistance being placed on the muscle.  This is the beauty of Dynamic Resistance Training. The muscle is being placed under constant tension.
5120	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great gift. My soon to be 4 year wanted this for Christmas and after receiving it, I am highly satisfied. It is age appropriate and will grow with her. It allows for her to learn balance and stability while having fun like her older siblings...it does not look babyish or like it is made for a younger child. It looks very fun and exciting.

The setup of the net was relatively easy, I would recommend using a partner just for the sheer size of the rebounder. The only semi-difficult part was stretching the rebounder net to attach it to the frame. This took some strength which was not a problem for me, but I could see some smaller people having issues with it(I am not bragging or a chauvinist, just saying I am a big man and have more strength than most).

Operation is simple. Push the top button quickly for measuring distances or hold it down to 'scan' the field. The front button toggles between yards and meters - and it toggles between standard and >150 yard measurements to avoid closer objects. The unit stays on for 6 seconds and acquisition of distances is relatively quick. Obviously, use is limited by the steadiness of your hand with farther, smaller objects.
The item is difficult to change settings when riding, so that made it ever less user friendly. (Who carries the directions with them on their bike? Who should have to?)

2501	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion this is the best of all the Swiss Army Knives.  I wore my first one out after 20+ years of hard use and am delighted the the new replacement.
3285	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I ordered 3 of these and 2 have functioned flawlessly and 1 had a slow leak along a side seam. I would have returned the leaky one except that we ran out of room on the camping trip and I threw it out to save some space.

8899	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am interested in this for toning, it's not really designed to replace dumbbells, so if you're looking for that go another route. Being that I like to lift weights, I wanted a band to help tone my arms a little more. In that respect it works great, I would say that when standing on this band with both feet, it gives you about 25-35(at top)lbs. of resistance on each arm with a bicep curl. Obviously this isn't for building huge arms or anything, but it is very convenient and portable nonetheless. The band itself is built really solid too, so I expect this to last a long time. As far as instructions go, I already knew how to properly use bands, but in case you don't look it up on the Internet.

2398	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We purchased this for our 8, 10 and 13 year old to play outdoor street hockey, and indoors in our basement with soft hockey puck.  It was very easy to put together and just as easy to pull apart when we needed to pack it up and take it in the car to grandmas. I don't see how its foldable. The boys love it! This net is sturdy, stays together and the ease of being able to pull apart makes it transportable. Its also light enough that kids can carry it where they want it. I will update again in few months to let you know how it holds up. So far its five stars!
1645	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect! Kids love it.
Lots of people talking about how hard an install it was. I agree, it was tricky, but if you couldn't do this, then you simply are not handy. The manual calls for three people to build it. Ridiculous! I did it while watching in one episode of "The Daily Show", and I skipped the commercials. That's 22 minutes, and I'm just a handy, average strength, healthy man. Some force is required, but two feet and two hands did the trick.

3682	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	We loved the Coleman Quick Pump we had for many years, but it finally gave up the ghost and we ordered the newest version of it.  We charged it overnight before the first use as recommended, but the pump was weak from the start, barely blowing up one double air mattress.  It only worked a couple of times, then would not take a charge at all, no matter what we tried.  We did not need it often, so by the time we realized it was dead, we were out of warranty.  A note to Coleman was answered promptly, but only offered us 25% off any product on their website, none of which was a rechargeable pump.  Maybe we just got a bad one, but I can't recommend this pump.  Now I have to remove the battery and find someplace to recycle it, one last indignity.

The concept is nice and the computer scan is a neat feature, but when someone wants to gauge their trip totals accurately, what's the point in having this if you still have to Google your trip to get an accurate distance?

One nice thing about this mat is that when you wear out one side you can flip it over and use the other side.  That's what I did and I figure I got over 7 years out of each side.  That comes out to a little over $2.00 a year, which as far as I'm concerned is a pretty darn cheap exercise mat.  If you take care of it and treat it well it will last you a very long time.

Aside from stretching and light work most will have to add bands to this kit. I added a purple (40-50lbs) and the atomic green (70-75lbs). I use my kit to workout when I am on the road. They yellow and blue bands are useless to me, but buying outside of the kit is more expensive. I have about $60 all into this kit and it allows me to work my chest, arms, shoulders, back, do "weighted" squats and all the major muscle groups. I add in some planks for core and jumping jacks to get my heart rate up and it is a great workout that can be thrown in a bag, taken and done about anywhere.

The beach is only about a 15 minute walk from the house and sadly I bought the wrong item on Amazon, so we didn't have any ice for the cooler. We didn't have much to bring, so there were some cheese sticks, pretzels, etc. and some sodas in there. It got a little heavy and the handle starts to sting your hand a bit, but it didn't creak or give me any impression that it was going to bend or break in any way - I'd rather have a little hand discomfort than have a cooler break on the first outing.
4711	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My family is getting back in to camping. I bought this one, because it was similar to the one I had years ago and at a great price. In hind sight I would've spent a little more to get the electronic starter, but it works great using a camp lighter.

Upon arrival you will see that the outside layer of mesh is a form of see-through mesh.  The orange dots on the shell are just decor held in place by a paper backing on the inside of the shell.

I want to point out 2 negatives:

9858	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This rod is inexpensive, but not durable . It suffers from inherent weakness and has corrosion issues.  Despite washing it after each saltwater trip and storing it inside, the guides corroded and two broke from corrosion early in its second season. The final nail in the coffin was when the rod snapped when pulling in a small (less than 1 pound) croaker.  I am looking for better options to replace it.
5446	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for myself.  Was the first time I have ever worn goggles.  I love the comfortable fit and they are perfect to protect my eyes in the water.  So much so that I can wear my contact lenses while swimming and not worry about them.  They don't leak and are great!  Would highly recommend.  I had seen other reviewers say that others leaked but the hydrospex did not.  Very true., these don't leak and you see clearly underwater.
I am rating it 1 because I am left with a totally useless purchase.
2688	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Don't expect it to last very long.  Two weeks before mine wouldn't hold air anymore.  Regret not sending it back.  It was around 15 bucks so I guess you get what you pay for.
8545	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It seems the only difference from the original backboard is the color & coloring scheme. Even the numbers are the same as the original board. I didn't use the new hoop or anything else - just the board... I guess, I should ask if they just sell the backboard alone... next time. Original lasted about 6 years (enough to escape a warranty claim). Installed fairly easily. It helps that the BB setup we got from 'LIFETIME' is height adjustable. I called first, read the #'s from the original backboard to the rep & she confirmed it would work w/o anything else needed. She was right! Arrived in a timely fashion. Price was... cheaper than buying a whole new package... Guess we'll see how long this one lasts!

9798	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I needed a crossbow for a Daryl Dixon costume.  I really wanted the Goldilocks of toy crossbows- not too realistic, and not a sparkly purple or lime green toy. This one was just right!  It is a good size for walking around a convention- I didn't get caught on too many things.  Be warned- when you shoot the darts, they can hurt! We were playing around with them and left a small ding in the wall. For the price, this is a perfect toy crossbow.

2690	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It's a very nice inflatable boat, which is perfect for kids. Please note that the maximum weight is 200 lbs, so it's unlikely to hold one male adult and one kid, unless the kid is 3-4 years old.

This ball has the traditional styling, detail and look. My boys enjoy practicing with it and the size is easy for them to use.

The lure was purchased as a gift.  The recipient is well pleased.
This thing is my best friend, and extremely durable. Aside from a weird top of the foot pain I get sometimes, it's the most useful piece of gear I have on my person. Especially since I don't know how to skateboard, and don't want to spend the time to lock up my bike and have to worry about it getting stolen constantly.
Overall, for the price, I got exactly what I wanted and expected to get. I'm only marginally disappointed with the issues I have had with the unit. I have no intention of returning my unit or getting a replacement because most reviews point to the problem eventually turning up, for those reviewers who have updated their reviews.  After pulling out the legs and leveling the unit, it becomes a non-issue during use.

Followed the directions, as far as the first charging, and charge it again after every use and have yet to have any issues.  It is even handy for deflating items.  I would buy it again.

4431	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I had one many years ago and it hasn't changed much. I see what people are saying about being able to 'turn' down the heat. I suggest a piece of rubber (like a piece of tire etc) or a piece of cardboard etc and put it between the dial and the stove so the dial doesn't move. That should take care of the problem. You shouldn't have to do that, agreed but in the meantime that is what I am doing. Also sent email to Coleman asking about this, let's see what they say. I will update when I get a reply. For that reason I am giving it 4 stars.

The only con is that you need to make your own straps, which you cut to length, from a provided spool of strapping.  Spool of strapping is huge, and more than covered my needs.  I used a lighter to singe the cut end of straps to keep it from coming apart.

3652	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	if you don't mind the price, this stuff is delicious. It is hard to imagine how something that has the texture of light weight chalk could taste so creamy and delicious but it really does. I just wish it were cheaper. I bought a large pack as a treat but it is much too pricey to make a regular habit. Too bad.
Cons:
4822	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We've had this stove for upwards of 25 years, and it has withstood the test of time, weather, and all kinds of camping conditions. The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska, Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.
after reading the negative reviews I saw that they pertain primarily to the map scales...if you'll order this compass here, it'll be shipped with the standard american map scale conversions... yes, as I've just checked on the photo enlargement option, the compass pictured here is shown with the [european] map scales of 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 but you'll get the one with the american units regardless...
2454	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love this boat, we have the larger version too and take both to the beach and tie them with a long rope and just push and pull them about in the shallows over small waves. This holds two toddlers easily and they love it! Also bought a small set of oars
246	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Okay.  So I have had these resistance bands for little over a month now and am really pleased with them.  The main thing I like about them is that they are so easy to configure due to the carabiner connectors.  While I am not a materials engineer the quality of the bands and the various components is good.  The stitching on the ankle and door bits is good.  I had no problem using the door attachment.  It slid right into the space between the door and frame.  I closed the door and was working out within minutes, once I got the right level of resistance I was looking for.  Need more just add another band.  Need to reduce the resistance just swap out or reduce the number of bands you have attached.  Easy as pie.

6713	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box. My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife, and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there, but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it, so to each their own.

So far, the unit has greatly exceeded my expectations.
8594	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use this band multiple times a week in an outdoor workout class.  It's been in the dirt, under my shoes, used over and over and is holding up nicely. It takes a few times to stretch it out a bit, I got the red (hard) so until you use it a few times, it's almost too hard!
"It's hard to open the case completely" - The protective rubber shoe should be thumbed off first, which is easy enough. If the opening the case completely is still too hard for you at that point, you are probably too delicate to risk being outdoors anyway and might do better to just stay home.

Not sure if the more expensive models allow for longer hang times, but these can start to pull on your ankles. I'm about two bills and some change when I'm lifting so it's a bit of weight to put on one's ankles. I can get about 5-10 min of hang time. I have noticed better hangs when I have the hooks *behind* my calves, but they can be worn both ways. There is some additional packing foam included...keep it. I use it at times to supplement the padding on my ankle. I go barefoot as opposed to boots. I have big stocky calves from punishing runs and years of military hikes with more weight on my back than you want to think about. People with skinnier legs will want to wear boots with these.  Recommend you have some ropes (I use old Jujitsu belts from my lower ranks) rigged up on both sides of a bar to help you pull back up if you spend too long inverted or your arms are shot from other workouts.  Nothing worse than passing out upside-down when no one else is home and you're too shot to get off the bar.

With two of these resistance band sets, I am now able to attach bands to my upper right and left supports for true fly type exercises.  Because I purchased 2 sets, I now have 4 handles.  This turned out to be a blessing as it allowed me to loop one set of handles around the upper supports to keep the rubber from the bands from rubbing against any bolt ends or sharper metal edges, while still leaving two handles to perform the exercises.  Additionally, because I ordered two sets, I now have two ankle straps.  This allows me to attach the bands low under my weight bench, looped over the leg restraint foam rollers, and perform normal resistance leg development without the need to purchase a whole new bench.
Otherwise this is perfect. It's small, light, durable, has a wind shield. I keep a long handled lighter inside (fit easily). No need for fancy piezo electric lighters.

It's in my Bug Out Bag/Pack. I keep it padded and safe. I haven't used it plotting destinations out on a map but I have no doubt you'll get to where you need to go if you use it this way.

6661	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this knife. Will serve as an effective tool/weapon if necessary. Knife handles well, is well made, and comes cleanly out of sheath. Carries a decent weight and handles small tasks well and with precision.

For the money, a good value, especially when compared to Ka-bar (admittedly still the gold standard IMO) good value, handles well, well made
8513	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well.

I've used Coleman stoves my entire life.  We had them when I was a kid in the 1960s too.  Nope, it's not the same quality it was then.  It's now made from cheap metal, and the folding lid that forms the case is not going to survive decades of use.  I doubt that the guts of the thing will either.  At the same time, nobody else is making an affordable stove that is any better.  So, I guess we're stuck with crappy goods to choose from.  We'll move on from there, since we don't have to beat THAT dead horse.

5895	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	If you want a mini-trampoline, I can recommend this one. It is built like a battleship, but assembly is non-trivial -- you need at least two adults (the instructions recommend three) to fight against the tension to pop everything in place. No big deal, but you are not going to put this together by yourself -- you can hurt yourself if something pops back due to the high tensions involved. The instruction book could use larger and clearer pictures. The legs screw on, and one of the legs in mine was slightly out-of-round, making for some stiff turning, but I got it on. There is an 800 number to call the manufacturer for any problems. I didn't need to call. We like this mini-trampoline.
7581	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We bough two for our 8 and 5 year old daughters.  The scooters are well built and the girls have lots of fun on them.  You might want to be sure the children wear long pants and maybe helmets knee and elbow guards until they get used to riding.  We got a few scrapes and bumps in the first few days because we didn't.
Regardless.  Yes, is inexpensive.  Yes, there are some parts on it that are not rugged.  You'll have to be careful with the little wind screens on the sides as the little tabs that hold them on would bend easily.  The whole thing is made of fairly thin stamped metal and sounds like a hollow metal box.  Because it is.  However, I'm pretty confident that if I can avoid abusing this little stove, it should work well for a long time.

9425	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I actually purchased this to suspend my canteen over a fire but quickly realized it was galvanized steel (the description also mentions stainless). It's galvanized steel which basically means it was hot dipped in zinc (and possibly lead) or electro-coated. It will help inhibit the steel from rusting but it can still rust under the right conditions just like stainless. Either way I wouldn't use it in high heat situations such as suspending water bottles for a boil. It may leach nasty stuff into your water. In a SHTF scenario who cares anyway but under normal circumstances I use a wire harness around the mouth of my canteen. Still looking around to find one in stainless steel or even plain steel. A little rust never hurt anyone. Probably would work good as a jaw spreader as well which is what I rated it for. Has some great tension.

I friend recommended trying one of these and I couldn't be happier. I don't play ultimate much anymore but I love throwing the frisbee around with my kids. The softer edge and flexibility make it easier on my fingers and doesn't hurt my kids as much when they miss catching a throw.
It is definitely quieter than the regular spring models but does not have the same bounciness. This means I feel my workout more in my calves and less in my core. As I mentioned, I've only had it for a week so it may loosen up or I'll get used to it.

There are a couple of points worth mentioning regarding Victorinox knives, and to begin with one should mention that, in Switzerland, for many years there were two companies that at one time or another were official suppliers of knives to the Swiss military - Victorinox, and Wenger. This continued from the early 20th century until 2005, when Victorinox acquired Wenger, and the separate product lines continued to be produced for a few years until they announced in 2013 that all knife products would be merged into the Victorinox brand.

BUT, the raison d'etre of a stove is .... HEATING. You cannot control the flame on this thing. No matter how precisely you adjust the flame, no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob, the flame immediately goes to high. It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob. This was okay when we wanted to boil water, but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant. This was true on both burners.

Has a decel/accel (speed tendency) feature which isn't too good.  Has a little picture of a cyclist and wheels on it spin forward or backward to show when you are acclerating or decellerating.  But it is too small, and hard to see which way the wheels are spinning.  Much better would have been an easy to see arrow pointing forward or rearward.

My only complaint with this stove, and it is universal for ALL 2 burner propane stoves is the rigid regulator line. Good I guess if you are only going to use the disposable cylinders, but lousy if you are hooking up to a 20LB tank, or have to use your stove on a narrow surface like a Coleman Pack Away camp kitchen. This is universal to all 2 burner propane stoves so I really shouldn't fuss much... Anyway, hanging the fuel bottle off in the air, or a heavy propane hose without support can bend the fuel line,and potentially cause leaks. So always make sure your fuel line or bottle are supported!

I have done a lot of comparison shopping and to get an Rawlings Official Major League baseball has always been the same price or more expensive than the ones I find online. I usually buy these baseballs just for the conveinance of having it shipped to me. I have always gotten good quality baseballs here and the product has always matched the description for me. I would recommend using amazon to buy this product.
The "shark tooth" tip is a neat design idea that gives it a VERY sharp point, there are serrated edges towards the handle that help out if you're trying to cut through something like twine or wires, it has a belt clip if you're toting it around as a utility knife but is also small enough to easily fit within your pocket.
Please "like" if you found this review useful.

843	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for physical therapy after a collarbone injury. I really like them though and hope to use it as a home gym and strengthening my shoulders which are prone to all kinds of injury. Great for the price with all the attachments and different levels of resistance, with comfortable handles and seems rugged enough after many uses. I also bought a book on resistance band exercises which has helped me to utilize this set to a fuller potential which I recommend too.

2360	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My 5 year old daughter LOVES it and over all it's high quality but the single bolt for the handle bars is an epic fail (and has been apparently for years). They move back and forth regardless of how tight the bolt is.  It's still functional but be ready to weld it or modify it somehow.
Still, 10/10. Hope the fish are enjoying it.

1567	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Really useful for my kids, both under the age of 10. They can use this in the backyard either together or alone and try a variety of maneuvers.

One of the reasons I purchased it was because Tasco offer a version in a gloss finish.  Gloss anodized scopes are almost impossible to find these days.  Admittedly, looks aren't an altogether compelling rational for purchasing an item like this, but I wanted something that would compliment the aesthetics of my Browning A-Bolt II Medallion in .257 Roberts a little better than the matte-finish Weaver 40/44 2-7X, 32mm objective unit previously mounted to it did.  That Weaver got transfered to my DPMS Oracle 5.56 carbine that I purchased back in April, leaving me once again in need of a scope for my A-Bolt II -hence this purchase.

While attempting to put together an add-on not sold by Black Mountain, it was necessary for me to price out some of the parts.  I honestly do not see how they can sell a product of this quality for the price they are asking.  I also had occasion to call their customer service and found them to be helpful way beyond my expectations.  I need it for a rotator cuff injury and it is working out perfectly.  Five stars.

9669	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I recently purchased a boat with a poling platform and quickly found to be able to haul life vests a bunch of my onboard storage was taken up by the vests. I have seen these on T tops before and thought it might work under the poling platform (which is dead space). So far it works great and does just what I wanted. It does have some extra pockets on the back side but they are hard to access since they are on the backside of the boat. Other than that I could not ask for anything better. I only haul 3 extra vests most of the time which leaves a little room to stow my jacket when it warms up.

5118	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I was researching here on Amazon for a new outside toy for my 5 year old and eventually found my way to the various pogo sticks being offered today.  They sure have changed since I was a kid.  I'd actually kind of forgotten about pogo sticks, but remembered having fun with one when I was young.  I figured this would also provide a great way to incorporate a physical exercise, work on balance, and hopefully provide something uniquely entertaining for him.  It's also a toy that he could do in the garage on raining days, which we seem to be having a lot of lately.  I decided upon this particular one because of the larger base that would help in the "training" process and I liked the fact that it could be removed later on as he became more comfortable with it.  My local toy store is currently in  Memorial Day sale mode and was offering this one at a reasonable price but it's still cheaper here on Amazon.  Because of the sale, the price difference wasn't that much and I wanted to physically see how it looked and operated before investing into something that could possibly be a "parent fail".

2187	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Optically these binoculars are OK, considering their low price. But wow do they seem flimsy. The parts that slide in and out to focus are supposed to slide both sides together, right? Well nothing is rigid, so one side can get ahead of the other by quite a bit. Both sides will get pushed in, changing the focus completely, just from holding the binoculars up against your face lightly. The little rocker thing you adjust with your fingers to change focus seems pretty cheapo and fragile. They might be OK for disposable situations, but I would not buy these binoculars again.

435	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product.  I have a rotator cuff problem in both shoulders.  So, I was looking for a set of resistance bands that would give me a mild to moderate work out.  The yellow and blue bands are perfect for my needs.  They are just the right tension.  Furthermore, changing the bands is a snap.  The grips are great, too, and the entire set can be packed in the zippered bag that is included with the purchase.  There are many band sets available.  I think I made the best choice!
There are times when we become over zealous with our pumping and cause the hose to pop out of the socket. In just a minute it can be fixed and pumping can resume. The bottom part of the base once you turn it over has a black cover that appears to be secured by six slots secured into the portion of the pump.

2179	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	After owning many cheap pairs $20 binoculars over the years I was looking for something a little better that wasn't going to set me back $200.

The clarity and build quality is superb considering they are only about $10 more than the inferior stuff I have owned over the years.
2832	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This ball is great.  Made of a much heavier plastic than the previous one I purchased.  Keeps air in it much longer also.  I would recommend this ball.  It was a little harder to blow up in the beginning, but I think it was because the heavier plastic was so crunched in the package...
PS--if you get a Swiss Army Knife 74mm with advertising, and the advertising is on the side of the blades, reverse the tools if you've removed them from cleaning and are used to the tweezers being on the cross side.  The advertising SAKs often have the scales reversed, with the cross on the wrong side.

8716	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	After a hospital stay my 92 year old mother needed balance and endurance therapy.  The balance beam although hard work for her, has helped a lot.  This is worthwhile, I made it a rule she had to use it everyday.  I set it up in the hallway and she walked sideways down and back, then rested and walked toe to heel down and back and then rested.  Every week she improved, after 6 to 8 weeks she could do the whole routine and only needed to rest at the end of it and was walking around the house with her cane.  There were other exercises we did everyday, but I felt this made the most difference.

I have been using this style for at least 10 years, my first pair wore out because I left it out in sun too much. My 2nd pair I'd had for over a year but I lost them. On to my 3rd pair and I love them. The other speedo styles don't work for me, they leaked water and just had no suction. These really wrap around well & are the only style that works for me!

Now I'm seeing tears in the black band and one tear in the new red band already.  As far as I know I'm not using them inappropriately but I may have to go ahead and return the whole set.
9727	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This product solves a real problem for RV owners. Most RV's, like mine, get black marks from the weatherstripping that lines slide rooms.

7797	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I first got this mask last summer when i was working as a rough neck on an oil rig, with it on you cant smell anything. When i left i kept it and used it for restoring a 19 foot rowing scull i was doing allot of fiberglass and painting. Ive worn it nearly all day straight allot, its comfortable and i would only replace the filters when it became difficult to breath. The higher the humidity you are around the shorter amount of time the filters will last. overall definitely worth the $$
8340	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The scope is a very good buy for the money. With good bore sighting, there is no need to mount something more expensive than this on a .22 rimfire rifle. Nice optics. And windage and elevation are actually not that hard to adjust. The only problem I see with the scope is that the clamp of the rings that go with it is too narrow; while it mounts on the narrow/dovetail rail of a 10-22, it does not mount on a weaver rail, which has a wider width. So, if one plans to use this scope on a rifle with a weaver rail (like the 597 VTR), make sure that the separate cost of buying scope rings (about ten bucks) that are compatible with a weaver rail is taken into account in the purchase.

This knife is exactly what I wanted. While this is the most expensive SAK (Swiss Army Knife) I've ever bought, the quality is well in line with their other products.

I know it states one size fits all. Myself, I am 5'8, these bands are perfect. If you are shorter and have slack, you are able to adjust. If you are a taller male, you might have some issues preforming the exercises to their full extend since they will not stretch the distance you need them to.

522	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these looking for an alternative to free weights and weight machines altogether.  As a retired and disabled veteran, my body aches at the thought of weightlifting.  So I decided to go with resistance conditioning for the purpose of general overall health maintenance and conditioning.  This kit is the perfect beginners kit, plus as your strength and balance improves, additional band(s) can be purchased with varying weight resistances.  I love the fact that it's portable and can be taken along with you on vacations, weekend getaways, etc.  The resistance bands have a life time warranty, and from what I've read, hassle free.  Pricing, lifetime warranty, convenience and practicality; this is a no brainer, especially for those like me who have physical disabilities and limitations, (physical therapy); and for those without such limitations and just want a blast of a work out, this is the way to go.  As with any exercise equipment or the starting of a new workout routine, always consult with your physician and not your neighbor or best bud!!!!

The Airzone 48" does not come pre-assembled.  While that was a pro for the basic 36" model, some things are worth a little extra effort.  The Airzone came in 4 major pieces which connect together to form the trampoline surface and frame, a couple of bolt/nut combos and a tightening device, and then you add the safety guard and legs.  Instructions called for 3 adults to assemble.  I put it together by myself (using a little logic and my entire body) and had my 12 year old daughter add the bolts while I held the frame in place.

2921	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I understand that there's not much to this particular item, but if Amazon is going to offer several different colors (and charge a different price for each), the least they can do is provide the color that you order.  The package I received has two red wheels in packaging that says 'clear'.  And while I don't really care what color they are, I'm sure my 9-year-old will.  So don't pay extra for a specific color because you might not get what you pay for.
A youth-sized soccer ball, this is smaller than an "adult" one, but not by much.  Perfect for young kids - or little kids - it looks and feels like a "real" soccer ball (because it IS!).
If you're considering this 'wrist computer' (Suunto's term and fairly appropriate) for a 'techno' toy though, save your money.  Typical of Suunto's products, it has stellar thinking behind it.  Typical also it is cutting edge.  However, also typical of products built and produced in Finland, it has an owner's manual that has to be about a 5 to 10 on the readability scale of a 100.  Like all Scandinavian products, there is a concerted effort here to use icons whenever possible and it's like you walked into a Russian made helicopter; there may be icons, but you're still going to have to have someone explain it to you!  But, like Suunto's diving gauges, one you cross the divide and spend some quality time with the manual, user reviews, internet postings and about 6 to 10 hours playing with it, you WILL have a grin on your face.  It's an outstanding piece of technology, but only once you finally understand it.
The company that makes these bands appears pretty solid.  In the package I received, there was a coupon for a free extra orange band which was even a heavier gauge than the black band.  I'm looking forward to receiving it, and I think the company offering it at no charge was a very nice touch.
Using the product before bed I find I get to sleep easier, and typically wake up more rested. Combining it with some soft tissue work on my abs, obliques and spinal erectors really makes for a great night of sleep. I have also found that alternating between hanging by the boots and hanging from a pull-up position gives me the best results.
8799	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great resistance band! Better price than what I found locally. It's held up great so far. I use it primarily for stretching, and occassionally for some arm resistance exercises. Pretty much the possibilities are endless for bands workouts, so if that's what you are looking to do, you'll have good luck with this. Keep in mind that each person might have different resistance needs based on the exercise you are doing, so you might want to buy a couple of these in different resistance levels. Personally, I'm happy with the medium, but if I wanted to take my fitness to the next level, I would get some different types. If you think you might want to do that in the future, you would be better off economically just buying one of the value packs that includes different resistance levels right from the start. That way, you don't have to buy more in the future. Spend now, save later philosophy.

I own a set of medium (red), heavy (blue), and very heavy (purple) and these replaced all my dumbbells. If you need more resistance, just loop/wrap/lengthen the band and the resistance is increased.

Perfect for family get togethers or tournament play without the price Tag.

I did have a problem with the balls that are sewn into the anchor end breaking. Having used other setups with an anchor strap I am not sure why this one had a bit of a malfunction.

Being used to foam earplugs, they felt & sounded a lot different. I could have gotten used to all the shortcomings if they fit better, meaning, when I mounted my shotgun they would hit on the stock. It was very distracting, even if I could have adjusted the fit or my mount slightly, it was too distracting to be worth dealing with. I didn't even shoot a full line, maybe 1 or 2 posts, max and took them off & sent them back. Thank goodness Amazon has an excellent return policy!

3889	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  Between her heavy use, and sharing with other kids in the neighborhood, these skates have been almost in non-stop use since Christmas morning and seem no worse for the wear.  I did see the wife using some elbow grease to remove some scuff marks from the uppers, but this strikes me more as normal wear and tear than anything else.  Very pleased with these skates so far!
I have just had them for a short period of time, but look forward to using them alot.

4169	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The quality is good.  Having used it now I'm not sure its the best kind of lock in terms of safety.  Sort of a one size fits all.  No matter how tight you make it you can still force it to move and possibly engage the trigger.  Obviously if a child were messing with it and it happened to be loaded that would be a bad thing and basically negate the purpose of the lock.  Go with a cable lock you can loop through the chamber.

3539	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to use playing Kan Jam with my daughters. The regulation disc that came with the game hurt their hands (and mine) when trying to slam the disc into the Kan. Anyway, this is softer and easy to grip and throw. It weighs enough to cut through a breeze. The only negative (for my use) is that it is slightly smaller than a regulation disc. I don't really care, but I do find it odd that they have this one that is smaller than regulation and another size that is larger than regulation. Nothing that is regulation disc size.

Combo Tool: Earlier versions omitted this tool, making those versions of the MiniChamp a layer thinner.  I avoided those, as I wanted the combo tool!  This combines a bottle opener, wire stripper, and small Phillips into one.  I use the Phillips more than anything, and it works fine.

The ease of setting up and hooking up the fuel canister.  Wish i would have purchased the stove with Auto Light feature.  Besides using for camping,  makes a great emergency stove.
The boomerang was packed in a small box (from Amazon) and one of the tips was bent and since is rubber it took a while to straight it up. At the beginning the boomerang sometimes did U-turns, landing several feet to my left hand side, other times it just hit the ground flying in a straight line. My wife was laughing and telling me to return it. I didn't want to give up and I took it to the park the next day and I saw a guy with several boomerangs (not Aerobie boomerangs). I asked him if he can figure how to make the Aerobie boomerang flying back. After throwing it a few times the boomerang did the same, U-turns only. Then he took a look at it and bent the front part (thin part) of the tips up, threw it in a "2 o'clock" position and in the first try, the boomerang came back to his hands. I did the same thing and after a few throws it came back to my hands.
Longevity...there are two rubber rings on an Aerobie with plastic between.  After a couple summers of play...the Aerobie rubber will slowly begin to harden.  You'll still be able to throw it...but its float will wane.

5979	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	GREAT LOCK. NEVER WORRIED WITH THIS LOCK
The Spalding NBA Tack Soft (29.5 Official Size) Basketball has a nice grip out of the packaging. The question is: "How long will the tack last?" My guess is long enough. And my guess is that depending on how much you play with it--through all of the sweat and wear--the tack may seem to wear off after time which is normal. So if you want that brand new tacky feel every time you play, you're simply gonna need to buy a new ball a few times a year. And that makes sense. After all, the pros use a brand new basketball at the start of every game for a reason.

6302	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I have to say I was shocked at how bad this whistle is. I mean, how could it be worse than the $1.50 one at the toy store? It says it is "pealess", which I think means it has no ball in it and so doesn't have the familiar trilling sound of a referee's whistle. That is fine--I just wanted a loud whistle for emergency use. As the other reviewer said, this is high pitched but not loud, and you have to blow really hard to even get a decent sound out of it. Highly unrecommended.
4098	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I own 3 .22LR rifles I bring to the range regularly, and this set of locks makes securing them for transport so much easier! No more fumbling with different keys. Great quality, fit snug, once properly cinched down there is no play in them. Fair price too.

6709	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love love love this knife. Comes razor sharp out of the box. You can shave with it (trust me, I tried and did.). Very sturdy, full tang, and has a nice nylon sheath with a small, zippo lighter sized pouch with velcro closure. I use it to hold a tinder bundle and magnesium strip. A big plus to this knife is the MOLLE compatibility. Easy to attach to any MOLLE backpack, vest, battle belt, etc. it is also ingeniously designed to be used as a belt strap without being wobbly like other sheaths. The knife itself is very tough, as I put my collection through the elements and abuse. This knife has held up great and is easy to sharpen with the proper sharpener and skills. The blade stays razor sharp for a long time, and will easily cut through most anything. For the price, this is an unbeatable knife for any Bug out bag or survival/emergency kit.

Packaging was my concern for this as I looked over the box and seen that it had been possibly lightly folded but seen no damages. I bought a Docooler Full Metal 9+1BB Ball Bearings Right Hand Drum Wheel Boat Sea Fishing Reel Horizontal XW-40 and the colors match perfectly. I may even order a heavy rod in the near future. The price is pretty good but I will put to the test here soon to measure how it stands against the fishing game. I average out 14 to 25 pounders on the river so I definitely update of any cons.
Still have the knife.  Still like it.  Another reviewer said this knife was double bladed (I assume that means "sharp on both sides") but it's not.  You might think it was from looking at the picture, but mine, which I ordered from this page a few years ago, is only sharp on the bottom, with the exception of the "shark tooth" tip, which is sharp on both sides, but only for a distance of like 1/8" or so (the very sharp tip is great for getting started on those highly annoying, nearly invulnerable hard plastic packages everything comes in these days).

First, the left. I'm left handed. I tried throwing at the angle described on the package. I can only get it to attempt to come back to me if I throws it at just the right angle in the wind. Most of the time, it just takes a nose dive about the time it started to turn back. The only way I could come close to getting it work left handed was to angle my spine as far as possible to the right and throw with the boomerang at the 30 degree angle to my spine. Not comfortable at all and not easy.

Why the four stars if I've had to replace them?  Because the bands work!  ... and they're a great value.  Free weights typically cost about a buck a pound.  So if you're capable of lifting large amounts, a suitable set of weights can set you back a fortune.  I'll continue to use (and order more) of these bands as I wear them out in the future.

9228	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I hope this review helps you in your shopping. I always depend on them before I buy. I bought these to use in a float tube for fishing. They were larger than I expected, but I decided to give them a try. I am 65 and my little bird legs balked at them at first. But they turned out to be great. I can wear them over stocking foot waders or small tennis shoes. And these things really propel. I had my wife take me a mile up a river and let me out. I had to kick my way for that mile and then another half mile against a quartering wind to get back to our campsite. I have a bad knee and was truly worried about how I would feel the next day. I can't really describe the excitement I felt that next morning. My calves were a little sore from not getting much exercise. And I could feel tightness in my thighs. And best of all, I could feel some tightness in my abs. You may not like the sound of all that, but it was heaven to me. I am a doctor and don't get much exercise. I can't jog because of my knee. These did not stress my knee at all. I have found a way to exercise calves, thighs and abs while having the fun of paddling around the lake and fishing. A great product.
3044	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Do not use during winter, it gets COLD. Summer only for this guy. It is somewhat comfy, but a pain to blow up, and a bigger pain to deflate. It has no deflate valve, just one of those standard pool toy nipples that you have to squeeze the whole time to deflate. In fact, you may just want to use this a pool/lake toy, and something else for the mattress.
The best part is the kids love these. They can go fast with minimal effort. The learning curve for a 5 year old is about 10 to 15 minutes to be able to ride. In addition, we see young teens still riding them at the local skate park doing tricks. So not only does the product last but so does the fun.

 If you are looking for a full body workout which will push you to the max I highly recommend this. I don't think I would recommend this as a first video for a brand new beginner because I think that it's too intense, but if you buy Bryan Kests "Original Power Yoga Set" you should in time be able to work up to this one by using the other programs first.

We have been having competitions as a family and it is a lot of fun since we are all at about the same level.  I would recommend getting some upgraded darts but the darts that come with it are adequate to get you started.

Even though I wasn't using it that often on the other stove, I kept it seasoned so I didn't have any problems with sticking.  So far in addition to the chicken, I have cooked scrambled eggs, hash browns, and French toast without anything sticking.
1780	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	These are not nearly as heavy weight as I wanted. It didn't take too many practices to show significant use by 9-10 year old kids.

Our son has ADHD and as he is almost 9, we have to keep getting bigger mini tramps to help him work out the wiggles. I love this style, as there are no springs, so nothing to rust or get feet stuck in. And bigger kids are strong so the  "spring" is just enough to get some air but not too much to get launched! I also use one in my classroom for my "special" friends who have the wiggles too.  Our older model has been being used for 4 years and has zero damage. It looks brand new.

4835	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I got this for a summer 3 week vacation at the beach.  It is huge which I like, so I can put 2 people and a cooler on it.  I also set it under a pop up tent and it worked great.  My only complaint is that after just 3 weeks, it is stretching and tearing a little at the seams.  I was hoping to use this for many seasons.  I like that it folds right back up easily and has carrying handles.  Was very convenient to carry.

The biggest surprise was the Fox 40 Sharx, which was among the quietest of the bunch. And here is the irony. Up close, the Sharx was, by far, the most ear-piercing, even more than the Storm.

But after only 9 months, the rubber that seals the goggles against the eyes is cracking and brittle.  I din't expect them to last forever but less than a year is still disappointing.  They have been used fairly heavily I would say.  END OF UPDATE.  Sometimes I hesitate to buy something because it seems too cheap.  These aren't going to last forever but what they do well is keep water out of your eyes and they have flat lenses so your view isn't distorted like with some goggles.  We'll see how long they last.

I called Radio Flyer--they weren't much help for this problem and we eventually got rid of the scooter in a garage sale. We also had a choking hazard problem with Radio Flyer's push wagon -- several screws came off and I would find them and the washers strewn about the house.

Even when shooting full-power 117 grain bullet handloads out of a rifle weighing 6.25 pounds bare, the .257 Roberts only has a flea-bite's worth of recoil and probably isn't the "test bed" for optics durability that a .30-'06 or virtually any belted magnum would be, enduring 400 rounds of .257 Roberts likely doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things.  Sitll, I reckon that if it was going break, it would have done so by now.

With this release, I am unencumbered.  It does take a bit to get used to and you will need to readjust EVERYTHING if you previously shot with a trigger release.  The angle will be different and you will need to move your peep hole and sight.
8237	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is really a quality compass and very easy to use. I like the fact it has a magnetic declination adjustment you can dial in too. It also has an inclinometer, but I confess I have yet to use it for measuring anything. The fact it has a mirror is a big plus as it can also be used as a signal device or checking your face or eyes for injury should you have an accident. The dial and etchings are large enough to read easily and checked against my other compasses, this one seems to be one hundred percent accurate. As with all things, practice with it and you will soon be able to navigate with the best of them!

2959	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	After quite a bit of research I decided to buy this range finder to use on the golf course.  The range finder works well and I have used to help spot targets up to 270 yds.  It has proven difficult to get an accurate read on long distances by focusing on the flagstick.  When this happens I try to use another player on the green or a nearby sand trap to get a rough estimate of the yardage.  As a result, you may find it difficult to extract the exact yardage every time, but I have found that I have been able to get a reading that is close enough.
225	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises, such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work.

7589	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this skooter for my 7yr old Grandson, who needs it for physical therapy (improving his balance).  I liked that the skooter comes fully assembled (quite novel these days).  I was told that Razor builds a well constructed product, and I found that to be the case. The only complaint is a minor one.  The adjustment lever for raising/lowering the height of the handles is too tight for a small child to operate.  Perhaps it will loosen up with time. As will all my Amazon purchases, I was happy with the entire transaction, especially delivery.

It is easy to maneuver and is comfortable for him to sit on.  I didn't put on the handlebar streamers.  The only problem I had with this trike is that the shaft that holds the steering mechanism broke after about 7 months.  I tried to jb weld it back, but didn't hold.  Finally I emailed radio flyer and ordered a new shaft for $7.  Well worth it.  I like the wood, it makes it look classic.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the broken shaft.  He doesn't abuse the trike or throw it around

1610	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I own at least a dozen of the lodge cookware pieces and love them very much but this is not such a great thing. I went through the normal in the oven seasoning that always works just great but this thing warped like a potato chip! It did flatten back out as it cooled but everytime I put it on my two burners to use, it warps again making it very rocky on the stove top and my pancakes looked like Picasso made them. It always flattens back out but it's really a pain in the ah hum to use. The grill side set off all the smoke detectors and left a greasey film on everything in my whole house and I was only using a med low burner, well, at least the door stopped squeeking! It is also a bit to narrow for two rows of pancakes unless you make them very small and the center doesn't get hot enough. Just when you thought you've experienced all the unpleasantness of this pan, you then go to clean it and discover you'd be better off just throwing it out in the yard for the dogs to lick clean! I love you Lodge, I really do but I'll stick to outside grilling and my larger lodge skillet for hotcakes, the 13 inch round pan is a dream as are all the other pieces I own. As for this heavy sticky thing well, I may try it out on my fire ring next cookout and if that doesn't work out, it's yard sale time!

The spigot is easy to push and automatically shuts off when its released. It enables one-handed operation: use your fingers to grip the cup and your thumb to push the spigot, important when hands are greasy or otherwise occupied. The spigot does not leak or drip. The design is sort of a compromise. Because it is positioned low on the unit, you do have to place the cooler on the edge of a table or other elevated surface so you can get a cup under it. It's recessed into the unit so as not to get broken off when storing or transporting. The handles make it easy for two people to carry it when it is filled and heavy, or one strong person to lift and move. The cooler is double-walled for insulation, and the inside is easy to sponge out when the festivities are over.

I got the matmans since they are soft on people that don't have any ear protectors on, but these aren't too bad, i could see in a really hard clash but if that is happening a lot then either people don't know how to roll and are getting agro or somebody needs to chill a bit.
Bottom line - very good. I'd buy again.

On the other hand, properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost.  The white gas can be stored for years before using.  Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots.  I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones.  It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out!  I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous, tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect.

The handles are comfortable and although I am not primarily using them attached to a door with the door attachment, it does work and stays put.
6884	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	In my opinion, it's better than nothing but not by much. There are weak points where the plastic is clearly thinner than in other areas, the spigot doesn't flow much and it's a pain to fill by yourself. Picture filling a 5 gallon garbage bag with water through an offset 2 inch opening with one hand and that's a pretty good description of how it works. Similarly, it sits on whatever surface you intend to put it on like a water-filled garbage bag. Honestly, if you're looking for something like this, spend a few extra dollars and get one that has a rigid body rather than this flaccid sack of aggravation.

Big burners let me use two big pans at the same time and have control over the heat so things don't burn.  Starts right up whether it's hot, cold or raining.  Perfect stove to take camping--it's very dependable.

The description says "2-person inflatable boat set" - yes, it is possible to fit two adults. My 115 lb self and my 145 lb boyfriend managed to fit relatively comfortably together (just note that "comfortable" means legs intertwined a bit more intimately than the description may suggest). We did not sink!  ...that said, it's probably best for one adult. Also, don't expect to win any races with this beauty, but we had a blast paddling around in circles.
But for the money I didn't have to get in the cold water. Fun for kid's yes, 2 adults no way.
The box also lists two games for kids to play, consisting of tight rope bop and one foot sock for alternative ideas. My two children are enjoying this freestyle play, plus my older son likes to take breaks from doing homework and can take out his frustrations in a fun and appealing manner.

As far as scooters go this is the standard by which all are judged. Sturdy and even (though definitely not advised) an adult could ride it they are so ruggedly made. They are rated to 143 lbs. Set up is easy as they fold like a jack knife. Just unfold it, telescope the handle to the right height, and lock it all down and you are ready to go. Elapsed time under a minute. To store just reverse the procedure. It took longer to get it out of the box than it does to "assemble".

The SPRI ES503R Xertube definetely comes in handy in matters of storage and travel.  I work out everyday, alternating cardio and weights.  I mostly use the Xertube for arms and shoulders; it gives you a wide range of resistance, from hard to I can barely do any bicep curls.  The resistance on it is very high, unless you are really strong, you won't be able to do shoulders presses with it.  The material is very thick and durable.  The handles are made out of plastic, really hard plastic.  I recommed the Xertube if you're looking for a resistance range and don't want to spend the money on different sets of dumbells; or if you're deployed like I am and don't have the appropriate work out equipment.

The sheath is not too shabby either.  One thing I really like is that it came with an order form where you can purchase other sheath designs for this knife.  NICE!!!
These wheels worked great and come with their own bearings (so you do not have to reuse the old bearings).  I believe the bearings are rated ABEC 5 (though I cannot be 100% certain).  ABEC 5 are what are found on most skateboards and scooters in the US.  Some models from China are rated ABEC 3 which are to be avoided.  These wheels roll about the same as the original razor wheels, which is why I'm inclined to believe they are ABEC 5.  Overall, I am very satisfied with these new wheels.

So I'm giving the Suunto four stars; was considering three for the STEEP learning curve, but after I finally 'got it' I was grinning like a Cheshire cat.  It is really a fun instrument to play with and truly does offer features in a unique package.  Highly recommended, but don't buy it if you aren't willing to spend the time learning its nuances.  One last note and one that helped me the most.  I was frustrated with Suunto's labels of the buttons and finally adopted Casio's system that I kludged together.  This watch has 4 buttons.  De-program yourself from thinking of them in Suunto's terms.  Use Casio's EXCELLENT system of calling the buttons A,B,C and D.  Just make a little cheat sheat that corresponds to A,B,C and D. A is top left, B is top right, C is bottom left and D is bottom right.  Once you convert Suunto's system to Casio's, it is SO much easier!  Hope this helps someone!

4545	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Having a Coleman propane stove and camping is basically the perfect combination. We use this stove for pretty much everything that can't be easily cooked over the fire. Or, when we're too lazy we do our cooking on here too. The wind guard is useful for keeping away the breeze and it's small footprint allows us to pack with ease and use almost anywhere. I do wish the knobs offered better control of the flame. You basically have off or 'pretty much full blast'. I seem to remember the one we had during my childhood having more control, but it's not the end of the world. It does seem to go through the propane fairly quickly though, so we always make sure to bring a spare since we'll undoubtedly need it.
I would have given a 5 star review if the unit was a little smaller and lighter, but overall I can't complain.  I tested up to about 350 ft with incredible clarity.

The bands are "weighted" by color and the booklet has their listed weight estimates. The weight of the resistance can change dramatically depending on how far you stretch it. Example: overhead press puts much more "weight" into the band than say a curl might. This gives a similar effect to squatting with a chain. The intensity increases further into the movement.
6878	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Just ok.  Very heavy, spigot doesn't work well and rolls around.  Love Coleman and the idea it folds up but this isn't a good design.  I'll use one more time then use a recycled dish detergent jug for washing up at the campsite.

BUT, as other reviews state, the temperature control on this model is horrible.  There is very little flow regulation, so the options are either low (hot), or high (re-entry hot), and the adjustment between the two temps is (for my grill) about a 5 degree difference in turn.  Your steaks will be raw on the inside and scorched on the outside.

Not the best choice in cold weather if you are backpacking because there is no insulation.  However I have slept on it in 30+ degree weather with a warm sleeping bag and I was fairly comfortable.  When car camping,  this is not an issue at all.  Just shove this thing inside a spare sleeping bag or wrap a blanket around it and it will keep you plenty warm.

I really like this set of resistance bands because they are very versatile and easy to change the amount of resistance you want. The handles are padded and offer a lot of comfort. Not only can you use the bands singularly but you can also add as many bands as you want to increase the resistance. It also comes with at door anchor so you can do pulling exercises and an ankle strap so you can do leg exercises. Comes with a carry bag so you can take your workout with you. Highly recommend.
First impression WOW very compact and super sturdy...instructions were a bit iffy on the battery needed. they could specify its needs AAA battery but other than that its great. Tested it out real fast in the garage banging a hammer against metal and it was great. Tested speech which had no problems at all. Highly would recommend this to anyone.

3684	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	So far, I haven't had some of the the problems with failure to charge (or to hold a charge) that other users describe.  I charged it for 10 hours, and on our first off-grid reunion, the pump inflated four queen-size air mattresses and a 9-ft vinyl raft...after that, it was out of juice.  I thought that was less-than-stellar battery performance...but it was reasonable...sort of.  That being said, I have a bunch of other issues with this item:
6189	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The mounting bracket that comes with this lock is based on tubing no bigger than a seat post. Most modern bikes that use alloys for the frame have very large diameter tubes. This bracket will not mount on those tube.  The only option is to place it on your seat post.  In my case the post is not extended out enough to accommodate the bracket and lock.  For me there are no options to carry the lock on the mountain bike I have.  The lock more than likely would work on securing the bike, with without a way to carry  it on the bike, it doesn't do much good.

1167	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set to allow me to do strength training when I travel.  I had previously purchased another name brand set of resistance bands, but they had plastic D rings that would slip under strain.  The metal D rings and O rings on this set is a much improved upgrade for me.  The door holder and foot strap completes the accessories.  The set is easy to use and the bands are strong enough to meet the workout needs.  This is a high quality set or resistance bands.  The only negatives would be the work-out instructions are weak.  I downloaded a more comprehensive work-out guide for resistance bands that have better diagrams and more exercises.  Also, using multiple bands can be tricky.  It would be nice if there was a sleeve that would gather the bands when using three or more for safety and ease of use.  Overall, the quality for the price is outstanding.  I would recommend these to anyone who would like a good quality set of resistance bands.
Even without ice, the cooler stayed pretty darn cold, and even about an hour and a half later, our drinks were still pretty cool and pleasant to drink. I'm assuming that they'll be even better when I order the right thing next time and we have ice packs in there.

As much fun as it was it was definitely a challenge to use.  I have never used something like this, I kept turning side ways instead of going forward.  I think the problem would lie in that I did not put enough air.  Also it seems like I kind of have to be laying down to use this.  In other words this takes some getting used to.

They still tilt when hit several times by the horseshoe, but that seems to be a set up error by us.  The shoes themselves are exactly like the description provided on Amazon.  This has been a great addition to our backyard and is still in excellent condition after a lot of use.  The set is well worth the price.  I would definitely purchase again.

Seem durable to last a while. Not light enough to backpack with but will fit in a two person tent.
Get the right angle clamp (or more than one if you plan on doing a lot of boxes or carcasses).  There is no adequate substitute and it works superbly.
8431	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Cheap, low quality CHICOM scope with even cheaper ring mounts. Seriously just save your money and get something better. If you want a decent quality rimfire scope for under $100, a Nikon is a good place to start.

TIP: My valve was barely letting any air through and it was taking forever to inflate by mouth. I figured there had to be something wrong, so I stuck the end of my small pocket knife (anything thin and durable will do) into the valve slot to bend the plastic fold back. Once it was folded back significantly, I then pinched it, removed the knife end, and inflated the entire thing in about 3 minutes by mouth.

599	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these bands in my work out routine and have been very happy with them. There are five bands of varying resistance. Each band has a pretty quality carabiner at each end, which I really like. I bought a set of Perfects at Wal-mart and they only came with three bands and no metal whatsoever (and only lasted a few months before snapping). This set is already more impressive. I have actually started using the old handles from the broken set with the extra bands that came with this B.M.P set. Using resistance bands for the first time can be a little odd, but once you build a routine with them they actually become a strong asset to your work-outs.

2916	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for the kid and they seem to work better than the original. Easy to install and should last longer than the original ones.
I find it seems to do some time averaging of the speed readout which takes 3 seconds to fully even out.  Don't know if others similar products work that way, but really this doesn't interfere with the use of the product and is only the result of having a sensor that pulses once per wheel revolution.  It also doesn't read below about 2.4 mph which of course is slow enough you are barely able to stay upright anyway.

8213	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great compass.
For cooking, it lights easily and is not complicated.  None of that scary stuff with the tank & pumping it up to pressurize it like the original white gas Coleman stoves.  I use the gas cylinder for both this and a Pizzaque pizza oven, and it has not run out of gas and needed refilled after 2 months of frequent use, so it seems to be reasonably efficient with fuel.
It includes a red string (for hanging I assume).

Try Shiva Rea's DVD. It is much better. Check my other yoga reviews on amazon for more.
6198	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I bought 2 of this for my grandparents as an upgrade to the ones they had from China. I chose this because it had a good price and a decent rating. But after receiving the product, the sensors turned out to be even less accurate than the old ones. I might have just have received defective units so I just simply returned the items with no hassle. Besides the sensors, the device looked nice and the usage was pretty intuitive. My grandparents would have totally liked the device is the main sensor actually worked.
3045	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Not for extreme cold. Not for extreme light weight backpacking.
This little mattress is perfectly sized and would be perfect for most adults. It's a middle ground between a camping pad and an air mattress. Set side by side, I was able to fit both mats in the tent without trouble. It does take some time, but we were able to blow them up using good ole fashioned lung power. I'd say it took 4-5 minutes each, including necessary breaks. But a foot pump will go with us next time.
5456	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect seal. Fits nicely. No leaks. Can dive, flip turn, etc. without any water getting in. Feels gentle on my face too. Good buy.
1665	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I should probably give the net five stars considering how many years it's been in the yard and how much abuse it has taken, but after a couple of years, I think loosing one star for having to put on two dozen zip ties to keep the net together is fair. It's started to sag a little in the middle, but I'm pretty sure that is due to my kids abusing it. To build something the kids couldn't break, you'd have to use tube steel and the thing would weigh 400 pounds and then you would have to anchor it in concrete so it wouldn't fall over and kill anyone. I'm thinking this was probably a better choice. Really it's done much better than I expected and it keeps the ball from sailing over into the neighbors yard and/or down the hill. I'm calling it a win.
7609	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this water bottle! I have been searching for one like it for some time. I like my water to be really cold. Unfortunately, I don't have a big enough fridge at work to keep a large bottle in. I have a Tervis and a Camelbak bottle, and love them both, but my ice is melted in them by lunchtime. I filled this thing with ice, and it lasted all day. There was ice in the bottle after I finished my last serving before bed, and the ice still wasn't completely melted by the next morning. I also had it fall off a 6 foot + high file cabinet onto a tile floor. Small Nick in the lid. That's it. I have already recommended this to friends and family, who will also be investing in one for themselves.
7209	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Its still not broken ! 3 very active boys. Ages 3-8. Each has their own scooter, but they share if there is only 1 available in the car, so it hold up pretty well until now.

First Impression: The material that the bands as well as the attachments is made to last. So far I have not found a single area where poor decisions were made on design or implementation. I have been using this product 3-4x a week for the past few months in parallel to a normal weight lifting routine. I have found that in doing so, my overall strength has increased as well as the rehab on my elbow and shoulder complete. Since starting to use this product, I have purchased a second one to keep in my office at work for days where I am unable to get out or when my elbow/shoulder are feeling blah.

7352	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My child rides this daily and I secretly take it for a spin while she's at school, you know, for the mail. It's fun, folds nicely and glides smoothly. So much fun to zip all over the neighborhood with. And the price really cannot be beat.
4. A rope for the front loop.
3. Declination/clinometer - The red numbers for the Suunto are printed so that they can be read from the back of the compass.  This is good because the declination adjustment screw is on the reverse (and works nicely).  Also, when using the clinometer, and finding an angle with the mirror as you are supposed to, the numbers are readable in the mirror.  Brilliant!  To be fair, the Silva is also printed on the reverse, just with black numbers, which are also easy to read.  Also, the declination indicator pointer on the Suunto is very thin, and thus easier to set accurately, much more so than the wide black indicator on black hash marks on the Silva Ranger.  To set the declination on the K&R, you turn the inner part of the compass face.  This seems simple and great, until you realize that now the bearing pointer at the top of the compass no longer lines up with the numbers on the inner ring of the bezel ring, and the inner ring has no numbers.  It can be very confusing getting the correct bearing because of this.  I can imagine if I was tired, I would easily get the wrong bearing.

6660	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Good knife if you get the correct serial number.  Some are made with aus 6 steel and some are aus 8 from what several knife forums say.  I got one that supposedly has aus 6 but it says 8 on the package, I can't remember what the blade says.  The packaging was torn and cracked(not something that happened in shipping). The tip  cover was rattling around in the box also. I wouldn't have minded if it was for me but it was for my dad for Christmas so that kind of lessened the excitement for me.  He likes the k if though so I guess mission accomplished.
2. I have some concern about the oar locks ripping from the rest of the boat.  But so far they've held well.

before I bought a second one. I like the tack soft grip of this ball but if you play outdoors on dusty courts it can get a little slippery but understandable. But the Soft touch is great and feels like the expensive indoor game balls. It does its job so far Im very satisfied
5143	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My twin 7 year old hyperactive boys love this thing - they have spent countless hours in the last few weeks hopping on it. We have only used it with the larger base but they are getting good enough at it that I think I might be trying to remove it in the next few weeks. The amount of energy my boys can burn on this is awesome. It seems very sturdy and it has not had any problems putting up with the abuse doled out to it.
6132	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Received this camp stove today and was very disappointed. There is a dent in the front that does not allow the tank to be properly connected to the stove.

They used to share a queen sized air mattress, but they would always fight with the other about "hogging all the room on the bed" lol. That old queen mattress finally sprung a leak, so I decided to try these out. They are not very wide, but the length was perfect for the kids. They used them this past week, and said they were pretty comfy for air mattresses. I wouldn't think an adult would be very comfortable sleeping on these, as they are small... smaller than a twin-sized mattress. The width is too narrow for an adult, and when I lied down on one of them, my ankles and feet hung over the end. (I am 5'8".) They are a decent thickness and were not difficult to blow up by mouth... plus, the price was nice! I would buy these again:)

My favorite thing has to be catching this ring with my head around my neck. I can casually throw it +50 yards to a friend and catch it no problem. It is also pretty durable. I was throwing it around the dogs and two of them ended up picking it up at the same time and pulling it. After 2 minutes of tug o war, I pulled it away from them and there was no damage at all.

4439	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I think this is the best stove you can get for the price...having said that, it would be nice to have it's own lighter but I keep one under the grill so that's no problem. The biggest complaint about this stove is the controls are really tricky in that they don't stay where you adjust them...they spring back a little bit so it's hard to control the flame. When you are using a typical camp cookware set (they aren't very thick because of weight savings) you really need to be able to fine tune the flame and this makes it difficult.

8303	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	If you've got a bunch of kids that ride and you go on adventures, you need the biggest bike rack you can find.  For us, this is a winner; not just because it holds 5 bikes, but because it holds them securely.  But man is it heavy (even with no bikes).  And those kids--well they keep growing, which means different bikes--and you've got to loosen all the bolts again and play with the angles, and make sure everybody knows what order their bike goes in.  Even once you've got it perfectly adjusted, loading 5 bikes takes precise, time-consuming loading.  But it is well-made.  Because I've found nothing better that holds 5 very different bikes, I'm giving 4 stars.  One star lost because there's got to be an easier to change the angles of the brackets, and the last locking plastic nut is a pain--very hard to get the lock to engage as you tighten.

Comfort is also just as good as any of the other over the ear protectors that I've tried.

Wanting to add an additional layer of protection, I bought this pack with the intention of fitting them to rifle trigger guards.  I think the biggest problem is the "one size fits all philosophy", which clearly doesn't work on something that has to fit perfectly to work.

For this reason, I prefer to use a regular frisbee since I don't have that much space in the street or yard.

This product allows me to do all of my ab exercises and overall is very comfortable. I even had a friend sleep on it one night. The product folds up nicely and easy to put down. It is not that wide, so I would only really use it for personal exercise.
This is a GREAT goal for shooting practice, you get a solid rebound when you hit the goal, and it's banked so it rebounds MUCH BETTER than a 90-degree vertical goal.  You can turn it around and use it like a regular goal, too!  It's very sturdy with 1.5" steel tubes, however, one of the spring-loaded pins broke off with a sharp point showing (not a problem as I haven't taken the goal apart).

5217	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these at the gym after forgetting my Agend S goggles at home one day. I have tried 4 different pairs of mid-size goggles and I like these the best. I got a good fit almost right away and don't find myself fussing with them all the time. For me, they are a perfect size, not too big and not too small. I'm really impressed with the peripheral vision. Just right for making sure I'm on my side of the lane and the side vision is very clear. The silicone flange is very soft but also sticks out far and maybe that is why it was easy to get a seal and keep a seal. The dual-band gets twisted easy but after a day or two I get them on without them twisting.

1857	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My husband coaches my sons soccer team and he wanted a goal he could set up in our yard. This goal is well made and seems sturdy enough for backyard play. I like the way the metal poles lock together because they are sturdy, but you can also take them apart to move or store the goal. The net is nice, but I do have concerns about how the Velcro strips that tether it to the goal will hold up. I suppose I can always use zip ties if need be. All in all, for the price, this is a pretty good goal.

1193	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These bands are made of strong, high-quality material. And I like the door attachments. But I'm 6-1 and find the bands too short. However, there is a workaround. To increase the band length, simply add a carabiner in between the handle and the band. Also, the color-coding is confusing. Instead, they should label the bands from 1 to 5.

The packaging describes the red bands to be of medium resistance and for people who are moderately fit to fit. My guess is that they're pretty good for most people.  If you need more resistance, try the blue (heavy) or the purple (very heavy) bands.  If you need less resistance, try the green (light) or the yellow (very light).
You get alot for the money.
I'll recommend this cyclometer.

8817	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Found out about airex balance pads via my gym. this is a pricey item, but something so simple and effective.  Couch potatoes can purchase and when you are watching TV just practice standing on it for balance. Then stand on one foot for balance. lift weights while standing on the pad. Use it to do lunges.  I gave one to my exercise buddy and she and her husband fight over sitting on it while watching TV. lol  they also use to kneel on when giving their grand daughter a bath.  I like it!

Edit: Having received my 2nd set in 2 days (thanks Amazon!) I am changing from 3 stars to 5. I also spoke to customer support regarding an "Orange" band promotion they are currently running.  They answered on the first ring and were super polite.  This seems like a small business with a great product.  Am guessing my first set had just sat around a bit too long in the Amazon warehouse or were just a fluke. I've only used them a couple of times now but am really enjoying the whole resistance band workout... especially as I recover from a broken clavicle.  My only complaint is the grips have some imprints from other parts due to tight packaging but I believe over time it won't be too huge of an issue.
5303	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good
They were a complete pain to inflate. We ended up bringing a bike pump with an adapter. The adapter didn't fit so I had to jury rig a gasket to get a good seal (not a great seal). We were able to inflate them but it took about 20-25 minutes each. Not fun. I wish we would have gotten self-inflating models, or at least something that came with a pump.
But heck, other than that, it's just great (...not).  Do yourself a favor, get one of the Texsport double-action HAND pumps.  The higher-volume one goes for about $26 (including shipping) at various sites.  If you want youngsters to inflate their own mattresses, they'd likely find it easier to use the lower-volume unit, it goes for about $23 from Midway (again, including shipping).  These little pumps are inexpensive, high quality, heavy polymer plastic. They pump on both strokes, so they do the job pretty fast.  You can use them to inflate AND deflate (just move the hose to the other side of the handle).  A bonus -- they work with water as well as air, so you can use them as bilge-pumps, too, if the water doesn't have too much debris it it.  Best of all, you get a moderate workout while being able to hear the birds singing or the kids drowning.
1587	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This was perfect for our 8-year old. It was easy to put together and big enough, but not too big. We can leave it in the garage and pull it out for fun. I agree that as her kick gets stronger, she will probably break the net, but she is not there yet. For now, she loves that the balls come back at her.

Once I found these Gazetteers, I bought one for every state in New England and New York.  Each of the above provide different levels of information and alternative routes and access to various locations, often places with no direct road or trails.  The gazatteers provide fast detail access to areas in question over the GPS or atlas and are invaluable to me while in the vehical.  Although, the GPS is my lifeline away from the vehical, the gazatteers are large and not weather resistant.

1149	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was impressed with the quality and design of these bands. They come with two handles, which attach to the bands with carabiners. I especially like the design of the door attachment. Unlike the other band and attachment I have, this one just slips through the crack and is held in place by a clump of metal that's sewn into the nylon strap. When the door is open, you can poke the clump through the gap on the hinge side. When the door is closed, it's way too big to get pulled back through. I also like how you can hook two or more bands to the handles to create more resistance as you get stronger.

The door anchor is a fabulous addition, easy to use, well made and strong.
How was the sleep?  I slid around in my tent, but I was on a little bit of an incline.  It was very comfortable, my back was fine, my hips were fine and I'm a bit of a tosser.  However, it is a little narrow, but it works just fine.  I'm 5'11" 200lbs - not small, but not big.

3619	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are the best flying discs money can buy. They're light and have a soft rubbery ring around the edge. They are easy to throw and they fly far when you wing them. We use these with our dogs, so the durability of our particular discs is probably affected quite a bit. About 2 months in and ours is definitely starting to look pretty beat. We have another one that we got almost a year ago--despite being warped and cracked, it still flies great, albeit a little wobbly. The dogs love these discs. We have purchased other soft discs made especially for dogs and if we take both types of discs out at the same time, our dogs will actually wait until we throw these before they'll commence playing. Definitely worth the money. I know I'll be back to replenish our stock.
Update Amazon took care of the problem and aside from a dud wheel this scooter is very well built. I am 6ft tall and almost 200 lbs and have been riding it with my daughter and if it can handle me a child shouldn't be able to hurt it no matter what they do.
I also came up with a solve on the problem of having the control knobs not wanting to stay in position once you let go of them. The knobs need to have some friction against them so that they need some force to get them to move even slightly. I built up little strips of gorilla tape under the edge of the knob (after they've been removed, of course). It makes the knob stay wherever you put it. There are other ways to accomplish this, like putting 1" valve washers, held in place by silicone gasket adhesive (RTV Blue) under the knob.

Its also great to put in the car / SUV for any time when you need to pack things that will put dirt in your trunk or seats.  Xmas tree, plants, anything sticky ( kids ) or dirty.  Also very useful if your car ever has a flat tire to use as mat to change the tire - I have used it twice.  Once to change a tire (saved my work clothes from the muddy street) and the other time just to put it down to look under the car.  Big enough to lay on, but folds small enough and neat enough to fit in trunk without taking up too much space.

723	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a very nice, complete set of exercise bands. I actually searched for something like this in a couple of local sporting goods stores, but they either sold the bands and handles separately or had a kit with far fewer options at a much higher price. I like how you can double-up bands for increased resistance with this set, plus the door adapter and ankle attachment are a nice added bonus. So is the storage bag. So if you're looking for a versatile set of exercise bands, I highly recommend this Black Mountain product.
7524	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The scooter was made for a small child. The online description didn't mention this.  It was also extremely difficult to fold and unfold the handle bars from the base.  I will be contacting Amazon to return this item.
-You can combine weights and bands together in a single movement (holding the band & weight, or have the band anchored on the weight) to increase the resistance and difficulty of an exercise (ex. regular dumbell curls are hardest when your arm is at 90 degrees, band curls are hardest at the top of the curl, holding a dumbell and band together with the band anchored in front of you makes the whole thing hard from beginning to end).
8640	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	wouldn't fit anywhere.

It is very durable.  This thing took a beating and at the end of the summer it was still holding up.

They don't wear them when they are on their bikes, only when they use their motorized scooters.  I am only giving them 4 stars because they don't fit my 7 year old daughter as well as my 9 year old.

I'm impressed by the attention to detail and degree of protection these pads offer for her knees and elbows. The soft mesh lining is comfortable for her to wear, the gel interior provides shock absorption, and the hard outer shell offers superior protection, and they're very well made so I believe they will last her for quite a while.  Highly recommend these!

5356	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've been using TYR googles for the last few years, but they keep breaking about every 9 months and finally TYR told me to basically F off, they were tired of providing me warranty replacements.  I might have a skinny nose so a lot of fixed width googles will leak on me, but these puppies didn't leak and were so clear.  I seriously saw so many new things in my pool I had never seen before.  I'm sure like all things in chlorine they will eventually break, the question is how long is that and how will Speedo handle a warranty.
I half expected to wake up on the ground with one of them deflated the first night, but they have lasted through multiple camp/hike trips. And I love to take them to visit friends/relatives. Comfortable and small, and they take minutes to inflate. I decided to try two instead of one, two people on a blow up mattress allows each one to feel every move the other makes. Having two, (they fit great side by side), eliminates this. My husband can get up and down, flop around like a fish and I don't have any idea he is moving around.

About setting wheel size.  For those that are absolutely anal about accuracy, borrow someone's GPS and use it to calibrate the wheel size setting.  The 2155 for a 700 size worked fine for me, a little off compared to the GPS but since I don't see myself going for a bicycle land speed record, don't really care that it's a little off.  However, was bored and so started changing the size setting by a couple numbers at a time and now have it matching the GPS exactly.

* It's not very bouncy.  That's my main issue with it.  I'm quite certain that spring-based trampolines are bouncier.  Not a problem because it's just for burning little kids' energy but I was expecting something a little more elevating.  Just be aware that this trampoline has a bit of a tendency to suck your bounce.  Probably that's good for working out.
I am a big believer in resistance band training and love the flexibility it gives you when it comes to the types of exercises you can. Your imagination is truly your only obstacle and if your imagination is not quite as active then there are also tons of helpful sites you can visit to find the perfect workouts for what you are trying to accomplish.

9776	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Fine cover.  These all seem to be an intelligence test a few levels beyond me.  It came with lots of straps and clips but nothing obvious how you get them all to work together.  But from what I've seen in my many years of boating, that's par for the course unless you pay for custom stuff.  I think I get more value from this level of cost and quality.  That's from a cost / year perspective.

I figured that my compass was just a single example of something that slipped through the QC checks at Suunto, so I arranged with Amazon for a replacement.  When the replacement compass arrived I was very disappointed to see that this compass also has the same issue.  I can only conclude that this 'error' is built into the Suunto manufacturing process and that Suunto is shipping thousands of MC-2 compasses around the world with an extra 2 degrees of error built in.
1641	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for a larger sized soccer goal that I could use to practice goalkeeping and shooting. I was getting tired of running all over the place to find an empty field with a goal. This one works perfectly as it is larger than the rinky-dink ones you normally can buy for your backyard. The product comes nicely condensed in about a 4"x1" flat box. Assembly took me about 20 minutes with another person's help. This is definitely going to require two or more people to put together. The bars are comprise of a heavy-duty steel type of material that holds up well to both abuse from play and the outdoor elements. The netting appears to be well-made and tense enough to hold up to quite a bit of abuse. The goal has held up to the weather so far here in NC, but we haven't been exposed to the hot summertime yet. I'll update my review if for some reason the goal is really damaged by the sun, but it doesn't seem like much is going to change this nicely made soccer goal. I can say that I'm very pleased with this product and it continues to hold up to the Franklin name.

5514	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have three small children who love to play soccer.  While the older two (6 y.o. twins) can sometimes handle a regulation size soccer ball, their 4 year old sister has difficulty.  Enter this ball.  This ball looks exactly like the "real" (aka size 5) ball that their older sister and her friends use, yet it is much easier for the little ones to control.  The ball arrived partially inflated, but it only took a couple of pumps from a hand pump to get the ball ready to go.  My three children have enjoyed kicking this around the yard and playing "soccer" with it using two trees as goal posts.  Our dog, a Carin Terrier mix, has also enjoyed playing with it, and has not managed to pop the ball with his claws (The ball is too large for him to bite it.)  The kids have had this ball for a little over two weeks and it has seen regular use, and so far is no worse for the wear.  The stitching is secure and the ball has remained inflated.  I have noticed that my 6 year olds seem to be improving their ball handling skills since practicing with the smaller ball.  I think this is a great soccer ball for smaller children for whom a larger ball would be difficult for them to handle.

It seems a bit short for the top strap. I measure the maximum it can fit 10cm above the knee is a circumference of 42 cm. I think that is a important point to note when purchasing this item. Other areas should fit well as the Velcro is long enough..

I just gave it its first usage out in the wilderness.  I cooked bacon, eggs, and hash browns while car camping far from civilization.  I only needed to fire up one burner, and I made the tragic mistake of having no way to dispose of my bacon grease other than wadding it up with paper towels and putting the paper towels in the garbage back.

Unless you want to sit for 2-3 hours and pass out from hyperventilation, using your mouth as an air pump isn't going to work.

I originally purchased this for backpacking but it's much too bulky and I don't want to carry an air pump with me as well. Would do fine for car camping probably.

Pen, bottle opener (takes some finesse so your friends won't be able to do it), knives, hook blade (especially good for opening up suit coat pockets), screwdriver, nail file, tweezers, general blunt and pointy tools. I've used all of them in some shape or form. Sometimes you have to get creative, and don't underestimate the blunt tools it has, they can be especially useful for poking and prying.

Oddly, the instructions included only list the resistances for the first five I already had, and I only knew what this resistance was from enlarging the photo on the Amazon product page. I dinged it one star, because unlike the rest of my set, the cables on these are not clipped, but run through the grips, so in order to double up resistance, I will have to hold two grips in each hand, and can't use this strength with the cuff The door hanger strap is included, though.

1186	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	When I bought the previous version that had the swivel clips I wasn't to keen on using it too much. But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly. Also I recommend getting the new extra strength orange and purple bands, sold separately. I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4" to 5'9" range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel. I'm 5'11" and I'm very careful how I use my bands. Black Mountain is a very good company with awesome customer service, and they're always working on improving their products. For the price and some common sense usage it's tough to find a better basic set than this. My previous swivel end set is a souvenir I keep in my closet. I hope they come out with a new set the has all 7 bands, 2 ankle straps instead of just 1, 2 sets of handles that are bigger than what they have now, a door anchor with a cushioned liner, and a really nice bag to put it in. If and when that comes out I'll be getting that for sure and ready to post a 5 star review.

As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences.

A boy at cub scouts had one of these that everyone was playing with last week. My son decided to spend his hard earned allowance money on Amazon to order one, hoping it wouldn't be pink. :)  He was thrilled when a yellow ring arrived. It has a VERY rice, silicone-like, soft rubbery grip and is fun to throw! Kids fight over these rings so I'm thinking of ordering several for birthday gifts and cousin Christmas gifts. You can't beat a gift for under ten that kids actually want to play outside with!

4969	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've seen "Everlast" on punching bags, floor mats, and all sorts of gym equipment. So I got this mat because I thought it would last. I had to spend a night on a cold hard hospital floor, so I overnighted this mat. I needed this pad to use as a light and portable sleeping mat. It works fantastic! It's firm but not too stiff. I could even lie on my side. No sore hips or elbows! The fold up design made it very easy to handle. It is exactly 1. 5/8 inches thick. It also will insulate your body from the coldest floor. The seams are inverted. There is no odor. And it looks like it is  tough enough to take some REAL punishment. And best of all...the price. This mat is far better than I expected! Whether your working out or need a nice pad so you will have a decent nights sleep, I highly recommend this mat!
I debated about taking a single star of the rating because of the noise but I think that's just being too nit-picky and unrealistic given the price. (Also, considering I'd need CPR after blowing up a queen sized mattress manually kind of makes the noise problem trivial the more I think about it).

I tossed the ball up in the air about 25 feet spinning it,and it kept a perfect spin and came straight back down. so the balance is true.  I would say this is the equal or better of the Wilson brand balls I've had in the past.  It might be a tad expensive for a rubber type ball, but a good one of proper weight and construction used only indoors will last as long as the other composites.  Recommended if you have an indoor court to play on, I think it would hold up for a while on the playground too, but it will wear out faster there.
5957	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The only issue is if it's moved, I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch, since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it, and so do it! Its a great leg workout.

6109	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We recently bought this dual fuel Coleman 2-burner stove for camping, and prepping for any catastrophic event. I grew up in the 3rd World and I was delighted to unpack this well-made, large Coleman stove. To me it was like going home. For many years during the 1950s in the South Pacific, my family did a lot of our everyday cooking on one that was not so different from this. When I was at university in the early 70s, I bought one that was virtually identical to the new one, in design and ease of putting together, except the fuel tank was red and it took only Coleman white gas. I cooked on it on camp trips for many years, until it mysteriously disappeared (I bet someone's still using it). In recent times we've gone with throw-away-tank propane stove-tops. However, one tank of fuel with our new Coleman stove is equivalent to 4.5 small propane bottles, so this makes more sense.

We use them for hog hunting and these hearing protectors allow you to hear what is going on around you as well your conversations as if you we not wearing them at all.
5215	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I made the mistake of falling into the trap of buy some Chinese goggles a couple of years ago, and greatly regretted it.  Those goggles were actually sharp on the bottom of the connector piece on the bridge of the nose, and had my son or daughter swatted the goggles, they probably would have cut the skin - they were that sharp.  They also leaked continuously.  I bought them at the time based on their rating, but have since been able to figure out that if you consider buying any Chinese product, you bet read they 1-star ratings first, because all the five-star ratings are written with poor English and are obviously fake.  I'm at a point now where if a product has a Chinese brand name, I'll look somewhere else.  These guys seem to make products that are never "quite right" and usually fail well before they should.
5197	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful ball.  I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son's birthday.  We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.  It has a nice "sticky" grip, feels secure when grasp, and for preparing to shoot. It holds air well and doesn't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season.  Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you'd expect in a quality ball.  I highly recommend it to all. It even arrives inflated for immediate play.
3054	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Wasn't expecting much seeing as it is so thin but was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is. Would be better for back sleepers, side sleepers (specially people with big hips), you might have to reposition a few times at night since it puts a little pressure on the hips. This is something i have found with any air mattress however. I had a decent night's sleep in this and would recommend to anyone who needs a little more cushion when camping.
6710	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I paid 55 for it, and i'm fine with it. I think cold steel does better with AUS8 steel, but the knife is okay. It has rusted a bit, and doesn't hold an edge as well as my other aus 8 knives, but it is solid, cool looking, and stays sharp enough for long enough. I probably wouldn't buy it again as I feel I could do better for the money, but this is ONE of the better options for this type of knife.
It's got a good non-slip grip on the foot rail, heavy duty foam covers over the handlebars and perfect for 4' 2" people.
Just do your research on different work outs to do with them and its going to be worth it

2941	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have 1500 miles on this rack so far, and I load it down pretty heavily with four bikes.  I love this rack, especially for the money.  With this, I feel confident taking our bikes on nearly every road trip we take.  The straps are starting to show some wear, so I try my best to be careful so they'll last as long as possible.  I see getting another 1500 miles before running into trouble.  I use this on a 2000 Toyota Sienna, and it looks like it was made for it.  It's a challenge to get four bikes to fit on there (at first). There is a learning curve, but once you figure out how to arrange the pedals and which direction to face the handle bars, you can load the bikes pretty quickly.  Just experiment until they fit just right. Yes, you'll look out your rear view mirror for the first 20 miles, but worry not.  Those bikes aren't going anywhere.
9814	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	i bought this one hoping it was larger than the others i could find on here cuz everyone was saying they were small in their hands and stuff. i have big hands and this puller is great. its just shy of 4" tall with a diameter of almost 2" when squeezed closed (with no arrow in it!)

So my wife and I grabbed our 22s and headed to a local hunting area. This time of year it's a dry hole for squirrels. Tons are harvested by this time of the season and probably every one of the survivors has been shot at, stalked or chased at least once since season opened. We started a slow walk in a grid pattern and gave a short set of chatters about every 100 to 200 yards regardless of whether we saw signs of squirrels or not. Surprisingly we had several fox squirrels come out to check us out over the course of the day. All of the ones that we saw were actively (but stealthily) working their way closer to us (I'm assuming they were curious). We didn't get our limits but we had plenty of chances to shoot. The reason I'm impressed is because I've never seen a squirrel in my 15-40 yard iron sight range in this particular area at this time of year. Usually if you see a squirrel at all it's running as far and as fast as it can away from you on the forest floor. The call actually made them curious enough to stick their heads out and come closer to us.

Leslie uses four basic moves--march, side step, front kick, and knee lift--but varies the speed and execution of each movement to change the intensity.  In addition, this workout uses Leslie's special weight belt for upper body toning work; I don't own the belt, so I substituted light (3 lb.) hand weights throughout the workout.

These little mattresses worked great. The wife and kids loved them. They slept comfortably for 4 nights. The mattresses did not go flat or lose air. For the price, I would totally recommend these for camping. The only gripe I have is that they take awhile to inflate. Make sure you have a pump, because blowing these up with lung power could be a big chore.

I have a difficult to fit face and facial hair so I did not expect any mask to be a one-size fit's all.  For me, anyway I just had to trim a bit of m hair and snug up the straps to get a good seal. Every respirator has limited air flow making real labor a test of the flow. I was mucking around in 10 foot high cattails and mud, carrying 40 lbs of chemical on my back on a hot day, with protective clothing. It was able to keep up with my heavy breathing better than I thought it would. It is not any more uncomfortable than most respirators, light, and the strapping system is easy and not annoying. For the price, I'm delighted.

The "zero" on my Tasco scopes have never failedd me, they are clear annd bright and are an easy scope to use.  I have 2 World Class scopes, one with a mil dot reticle and one with a standard duplex reticle and I love them both.  For the money there is no better scope on the market and for much more money you will get no better scope.

The 1 5/8" thickness also makes the mat very comfortable and shock-absorbent -- I imagine it'd be great for tumbling and/or doing any kind of ab workout where you sit a lot.
The bands, although not a substitute for gymnastics rings, high bar and the like are really really great for a whole bunch of exercises.  Using one of the band combinations with the door anchor I got a couple of really good ab exercise and some good pullovers (for muscle ups).  Sure today I was able to do some levers so but these exercises are really helping me stay strong through injury and I can see them going way beyond.  Far better and more versatile than weights, these band are fun and create exercises that require small muscle stabilization far better then weight machines.

One of the nets we have currently from this same line has been exposed to the elements for more than a year and is seldom put away but is in perfect condition for use.

work perfectly
We bought these for a cruise so that we can look at the ports and such from our balcony, but we go on a lot of hiking trips and visit lots of national parks, so I think this will be a good buy for us long-term. Yesterday evening we played with it a little while playing baseball at our neighborhood park, and I was able to see 2 stars close to the moon that could not be seen with the naked eye. I pointed them out to my husband, and he saw them as well. This was when it was still very light outside. Once the sun set and it was darker, we could then see the stars without the binoculars, and I thought that was neat. I did not use the binoculars at night yet.

3615	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Can't complain. Came just fine, works like an Aerobie should. Fairly durable and something I would buy again. Definitely recommend it.
Still, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands.  They are a good value and we are pleased to own and continue to use them.

3587	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These discs are by far my ffavorite to throw. They throw very well and you can get some distance on them. I am able to get about 75 yards on a not windy day. Anyone can throw them and they fly straight. I have purchased about 6-8 different ones
220	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I worked out once back in '08. I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - "too easy". So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them. Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable. I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.
2786	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone).  I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars, so we were happy, we now have two little boats (and yes, one set of oars).  Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore.  I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up, but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air, so that boasts well for the quality.
Yes, it will wind up in the trees if you are tossing near trees, but easy depending upon how high up to get down with a stick because of the ring (hole in the middle donut shape).

41	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I recently went on a long road trip to celebrate my retirement.  I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes.  While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.
6539	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Looks like it should work out, got as a gift for some kids. Says it is 12+ but am hoping they are just playing it safe since these things can really get up and go if I recall from my youth.
Pro:  Very comfortable and looks like it will last longer than most seats.  Storage is a welcome extra.
Another interesting fact.  When I purchased this most of my friends questioned the purchase and felt it is unnecessary.  However, that belief does not stop them from asking me the yardage on nearly every hole.
Well priced and own 2 of these, 1 orange and 1 purple.
1754	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Works well after a year of use still good.  The velcro fasteners need to be more heavy-duty if they are to last... but you can replace with ties of any sort.

It has held up nicely so far, we have had it up for about a month with no issues. It is light enough to move around the yard for mowing purposes.  I will need to get new stakes, the ones that came with the rebounder are too flimsy to hold up to constantly be taken in and out.

1998	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	These are definitely cheap binoculars. As with most binoculars, these focus by sliding the eyepieces the eyepieces in and out just slightly. However, on my set, the eyepieces can wiggle around a little bit, which makes it pretty much impossible to get a good focus in both eyes at the same time, even with adjusting the monocular. Also, the left side is just not very clear in general and is always hazy around the outside especially. I wasn't expecting crazy fancy, but being Bushnells, I was rather disappointed. They work...ish, but I'm sure you could find better for cheaper at a thrift store.
3492	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought them to slide down behind the couch cushions to hold the slipcover in place. I can't vouch for how they work for playing tennis but they're handy little couch helpers.

Except for the lone .17 caliber bore brush, the adapters and the collars/bosses of the bore brushes and cotton bore mops are aluminum, which can scratch bluing and steel barrels (the aluminum-oxide exterior film on all aluminum alloy is much harder than gun barrel steel); brass is MUCH preferred.  It's really odd since the cleaning rods themselves are solid brass.  But now that I look closely, I can see in the photo that the collars are aluminum. <sigh>.  Two stars for false "Origin: USA".  Don't support Communist tyrants!
4004	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Playing volleyball at the beach with this is a head turner for sure, the ball came ready and pumped to the amount used professionally, ball was used all summer long and no problems what so ever. You can't beat it for the price you pay, it's cheaper than buying a ball at a sports store plus you got the touch of Wilson. Planning to buy one more in case they go out of stock.  Definite conversation starter!

3253	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I'm very happy with this mattress. It is cheap and provides way more cushioning than my backpacking sleeping pads. It's too heavy and bulky for long backpacking trips, but for short hikes I find it worth the weight. I am getting older and sleeping on the ground without pillows is not as fun as it used to be.

2062	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've never bought real binoculars before so I cannot compare these to any others but they are sturdy and I cannot find any imperfections. I purchased them to view Dolphins from our 13th floor balcony when we go on vacation in 5months.

Currently my son is only four and when he wears it is it slightly large but the tension is enough to keep it attached. It looks like he can wear this for a few more years and the pads will probably start to fit even better. Recommended.

I don't know what the answer is here as it would be awkward to have them attached by strings--they just need to fit better (perhaps testing them prior to selling them might be a good idea).  Do love the size & available adjustments so for the price, I'm a happy camper.
1429	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This was my first Case knife and I have been amazed by it. Until about a month ago, I was really big into modern tactical knives like Benchmade, Spyderco, KA-BAR, etc. Traditional knives never appealed much to me. However, I've since taken an interest in "simpler" pocket knives. This knife was given to me for Christmas and has become my favorite every-day-carry knife. The finish is superb. The bone is very smooth and transitions very nicely to the bolsters. I usually hate knives with stuff on the blades, but this one is really well done. I kind of like looking at the little man in the canoe and wishing I was floating off somewhere myself... but anyway, back to the knife. The knife came razor sharp. After a few passes on a Spyderco Sharpmaker, the knife is LASER sharp. A great knife for a great price.

8187	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I like the adjustable declination feature. I'm not sure if it's worth the price increase as you can easily compensate if you choose one without it, but if  you want to spend the money go for it. It's a nice piece.
5114	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Gloves are great and quality is decent as well and my 4 year old loves them. However, they do run small and I really don't see how they can be considered "youth" boxing gloves if he won't be able to use these next year. Maybe he has big clubs or something.
2207	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Considering, these are a very inexpensive pair of binoculars, they arrived in great shape, came with a carrying case and a cleaning cloth. They focus pretty well and have a decent field of vision. If you just want to look at a birdbath in your backyard, these would suit you quite well. If you want to do more serious birding or scouting, buy a more expensive pair. For the money, they are a nice lightweight pair of binoculars.
Unacceptable performance from a supposedly quality brand. Stay away!
1336	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Having connectors at both ends of a trailer wiring harness only allowing the use of a split covering. This worked great, easy to apply and stays in place. Just be careful when cutting it, better if you use a hot knife.

This compass does more than simply point you in a straight line as others do. This is a full navigational instrument designed to be utilized with maps. My compass even came with a code for five free maps from National Geographic. There are a lot more features on this compass than I was expecting.

8344	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Lets face it, its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks, its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers, but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it.
And they can double for a water float too!
Problems, string  broke,Sites kept falling off, cross bar kept falling out after shot fired. making it rather difficult to have fun with.
3549	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	More decorative than useful for real play. The "stick" is very short. Maybe good for the very young, but I think the point is to have something to hang on the wall more than it is to play with.
I got one of these for them to practice with, and they love them. No more fear of getting banged in the hand/head/etc. by the disc, and the Superdisc is stable enough that they can really start to see progress in their own throws.

Also, the cam/gear mechanism for the pliers is a very nice force multiplier, but it means that if you need to open the pliers particularly wide, the handles go out very far which may leave you with insufficient room/leverage to actually use the pliers... I would say that it is more common for me to wish that there was some way to turn the cam/gear mechanism off than for me to be thankful that I have the extra gripping power....

3282	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Got them for camping to be more comfortable.  Kids slept like babies, and were much happier than with sleeping bags.  They didn't lose air, but can be a witch to inflate.  A cheap battery pump fixed that problem.  Seem durable and had no problems.  Not really lightweight so would not recommend for backpacking.
The picture that Amazon has shows an earlier model S60 that has the piano style locks and the hex head bolts rather than the allen key bolts. The shipping item is NOT as pictured, and as far as I can tell from SOG, the current model is the one with the single lock and the allen key bolts.. I'm sure the single lock is significantly cheaper to manufacture!

2305	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	While this is not a leather or synthetic leather ball, it still has a feel for quality, it bounces well as there is a solid feel of control with your dribble.  I've had a number of synthetic leather balls and a few leather ones in the past, and I always felt they needed a long break-in period the balls were typically slick and hard to control.  I sometimes took them outside on the pavement to accelerate the process.  Not necessary with this ball you can grip it solid right out of the box. It has a rubber smell to it, but the quality seems better by far than those outdoor playground balls.  I felt it was a touch smaller than regulation, but that may be my imagination.

The individual components are not made of the strongest materials, but then you don't have to worry about any of them damaging your rifling.

The extra room between some of the items is also pretty good for storing hex keys and what-not.

As other reviewers stated, this knife can be opened in the blink of an eye, and I've made the mistake of frightening people when going to open a box.

Resistance band s is the most economical resistant equipment out there, since you can just buy a light, medium, and heavy band for all your needs. Simply combine the bands together to create different variations of intensity! Use the resistance bands with the stability ball, stability disc, and bosu balls for even greater workouts.

5759	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These pads really work well and my kid is comfortable wearing it (he asks to wear it whenever he rides a bike). The pads have a gel insert below the flexible plastic caps which absorb some shock and helps in comfort, too.

9666	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I ordered the 50# line, and have found it to be indestructible.  The color camouflage sounds gimmicky but it actually works, and does not seem to compromise line-strength.  You can choose between a black, red, or clear knot to fit your needs.  The downside is that this line is quite thick, and you'll need a large reel and the right knots.  The line "memory" is about average.  I plan on buying another spool in a lighter weight for my smaller reels.

604	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	First, shipping was very fast and the company provided their number so you can reach them directly. Bands are incredible - very well made, sturdy and I expect these will last for many years. I think the scale of pounds per resistance bands is true to the rating. I would like something stronger than the red and black bands for squats and lunges.  Men will need heavier bands than women, especially for a lower body workout. It does come with a detailed book detailing the various full body workouts using the bands.  I will definitely be taking this with me on my work trips as I can do these in my hotel room.
4185	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I wasted money on these thinking they were California legal, they are not.

It feels solid yet comfortable to handle, all of the parts are really smooth, there is a circular plate that holds the magnetization so that the needle can balance better, the needle has pins on to keep it from getting stuck on the floor or ceiling, there is a needle that works like a plumb line to gauge inclines and height (if you know distance), the mirror angles firmly so you don't have to worry about it closing when you're taking a reading, being able to pre-set your declination is rather nice feature to have when you're going to be trail tired when you take a reading.
I have used this in the woods for a couple weeks and it still is amazing. I even compared it to another scope my daughter has and we both said the Banner wins. We were looking down a logging road/foot path about 1/2 hour after sunset. We could both still see leaves on bushes and blades of grass at about 50 yards. Her scope, which is a more expensive model and a different brand, was not even close to the detail we could see with the Banner. If you hunt very early or very late in the day, this is the scope you would want. I am sure there are more expensive scopes that could match the Banner, but I think you would be paying for something you do not need. I firmly believe this scope will allow me to see a deer at the last part of legal light and make a good shot!
4947	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've tried using about 4 prior foam pads, and this one beats them all by any measure, any standard, any criteria.  I've used it to sleep on but mostly I use it for my morning stretching exercises and it shows no sign of flattening.  For the price, it's the best.
Well, color me impressed!  I can easily replicate all of the exercises I used to perform on cables and more.  Rows, lat pulldowns, crossover chest pulls, hammer curls, concentration curls, tricep extensions and pulldowns - these have even replaced freeweights for lunges, good-mornings, and calf raises!  Even with no freeweights, you can still get a full-body workout with these bands, and add-ons are available to up the resistance.  Believe me, the pump you feel after a workout with these is every bit as good as you'll feel leaving a gym.
1781	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Love it - easy to assembly, large and sturdy
7332	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I don't love it but my daughter thinks it's great 'cause it's pink and has tassels on the bar ends. I like that it collapses and folds down to the length of the bottom board. It's light enough to carry in one hand or put in a backpack (yes it sticks out a bit) and bicycle to her school for the trip home. She's been using fairly regularly for half a year now and it's holding up fine.

Some have said they thought the metal on this newer Coleman was flimsier. I don't think so! We also like the "orange peel" textured green paint. The gray tank, that still fits inside the stove while transporting and easily slides into place for use, seems as well designed as ever, and heavy duty.
7087	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We have had plenty of these over the years and they don't disappoint. We have an old one that's rusty and it's starting to get wobbly. I was excited to see Amazon had them $10 cheaper than retail stores on average. This scooter is made of metal and sneakers or hard shoes need to be worn when operating it. As other safety gear should be worn too but no flip flops. It has a nice adjustable bar and my two year old can have the hand grips at a good height even at his age. It is not intended for children his age though so use extreme caution if a child under 5 uses it.

Surprisingly even after being very chewed up the Frisbee will still fly pretty well.  I have a German shepherd and he is very hard on toys.  I used my last one about 4-5 months very heavily with the dog before buying this one.  Most other Frisbee were gone in a month even the ones made for dogs.

1012	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This set of resistance bands is complete with everything you need for a light workout.  I bought them to help with my shoulder workout.  This is a really nice system.  You get handles, carabiners, ankle strap, and door anchor, along with 5 different resistant bands.  I purchased the wall-mount, 5 position exercise station to use with these, so I am ready for rehab after my upcoming shoulder surgery.
6805	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These are inexpensive and collapsible, and reasonably sturdy.  I bought four for my Scout troop.

Consider spending a little more and buying the 13 inch ring. It flies farther and better than the 10 inch rings did. However, if you don't have a wide open play space, the 10 inch rings might be better because they play more like a Frisbee and don't get hung up in trees quite as easily.

4330	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is my second gel seat cover.  I'm already a huge believer in gel seat covers because I used to find riding my bike very uncomfortable and using a gel seat cover allowed me to bike a lot more with a lot less discomfort for a small investment.  The gel padding takes the edge off the pressure on the pelvic bone and allows me (a heavy guy - 300+ lbs) to bike for hours.  My last seat (not Bell) lasted 3 years - until the gel started to lose its integrity (and form loose chunks under the cover.  I was a little nervous about the Bell Gel Base because it's so inexpensive.  I was afraid it would smaller or thinner or somehow compromised - but no problems.  The Bell Gel Base is just as good as any gel seat cover I've seen and fit both my large seat and my wife's small seat just fine (via the adjustable pull cord).  The Gel is firm but deep and works great.

UPDATE: I am now buying our THIRD ring! These make awesome gifts for boys in the 8 to 11 range, as my son is frequently swarmed by boys wanting to play with his. But be aware that if you throw it too far and loose sight of it, you won't get it back. It will be stolen by the first kid who comes across it. We had this happen at a party where the ring ended up sailing over a house and landing far behind it in an empty field right at dark. It was snatched before daylight. Hence me having to buy our third. (Since it was probably the roving neighborhood teenagers who picked it up late that night, I am going to say this is a good toy for fussy 16 and 17 year-olds, too!) It has been a favorite gift at birthday parties, followed by thank yous from the moms who are grateful for any toy that gets their video game addicted boys outside. I am thrilled to have found such a good gift for under $10. You can't go wrong with this ring!

6431	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	When we received this ring we quickly went outside to throw around.  We discovered there was no way to play with this in a neighborhood.  It goes a long way with very little effort, but it has a hard shell within the rubber which could easily scratch a car, injure someone or even break a window.  We then took the ring to the school near us and had a great time with it as the claims of distance they give are definitely possible.  Six and nine year old boys  could throw this a long ways.  In the next two weeks we took it to parks and other schools.  Everyone who threw it was impressed and could not believe the distance it traveled and how easy it was to catch.  Then the BUMMER!  The inner black rigid part covered with rubber broke just from normal use.  Sure, we can still use it but the only thing holding it together is a little bit of the rubber surround.  This ring was a 5+ when we first got it but having broke in the first two weeks, I can only give it a 1 star.  With the design as it is, not sure how this company will have very many repeat orders.  We were very disappointed.  Returning for refund.
2461	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Its exactly what is described.  My only criticism is that the floor of the boat (which inflates in a second pocket) could have stronger material to be a little more durable.  But a little patchwork & its good as new!

Being disabled with chronic pain,leg and back issues there's not much I can do workout wise. Even walking can be unbearable so looking for something I could do at home whenever I feel up to it I tried these resistance bands.

6164	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Swiss Army Knives (or more appropriately, Swiss Army multifunction tools) are among the best in the industry.  My last one, just like this one, lasted about 10 years (with very heavy use), so I have no complaints, and it would have lasted longer if I would have stopped dropping it.  I especially like the Craftsman because for me it has all the tools I use and like, and none that I don't (like the corkscrew).  The pliers are small but useful, as are the scissors, but the saw blade is one of my favorites, as it cuts thick plastic or fiberglass and small tree limbs very well; and although I don't recommend it, I have cut a 2x4 in a bind.  You can't go wrong with these as a tool.  The construction is top-notch and the steel is excellent. The width of this knife is slightly more than it is tall, so it fits well in my pocket and doesn't spin.  This is absolutely a great knife / tool.

similarly, because brunton co. is no longer the same company of old, which exclusively made some truly high quality compasses at one time, the lower-priced brunton labeled compasses of today are crappy units made and finished en masse in china or india with very questionable quality [they easily develop bubbles, break or don't show the actual north]... check hiking/orienteering forums and youtube for reviews if you want to spend the time... the higher priced models of brunton are still u.s. made and there are some very good, dependable ones but they're very expensive and mmade mainly for professional surveyors, forestry workers, etc... we're talking $300-$1,000 price range ['pocket transit' line] with options that a common hiker will likely never use or even learn how to use...

I have worked with some nasty reagents over the years in research and industry so I definitely appreciate safety products, especially in my own home.  I purchased this for painting with spray guns, mostly water based, but just because something is water based does not intrinsically  make it safe (read some of the MSDS sheets for the water based stuff and I suspect you may agree).  Since I also occasionally spray pesticides, it would help with that task, too.

It can be modified also by changing the rear hook for a larger heavier one that makes the lure sit different in the water with it'd nose sticking up.

There's nothing wrong with the product. For reference our son is 38 inches tall and weighs 33 pounds.
The reason why I'm telling you this is that when it comes to choosing a product for which there is a certain very popular brand, it might be hard to go against the current. But if you see how much of a difference there is between the two multi-tools, you might realize that sometimes it really pays off to go against the current.

8129	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have used my MC-2G for about a year and am very impressed, I can not think of any improvements that I would make.  To adjust the magnetic declination, the compass is flipped upside down for access to the adjustment screw and for direct reading of the declination scale.  The fine green index line was a little difficult to see until I started the adjustment and the line moved away from the red declination marks.  Now that I know what it looks like - it is easy to spot.  Two of the scales read directly in miles, one scale for maps using 1:24000 (1 inch=24000 map inches) and one scale for maps using 1:62500 (1 inch=62500 map inches).  I believe the scales do not go to the corners of the compass because the corners are rounded, plus the three scales would then overlap.  This is my favorite compass.


8762	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The purple band is not even close to being "ultra heavy". I have three really old resistance bands from the first p90x and they all offer more resistance than this band does. I'm not a overly strong guy either, I am 5'7" and 175lbs. To me if it says ultra heavy I should only be able to do maybe 2-6 reps per set depending on what exercise I am doing. No matter how many loops I used and no matter how many times I wrapped this around a bar or something to try and shorten the band and up the resistance I could still easily do at least 10 reps of every exercise I did.
5319	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love these goggle, because they never loose suction and I don't have to worry about water getting in them. The only thing bad I can say about them, is that they can fog up after a long swim.

2371	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We purchased a vacation home that had outdoor teak furniture that had weathered badly. We used this product and the original teak wood was wonderfully restored. At first I was pouring the cleaner on the teak, but that was wasting a LOT of the product, so then I started using a brush to apply. We live in a very dry, windy climate, so I had to work quick to apply the cleaner, then scrub it on, then wash it off -- when I the full 2 minutes for the cleaner to soak in, it was drying on the chairs! Once I got my system down, this worked great. However I did have to use 4 bottles to clean a small round table and 4 chairs, a bench that seats 3, a rectangular coffee table, and 4 large chairs. Highly recommend this product
USE: while using the product takes a little time to figure out, it is generally easy. follow the workout charts they give you. the door attachment is a cool addition and is also generally easy to use, also widens the range of workouts available from the product. this level of resistance is perfect for me being a larger male, on some exercises it is a little weak so make sure you can estimate your strength before ordering. the door attachment can be tricky to install. make sure the door is CLOSED when you install it, otherwise could result in a flying object to the face.

It was impossible to get a low or medium flame on the Everest and made cooking on it a challenge. There were other issues with it, but that was the biggie. See my review of the Everest for details.
The German #4 reticle seems to allow for quick acquisition. The 1.25x allows for two eyes open comfortably (for me) past about 15 yards or so. There was no information included on how to "use" the reticle. Perhaps there is no range estimation with the #4 reticle?

I highly recommend anything they make.

4687	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This product is great. We took in on a road trip, where we cooked on it probably 10 or so nights out of the 16 that we were on the road. It was great to be able to pull into a campsite and be able to be cooking supper within minutes. No messing with getting a fire started, or smelling like smoke when showers might not be available. It puts out a lot of heat and brought water to a boil very quickly. It also uses surprisingly little propane. I bought 4 bottles for our trip, and ended up not even emptying the first one, even though a couple of nights I was running it for 15-20 minutes to boil soup or noodles.
We bought the first set, and were incredibly happy with it, so bought a second set to increase our weight capacity and enable us to transition while circuit training quicker. Really, REALLY excellent set, and the basic exercises sheet that comes with it will give you a great overall full-body workout.

However, I originally bought this mat for Insanity, and I found two drawbacks with it for that program: (1) The thickness of the mat makes it a bit unstable for quick lateral movements and floor holds, which are HUGE parts of the Insanity workouts. (2) The smooth material gets very slick with sweat, which makes it a bit treacherous (at one point I slipped over sideways doing a 1-2-3 Heisman... but at least the thickness of the mat padded my fall!). I was also using this mat on top of a carpet and found that it tended to slide around, though I think it'd stay in place better on wood.

6527	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this for my 6 year old son and I to play with in a field behind our house. Our neighbor had one so we had to get one also. It flies great (fairly straight - but that largely depends on the thrower) and really far. It isn't affected much by the wind. Would highly recommend.

I recently had cervical spine surgery and my Physical Therapist recommended resistance bands. I ordered these and could not be happier about the quality. I reached out to them with some questions and their service is excellent. Great quality bands and I love working out with them. I a traditional gym rat who works out with heavy weights. However, after using this for several months, I will keep them in my routine for the long term.
My children all say they are comfortable, and you can't beat the price!  No need to look further.
This is a good value for a reliable scope, recommended!

7817	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought these because a cheap set of my caldwell's broke.  But in all reality, I actually liked those a little more.  They weren't as tight on my head (big head) and you had to put batteries in only one side and you only had 1 switch to worry about leaving on but overall, these have been a good replacement.

6252	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	If you have an official Fox40, and then use this, you will know it is a cheap knockoff.  The sound is completely different, and nowhere near as powerful as a Fox40. All of my kids are lifeguards, and have used Fox40s.  My daughter saw this pink one, and asked for it, for this summer at work.  She ended up using her "old" Fox40 because she could not blast a loud enough warning from this junk. Buyer beware.
5530	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This soccer ball came ready to use right out of the box (though it's still helpful to add some air to it). The size of the ball is four. The black and white design make this look like a traditional soccer ball, thought its a bit smaller than a traditional soccer ball. It's great to be used for training with children and teens. Overall, this is an attractive ball.

If you use this item at your desk, it is a fine tool.  In the field if you are moving fast over rough terrain, I recommend you remain vigilant on where your declination is, every time you reference the compass.  Even if you are sure that you just set it.
3464	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These rings fly the best of any "frisbee" style toy but have a hard plastic core that breaks (the dark ring in the middle of the soft plastic ring).  This brand doesn't last anywhere near as long as traditional "frisbee" discs and rings.  BUT then they fly so well, it might be worth having to buy one every few months ??

Perfect? No, but that's just symptomatic of it's simplicity, in that, it's not self lighting (you have a problem with grill lighters) and has no internal room for fuel bottles (It's not a rattling, bulky, overweight stove). Simple.
8575	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Does what it's sposed to do! We had a little bit of trouble getting it to buckle onto the Rawlings Coolflow Metallic Batting Helmet that we purchased it for.

1041	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Since you can clip numerous bands to the set of handles it makes it very easy to get to higher resistance levels.  I bring these to the gym and use them in lieu of the gym's as those tend to be use so much that they are stretched out and I cannot get the level of resistance I want.  Great product so far.
8140	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Awesome piece. One minor gripe is that there are not, if anyone might need them, any hints beyond the picture on the Amazon website, as to how to attach lanyard. It is not difficult but neither is selling a $60+ compass with inclusion of a pic and a paragraph of info on retaining it afield. The total package is excellent however.

I have had no problems with this band and it feels sturdy enough to last for a while. Time will tell and if it decides to snap or fail on me then my review will be updated to document its shortcomings.
The concept with a seat cover is you just put it over your existing seat.  The possible downsides are that it might slip a bit to one side during use.  I periodically have to straighten mine out - but no big deal.  The upside (over buying a special gel seat) is that it's less expensive and when it wears out you just buy another.
8366	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good for the price.
After much more time with them, I may upgrade them to a 5 star product.  That depends wholly on how they "wear" with daily usage.  I would definitely purchase these again and do highly recommend them for usage in your routine, whether it is light duty or heavy duty.
8292	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am a big fan of pelican cases. They are tough and they protect the contents better than any other case.
The net attaches to sleeves that fit over the PVC, this allows the goal to be disassembled without becoming tangled. You can remove the rear brace and break the top bar off and it will all fold flat for easy storage.
2878	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Nicely made blue wheels. They are smaller than standard Razor A3 Scooter  wheels but they can fit with no problems on it.
There's also easy set up and take down. The propane tube fits nicely inside when being stored. The wind walls can be extended or collapsed depending on the need of the wares you're cooking on. It also cools down quickly and is relatively lightweight for the quality. If you don't have a carrier for the stove no worries, there's a convenient handle in the back.
7898	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	What can you say, a good basic compass. Seems to be made pretty well and it points north!  Tally-Ho!
The only negatives:  after over a year of use, the metal face plate fell off (we reattached it... but it's purely cosmetic);  after 2 years of use, a neighbor kid hit the grass while bouncing and sucked out the rubber tip.  I'm now online looking for the replacement since you can't use it without that tip.
5280	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	good item
5708	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These have protected the little knees and elbows of my son in many a fall from his scooter and bike. They are made of strong thick plastic. The stitching has held up well. After about six months they do show some wear on the plastic from falling against the pavement, but that is to be expected. The only complaint I have is that no matter how tight you Velcro them on they tend to slide some after he has been playing for a while and he has to stop and readjust them.

3236	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bullet proof...been using these for campouts for about 10 times now and no issues whatsoever. Very firm and the butt does not sink in the middle like some of the other cheaper ones I have pruchased. Don't bother buying the self infallible ones...they don't work at all. You don't even need an electric air blower. I blow up two of these each time we go camping. One is has a rough texture to help from slipping and other side is smooth plastic.
The problem some have had with this falling off a table, that is common among this design and is not a flaw with this particular model.  Proper placement can minimize the chances of that happening.
It works well with a small propane container, but we use ours with a propane distribution post and hook up a 20 pound propane cylinder when at the seasonal campsite.
384	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works well with stretching and with resistance. Really enjoy my work outs.
(I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true. Took about 5 years of off and on cooking to do it, and 10 to become perfect.

The door anchor is wonderful as I can attach my bands at any height.  I also can easily use multiple bands together.  Wish I had gotten these earlier!
2299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use.  So, we thought we'd wait.  We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust.  Once it started, the rust couldn't stop.  So basically, a big waste of money.

8887	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I quit the gym and work out at home with just this one band and pull up bar. I recommend this to any serious or novice exercise fan. The combination of exercises is limitless. The resistance of this band is for more advanced weight training. I'd equate this to lifting about 30-50 pounds (per arm) depending on the position. I plan on buying the heavier and lighter bands just to round out the set.
354	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Black Mountain is an A+ brand. Quality shows on every level with these bands. I also have the exercise ball and resistance loop bands. You won't be disappointed in this. Great for traveling so you can still get a muscle work out.

 Rodney Yee's Power Yoga For Beginner Series (Flexibility, Stamina and Strength-3 tape set) which are challenging but not as long or as tough (though the Strength tape is actually very tough compared to the other two). These are also only about 25 or so minutes long so very easy to fit into one's schedule.
The only problem I had with this workout is the title, as I think it would have more appropriately been named WATP for Upper Body rather than Abs.  Leslie does provide frequent reminders to concentrate on your abs and some of the moves (especially the knee lifts) do work the abdominal area, but the toning segments were more focused on the upper body in general.  Overall, however, I found this to be an excellent cardio workout, and although the moves are repetitive, the time really does fly by.  It is probably most appropriate for intermediate exercisers, but experienced beginners could manage by moving at a slower pace and skipping the weights.
The things we like about it:
5850	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to put them to the test yet, but they are comfortable, look pretty cool, and you absolutely CANNOT beat the price. This is a wonderful set of pads, and I would buy them again just to have a spare set.

388	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	A few years ago I tore a tendon in my shoulder. I was in physical Therapy for 6 months. about half of my exercises were resistance bands. They were basically strips of latex in different colors for various strengths. They did work and I trained my muscles to be able to function without that one end tendon. Now I wanted to get some new ones to continue exercising mainly in the winter as I am very active the rest of the year. My trainer form blue cross showed me some models out there that were endorsed by Blue Cross. I noticed he used these from Black Mountain that were not on the list. He explained that he was on a budget and the latex tubes are all fairly equal. I did some research and they all last about a year if used every other day.

She was thrilled to receive this and the helmet we got for her along with it. Cute and sturdy basic scooter that is ideal for younger kids and/or beginners as it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that other Razors have.  This is her first scooter, so she asked for one that she would be able to learn on and improve her skills before she "asked Santa for a harder scooter".  It was simple to get this into ready-to-go mode once it was out of the box - easy enough that the little girl did it herself. No special tools were needed to assemble it and it was simple to adjust the handlebar for her height.

More importantly, this set is FUN. Having used conventional equipment ("weights") off 'n on most of my life, I can assure YOU that with this set you will get a better and wider range of movement for every exercise typically executed with conventional weights. To enhance the experience and development, try doing your movements "mindfully" and slowly. The "BURN" is perfectly sweet!

For the record I'm a 230 lbs, 6 footer with a 38inch waist. The XL fits nicely, not too tight and not too loose. The Grippers work quite well... but, if you've got longish leg hair, the grippers might pull on them a bit. My Typical weekly ride distance is 150km to 230km
4570	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The classic stove. I love it. My parents had one while I was growing up and they still have it 30 years later. We used ours on our recent camping trip and had no problems with it. It lights easy, folds out and back down easily, and wind was not a problem. We used it to cook every meal and were totally satisfied.
They are fairly cheap, but I expected that from such an inexpensive product
3289	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I got this because of the price. I saw there were a lot of negative reviews, but I took a chance anyhow. It worked fine for me on a 4-day motorcycle camping trip. I didn't lose any air over the night that I could notice. Sure, it's basically just a pool float... but you get what you pay for. It definitely beat sleeping on the ground.

5843	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	After reading the other reviews, I thought these would work perfectly for my 4 and 5 year old children.  I was wrong!  They are huge!  They kept falling down, and the kids weren't the least bit interested in wearing them, and they are truly very safety conscious.  After realizing they were way too big for them, I tried them on, and they fit me!  They are really nice knee pads, but definitely not for little kids.  The elbow pads could probably work for knee pads for them, if you don't care about elbow pads.  I wish I had only bought one pair instead of two.  I will say they are priced well, though, as long as they fit!
I take my pack out whenever I fish in Colorado, so I play with it every time I go and it's not broken and I carry a lot of stuff in my pack but then again, I treat it with respect and keep it well secure just in case.
I would recommend this for any little princess, not just competitive dance.

Rubber was just thick enough to stand up to our kids' abuse. You'll want a pump to inflate the boat, unless you've got a half hour to kill.
2818	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly for my replacement chair at work! For the price point, it was a lot better quality than I was anticipating! My lower back was starting to hurt from my chair at work. I use to use one of these at my home computer so thought I would try it out and see if it helped. So far it has, still switch off back and forth, but would buy this again if something happened to it!
But the tramp, once assembled and all 2 bolts tightened, does not hold the disk form well. It occasionally warps when the kids jump on it or move it. Not much, but enough to make the legs a little wonky. It still works, but that's why I say the quality just isn't top notch.

I thought I'd use it for small bursts at my standing desk, but I don't think I ever want to get off of this.  I have an anti-fatigue mat which I've been using and thought was doing its job quite well -- was feeling better standing for 7.5 hours a day than sitting, and I'm 55 years old and had 3 knee surgeries about 24 years ago, so I thought the anti-fatigue mat was just fine --  but I wanted to alternate between that and other mats and/or foot massage balls --  in order to use different muscles so I can feel even better after standing a whole work day.  ThisAirex Balance Pad  is more comfortable than the anti fatigue mat though, don't know if I'll be going back to that :)
8453	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have owned Tasco Scopes all my life.  I bought this one based on a friends recommendation.  The optics are very clear.  I did notice that when on the higher power (9x) just a little distortion on the extreme outsides of view.  Really, nothing that is enough to make this a deal breaker ESPECIALLY at this price point.  My friend has his on a 30-06. He reported no scope creep.  I have this mounted on a .22.  I would not think there would be enough vibration from a .22 to cause that.  1 zeroed in at 30 yards.  after 100 rounds, and a grouping within a dime, I can safely say no scope creep on my .22.  Again, for this price point, you can't get a better scope.  Bottom line, I would recommend this scope to both friends and family.

I suspect avid surf fisherman might turn their noses at such an inexpensive rod however this one worked wonderfully on my trip.  I was throwing 2 ounces quite far considering it was my first time doing surf casting.  I believe the slightly slower action of a fiberglass rod was more forgiving than a fast action graphite rod.

6654	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This knife is great ! I have several SOG knives, both fixed blade and folding blade, and I like all of them. This blade has a good balance in the hand. The blade is not too big and heavy nor is it too small to do the job. The blade is sharp right out of the box and is easy to touch up when needed. The blade is made of a special stainless steel, so it will not rust like the carbon steel blades. The sheath has a pouch which will hold a Lansky sharpener, which has a ceramic rod and a diamond dust rod to sharpen any type of knife blade .https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085PPSIQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_113. The back of the sheath has a MOLLE  strap system which also allows it to attach to a LC 3 pistol belt for a multiple attachment option. I think you will like this knife as much as I like it.
GREAT quality of the bands and ankle strap. You can't beat the price either (I found everything else to be more expensive through Amazon and other sports stores). Plus, I like that my money goes to support a small family owned business rather than support another country's economy. All in all, this was money well spent and should make my son as happy with the purchase as I am.
5548	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We have 3 children in different grades who play soccer and all 3 seem to have different sizes.  We have a couple of nets in the back yard, which is really great for them to practice a game they love.  But we also have several balls of different sizes.  I think it is really funny that they use all the balls to practice.  It seems like it makes a perfect practice.  They laugh a lot.
Maybe it was because our daughter was tall for her age, or maybe the sizing is just off. At ten months our daughter was big enough to sit on this flat-footed and push it around. At this age though, she never got the feel for it. She preferred pushing it around from the side or from the front, which were both awkward.

5041	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this mat a few months ago from Amazon.com since I can no longer find it at any sports supply stores.  This mat is just like the ones we used to have in our grammar school gymnasiums.  I purchased it so that I can tote it around and use it at home.  It is easy to use since it folds out evenly without bumpy areas and stores well since it folds in half.  The mat is just the right thickness for comfort and I find that it supports me when I need to do exercises while lying on the floor.  I can no longer lie on a plain carpeted surface without extra cushioning from a mat.  The price is very reasonable as well.  If you are looking for a simple but comfortable floor mat for doing exercises and stretching I recommend this mat.  Note:  when you get the mat out of the box you may notice a plastic-type smell from being in storage.  This will dissipate over time and does not affect the quality of the mat.

The handles are foam, not rubber, grips, so I assume the normal wear and tear from a foam handle, but they are not, in any way, flimsy. The system works very simply to clip in and out for varying resistance. It's a quick and easy change when you move between exercises. When I had mine in the door frame, I kept all the bands hanging and only clipped the ones I needed. It worked great so my boyfriend and I could swap out between sets without any fuss.

I would consider these good for physical therapy (lots of full range of motion exercises you can do at lower weights), early stage muscle growth, or larger mass maintenance.

So far, we've only used this a handful of times, and it's difficult for my youngest daughter to get the ball up in the air, so the ball plunks off the base crossbar bar and doesn't really rebound back.  This rebounder will encourage her to kick with better form.

4.  Mirror - The Suunto alignment guide down the middle of the mirror (to align your eye with the center of the compass) is wide enough to use, but not too wide to get in the way of getting your bearing.  The Silva Ranger guide line was so thin I couldn't even see it.  The K&R was a slit that blocked out the entire center of the compass, and even the needle itself near a 0* or 180* bearing.  The Suunto and Silva mirror itself appears to be glass, and is like any other mirror in that it reflects very well, and projects a great flash for signaling.  The K&R is metal, and thus unbreakable.  It was not as bright for signaling, though.

There have been a few reviewers who are displeased with the Observer's ability to generate an alarm that you can actually HEAR -- and this is one area which Suunto can really improve upon.  It is so quiet to be almost non-existent under even fairly quiet conditions.  It sounded to me a little like a Palm Pilot alarm going off underneath a pillow -- that was located in a room down the hall.  YES, it IS a joke -- but I have other watches that can fill the alarm void, so I only considered this a MINOR problem.  If you are interested in purchasing this particular Suunto model and you absolutely NEED a loud alarm, you might be better served with the Casio Pathfinder -- but if you are more concerned with the other incredible feats of electronic gadgetry that the Observer can do, this is DEFINITELY the model for you.

All the figures are brightly colored and durably made. I love that my daughter can act out the story with the figures as well as create her own story with them.
The key items for prospective buyers to be aware of, is that the Explorer 100 is a one person craft, with a rated capacity of 120 pounds, intended for pools and calm waters.  Its not recommended, but the raft could probably accommodate a couple of small children, as long as the weight limit is not exceeded.  Those heavier than 120 pounds, should probably look at the larger&nbsp;.

The BMP set, however, is great. I use all five bands, from the lightest one (yellow) for straight arm shoulder flies to a combination of the heaviest ones (red and black) for bicep curls. Speaking of which, this is a really clever system that allows you to use multiple bands in one exercise, so you can create your own weight. Really smart. The door hook anchor is also cleverly made, with no metal parts, so if for some reason your door isn't strong enough, at least no metal will be flying in the direction of your face.

3468	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Got this radio flyer for my 1 year old grandson a year ago. It took him a while to get real mobile on it but it has become his favorite toy now that he is 2. At first, you think that the wheels get in the way of the moving feet. But my grandson figured this out and keeps his moving feet right under the wood panel - and he is fast!  He goes up the steps with it, stands up and turns it easily and just takes this thing all over the place - inside and outside.  Becuase of the constant use, the steering handle wiggles slightly from wood tear. But it doesn't seem to matter and is still safe and doesn't come lose - it just wiggles a bit.  In any case, this is a wonderful fun toy for the grandkids (now I have 2)

I fear repeated use at the combined higher multiple band tensions will cause the handles to deteriorate. Otherwise a well conceived product!
In looking through Amazon, there seemed to be a few very good choices in the 1/4 inch drive size that had good reviews.  What pushed me to the Chicago Pneumatic sets was the fact that they have every socket with no sizes missing (12 mm seemed to be commonly left out and was a thorn in several reviews).  When the sockets arrived, my first thought was of the sturdy plastic box - both that it is far stronger than most shipping boxes and also that it could be much smaller.  Opening the nice latch on each of the boxes revealed a specific spot for each of the sockets.  I would imagine that someone could cut the lid off the box and use it as an organizer for the sockets in a tool cart.  The sockets themselves are well made - perfect machining on the outside with some minor burrs and slightly off-center through holes (1/2 point off the score).  Instead of a smooth interior to the square drive area, or machined in divots, each socket has a hole drilled through so it will work with pin retention, the little ball or a hog ring.  The remaining 1/2 point deduction comes from the size marking on the sockets.  Each socket is both laser marked and stamped - which seems perfect.  Except that the stamped mark is rather small for my eyes and the laser engraving which has the potential to be excellent is mostly used with a big CP and a little size marking.
8851	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Can't say anything but positive things about this brand.  I also like the flexibility the handles offer.  Some have solid handles which make certain hand/arm positions uncomfortable.

2135	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for bird watching in my backyard.  They're comfortable, easy to adjust and large enough not to get lost.  I use them to view birds on our half acre property, and this works perfectly for that purpose.
6623	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This knife is exactly as represented on Amazon and by SOG on its website, so I won't go into detail. It is a perfect size for carry when hiking or camping. It is too light and too small for chopping wood or batoning, but it is perfectly suited for all the smaller tasks in setting up camp or on the trail. I recently purchased a Seal Pup Elite for a gift and find there are four obvious differences between it and this Seal Pup. The Elite has a TiNi coating on the blade which is arguably more durable than the powder coating on the Seal Pup. The Elite has a straight edge option while the Seal Pup seems to offer only a partially serrated blade. Depending on the purpose, each edge feature has it's advantages. The Elite has a rasp-like spine whereas the Seal Pup has a smooth spine. Finally, the Elite is made in Taiwan whereas the Seal Pup is made in China. Other than the intentional differences as noted, I see no difference in the fit or finish of the Elite vs. the Seal Pup. Apparently the Elite may be shipped with the nylon "molle" compatible sheath or the molded "kydex" type sheath, so be sure you get the one you want. The regular Seal Pup is shipped with the nylon sheath. Both sheaths are well made. The kydex sheath will probably be a little more durable, but it doesn't have a vertical strap that allows the knife to me mounted on a "molle" compatible pack. A "kydex" sheath can be purchased separately, so if you get the nylon and later want to purchase the other, they are available. If money is no object I'd recommend the Elite, but for the difference, there is nothing wrong with the standard Seal Pup. If the size and weight of the Seal Pup is what you want you can't go wrong with either.
The view through the Tasco World Class is not quite as crisp and sharp as it is through my ancient Leupold Vari-XIIc, or the Weaver 40/44, but it is about equal to the VX-2.  In terms of low-light performance, it seems about on par with the Weaver 40/44; with my VX-2 being only very slightly superior, and my old Vari-XIIc being the best of the lot.  Even though it isn't as bright under low light as my Leupolds are, it is bright enough during legal shooting hours to take way inability to see the target as an excuse for missing it.  The Tasco might not be "World Class" in this regard, but I do think it is as good in this regard as it needs to be to provide statisfactory service in the field.  In sighting in to low angle sunlight, the Tasco has about as much internal flare as my VX-2, while my Weaver 40/44 and Vari-XIIc are about equal to each other in that regard and slightly better than the Tasco.

6163	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years.  My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years.  I've always been satisfied with the quality, and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel.  This knife is no exception. Same fine quality.  A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket, but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers.  Of course you also have the available screwdrivers, as well as all the other features.  It's amazing how handy this knife has been.  There have been times, when I don't have the knife with me, that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task, and then, "Drats, I wish I had it with me."

6140	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this stove from Amazon in 2011 and this is the third summer we've used it camping.  The only differences comparing this stove to my father's from 30+ years ago is the color (his is a lighter green), the metal case is a little thinner (which isn't an issue at all...we haven't dented it in 30-40 times of use so far), and the tank doesn't let you fill it up when it is attached to the rest of the stove (which is a safety thing, and probably a wise decision).  Functionally, it lights easier that my father's (likely because the parts are much newer and cleaner) and has burned with a blue flame every time (once it took a while, but every other time it was quick and easy).  It also comes with a filter funnel that doesn't let you overfill/spill which is quite handy.
Note that the handles are plastic. As an alternative, you might want to consider this product that has foam, rather than plastic, handles, but does not appear to include the door attachment: "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SPRI-XT-MU-Xertube-with-Padded-Foam-Handles-Medium-Resistance/dp/B001A6L7U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SPRI XT-MU Xertube with Padded Foam Handles - Medium Resistance</a>".
7490	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We love these scooters. They are built strong enough for adults to use and are compact enough when filed up to put in a school locker. They last a long time.
Plastic makes your water taste funny if you don't rinse it out first, or store it in the sun.  You don't want your drinking water in the sun in plastic anyway.  This was perfect for the camp washstand.  Remember to dry before storing, and keep the cap off in storage.  We used a wire tie to connect it to the handle when not in use.
The idea of it being a compact set is really nice.  It does come with oars, a manual pump, the boat and a string.  There aren't instructions, which isn't a big deal except for that the valves were stuck and the pump has a weird hose thing you're supposed to attach to it, which isn't obvious (it's closed at the end so it doesn't look like part of a pump).  If we'd looked at the box we would have figured it out sooner.  So I ended up using a meat thermometer to puncture the valve to get air into the boat, and using a different pump.

Get's them off the video games too!

5455	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I finally decided to get a new pair of goggles after using my old pair for over ten years and the lenses were getting hazy.  These are extremely comfortable and optically very clear.  I wear them for over an hour a time doing laps and never need to take them off for any discomfort.  The anti-fog coating works very well, but I don't know yet how long it will last.  I rinse them in fresh water after swimming to get the chlorine off in hopes of extending the anti-fog...who knows.  They are great in the pool and I use them for open water lake swims for triathlons as well.  May not be the "fastest" goggles out there by any stretch, but they are comfortable for as long as I can keep swimming (and haven't had one drop of water leak in yet).

Great value as a fun pool toy, and if the description focused on it being best for kids instead of implying it's '1-person', I'd give 5 stars. It deserves 4 1/2 stars as it is, so please consider my experience with it to be on the high side of 4 stars.

4321	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I use this seat cover on my Phoenix 98623 Revolution Cycle Pro II Exercise Bike.  If you like cushioning, I would recommend that you continue to wear a pair of padded bike shorts in conjunction with this seat cover.  Otherwise, it does a fine job of making the stock bike seat more comfortable.  I also like that it is fully adjustable and you can tighten it with the pulley strings.  No problems with the seat cover slipping off or moving during my workouts.
The darts seem sharp enough. We haven't had problems with them breaking or even popping out of the board while playing. This has been so much fun for us.
5878	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized, but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight, and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an "okay" job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again, nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)

5437	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I suggest going with the adjustable nose piece because these goggles did not fit me whatsoever.  If you have an above average sized nose at all, I suggest not buying these goggles either. The hard plastic bridge of these goggles rested on the bridge of my nose.  I bought these for triathlon training in a lap pool and was miserable, although I didn't really comprehend exactly how miserable I was until after trying new pair of goggles. I decided to purchase a pair of Speedo mirrowed goggles at Target with adjustable nose for $18 and they were so much better it was unbelievable.  It made swimming much more enjoyable and relaxing when I didn't have to worry about finishing a lap with one eye shut because my lense was filled with water.  I literally had to drain my goggles after each lap.  I tried to really push the limit with the suction to the point that I burst a blood vessel on my eye.  Frankly, i was shocked at how high these goggles were rated. There are obviously much better options out there.

5927	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I don't recommend it. The metal circle frame bends easily (it comes in two semicircles and you have to put it together). It may constitute a hazard situation. The legs feel a bit fragile. Better buy a similar product where the upper metal circle is a single part.
2949	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Couldn't quite tell if this would work, but I took a chance and this rack does fit a 2005 Toyota 4Runner, with the spoiler installed, which I believe is optional on this year (mine had the spoiler when purchased as a used vehicle). The top straps pass under the spoiler without touching it, the hooks on the top straps then fit into the slot above the rear hatch. I was quite impressed with ease of installation once I figured things out. The hooks/straps for the rack all attach various places around the 4Runner's rear door (not to the fender, bumper, or other external area), so it is possible to raise/open the rear door/hatch with the rack in place. I have not tried to do so with a bike on the rack, but it would probably work, at least for partially raising the door, though I'm sure is not recommended. The padding/design seems adequate to protect the 4Runner's paint job. I have not used the rack extensively yet and only loaded 3 bikes (not the 4 maximum) but I'm quite happy so far and will add to this review if problems develop. The straps have a partial "stretch section" which allows you to really get them tight, and they are PLENTY long. Good design as it appears so far.
9925	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for transporting my daughter's practice shot.  Better than carrying it :)  Seems to be holding up.  Would be nice if it had a little more room for other things, but it does what it's supposed to.

Tweezers:  I use it for pulling stuff that gets stuck into my skin, in addition to several small tasks.  The Midnite version of the MiniChamp trades this for a toothpick. Considering my knife may get wet or washed in my pants, I don't like electronic components.  I have a much tougher Mini Maglite that is much brighter than the wimpy little single LED bulb on the Midnite version.

We really like them, and I'm sure you will to.
There are four lens covers and they do the job, but would fall off easy were you carrying the binoculars around neck or otherwise not attending close.  I only use the covers when the glasses are inside case.  I suspect these covers will get lost easy, especially as the soft sided case does not zip.
1191	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This product is pretty awesome - I use it almost everyday.  It's convenient and it has a storage bag so you don't have bands all of the room.  My favorite exercise is the overhead press - you have to use your stabilizing muscles to keep it steady.

And it comes with extra keys in case you lose one. Highly recommend these. Also are great for transportation to keep trigger safe.
There are a lot of different things you can do with this thing, including using it as a zafu (like a meditation cushion); it's seriously excellent for that.  However, the only thing I've used it for much, so far, is standing on it on one foot.  When I got it, about a week and a half ago I guess, if my life depended on standing on one foot on this thing for 30 seconds, I'd be dead.  Now, I think I'd have an even chance of surviving.  I've done a lot of tai chi, and I've been working with Eric Orton's Born to Run system (which I highly recommend), so I was already pretty good at standing on one foot, but now, in this short time, I'm actually much better at standing on one foot, on any surface.

8350	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This Tasco scope came pre-mounted on a .308 caliber hunting rifle we recently bought and I have been impressed with the accuracy and quality of this bargain priced scope. The scope came "bore-sighted" so was on-paper at 100 yards and it was easy to get sighted in at 200 yards. The scope has held zero through multiple trips to the range and roughly 80 rounds or so. I really like the 3-9x zoom capability, which is perfect for the ranges this will be used.
2893	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent and a good fit. The front wheel rubbed a little on the top arch but the noise disappeared after an hour on the concrete.
3633	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Has potential but the manufacturer's decision to use lower/thinner quality fabrics results in a quick tears in the netting.  Along with the single stitched wasteband, this product is literally falling apart at the seams.  I have really nothing positive to say which for me is rare.  Sorry, but this product needs to go back to the drawing board or be discontinued.

I haven't really played with a fresbe since the original professional fresbe back in the late 70's, but I have a high energy dog who needs almost daily running and playing.  This disk is simply the best I could have hoped for.  It flies almost effortlessly and is easy to throw straight and level. I can easily get a 40 yard flight out of it and the dog just loves going after it and catching it in flight.  He just loves to jump high and snag it out of the air.

1584	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought two of these to replace some worn out smaller goals for my kids. The big benefit of these rebounders are that they are large enough for my kids (8, 6 & 6) to really practice shooting at, while they are small enough that you can still play without a goalie. Additionally, the ball comes right back out which keeps the game moving and lets them practice better on their own. At the price, it's hard to imagine doing much better.

Basically I ended up feeling like it was a total waste of $20, and my expectations were really pretty low.  I just wanted something I could row around in.  Now I'm thinking we may just spring for a kayak because this was decidedly not fun.  It might be okay in a pool or some other sterile environment, but it's really not made for nature.

6815	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I used this for three days on a camping trip I just returned from and won't be using it again. The faucet only lets a dribble pass, so there was no way to get it to give me a lot of water without waiting for a long time. I also doesn't maintain its shape.
5272	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	These are good when they are brand new. But here in Florida if you leave them in your car, the part that fits around your eye melts and leaks. My last pair only lasted a few weeks.

281	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Have used the product about a dozen times and works as expected. Cons are - the handles are prone to slipping and the stitching from one of the handles which prevents the plastic grip from slipping came apart during a workout. And not a big deal but the handles are a bit loud, making a squeaking sound.

1493	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This game board is a must have. The cue or finger style pocket games are fun for everyone who tries it! People might say that while playing the "pool style" games it is easy to pocket ... well it might be. But that only adds to the greatness of this game board. The key to a great game is that it is something that a new person can pick up and have fun with instantly but takes skill to master. That is what this offers. For the price the build quality is great in my opinion. I recently ordered a second one because my first one I am applying polyurethane to the surface .. but wanted a "vanilla" one as well. This game needs local and national tournaments.

4821	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I owned this model stove for many years and it provided reliable service. A nice thing about a propane stove is that it can be used indoors with relative safety if there is a power outage.  However, one red flag.  The aluminum drip pan is almost impossible to clean, should something spill over.  I made the mistake of using oven cleaner on my old stove and the residue quickly turn the stove into a rust heap. My fault - not the stove's.  But still, it seems that Coleman could use an improved material to catch the spills and be easy to clean up.
It's a shame, because I really like how thick they are. Just to darn paper thin!!!

I am curious how some other people smaller than me can use this.  I felt like my feet sliding out from the boots when I use them. I am returning them and get other ones with adjustment.
3318	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a good quality blow up camping mattress.  The pillow section is a nice touch an adds a bit of elevation under your head.  The mattress compacts down very flat when deflated.  It already takes some time to blow up, but a few more inches of width would have made a big difference in my sleep quality.  The first night I used mine, I rolled off of it sometime during the night and did not chose to get back on.

CONCLUSION:
Outstanding stove, the same as it has been!
1840	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	For smaller (4-7) children just gaining interest/ability in sports this is a nice goal.  It was easy to assemble with the provided instructions and is sturdy enough for the force exerted on it by small children.  It is also light enough  to be moved around by a single person with no difficulty.  My one concern in purchasing this was that the velcro tabs that hold the net to the frame might fray, but so far they have held up.
3304	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Haven't went camping yet, but have tried it out on the living room floor. The flaw I see in this product is the air valve. You have to squeeze it while inflating or deflating. Makes the two processes more difficult than they need to be. Took 7-10 mins to blow it up, but took just as long or longer to deflate it to pack it away.
The Trike came in a box and took about 10 minutes to assemble. Real simple. When he first saw it he was afraid. That didn't last long. I rang the bell a couple times and his interest was piqued. The next day we went to a neighborhood playground and tested it. First, the trike was a little too big for him. It specified 2 1/2 to ?, but his legs weren't quite long enough. With the seat all the way down, his feet won't stand flat on the ground and with his feet on the pedals, they aren't quite long enough. No major problem. He'll grow. It's just a matter of a couple more months. I sat him on the seat and put his feet on the pedals and pushed him around the basketball court. He loved it, although his steering is going to take some training. In any case, it was a success and he wanted more.
Two years later and the stove is still working awesome.  I saw a much older coleman in a pawn shop and it had the same thickness and stability of metal as this one.
1419	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	What do you do when you have 4 or more kids of the same age in your house. Here take this parachute and go outside. Putting a ball on the top and letting them bounce it out is a fun game. Or bouncing the ball and trying to keep it on the parachute for a more difficult game. This one is not quite big enough to walk under and pull it down while you are inside. Well it would work for small kids, not with an adult in the group.
130	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have used almost every day for the last 6 months and still working great. I do three sets from about 5 or 6 workouts shown in the guide. I feel a big improvement in strength and am glad I don't have to go to a gym. I bought one for about the same price at Dollar General that lasted all of two weeks before snapping. Highly recommend!
I wish they had some kind of eyelet or something built in so I could tie them together or something.  I drilled holes in the corners and put a big carabiner through them which works well, but the hole is a bit rough.
Cut and Picker Blade/Orange Peeler:  The original purpose of this tool was to cut the safety band off of a pill bottle and then dig the cotton out.

I am using them on a snub nose revolver, full sized revolver, two different compact semi-autos and a shotgun.  I unlock certain firearms at night and lock them up when I leave the house.  They definitely do not fit perfectly on any of my firearms, but in all cases they do prevent the trigger from being pulled.

This was my compromise.  Sure, it does take longer to bring a huge water bath canner to temperature (about an hour with near boiling water & 7 quart jars of product).  At the same time, I can cook eggs & pancakes on it, fry burgers, make mashed potatoes (or whatever) without worrying about scorching everything.  It's easy to pack up for camping or storage, and easy to set up to use.  On a sturdy table, it works well with either a canner OR the pressure cooker, and I can also use a smaller pan to cook something on the second burner.
1197	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This was my first time using resistance band training. These bands are good quality.

Later, I took my 10-14 year old kids to a football field to throw it, and we were regularly getting 50 yards on modestly powered throws.  An adult throwing the ring with full effort can easily achieve 70-100 yards of distance.

2329	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The SOG Pentagon Elite folder is without a doubt THE best every day carry I have ever owned! I've had mine for more that 6 years and it has NEVER let me down. I have put this knife through a lot of abuse and it still looks brand new. I have never needed to put a new edge on the blade and I've really only had to lightly sharpen it a couple of times. It remains as sharp as a razor. The sharktooth point is amazingly sturdy. It opens instantly with a flick of my thumb. I'm a lefty and this knife is completely ambi. My SOG actually saved the day during a boating trip when a tie rope snagged during a storm and was dragging the boat toward shore. It sliced through that rope like butter. I have other knives that sit a little lower in the pocket and open faster, but I always end up carrying this one. The clip snapped off once but was quickly replaced after a call to SOG customer service. I received a replacement in the mail in three days.
1471	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very durable construction. Just like I remember as a kid at soccer games this cooler will be for my kids to drink out of at their soccer games. The spout is so easy to operate my 5 year old can use it. Will probably buy some more of these for camping.
2064	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great, budget, binoculars. I wanted a pair of bino's to look at the airplanes from the windows at work. We're right across from the airport so it's not super far and I don't have to track accross tons of open sky, so they meet my needs. They work well and the focus is intuitive and quick.

4669	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I have used the same Coleman stove for camping for 15 years. Bought a new one and can NOT get the flame to adjust from full to simmer - the knob turns but reverts back to full if you don't hold it. I would return it in a heartbeat but the 30 days passed while we were out of the country camping. VERY disappointed! Now I see many people with the same problem - stove is virtually unusable for me to cook on.

6144	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Our 21 year old Coleman stove, model 424, from 1991 (the date is stamped on the bottom, along with "Made in U.S.A."), has been on many camping trips, and has been extremely reliable over many years and through all kinds of weather. It has never been repaired, and still works fine to this day.
Used primarily for inflating an inflatable pool & mattress.
7692	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I borrowed a set of these from a friend a few months ago and after seeing how affordable they were on Amazon decided to buy a set. They are my go-to range ear protection now. I shoot in a 7-bay indoor range which can be pretty loud when you get a .308 shooting next lane over. These do a decent job at suppressing the noise but where they really shine is in amplification of standard level sounds. I can carry on a conversation with the guy next to me at the range instead of having to raise my voice and ask people to constantly repeat things. I still use in-ear plugs while wearing these for better suppression, but with these turned on and up, I have no problem talking normally with someone while being protected from the .308 rounds nearby.
I got these on a $10 special.  I'll let me sons trash them and toss them and maybe they will spare them from a skinned knee or elbow first.

Pros:
2301	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Just in time for the grandson's visit.  It says "indoor" - but we've got a hoop just right for his height out on the patio, and it's working just fine outside as well.  Well-made, good bounce, just the right size.
990	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Having a 4 year old, a newborn on the way, and a military spouse.... it is near impossible for me to even consider a gym membership these days! My friend is a fitness coach and she recommended these to me. They go right on your door and there are so many options for how to use them! If you love to workout but cannot afford a gym membership or have a busy schedule, this is the way to go! Also, I would recommend a home pull up bar as well. Use both together and the results can be significant!
804	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have used these several times so far and they work very well. I have had no problems at all and I suspect these will last years if they are not abused. All the colors arrived as well as the accessories. Looking forward to furthering my strength with these.


The Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout Laser does just that in a compact, water resistant, lightweight package. This has a matte dark green rubberized finish which is weather resistant.

I got a secure fit on several style of rifles - air gun, youth .22, 30-06, 10/22.
As some have stated, the bottle is a throwaway, but the case is everything it should be and the price is roughly comparable to other modular cases in this line.
4062	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Do not buy this, just mail me cash if you want to waist money.


9673	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Second one we have purchased, but because this is a new boat.  We loved the one we installed on our last boat, so ordered one for the new boat too.

703	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love these exercise bands.  The possible variations of workouts is almost endless, considering how you can use multiple bands at the same time to add/ lessen resistance.  Also, the carry-bag they come in makes travelling with these bands, so easy!!  Meaning you can always have them with you when travelling, allowing you to at a minimum get a decent workout in, even when living in a hotel room.  I'm very happy with the purchase.

805	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The bands are really sturdy and do the job. I use them with my P90X3 discs and they have great resistance to them. I love that you can just add the handles to each band with the clips.

3227	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Bought several months ago, finally went tent camping in May 2015, bed deflated over about two hours.  Fully inflated early in the day, paced sleeping bags on it to give it the day to stretch out, re-inflated to account for stretching and attempted to sleep on it, was flat within a couple hours.  DON"T BUY A $15 AIR BED!

2226	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew.  My wife and I love them!  They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other.  We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene.  They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.
Next, the "Mheh, whatever."  The little booklet that comes under the baseplate is cool, I guess, but I already know how to use a compass and I'm probably not going to whip it out if I need to brush up on first aid but someone might, so okay.  It doesn't look at all waterproof, so I took it out of my old one.  The rubber base cover ... not sure exactly why, other than to hold little booklet in.  It makes this larger compass a bit bigger and clunkier looking and feeling.  You'll have to take it off to take a good map bearing - it makes the edge indistinct and it won't slide on the map.  Hmmm... musta been thought up by someone who doesn't use compasses in the field much.

Other reviews have complained about the burners being impossible to turn down.  Mine were dreadful at first, but with continued frequent use, have become easier to turn down fairly low.  The only thing that they simply are not going to do is turn down to an actual simmer.  To solve this, I would suggest a flame tamer, also available from Amazon.  They are light, easy to pack up, and work well with any gas burner.

It did have a little trouble getting consistent groups at 100yards for me. Holding zero was a little difficult. My next scope purchase will probably be a nikon prostaff, though I realize the tasco is a third of the price. I used redfield medium scope rings and took it to the outdoor store to get it mounted (with lock tite on the screws) and bore-sighted too. As a basic intro scope, you'll be able to have some fun with this though and put a deer on the ground if that's what you're looking to do.

Unfortunately, the smaller sized one is also our dog's favorite-in-the-whole-world frisbee, even though she has many different frisbees, especially dog specific ones.  But none even come close to the Aerobie in her opinion.  She LOVES it and goes bonkers every time it comes out in the yard.  She will chase it forever, until she literally drops.  We have to have a little pool for her to jump in often, because she gets so overheated. It is definitely not made to hold up to dog teeth, and so we cannot her alone with it for even a minute.  We play frisbee with her until WE are tired of throwing, and then we immediately put it away where she cannot get it.  Even so, we still have to replace hers every couple of months.  But she loves it SO much, we can't deprive her of one.

The new one arrived in 2 days (Amazon prime) and charged up quickly for another round of keeping us in air mattresses and afloat.

1) When there's wind, simply make sure the wind is hitting your left side (90 degrees from wind direction). Unless of course you are throwing left-handed then the wind should be coming from the right. That way the wind helps it make the full 360 degrees so you can catch it before it starts to make an "S" maneuver away from the throwing location.

2411	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I'll certainly be taking the advice of a couple of reviewers and will be gluing the small side poles to the back one as they come out way too easily, but it's a good, basic net. I'm using it to shoot pucks in the back yard in between hockey seasons and it's working out great. I needed to tie up part of the netting as it's a bit too lose and kept tangling the pucks, but it's a multipurpose net, so I can't complain. Setup was actually a little harder than I thought (I generally barely look at instructions) as I had to pull out a tape measure to figure out which piece was what, but otherwise, was a piece of cake. It's sturdy, stable (once I glue in those back pieces) and, for me, was an absolutely perfect purchase. It allows me to get some shooting exercise and practice my aiming. If you're using it for a game, it *is* rather light weight, but that also makes it great for me as I can move it around easily. I didn't give it 5 stars as, well, it's not perfect, but then perfect would cost a LOT more money, and I also don't have a wicked slapshot, so I'm not likely to shoot through the back of it. For the cost though, it's awesome.

I may update this review once I've taken them out to the range but I don't expect that there will be anything to report. There is a reason why they are the most popular and I don't expect them to perform like the expensive models anyway.

A former friend had one of those Bushnell Trophy scopes from new and I got a little trigger time behind it over the years.  One of the things I liked about it was the scalloped power adjustment ring.  It turned smoothly, with just the right amount of resistance, and the scallops made it easy to use when wearing thick gloves on cold days.  This Tasco unit has the same kind of scalloped power adjustment ring, and on my example, it is smooth and positive in operation.  The scallop motif of the power ring is carried over to the turret caps and as with the power adjustment ring, the scallops of the caps provide positive purchase and good tactile feel, even with gloved hands.  It's a small detail, perhaps, but a nice one that leads me to believe that product planners spec'ing this scope might actually have some real-world experience in using such things.

8811	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Got these for working out. I have a herniated disc and some exercises are difficult for me to hold weights with anymore. Other exercises require me to use a pull up bar which I do not have. This is a good replacement for that.

 This was a major design oversight: The straps to the handle should have been longer, or covered with a tape because as you do curls, it rubs against your arm repeatedly - eventually causing abrasions. The RED band had a longer strap so when you used it it didn't touch your arm or wrist. I'm on the shorter side, but if you're a big person this will rub over and over against your skin.
3334	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for my 7 year old and they're great. So easy to adjust and he loves them!
Air valve aside, it's a good product. I'm 6' 270lbs and the mattress supported me well. Was reasonably comfortable to lay on. Material seems tough enough to hold up to regular use. Overall, good product for the price.

My husband and I lost about 20 pounds together working out on the gazelle 3 to 4 times a week for about 1 hour. It took about 3 months to lose the weight. You can listen to music or watch TV while you work out and before you know it your hour is up. I like the fact that they have a cup holder for you to put your bottle of water in, because I would drink 2 bottles of water during my hour on the gazelle which would be about 3 miles.
4921	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This mat is perfect for my needs. We bought this because I was getting shin splints while going through the Beach Body Insanity program on a cement backyard patio. Though one by itself was not enough covered area for ALL of the exercises, performing most exercises on it work just fine and definitely fine enough to reduce the impact to my shins. The thickness and firmness work fine for me, I have never come close to rolling an ankle while performing the exercises in Insanity. I am 6'0" 230 pounds wearing a size 11.5 US shoe to make the data relevant for potential shoppers.
7668	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Not nearly as awesome as the $500 Peltors but this does the job on a budget.  I typically spend about 1-2hrs at the range at a time and I don't notice any discomfort with these, even with glasses on underneath.  The combination of hearing protection and still being able to hear whats going on around you is a huge plus, both for situational awareness and safety.  If I'm taking someone to the range for their first time, I typically let them use these so they can clearly understand what I am saying or instructing them to do.  Even having children wear these, they are less likely to try to take them off to hear what someone is saying.

7103	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Started out with a 5 star. I bought this for my daughter due to the look with the tassels. They just fall out. In fact, one side is completely gone. Very poor construction on this feature. Might as well bought one without them as now my daughter is sad!
9201	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	These are only useful if you have gigantic ankles AKA cankles! I'm 6'1 194 lbs and these were WAY too big. I used the extra padding they came with (which were a complete joke) and it still was not tight.  They would put too much pressure on my feet because there was no tension on my ankle. I even added extra padding from my old boots and they somewhat work now.

9819	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchase a used one that had some dings on the paint and a slit on the cap from shipping, still good for the price if you don't mind the weight of the rod on the low end. I'm 6' 4" 270# it felt heavy on my backyard dry run resting on my leg or underarm with a Penn 6000 and that's without that big fish on the end. Also trying to take apart the lower ferrules was stuck so I had to wrap it in ice and put behind my legs, grip and use my knees something I don't want to do at the beach. Most likely way it was return the first time.
8403	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I choose this rating because it was a nightmare trying to get it delivered. Never saw the scope, I can't even rate it. Amazon would not deliver this item to a PO box no reason provided and then FEDEX did not deliver to our physical address. FedEx turned it over to the local Post office who did not deliver it because we have a PO box. It was returned to FedEx who then shipped it back to AMAZON all because Amazon would not allow it to be shipped to our PO box. What a nightmare for a $60 dollar scope. It was not worth it, save your sanity and just go to the GUN store, there I said it out loud. Put your money in the local economy, not into amazon. The only good thing I can say is Amazon refunded promptly, however that does not get a scope on my rifle. While I am at it, Shame on FedEx for not driving to our physical address which I have lived at for 30 years and they have delivered to before. The only competent delivery drivers seem to be the brown uniform guys. I know this will probably not see the light of day but how else will anyone know if I don't speak up about lousy service.

The Elite version has a textured surface that supposedly keeps it from sliding on smooth floors.

I also noticed it sometimes double counts every few revolutions.  The distance will jump two thousands of a mile rather than one.  Maybe a rounding error or some such in the electronics.  I have counted rev's of the wheel over a known distance and it isn't counting twice the overal distance shown is accurate.  So probably a non-problem unless you compulsively watch the distance readout while riding.
4981	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my daughter(s) for Christmas and it has been a big hit.  This mat folds up perfectly to store in the corner or under her bed, which is great.  It isn't very wide but it is long, which is perfect for the acrobats that she uses it to practice.  It is nicely padded but isn't too heavy, and she can carry it from her room upstairs, downstairs to the living room (she is 8).  I would definitely recommend this product!
All in all, I doubt you can find a better bargain on Amazon than this guy if you need a cheap yet efficient rimfire scope.  100% recommended.

This stove has an solid bottom, and feels more substantial. I would have given it 5 stars if Coleman had figured out a better way to connect the propane tank. The metal arm that screws into the tank on one end and the stove on the other always feels vulnerable. If feels like it would bend or break if struck or dropped with the tank attached.

Pros  -
It comes packaged well, and for the price is an excellent value.  The hard case is very protective, the soft case is more than adequate, but as others have said, the furnished tripod is a waste of space and time.  Luckily I followed the advice of some other reviewers, and concurrently ordered a better tripod.  The furnished tripod would not make the use of the scope very easy or satisfactory.
3452	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These ring flyers have a rubberized outer ring.  When it bounces off of cars, houses, doors, window, etc, there is no damage.  They fly perfectly (FAR!!!) and are super easy to catch.  I bought a few because we lose them over our fence, which leads to a cliff.  I don't mind paying the extra for them, because they are SO WORTH IT!

7699	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I do love this.  It seems a little overboard for this DIYer but I thought I'd better have it handy.  I took down plaster from lath and the N95 paper left me HACKING (on and on) and even worse, it felt like a heavy breather was on top of me with hot, wet breath.
3375	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This item is the perfect minimal investment to keep the Aussie trained with the Frisbee. I find them just slightly light on windier days but otherwise I can usually get the distance and speed to keep her going.

8691	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It seems like a lot to pay for a 'bit of foam', but I've tried many of the Airex alternatives found them all to be either too soft or too hard.  There might be a version available for a fraction of the price, but I reckoned I'd spend more money searching for it than a 'real' Airex costs.  So, I bought it.  I've used one many times at the gym, so I knew what I was getting.  Its great for balance exercises and some stretches I find essential after a day in front of a computer.  Yes, the one I bought is likely to start cracking and flaking and need replaced.  But, until it does I'll be using it most days.

These Black mountain lifting bands have 5 colors starting pretty easily, that get more stiff as you move up. When you get to #5, you can add the #1 to it to create #6. Some huge beast might be able to use 3 or 4 bands together to create a massive rubber resistant band but it would be very awkward to use.
2731	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Cheaply made and not great for stability. Go with something better made or a tire.
4390	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Use it every time we go camping (which is a lot because I live in Oregon). Make sure the surface you have it on is flat and not sloped to one side. Works great with a griddle!!!
3113	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Held up great to a week of international use on cement and brick floors, comfortable, folds up small, fits well in tents or tighter spaces than a twin size would, yet large enough for a good night's sleep in a sleeping bag.  Not especially warm or large for long term use in a home, but great for travel.

Much has been written about the Victorinox Swiss Army Knives and often the knife is overstated by well meaning but carried away people. Remember, all the tools on these knives are miniturized versions of the real thing. Despite the quality build they cannot accomplish everything the full sized tools can. The advantage is that you can still accomplish a lot and do so with a small fraction of the size and weight burden you would otherwise have carrying the "real" tools. The Craftsman is a great knife for man or woman and is sized perfectly and outfitted with the best selection of tools. Highly recommended.

I paid extra for the 'global' version so I can use it in the Southern Hemisphere (someday....). It's not a compromise, I see no issues arising from this in Northern Hemisphere use. I'm experienced at using a compass: I'm home (from fog on the ocean, mountains, unmarked trails, etc...) I like using a mirror compass because I can more accurately site distant landmarks and use these more accurate angles on my map to find my exact location.  I've got a similar Brunton that is battered after 30 years, this one will outlast me. The angle of declination, the local difference between magnetic north and true north, is set with a small screwdriver attached to the lanyard. This seems a good feature as the setting can't be changed by accident. I don't see any reason if for some reason this little screwdriver is lost that a knife tip or even twig can't be used instead.

It will always fly -- sometimes, too far (I don't know my own strength). It makes me want to go to a big park and see just how far it will go.

No nausea or lightheartedness. While cutting wood,  again no smell of wood or dust anywhere near my mouth or nose.

Scissors--again, are thicker and take up more space than a typical layer.  The scissors on my particular Craftsman are thicker and have a more curved lever than those of my Fieldmaster. Also, on older Craftsmans like mine, the scissor halves are put together with a screw instead of a pin, as on my modern Fieldmaster.  Problem is, the spring tends to slip out from under the lever more on my particular Craftsman, a problem that was improved upon by Victorinox before I purchased the Fieldmaster I had before. The scissors are still razor sharp on my knife.
I carry the smaller knife (don't know which one, but it has two blades - no pen - and is about 2/3rds the size of this one, lies flatter in my pocket, and has the one blade I use daily: it's either what they're calling the cut and picker blade or the emergency blade, and I use it as a letter opener. The "larger" "normal" blade I use for opening cartons and heavier envelopes. This knife, which I bought 15 years ago at the Mall of America (well, I had to come home with SOME souvenir) is perfect.

7253	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	All of my kids have had one of these scooters. We actually just bought 3 new ones because they literally loved them to pieces. Okay, okay-so it was the truck backing over them that made them into pieces but my kids can't get enough of them! The roll easily but don't seem to let the kids get going so quickly that they're out of control. One of my kids has some proprioception and balance issues and I was worried this might be too much for him. He never crashed and this has actually helped his balance and leg muscles as well. These are awesome!

4137	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Obviously I have hand guns and more than a few....Now that's out of the way!  All I can say is that even with a safe, I have found that trigger locks provide great peace of mind in preventing unauthorized people from using your firearm.  These master keyed "Master Locks" work extremely well and fit all my firearms.  I would highly recommend purchasing these locks.  I know there are some that don't like to use these locks and I wouldn't recommend this lock if your intention is to keep your home defense firearm locked with the hopes of unlocking it if or when someone is breaking into your house.  If that's your thought then I would highly suggest that you rethink that position and I would say this product is not for you.  But if you have several firearms and you are going to put them up or store them.  Then this is an extra level of security assuming that you are using a safe.  Anyway, this is a solid product that is very very easy to use.

The fox has a higher pitch. the storm is throatier. if you are not hindered in your breathing both are good choices. If you have breathing issues or are injured such that you can't blow hard, the All Weather Storm Safety Whistle, is so much easier to blow that there is no choice. The Storm is my whistle of choice in my emergency kit.

I worry that we maybe should have gotten a higher magnification, but after reading many reviews on several binoculars and many articles, we went with the lower magnification since these will be shared with our 7 year old, and I repeatedly read that anything over 7x or 8x can be a bit more difficult for kids. I am glad we went with the 35, though. Maybe later we'll get another one that is a higher magnification.

Some might think that $20 for a water bottle is crazy - I guess I'm crazy.  I used to carry a 'new' plastic water bottle to work everyday, then refill it from our water cooler.  I'm not as environmentally friendly as I should be, but there was an appeal to reducing the amount of plastic I was using.  Also, there are always concerns about a reused water bottle being clean.  This bottle seemed to take care of both issues, plus it is 'easy' to drink from - no dribbles.  Now I just wash it out with hot soapy water every couple of days and it is good to go!

2838	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	these were a pain to put on the back of our old razor scooter, compared to some custom light-up ones we had on there for four years... the hole the axle goes into is easily blocked by the spacer they have inside, because heaven forbid they use a thousandth of a cent more metal in there.
You'll notice some bad reviews on the sheath - however take note of how old the reviews are, they are from the first version of this knife which had an overly long choil and less of a cutting edge due to more serrations, and apparently a weird sheath. SOG has fixed these issues and it is a much better knife as a result.

I recommend this product.
6492	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I'll never forget my first experience with one of these. I saw the ad for one on TV when they first arrived on the scene and the promise of a frisbee-type ring that could literally break Guinness World Records was too good to pass up, so me and my buddies chipped in and sprung for one. We went to the local park in our neighborhood, which had (what we considered to be at the time, anyway) fairly sizable stretches of open ground that would be perfect for our needs. I kid you not when I tell you that we only got to throw it once. It flew for hundreds of feet on that throw, caught some air and actually climbed higher and higher during its flight before it got caught up on a tree branch with no feasible way of getting it down. These things are pretty ridiculous. You literally need a HUGE field to be able to play with these things properly and they can get caught on things (like tree branches) easily due to the ring shape. I'll still give this thing five stars because it does exactly what it says it does and it's a LOT of fun in the proper setting. I'd also suggest being careful with this thing. Not just in regards to losing it but if you play somewhere where there's a decent amount of foot traffic, you can take someone out easily. It happened to me and my friends with the second one we bought, when we used the Great Lawn at Central Park for our play area. One man walking by caught a throw square in the face while another one got a shot to the crotch. If you're not looking for it, chances are you won't see this thing coming being that it's so thin and so fast. I actually still have the second one in my possession and it's a great product but heed my words in regards to its capabilities and its potential safety risks.

I bought it online for a gift for my sister's kid this last Christmas. I can't go to the store because of my work and so resorted buying it online. At first i didn't know what to give them but as 1 browse amazon I think this is a pretty good idea of what to give her. All in all there were no problems. checking out online is very easy and their service is very good and reliable. they send me email on how to track my package and the packages have always arrived just in time before Christmas. My sisters kid was so happy with my gift because that's her dream present and I'm so glad I fulfilled it with the scooter, was awesome to see the smile on her face!

6179	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this elliptical after reviewing many different other ellipticals.  This is pretty easy to put together and it has a digital display.  There is also a nice smooth ride when using it.  I read some of the reviews for others saying that they heard clunking noise and parts would loosen but not so far with this one.  I've had i a month.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone plus I got free shipping so I couldn't beat that price.

4739	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Did a perfect job for first time campers. Very easy to use. I am sure there are models that have more features, but if you are looking for a basic camping stove, that gets things really really hot - I mean hotter than my home stove, then this is it.  We camped for three days, two nights and made many meals and snacks on this stove using one small bottle of gas.  The stove folds up into a nice compact shape too.
I'm a lifelong weightlifter and bought these to take on a several-month trip where I wouldn't have access to a gym.  They worked great once I got used to the difference of using resistance bands instead of regular weights.  I mostly used the red, black and blue together for heavier exercises like standing bicep curls (the bands passing under my feet to anchor them), took off the blue for tricep pulldowns and lat rows, used just the red for front and lateral delt raises, and so on.
I like this ball a lot, but I only gave it 4 stars, because I noticed that whenever we pick the "game ball" for our pickup games, everyone shies away from these balls.
1860	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great goal from Franklin for back-yard use.  We also have the Franklin 9ft rebounder.  It's been outside in Vermont winters now for 5 years, and it is still in great shape.

9031	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I buy these in XL because they are styled for Junior's or Misses. Even when I was an adolescent and young teen, I was curvy so I don't know why these designations exist. Regardless, I'm about a 12-14 in women's sizes, and use the Soffee brand shorts as sleeping clothes. Yup, I sleep in a pair of Soffe shorts and a t-shirt every night. That's the only reason I buy these. They hold up really well and I find myself replacing my set of 7 each about every 2 years. Each pair gets washed in a machine 1x week. That's over 100 washes each. Really, the only reason I replace them is because I put them in the dryer each week. If I air dried them, they'd probably last 4 years.
bottom line: if you have big hands this is your puller

3271	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect to put in the back of a car when traveling  around car camping.  A very large opening to use with an electric air pump.  Deflation is easy  due to the large opening. Very strong top so the risk of  puncture is  lessened.  Great product for the price.
The nice thing about this is that's it's smaller and less heavy than a twin mattress (and takes up less space when inflated), so it would be easier to carry with you.  But, if you have the room and ability to carry a twin mattress, I would just go with that.

6025	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Put on a 29er mountain bike without an issue. Very light weight and OK quality. I purchased this only because I like the design. The others were just ugly.

  the bands are strong and sturdy.  I have no problems lifting them overhead, clipping on 3 and 4 bands at a time.  I did buy some loop bands from discount-bands.com, which seems to be a part of Amazon.  they are unbreakable.  I do squats, shrugs, and heavy stuff with the loop bands.  the squats are great with the loop bands, with less stress on the back than a barbell.  Not much need for iron weights and the gym any more.  But I have not lost any muscle strength. with some thought, there is no muscle that resistance bands cannot work in a very effective way.

9869	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Bottom line, more distance, accuracy, control, portability, and fatigue is a non-issue, using my 9ft Daiwa and 9ft Shimano rods.  The two TU120's now sit in a corner in my basement, rotting away.

4300	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Having a pedometer is fantastic, and definitely inspired me to make sure I was more active.  However, this product is not up to snuff.  The first one I ordered was next to impossible to open, and returned to Amazon within a day.  The replacement I received worked fine, and then stopped working completely after 2 weeks.  I have decided to research pedometers and find a good working model that will work consistently for a reasonable amount of time.

1040	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These work well. It is easy to attach multiple bands for more resistance. They're easier to use that way if you loosely secure them together in the middle. The weight of each band isn't marked on the band itself, that I could find, which could be a nice addition. Overall, though, they are durable and do what they're made to do.
8523	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent scope, for the money.  Able to see a .22 caliber hole in the black of a paper target at 200 yards.  Can't beat it, for the money.  Compares well to much more expensive scopes.  The tripod is junk.  If you plan on using the scope past 75 yards, get a decent tripod.  The carrying and protective cases are nice.  I'd definitely buy it again.
3759	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I moved my old dartboard outside in the covered area near our fire pit, and put this one inside in the basement.  This is a solid, well made dartboard and the accompanying darts are good, basic darts.  I actually kept my nicer darts for the inside dartboard and will use these outdoors.  Overall a great, no frills dartboard and it seems like it is built to last for many years.

This is a very cost effective solution for car camping, tailgating, emergencies at home, and patio cooking.  I use ours exclusively with a refillable propane cylinder, so all of my experiences are based on that experience.  I like to move the bulk of our cooking outdoors in summer to keep the heat out of the house.  It's hot here, and not having that additional source of heat indoors just makes sense to me.  While I would love to have a dedicated summer kitchen with screens, our budget hasn't gone there yet, so I needed a more portable & adaptable solution.  I also do some canning, in small batches, which anyone can tell you is a hot & steamy process!

That's when I suggested a bed tent to my daughter as a solution. Hallelujah!  It worked like a charm! The tent was super easy to set up. The tent material and support poles are very durable. (Although keep in mind this is an indoor tent.) It's an added bonus that this tent is available in a race car design. My grandson loves cars. He may still need coaxing to take naps and go to bed at night, but at least he is sleeping in his bed. After all, what red-blooded American boy wouldn't want to sleep in a tent--especially a "car" tent? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

These are the 7 whistles I tested at 1/4 mile distance, over a hill and with general outdoor noise present (birds, wind, etc.), in order of loudness:
I experimented a lot longer from the right side. Throwing with my right hand is not natural, but I can do it. softballs, footballs, frisbees, whatever. This. Not so much. I got a few good results with the following: release the boomerang a lot sooner than you would any other throwing item (ball, frisbee). It really feels like I might drop it. I also can't let my elbow move too far from my body. Very unnatural and not like any other throwing object. Don't try to throw it hard. The docs talk about trying to hit the ground 100 feet away. Right. I have to give it a throw that might send it 50 feet. The harder I threw it, the less it worked. I tried all kinds of angles. The 30 degree angle from the top angle simply doesn't work in a slight breeze. You absolutely must throw it into the breeze or just slightly at an angle to it. It doesn't work at all with the breeze. Yes, I played with bending the tips as instructed too. I could definitely see flight pattern changes, but nothing that made it work in the breeze.

1064	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	So far, the door anchor and the lightest resistance bands have both snapped. When the door anchor snapped, I went flying across the room and landed hard. I was not seriously injured. The lightest resistance band snapped today and the carabiner part of it was rocketed into the ceiling with enough force to break anything remotely fragile. The scariest of all is that there is no indication that a part is going to break... it happens suddenly. I am nervous to continue using the unbroken products and will buy some free weights when I can afford them.

update July5,2012: something interesting I wasn't aware, on the back of the fox 40 whistle package is an International Whistle Code, [one blast: "where are you?", two blasts: "come to me.", three blasts: "I need help!", if you hear any of these signals, respond with one blast. each blast should last 3 seconds.] I cut it from the package and have it in my tackle box, may be very helpful when im out on a lake in my boat as I bought this whistle for fishing, if of course any one within hearing distance also knows the code.

160	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to get back into working out.  I was struggling to find time getting to the gym and I didn't see a point in investing in an elaborate work out machine or getting multiple weights to lift with.  After doing some research I decided to try this out.  First off, I like that it is light weight. I have taken this on one trip so far and it fit super easily in my luggage without any extra weight.  Second I liked how versatile this band is especially with the door weight.  So basically, the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises.  I found that the anchor was sturdy and I didn't have much trouble with it.  The band itself has seemed pretty sturdy along with the handles.  I've gotten some good use out of this band and have had no troubles with it.  I feel that I can get in a decent work out when I can't make it to the gym.

The nose bridge is not adjustable so if your head is very small or very large you could have double vision with these.  If so look for a goggle with an adjustable nose bridge.  I had trouble at first but when I got it adjusted correctly it was ok.  Quite good, clear vision and no leaks.
Overall, the product is exactly as you think, a blow up plastic toy designed to smack someone in the face without getting all that much hurt...
I'm 19 and I enjoy frisbee and me and my buddies go to the football field and throw it from 20 yard line to 20 yard line. Great for cardio (running it down and such). Easy to throw easy to learn. Don't use by trees tho, could get stuck up there because the thing flies without any actual effort.
3121	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These work fine with a sleeping bag but they're kind of a bear to inflate and deflate.
I have a concern about potential wear on these bands.  I received them in what I would consider to be nearly pristine condition, but running my hands along the bands, I can feel slight nicks in the rubber.  This could be normal, but given how rubber bands work, this could be a future concern.  For now though, it is merely a thought that I check after each usage.  Another concern here is in their usage and not so much a testament to the product.  It must be understood that because these are essentially giant rubber bands, they attempt to snap back to original form.  Make sure to take proper, sturdy, stances when using these.
4281	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This was a bad choice, they don't make this as they use to be.  The pen never worked, the red plastic came off after a few weeks, I had to use crazy glue.
The only thing I would do is call BMP before they ship your stuff, and ask them if you could order an extra set of handles to be shipped along with your order. It makes switching between bands (and therefore between exercises) so much easier! And the staff of BMP is super friendly and nice about it.
3281	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Made really well.  You can blow these up by mouth (which we did) in about 10 min.  If you use a pump, you will need an adapter.

7304	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old daughter.  We purchased the item at a very reasonable price and it was delivered in secure packaging.  She loves the color and the tassels and bell make it stand apart from other kids' scooters at the park.  (Several other girls asked if they could ride hers...there's definitely an appeal for younger girls!)  Our daughter doesn't really ask to ride it much, but that's less the fault of the scooter and more about our daughter's lack of coordination.  :)  Four star rating is because the handlebar does not stay up securely (it occasionally slips down) despite our efforts to tighten everything up.
UPDATE 8/2/13:  It's about 2 years later and this sucker won't die.  In my backyard braving the elements.  The net is still stopping balls.

4860	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to lay outside our pop up camper door. The rule is, you take your shoes off on the ground at the edge of the mat, then walk over it barefoot to enter the camper. It keeps the camper carpet nice and dirt free, and if the rules are followed, the mat stays clean, too. By the end of the weekend, there is always some dirt on it, but it is easy to hose off. I love how it folds up nice and small. Although I have trouble getting it to fold up so I can use the handles, but that doesn't really matter. I just stick it in the camper until next time anyway. I'm going to buy another one to give us even more clean space outside the camper. So far it has held together very well.
5194	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Overall, good ball for the price. Looks and feels great straight from the box. Nice tacky surface that is great for grip. Does what you would expect from a new basket ball. This ball is marked for indoor/outdoor play. But the tacky surface feels artificial and won't last long outdoors. It will lose the grippiness after picking up too much dirt and dust and the it will feel worn out. Keep it clean, play indoors and the ball should last a while.
5193	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	If you play outdoor hoops, this is a good value for less than $25.  I never bring an expensive ball to outdoor pickup games - harsh on the ball plus decent chance of forgetting your ball or someone getting it mixed up with theirs and walking off with it.

They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem, so the red, black, green, blue, and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance, which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design, but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty, just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed, and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again.

  Of course, to be truly doing yoga and not just exercise, there is much more than the physical practice involved, the mindset is crucially important. Bryan really goes into all this in his introduction. I personally like his introduction and feel it's helpful to listen through it before each practice to prepare you mentally for what is to come (that's just a personal viewpoint of course). All that being said, there is no doubt that if you do this program you'll be doing a VERY physical practice.

But if you thump the pieces together with a rubber mallet and don't try to get them apart again, it's a terrific piece of equipment.
  (b) There is no overcharge-protection circuit, the kind that allows you to leave the unit plugged in as long as you want without destroying the battery.  Again, such circuits are cheap and have been around for a long time.  And again, who wouldn't pay the extra buck or two to be sure the battery wasn't going to cook?

It has kind of a slow glide when it flies allowing you to easily predict its landing for the catch - that is if you are far enough away.  If you don't have wide open space, or have a lot of trees this may not be for you.  It easily gets stuck on branches because of the open ring design, much more so than a typical frisbee.  It would also be difficult to use in a neighborhood as it would easily be thrown over houses and fences.  On a soccer or open field, this thing is awesome!
I expect to get many more years of use out of this stove.  Definitely recommended.

I got a great workout from these bands and they offer resistance in a way that weights do not. Similar to working out with TRX... the moves may be the same, but the muscles it works may be different, or the same muscles may be worked in a different way. This is a great addition to any gym. I don't know what took me so long to get a set. I'm very happy with the system, the product, and the customer service (I called to talk with CS to ask them about a promotion they had noted in the paperwork. They were so nice. No sales pitches, no pushy reps, and no gimmicks, just a really nice guy who answered my questions, and was very friendly and informative).
6509	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Super easy to throw and catch, even if you're bad at frisbee.  This really does sail far, and little kids can still enjoy it, because it's so easy.  The only thing is... watch out for trees.  We had a whole-neighborhood event trying to dislodge one from a tree after it got stuck!  Everyone turned out and offered helpful advice... turns out the ideal thing is this weighted bag that tree removal experts use to get a line up high into a tree...
While the construction of this stove isn't bombproof its good enough and I expect this stove to last a long time.  My only gripes are that the tube from the fuel tank to the stove was crooked so I had to bend it to the right position and that the tank didn't sit firmly in the slots.  This was rectified by bending the fuel tank tabs downward to a sharper angle and its fine now.  Yes, it should come perfect out of the box but if you can't deal with small tweaks like this you probably shouldn't be using a white gas stove anyway.

The latter is not the intended use and I'm sure the manufacturer does not recommend this, but as a testament to the strength of the fabric and the stitching, there have been zero signs of wear or failure after hours of "field testing".

4252	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Overall this is really nice.  It contains many tools and pretty much all of them are useful.  I do wish the main blade was about twice as thick...it is sharp and high-quality but it is a bit on the flimsy side.  However, I have found the "hook" to be great for opening thicker plastic packages; just pierce the plastic with the point and the slide the tool back to the cut the plastic..  Also, I wish the tweezers were about twice as thick. The "ruler" is a bit on the useless side (they could've just laser-printed the smooth side of the nail file) so I wish they would find something more worthwhile to replace it with.  Overall I am very glad I bought this knife and I use at least one of the tools everyday, and have used every tool at least once.  Definitely recommend this compact little multi-tool.

2857	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The wheels on my daughter's scooter were really worn on one side I guess she leans more to one side than the other and they weren't spinning well.  She had to push more often than if she rode her sister's scooter and she is younger she was having a harder time riding her scooter.  I looked at couple different retail stores and had a hard time finding these wheels in pink.  When I did they were more expensive so I was happy to find them here on Amazon they were around $20.  They arrived quickly and my husband didn't have any issues switching out her old wheels and putting these ones on.  Wow, they made such a difference for her riding her scooter.  It was a much smoother rider and each push of her foot allowed her to go further than when her worn old wheels were on her scooter.  It was almost like she got a brand new scooter again because it rode so smoothly.  The scooter's hold up really well so it saved us having to buy a new scooter and just being able to replace the wheels.  Our daughter is happy and it was such an easy fix.
816	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I don't know what more to say than this is an absolutely sound product. It's durable and has met all expectations. My only complaint is that they don't have stronger bands, but I've counteracted that by just using multiple bands at once.

About the same price as local stores.
8725	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have been using them and really like them. handy. lightweight.
5871	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these based on the other reviews for the product.  The price was excellent and the fit is great too.  My son's legs are a little chunky and these still fit well.
My home has hardwood floors, and I was previously using a thin rug from a certain Swedish furniture store to do basic exercises on, like stretching, leg lifts, situps and push ups. It got the job done, but wasn't that comfortable. This mat has the right padding and thickness that I needed, giving my body full support for everything I do on it. If it wasn't comfortable, I'd say so. This is an excellent mat for anyone who might not have a very big area in their home for whatever exercise they might need this for. Pilates, tumbling, gymnastics, martial arts, throwing, yoga...there's a lot this small mat can be used for. It's easy to clean up any marks, and storage is simple since it can be folded in half and tucked away in a closet or under the bed when it's not being used. The handles are sturdy, and unless you -try- to rip them off, they won't be falling off any time soon.
With 6X magnification, you get more than enough range for common targets.  If you're looking for an economical way to improve your game or speed up play by spending less time in the hazards, then this is for you.
Hope this helps and keep loving life through exercise!

I bought this, and he loves it.  A small throw gets real distance, and it easy and soft to catch.
I suppose the only downside of this band it the inability to be able to change or add resistance.  Therefore, you will need a few different bands for differing exercises and uses.  The band included a door attachment, but frankly, with mos interior doors, it is far too easy to rip the door frame apart using it (or any other similar item).

Pliers--takes up the equivalent of two typical layers of a normal SAK.  If you've got an early Craftsman (pre-1987) it will have a fish scaler/ruler combo in place of them.  They're fairly small, meaning they're not good for big jobs.  They also feature a minuscule pair of wire cutters, which as a result of the narrow opening can't cut much more than the small wires founvd in the guts of electronic gadgets. For grabbing and gripping, however, the pliers are always handy.  I've freed stuck zippers on my jeans, and  pulled tarp to align the snaps of the bed cover of my grandfather's pickup with them. It has been said that the somewhat awkward positioning and the small size of the pliers on SAK's inspired the Leatherman.

I've had mine for over 2 years now and I use them at least 3 times a week.  I also keep one in my baseball bag to warm up before throwing, so with the dust and abuse, it is still holding up fine.  The door attachment can harm your wooden door if you place it wrong, however, I don't even use it; most of the time I just hook the handles together through a stable beam or something.
EDIT: I increased my review to a 4 star after using the bands a while longer and speaking to their customer service.  I also got a free orange band for my call.  According to customer service the bands can actually stretch safely up to 5 times their original size  (their max stretch is about 40 ft. although this makes them unusable).  After 3 weeks of overhead use they still show no signs of wear or tear.

Note to anyone wanting to purchase an air mattress for the first time. Every air mattress will slowly leak air over time. All air mattresses need to be re inflated every now and then.

I took this set on a trip to the Bahamas living on a boat.  Used them daily.  The variety of combinations gave great versatility to fine tune each exercise to my specific needs and strength.  I could wrap the bands over the main boom, around winches, around the mast, and just experiment and try different things.  Kept the workouts interesting and fun.  Imagine doing a weight workout on a pristine white beach with the crystal blue ocean in front of you in a balmy breeze in the shade of palm trees!  (yea it doesnt get much better than that!)

3384	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It might not fly as far as a regular Aerobie, but it still flies far!  Much further than a regular frisbee.  You need a lot of space to throw this. It also helps if you're already pretty proficient at throwing.  Otherwise you'll be doing a lot of running - when someone misses, they miss badly.

4115	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Bought these for my revolvers, wife's semi auto's and rifles. They lock on all of them. DO they stop the gun from firing? Not on a single one of the 11 firearms we tried them on. As I said yes the locks lock. The issue is with the post. It does not fit behind the triggers it fits in front of them and wit enough slack that with minimal effort (our 5 year old grandson can fire the weapons) . Now before you go off on how unsafe it is for him to do so it was a test. Controlled and with empty guns we are not idiots. After all it is the kids that will pay the price for this lock not working.
7238	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great value compared to stores
Update: Today, one of the two bands i bought, had a huge rip in it (it has been a little over two months since i started using) its not as durable as i thought it was when i started with them. I emailed BMP about the product warranty. They responded in under a day, i told them about my situation and they decided they would send me two ORANGE BANDS UPON MY REQUEST (one for my set where the handles detach and one normal one, orange is the heaviest band they have and isn't available on amazon). Excellent customer service!
4216	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to take up north to Grandma's for Christmas, where the kids got to see a foot of snow.  I figured it was a gimmick- but my kids never saw snow, and did not have any fort-building skills.  I wish I'd bought three- it was easy to pack snow in and stack, and the handle made it simple.  I doubt an experienced snow-fort builder needs one, but we had a great time

I use it for my P.T. routines as well as general resistance exercises.  They don't last forever; but they do last a long time and do a great job.  The door accessory works well to let you do cable routines just like on the cable machine in the gym (one of my favorites) .  Tones and strengthens without undo stress on the joints.

Especially if you are like me and not fond of bringing the beach home with you in your shoes, bags, chairs, etc...
1644	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This Franklin Sports Competition Soccer Goal goes together easy enough, and stands firm when it's hit by hard-kicked soccer balls, even if it's not secured to the ground.  Thankfully, we live near a park, and two people can easily carry it so the neighborhood kids can play in the park.  There's lots of comments in the Amazon reviews about how this thing may or may not stand up to weather.  The truth is that, over time, *nothing* is going to stand up to ultraviolet rays or water (the universal solvent). If you want this goal to last longer, just get a large tarp to put over it (we got one from Harbor Freight). We found that a couple of bungee cords hold a tarp in place quite nicely, minimizing water damage (aka rust) and keeping the net out of the sun. This unit is well-built. Keep it protected from the elements, and it will last a long time.

I haven't had any trouble with the screw on lid as some people have. It's very sleek looking, fits in my bike bottle cage and my car cup holder. I love that it's made in Switzerland. The brand is unobtrusive, so you don't feel like they should be paying you for advertising. I wish it didn't have a polymer lining but it's the closest I could find to harmless.

I use them on a fairly regular basis.
5942	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son. After a bit of a struggle two adults managed to get it together. Unfortunately every couple of hours the screw came loose and the trampoline would begin to fold up. By the next day the metal was broken. Very dangerous. Unfortunately, my son never got to use it and since it didn't get opened until Christmas my window to return it has passed. I would not recommend this product. Poorly made and very dangerous for anyone, especially kids.
1671	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Overall this is a nice soccer goal, and perfect for smaller yards.  The goal comes in pieces, with the metal poles requiring assembly into each other to make the goal itself.  This was fairly straightforward, and the goal seems strong and well built once I set it up.  My only complaint is that the net isn't really designed to go onto the goal.  It comes with little velcro straps that you have to use to attach the net to the goal.  I would have preferred if the net threaded onto the goal, or if the net itself had velcro or some other feature to allow a more seamless attachment to the poles.  This would have made a better overall design.  But for a simple goal that is relatively easy to setup, this is a nice option.

The other's largest guide insert shattered within a few hours of the first trip's start. I sent that back for an exchange.  The replacement rod's reel seat was missing large chunks of plastic, which I found in the bottom of the box, and have super glued back in place (not going to bother with a second return).  Given how unbelievably cheap these combos are (about $38 shipped for the 10'), I'm not surprised they're not durable.  I just didn't expect them to be this flimsy.
Last week, I wanted to get another one for a road bike and decided to go with this one instead -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Schwinn-20-Function-Bike-Computer/dp/B000DZD3FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Schwinn 20-Function Bike Computer</a>&nbsp;.. this one has a calorie counter too, but its bigger in size ..

4868	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I used these around couches in our house that had all wooden floors.  After our 1 year old got up on the couch and underestimated the ability of one's relatively large head to pull one's relatively small body right over the armrest, and I healed after making a diving catch just before said head hit the floor, we decided there was a better solution than carpeting the whole house.  These are big mats, so we put one on the fall-prone side of the sectional and one running the length in front.  They paid for themselves in saved medical bills at least a dozen times, and instead of tears we ended up with the laughter of a kid who came up unscathed from an epic tumble.  Since you can also just pick them up and move them to whatever new perilous perch your child has found, they end up being much handier than expected.
8274	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Definitely worth the price. I use it to carry my projectors around and it is extremely durable. Must buy.

UPDATE (Nov. 1st, 2012) - after shooting enough slugs (around 40+) to blow my shoulder off this scope no longer holds zero.  Gonna send it back to Bushnell for repairs. Not sure if I will put it back on my 20 gauge slug gun. Maybe put it on something with much less recoil. Still like the Circle-X reticle though and the glass and f.o.v. is 'ok' for the price.

707	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These resistance bands work perfectly as a 'travelling' gym. Admittedly I have so far only used the black, strongest band, but am experimenting with combinations. You will want to put the door anchor on the hinge side of the door.

Highly recommend as an option for those who travel a lot and want to do weight training, for those who don't have a lot of space for weights, and for those who need to do a gentler form of weight training due musculoskeletal or joint issues that require a gentler, lighter approach. Completely customizable to your needs.

This is very large once unforlded and comfortably fits two people. It's a bit bigger to carry (it won't fit in my beach bag) but it has a handle so it's not that inconveinent. It seems very durable as well. great purcahse!
BUT: They're well-built. GREAT price. And come with neat little carrying pouch and instructions for about 10 excersises. I just wish their directions gave more explanation (or visual depiction of your body) as to which muscles each excersise is supposed to workout (primary, secondary).

The board as it is could have been a 5 star, if only they had packaged with some foam on the sides and glued the edges.  Opened the box and found one side is broken, it was actually for good. Else I would have been dissapointed with the lack of bounce. I took some carpenter glue and ran it through the rail, then the board came up alive. It bounces well and we are having a great time now with the board. Hard to complain as the price was so cheap, with a small glue and 5 minutes of drying time I am very happy customer.
1615	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	All I can say is I'm glad that the lock broke when my bike was NOT locked up with it and when I did not have to rush out to pick up my son from daycare.
Using the chart will get you in the ballpark, and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need. But if you're going to be doing longer rides and recording your trips, then it is well worth the extra effort of taking your time and doing your own measuring.

8830	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This excellent exercise band provides steady, controlled resistance that demands correct form. Working with an exercise band allows the ability to exert the right resistance in the correct target area. After several years of hard use, the band (blue = heavy weight) continues to work perfectly. I also recommend the purple (highest weight). These Xertube resistance bands are a vital supplement to free-weights, providing smooth, targeted isolation of muscles, highly recommended for adding effective versatility to your workouts.

You need a huge space for it though. I have taken it to 2 parks with big fields and it always finds the closest tree.
The door anchor is decent; I have seen more secure versions but I still don't imagine this will be a problem. The anchor is smaller than what I'm used to seeing (I have always seen the "tube" style anchors, this one is a few small... things... inside the nylon) but it seems to work just fine. The anchor can go over the door, or on the hinge side of the door to adjust for height. Both these methods work great and are simple to set up.

The one that came with the carrier is as good a water bottle as I have had and equivalent to my other hiking and bicycling water bottles. Actually it is better than most as the black plastic section screws onto the main body so it will not pop off and get the bag or you wet.
6156	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very nice and super sturdy. My teen wants to get organized this year so I bought these because I know they last because I have this at work.
The colors, logos, etc. are all spot-on. This is definitely an officially licensed NHL product. I suppose that the "puck" could be used as a hackey sack. It may be a bit too light for that purpose though. The stick might be useful for toddlers or midgets. It is quite well padded, so no one is likely to get hurt if there is any type of high sticking incident.
5553	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We have had Franklin Soccer Balls in the past and our Grandsons loved playing football (soccer) on our property here in Texas. In their two year absence we have given them to a family with young boys, so when I saw the Franklin Sports Competition 100 Soccer Ball, Size 3, Black and White available as a Vine item I was quick to order it.

The only criticism I have at all with these workouts is that the stretch doesn't include the usual leg and lower back stretch in most of her other routines.  It includes only a stretch where you raise your arms above your head.  I simply take the time to do the stretches on my own that are on her other workouts, but find it odd that she goes to great lengths on the other DVD's to stress the importance of stretching, only to leave it out on this one.  Still, it doesn't really detract from the workout itself being an enjoyable one!

Cons: The padding is a little thinner than some others I have seen.  My biggest gripe is putting in the batteries.  It's a pain.  To pull out the ear cups is very hard and really hurts the fingers.  The two methods described, one is just pulling out the ear cups which feels like you are about to break the whole thing.  The other method is inserting a precision flathead screwdriver into a small hole to pry open the ear cup.  Well this ended up scratching the area and I don't advise on this method.  Also you figured 2 batteries would have been enough to power the whole headset but it requires 4.  A simple power wire across might have fixed this.  Per the instructions with regular use you have to replace the ear cups every 6 months, sounds a bit much don't you think?

10	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	If you're interested in exploring any area of New York beyond the metropolitan areas, this Delorme Atlas and Gazetteer is your best bet. Over the years I've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states, and they've come in handy when exploring out-of-the-way places, as I'm fond of doing. For me, this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks. I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas, thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads, and also show hiking trails. Because the maps are topographical, I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter, particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory. While I've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks, it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows.

1195	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This product is excellent. The bands are great and I like the door anchor as well. The company is excellent. They shipped quickly and I had a small issue with one of the handles and I set an email inquiring if I had an recourse, keep in mind I've had these bands for 6 months now, and they replied with just asking for my address and the exact product. I received them two days later at no cost to me, either for the replacement handle or the shipping costs which I feel is outstanding. The only question asked was my address.
Bought some adjustable dumbells and am much happier using the dumbells for almost all the exercises I would otherwise use with the bands. I still use the bands for a lat pull-down.
Edit 1:  *Deducted a star*  The replacement red band seemed fine, but after using it for a total of 18 hours, cracks started to appear, lots of cracks.  I emailed customer service and they're sending another.  What bothered me was they recommended I use multiple bands instead of stretching the band to their limit.  LIMIT??!  I have only used it according to the provided guide.  The bands are 40" long and are suppose to be able to stretch to 5 times that, which would be over 16 feet, roughly 3 times my height (5'8").  Exaggerations about elasticity?  Quality control issues?  Perhaps I was unlucky?  Maybe I'm stretching it wrong?

It's incredible for the price (and FREE SHIPPING). That said, it IS the same industrial quality as other items of its ilk, so just be patient. If there are no threads on one leg, just pop off the end cap - they'll be there. Some people have found assembly frustrating, but just follow the instructions given by at least two reviewers here. To those, I would add a warning: one of the bolted male ends may go too far into the socket to start the bolt in the threads. Just find a metal washer (they're either under the sink, in a drawer or in the garage) slightly less than the socket pipe's inside diameter and use it as a shim before you pop the vertical side down into bolting position. Your kid can help by sitting or lying on the insert side (in case you don't have 3 arms) while you use an adjustable wrench (not the tin thingie that comes with it) to bolt up. BTY, the plastic oops protector must be fitted before you thread the legs on. And no jumping FROM the back of the couch. TO the couch is ok.

These have a great low profile design.  My old protection caused issues with getting a cheek weld, whereas these do not.  The electronics have functioned great for the 6 months and 20+ times I have used them.  They offer great protection while allowing conversation.  They do not completely cut out like cheaper versions, you can still have a conversation with shots happening nearby.  They do become uncomfortable after a few hours of wear, but I've used much worse.

The scope I purchased had the Circle-X reticle. Using the standard 10" circular targets, the circle in the reticle encompases the target nicely inside at 100 yards. Since I'm shooting slugs out of this, I don't expect tight groupings.  My expectations is more like 5-8" inch groupings. Perfect for the kill-zone area of a deer and this scope does what its suppose to do and still takes the recoil without flinching.

If you think you need to have 24 power, then move up to the Bushnell Elite series or equvalent at around $700+. Good optics are are so important and most people elect to go cheap on scopes and rings after putting a lot of money out for a quality rifle.  For shooting 50-200 yards, consider a Nikon Prostaff Target EFR 3-9x40 AO Matte Precision Reticle, at twice the price of the Tasco and be happy once and for all.

1026	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am doing the P90X 3 program, which requires you to go from one exercise to the next without rest. Changing the resistance bands quickly and moving them from place to place is a bit of a hassle. For example, I will use them for a pull up alternative with the door mount, but then I will use them for curls for other shoulder exercises which require a lighter load. So I have to pull the bands all the out of the door mount, remove a couple of bands, do the exercise, put the bands back on and re-thread it through the door mount. Because of the alternating nature of the program, this gets annoying really fast.

"It got a bubble" - Maybe there are compasses out there that will never get a bubble but having used several brands and models, I don't know of any. I confess - my 8099 compass developed a bubble when I took it out on an early winter camping trip a few years ago. Cold temperatures do that to compasses because the damping fluid within the capsule contracts.  Set them out in the sunshine on a hot summer day and the bubble goes away (or at least shrinks to near nothing). Anyway, since this compass doesn't use a traditional needle, bubbles present no functional problem.

1067	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a pretty decent set of resistance bands. The only thing I would change about it, is that the band themselves are a little bit long. When you put the attachments on them, they are too long to do some of the exercises I would like to do. I have tried to tie the bands in knots to remedy this, but they are very hard to untie, so I try to avoid doing that. Also, if you call the company after you get your package, they will send you a free orange band, which is even stronger than the strongest band in this pack. That was a nice little bonus!

I give this scope 5 stars while taking the price into account. I would not say that it comes close to a Leupold or Shepherd scope. But I would, however, put it up against a higher line Weaver or Nikon scope. Considering the price, that says a lot. This scope is very bright... the amount of light that comes through is impressive. After playing with this scope on my AK-47 for a while, I used it to replace a Weaver K6 on my 30-06. The difference in clarity and light gathering is huge. I have no issue at all in taking out a small animal like a rabbit at dusk at the 200 yard range. That's overkill for a rabbit, but it would be easy to do with my rifle/scope combo.

I just got these resistance bands in the mail and tested them out for a bit. The quality appears to be fantastic and the price is right! I'm a student and the gyms in my area are too far and too expensive. These bands seem to do the trick. They are cost effective and from my limited use seem to give you the experience of working out on a machine (or should I say, the experience of working out on multiple machines depending on the configuration you choose).

If you have questions, post a comment, I usually respond within a day.
Holy cow is it impossible to steer!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I have experience with canoes and kayaks and I almost got stuck in our tiny little pond because the end of the oars kept unscrewing and there was too much give in the spot that holds the oars on the boat.  If you're experienced with row boats this might work out for you, but it was not fun for me.  I couldn't get home fast enough.
7875	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Wish I had these sooner. Lets me hear my shooting buddies while still protecting my hearing. There is some background static/noise when turned up very far, but it's no big deal. I don't know why there are seperate on/off/volume knobs for each earpiece.
4682	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works very well and powerful
I also felt like I was going to fall into the water.  I've been in inflatable boats before but this one felt like it was going to sink at any moment.  This wouldn't have been a huge deal except it turns out that while the pond is pretty from far away, it's absolutely disgusting when you're sitting above it and I didn't want to touch the water, let alone swim in it.  So if you're in a bathing suit, that's great, but if you really actually don't want to get wet this may not be the boat for you.
6806	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent thank you
5187	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The thing that sets this ball apart from other basketballs is it's "tacky" finish, which helps with gripping.  I can't say that I would pick this finish over the regular one, but I also wouldn't be bothered by it.  I would guess it's just a preference of feel. This ball has been really durable and seems to hold up just as well as any other ball we have purchased.
7480	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My granddaughter was disappointed when her twin sisters got scooters for Xmas.  Instead of a scooter I thought she would love the original American Girl Doll....Needless to say when Spring arrived she was constantly in trouble for stealing one of her sister's scooter.  Saw this on line and decided since it was her favorite color to buy it.  Was very impressed for the price the quality was unbelievable.  She was spinning around our driveway and doing her turns like a pro..... Very satisfied.
9567	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've used these fenders for years and they fit my needs perfectly.  I use five of them with my 28 foot boat.  They are incredibly strong, hold air well, are easy to inflate and easy to clean.  They leave no marks on my while hull and they look OK even after several years in use.  Since they are almost the de facto standard at around the Pacific Northwest, you can find lots of accessories such as bow racks and covers for them.  The only problem is that others like them too and they occasionally disappear from my boat.  I recommend them highly.

472	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Although I have used resistance bands with the Physical Therapist and also with my Bowflex, this is the the first set of Bands that I have purchased.  I really enjoy these resistance bands, they are a safe way to perform practical, strength building exercises and they can be taken anywhere.  The resistance bands have helped me recover from Knee Surgery and also from Tendonitis. This is a great set for a great price and I recommend it to people of all body types!
I would highly recommend this product if you and or your family are hard core campers who camp more than 4 times a year.  Happy Camping!
If you already have good balance, strong ankles, etc., you may not like this product, as it might be too easy for you.  I have always had weak ankles and I have been having problems with balance as I've aged (Now 75) and I find this balance pad to be quite useful.
8426	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I find for the money this is a good rifle scope. This scope is not made to shoot iron targets at 1000 yards. It is made to hunt with. It is very reliable,and shoots straight. It shoots as good as some scopes that cost a lot more money. It gathers light well. And most hunters in the woods done't take two hundred yard shoots .

9034	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The fabric of the shorts is a 50-50 blend of cotton and polyester and has a nice finish.  In the picture the shorts appeared to have a white accent waist band, but upon receipt, I realized it is simply the elastic waist band turned down [confusing].  Also, the elastic is not encased in the fabric on the inside next to your skin.  After some wear in the heat it became quite uncomfortable an irritated my skin.
Just rub it in really good after applying.
9701	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this product for years and have always been very satisfied with the results on moderately oxidized fiberglass.  My only complaint was that I couldn't buy a bigger bottle.  Apply this product with a rotary buffer using a woll pad, or by hand with a cotton rag.  I apply it to the pad and then spread it around with the buffer off, before starting at the slowest setting (600rpm on my buffer) and then working up to 1,400rpm.  Buff it out by hand with a clean cotton rag, turning the rag frequently to expose a clean surface.  This is really a cleaner more than a wax. It should be followed by an application of a protective liquid wax (I use 3M Liquid Protective Wax with ScotchGuard).  If you have heavy oxidation, use 3M Restorer Wax instead of this product for your first pass.  You may even wish to do three separate applications; Restorer Wax, followed by Cleaner Wax, and finished with Protective Wax.  Though, if it's really that bad, you'll probably discover your hull is in need of a wet sanding.  This product is a good thing to keep on your boat at all times, along with a couple bags of rags (one for clean, one for dirty), so you can quickly clean spots you notice while you are out enjoying the water, or to touch up at the marina before guests arrive.
4643	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is just like your dad's Coleman stove, only with some improvements. I needed a new camp stove so I bought the Coleman ol' green trusty. It seems to me that the metal on the outside is sturdier than it was when I used these almost every other week as a Boy Scout (20 years ago). The gas flows well and can be connected to a 5 gallon tank with a hose and tree (sold separately). But, works as intended with the small green Coleman propane tanks.

PRODUCT: in reading the reviews, some people have had the product break on them within the first several uses. I haven't noticed any indication of weakness, seems to be well constructed but i will be looking out for this. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE DOOR ATTACHMENT PROPERLY, if you do, you should have no problem with it flying at you face.
I read complaints about multiple tools coming out when you pull one out, that's true.  They do.  The smaller tools are also a bit difficult to get out.  I have to use both hands to get any of them out... I don't know how you could do it with just one hand.  I like the tool covers as well, they work quite nicely to eliminate the pain of really cranking down with the pliers that you might experience with other multitools.

Fast Delivery - I ordered the variety option and received a red Frisbee.
4556	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I agree that the stoves knobs keep turning themselves back up, but there is an easy fix for it in the review below mine. We needed a stove for a car camping trip a few weeks ago and bought this locally. We were just reheating food that we cooked up at home and froze for the trip. Normally we overthink everything and overspend on items like this but this time we went with the basic stove. Other than the knob issue, which I intend to rectify as described in the next review, the stove performed just fine. It isn't worth a star deduction in my opinion. It's quick and easy to set up. We cooked 3 breakfasts and dinners on ours and still had not used up our propane canister.  It would have been nice if coleman had put a clamp inside it to hold the adapter when it's not being used but I just wrapped it in a piece of flannel and put it under the grate with one end in the hole in the center of the back. Any food that got splashed or dripped on area below the grate was easy to clean off. It cools down quickly. I used a long grill lighter for starting it.
The only complaint I'd have is that the knob is VERY sensitive on ours. There is a fine line between OFF and 75% full on. It's fine, we just know to be sensitive with the knob.

In the end, this scope reminds of the old 80's Bushnell Trophy in more than just looks.  "Back in the day," I thought the Bushnell Trophy was a heck of a lot of scope for not a whole lot of money; a rare case of getting performance and capability beyond what one was paying for.  The old Bushnell Trophy wasn't a great scope, or a "World Class" one, but it was "better than good" at a price point filled with competition best described as "not good enough to be of any real value."  In rating it, I've tried to avoid doing so on a "yeah, but for the price" basis and focus on the performance it has or has not.  Like the old Bushnell Trophy it reminds me of, this Tasco model might not really be "World Class" but, so far at least, it seems better than good.

I will say this though, their are 3 wheel models out there that both my 7 and 4 year old like a lot better than this two wheel razor.  The three wheel ones are a lot easier to control and most have a fixed front wheels which my kids like better.  They are more expensive, but I think they are worth it over the 2 wheel versions.  Again this one is good. . . kids love it, just something to think about.

The only downside is that I've really only found use for it on large fields (football). Yes you can toss it slower, but at that point it feels heavy and awkward, like I'm play horseshoes.  I still use my regular frisbee for low-midrange tosses.

Update:  After letting these sit for a year and a half, I decided to give them another try.  Well, one of the pads was missing.  Really? The pad fell off while just sitting on a shelf.

Blades:  Wharncliffe and the standard Classic blade.  The Wharncliffe is supposedly useful as a letter opener.  The other blade is the same as on every other 58mm model.  All Victorinoxes I've had have had blades that came sharp and stayed sharp.  I had to sharpen my Fieldmaster once a few months ago in the 10 years I had it, and as I was only about 8 when I bought the knife, I abused it and did stuff it likely wasn't supposed to!  The blade on this used knife was still sharp. Don't expect these to do the same jobs one would expect from any of the larger frame sizes.  But, that's why I recommend owning more than one (or in my case, close to a dozen!) Swiss Army Knives.

On the front of the boat, there is a "knob" where you can put the pull string rope (or whatever you want to call it).  If you hold on to that, and pull it, the spot where it is attached with DETATCH from the boat, causing a huge hole, and a fast deflation.  It was my fault for taking it in waters that were not calm, but the fact that it detached is worrisome since it makes a HUGE HOLE when it comes loose.

The weak link for these exercise bands is that the tinniest nick or cut can lead to the tube breaking (this is true of all brands). There are now exercise tubes sold with a cloth wrapping around the entire length of the tubing but these cost much, much more. I simply wrap an old t-shirt or towel around the part of the tubing that I am standing on, or that is placed through the door attachment, or that is wrapped around a post.

Assembly: The unit goes together somewhat easily. Package included 2 bolts and washers with a wrench, six legs and the blue outer cover used to conceal the elastic bands.  The mat and four frame polls are partial assembled out of the box.  I was able to get the unit assembled by myself; however with the tension it may be necessary for some to have additional assistance.  I was able to assemble the trampoline in about 5-10 mins.

Update October 2011: Used it all summer, no problems and I'm 100% happy with this bike rack. On my 4Runner, I can lift the tailgate with one bike mounted on the rack, causing no damage to vehicle but it is heavy and would cause the gate to slam shut if I was not careful. I don't recommend this procedure., but sometimes you just need to grab something without removing the bike!
5812	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	While the picture may seem to represent STURDY devices, and while I thought the ORANGE sections were covering hard NUTS, it's just a facade.  I bought these because I wanted to protect my child's elbows and knees, and I feel scammed.  They should indicate TOYS ONLY WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR CHILD IN MOST CASES.

NOTE:  I first bought an off-brand clone from Walmart to replace the Coleman one that failed.  I am not immediately able to find the exact name, but it was *not* equivalent.  On the Coleman one the spigot assembly is mounted on the side of the body and points down.  On the off-brand one the spigot assembly is mounted on one edge of the body and points back towards the bottom of the body at about a 45 degree angle.  I was unable to find any way to position the jug and spigot assembly so as to make it convenient to use.  I hate it.

8248	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have owned several compasses over the years and I was looking to upgrade. And boy did I ever find the jackpot! The Suunto MC-2G was the answer. Easy to read, simple to use and easy to set the declination. I went through several other options but they all had problems. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy the best. The Suunto lived up to all the hype. I opted for the Global (G) model because it will work anywhere in the world. Not that I will ever get everywhere in the world but a guy has to plan ahead. :-)  For a compass to work correctly it has to be designed to work correctly in that part of the world in which it is being used.(I never knew that--did you?) This Suunto works correctly wherever. Great for orienteering or running a line across country and the needle settles down fast. You will not be disappointed in this compass.

8054	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These are fun to play with and do come back.  Make sure you have plenty of open space as these fly pretty far.  Also if you have ever used a real Boomerang and know the fear that comes from a solid wooden rang hurling back at your face then don't fear.  These Aerobies are very soft and aren't going to hurt you.
Pretty much all the issues I had with the Leatherman are not issues with the SOG. The opening action is butter-smooth, and the pliers don't grind against the handle when closing the multi-tool. The tools in the handles come out VERY easily without having to do any "break-in" nonsense, or loosening the screws. The handles have smooth edges that make it very comfortable to use.
The thunking stayed, and my wife re-emerged with her broom.  I hit the Amazon website, furiously re-packed the Eclipse in the original shipping container, and *poof* a UPS man appeared immediately to whisk it away, muttering that he hated lifting three hundred pound boxes.  My wife hit him with the broom and he stopped whining.

No room for a lat pull-down or other cable equipment. This product is perfect to replace that need.
I had no problems with leaks.  I understand some of the other reviews complaining about the flow rate but I didn't think that was an issue.  If you're using one of these you likely want to conserve water, a lower flow rate helps control waste.  And if you need a faster flow, just push on it from the top to add some water pressure.

Finally the overall product. When it comes to being physically active I like simplicity. Free weights, a pull up bar, a bench press in the back yard, and now this mat. I can't stand bulky single purpose contraptions, I hate wasted space, and personally for me if i'm in the mood. BAM! Get it out. Get to work. Store it when I'm done. Functionality wise, my cousins can use it as a makeshift bed when they're drunk, and make unexpected visits. Worst case scenario rough day at work, I can prop it up against a wall and punch it. Or I can use it to do sit ups. It solves a problem, it serves a purpose. I'm satisfied. 5 Stars.

Several weeks ago I ordered the Suunto MC-2DLIN from Amazon (great service as always) for evaluation.  I own a number of Suunto compasses and have used them in some pretty harsh environments (Middle East) and I've always been impressed with the quality of the company's products.  Suunto is the ONLY brand of compass I've owned where the needle capsule did not develop air bubbles.  I can't say the same for some other well known brands, particularly Silva and Brunton.

It is almost hard to make a bad throw.

2321	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I can use this tool for just about any activity such as changing out an ATM fuse on my jeep too cutting and splicing wires at home and I can even saw down small or medium size trees for a camp fire. The pliers has jaws like a Pit bull once they lock they don't stop, of which I like various options of use for this magnificent tool. I was a leather man only but with this tool I prefer SOG hands without question

I am going to keep the net longer outside and will update the review if anything changes regarding the net.

6885	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Nice, thick plastic - holds water well. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the water kind of trickles out of the nozzle...that could be designed to release a bit faster. But overall works as it says.
The detail is beautiful and the quality impeccable. For those complaining about the size, it's all in the product details, so not sure why there are complaints. Coming from Brunton, I know it's a high-quality product, as they are known for their optics and I've used Brunton products for other hobbies. Some engravers wouldn't touch it; others would (for a hefty price tag). I opted not to get it engraved and I wish, now, I paid the extra to do so.
THEN, the smell is overwhelming.  I'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute.  It does say "Keep away from open flame".  But, I think this is more like "Do not light a match while this is in the room".


7667	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great product. Fast shipping. Works well. Battery installing is kind of a pain but not terrible.

9068	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	First this is a great price for any pants. This is why I shop online. These pants should be available for men too. There is no way to tell pants apart anyway. These are great for summer. They are a bit too short for biking because they fold up while you ride so it gets uncomfortable, but for running these would be great. It feels great on the skin too. Overall a great product for men and women. Though I must say it would look much better on a skinny women than a guy. (my opinion).

2566	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great!
It is a fun "toy" and it really flies well. Highly recommend it if you have the space.

The included pole anchor works great and is very handy.  Having 2 of these (from the 2 orders of the product) makes for a good cable machine substitute since I will anchor these to the poles on my squat rack (I have the base of the squat rack weighed down by a couple of 70 lb dumbbells to make sure it doesn't move).

UPDATE 9-09: My son is now 10 and I have a 5 yr-old daughter. This trampoline has lasted through tons of use. We continue to find fun things to do with it. We have used it on the end of a dock to jump into water. It has been part of 'obstacle' courses. It is great for exercise and balance. The only thing that has given a little is the blue outer ring. Not a big issue but with multiple children using it for over 6 years, there are some tears to the vinyl. Nothing a little duct tape won't fix! The trampoline base has no signs or wear or deterioration and the legs are solid and straight.

9674	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Works great helped with the storage space I needed. It's a little droopy in the middle though but it did come with stuff to fix it if I was willing to drill holes in the t top.

I have given the Hydrospex goggles as gifts!
2670	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I used this to float down a stretch of the Batsto river in Pine Barrens of NJ. You have to sit in it backwards for better stability and floatation. Think of it more like an innertube in terms of expectations of steering and maneuverability. The river is slow and winding, and this thing was not easy to "row" backwards--kayak paddling would be better. It was light enough to hike in 7 miles, and it made a pretty comfortable couch when in camp for the night. It did not puncture even though I was constantly going into branches and little deadheads--but bring patching tape just in case. I fit a large dry sack (with all my backpacking gear) in between my legs in front of me. I'm 6' and had my legs slightly bent, but it was very comfortable (more comfortable for long durations than kayaking).
A year ago when she was traveling abroad, she forgot to put her Swiss in her checked in luggage. Of course TSA checked her purse and made her throw it away, with an option of mailing it home for some exorbitant costs. So she tossed it in the trash. Just recently she told me she misses her Swiss but wanted the exact same model as she had prior. I finally found it on Amazon, and bought it for her again. The thing to note here is that her previous Swiss lasted her over a decade! She's elated I found the exact model and purchased it for her. I'm just happy to make my mom happy...for a mere $35.

9865	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	First time I used this rod today, I know its sole purpose is used for surf fishing, but its 15 foot length, is very good for casting anywhere. Caught me two catfish earlier today using anchovie bait. It is true what they say about the rob sticking at the sections, but knowing this ahead of time from user reviews, I put them in slightly, an even better idea is to iol the sections prior to use. Pros and cons as far ive used it, pros would be its extremely long casting distance, cons would be its sticky sections, and since its 15 foot long, it can be sorta heavy. But all in all, this rod stood up today, and I would recommend this rod to anyone who wants to cast just a bit further from the shore.

3412	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My kids love this thing! I'm basically a frisbee (flying disc, whatever) collector. Well, I have maybe 3 or 4 of my own with varying weights. I grew up playing frisbee (again, flying disc) my whole life on the beach as a kid. I want my kids to gain a few important skills in their lives (how to ride a bike, how to swim, how to skate/skateboard, and definitely how to throw a 'flying disc'). These rings are the perfect weight and size to get really young kids (my daughter is 5 and digs this and is learning well) up and going and my son (9 years old) is a pro at frisbee because he was 'trained' on this. I love to throw it as well. We have the bigger disc, which will sail above and beyond everything else in the world, and this one gives you a bit more control for shorter (but still very, very long) distances. The weight is very balanced, the product is extremely solid. I would imagine that a lot of throws into the street would shorten the life (as the outside of the disc is rubber), so heed that. When it's veering one way or the other, there is even a reminder written on the top of the disc which way to bend it to get it on track better (which works really well). A few words of caution. This thing, when landing on a roof, will stay for a VERY long time. Nothing much will bring it down (wind, rain, etc.) because it is very flat and weighted. I've lost 2 of them (the bigger ones) this way. Also, if you play in water (like the beach), it will sink indefinitely. Then you can say goodbye.

2365	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	When I saw this knife I thought, "This will unzip a deer like nobody's business." Turns out I was right. This little knife is the best field dressing knife for deer I've used (or even seen). It's razor sharp right out of the box and stays sharp through the whole job of field dressing and skinning. A few strokes on a sharpening steel and this one's ready to go again. I haven't liked folding knives for field dressing before because they tend to get gummed up and are difficult to clean out. The E-Z-Out Jr cleans up very easily with just warm water. One tip I can pass along is that the tip is very sharp and can easily puncture the guts if you're not careful. I lay my index finger along the back of the knife and just over the tip then insert it under the skin, sharp edge up and 'unzip' the chest and paunch. Its compact size makes this very easy since the whole thing fits in your hand. Working inside the body cavity is just as easy for the same reason. It fits in your hand so the end of the knife is never far from the end of your fingers. That way you don't accidentally cut your other hand or something you don't want cut.

Original Review:
2756	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For the price this boat was just right. I bought it for a 11 & 9 year while at the beach. They were able to set it up themselves using an electric pump. The ocean was a little chopping..but that didn't keep them out the water. They spent hours on that thing and had a blast. At some point...I jumped in and another adult, and the kids jumped in it too, just for fun and the boat held up nicely. Didn't lose air..it's sturdy and the paddles worked well. Will def buy again! It's awesome!
1142	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to strengthen myself after a car accident and my physical therapy has finished. I have been using these for about 6 weeks and I have found this is better quality than others I have used. The bands have very good resistance.

I would not want to float around out in the ocean for days on this thing but for several hours it did the job. This mattress is much better than a thin sleeping pad and for the price I was surprised it held up for several years. The material is the same as the bigger mattresses so its not bullet proof. If you use some care it will last a long time.
I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime's universal mounting kit and 5/16" Red-Head masonry anchor bolts.  It's not the mount that's the problem, it's the back-board itself.

With this, using a small piece of soft leather, I rubbed on both my wife's and my bows' strings, we have yet to find a complaint against it. It's a lot of work putting it on, and making sure the wax is melted and infused into the string, but the work is well worth it.

3458	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Our Jack Russell Terrier/Dachshund mix loves to play frisbee and we haven't found any frisbee she likes but this one. We've tried many different dog frisbees, and she doesn't like any of them - unfortunately, because they hold up to her chewing a whole lot better than this one!!!  So we have to buy her a new Aerobie ever 3 or 4 months, but she just LOVES this thing.  She quivers all over when we bring it out and she can hardly contain her excitement.  This frisbee goes fast and far, but she is a little speed demon chasing it.  Although it wasn't made for dog use and can't stand up to her teeth for as long as we would like, it is worth every penny because it brings her so much joy.  I ordered some 13" Aerobies by mistake last time, and although they were bigger than she is and would trip her up when she was carrying them, she still loves them.  These are excellent flying frisbees for humans, too, by the way!!!!

After repeatedly putting it back together again you'll figure out the joints to bolt.  Works like a charm now.

The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump, nor did it come with a plug. So basically it was unusable, as you can't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it's inflated.

The kids have tried to play with them, but mostly just jokingly mimicking me.

update June 2012 .. I have used it for around 300 miles or so ... The only issue I had last month was that the clip that holds the unit on to the bike was getting loose and i was worried that it would fall down. And it happened couple of weeks back when i rode over a bump on the road and it flew off my bike onto the road. As i was going downhill and had some speed, it bumped around at 20-30 times before it stopped. When I picked it up and put it back on, it was no longer working. As it was working without any other issues and as the bike had all the other attachments intact, I decided to give it one more try and bought another one.

They are super comfortable to wear, easy to put on, no weird tags or seams irritating the skin. (Yes, they do have seams sewn on the inside, but these seams didn't irritate my skin like some fabrics and clothing seams do.) I actually just ordered a bunch of Soffee shorts in a bunch of crazy fun prints and patterns here on Amazon just yesterday, but I went with one size smaller than that which I ordered here, as I purchased these to wear to the gym, and have been and will continue to go to, and therefore weight will be lost.

3192	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very good quality for the price, a little heavy for hiking. It is very comfortable and farly easy to blow up. It is worth the extra weight as the foam pads are worthless if you are over 40

7236	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great scooter! My 6 year old loves this one because you have to balance on it (rather than their being 2 front wheels)
3507	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love this frisbee. The edge makes it easier for my dog to pick up regardless of which side it lands on.
I wish these bands came flat so I can use it with bare feet, but from what I can tell, I REALLY want to conquer it and be able to pull it over my head so I forgive it. All in all, it's a pretty good quality and at least it won't be getting torn up like the previous one! But now I may need to think about investing in indoor workout shoes....
It's worth noting that the lock has a long lock barrel as you can see from the photos. It makes guns much wider once the lock is installed, so it may interfere with storage cases.

Great price and it travels well whenever I go on trips, but don't want to miss out on 'weightlifting'.

The legs screw right in easily. Seems well built. No spring design which I like, less stuff to break or scrape your feet on.
3182	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My initial impressions of this fabric camping mat are very good unlike other Intex air mattresses I have had in the past. I bought three of their air beds and all failed within 90 days with leaks, tears and ruptured seams. I wish that they used the same fabric with this mattress on their air beds, maybe they would hold up better. It wasn't hard for me to blow up as I had an air compressor with the proper attachment to do the job. Unfortunately the compressor did not like this mattress as much as me, it blew up right after I inflated the mattress. Oh well.... Anyway, I put this on top of my camping cot and it is quite comfortable but just a tad narrow for the cot. It's long enough but if I lay on my back my arms don't really have enough room to rest on the mattress. Not a big deal. I slept well on it. I do hope this will hold up over time better than the other Intex stuff and I will definitely update my rating if it expires prematurely. It was so cheap I had to give it a try.
6446	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Need open space but awesome

6152	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This was just what I needed for organizing workbooks for homeschooling. No plastic here; metal through and through. Incredibly sturdy, but weighs a ton, so don't plan to use it on a flimsy table.  It is exactly the same dimensions and construction as the 5-compartment MMF Industries Steel Vertical Organizer (I bought the 5-compartment one first, and liked it so much I tried the six, to accommodate a couple extra things); the only difference is that on the 6-compartment one, each compartment is only about 1 3/4 in wide, while on the 5-compartment one the compartments are about 2 1/4 in wide.  My only (small) concern is I wonder if the end walls will eventually be leaning out, because they do flex a little under the weight of the books if the books are leaning toward the outside. Overall, extremely happy with it and would buy another one in a second (but I only have 2 kids).
Handle: Made from real bone, giving the knife a great appearance and sure grip.
Overall: they work.  Good for light workout.
9963	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The drag adjustment wheel wouldn't stay where I set it.  The drag was too light even when set at the highest level. I contacted an authorized Daiwa service center and I was told that there must be a stripped part.  I also had intermittant reeling problems like something was interfering with the gears.  I ended up returning this reel to Amazon for a refund.  I was very disappointed with the reel considering the majority of reviewers had good things to report about it with the exception of the adjustment wheel issue.

5348	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	One of the better pairs of swim goggles I've owned.  I bought the tinted smoke gray color and they are quite heavily tinted but still fine for indoor swimming pools.  Although they are well constructed and fit very comfortably they're still very light.  I've kept the goggles in the case they came in when not using them and over the past 6 months they've remained scratch free.  The anti-fog protection still works fine despite everyday use in a saltwater pool.  I rinse them in fresh water after every use--no other special care.
Had it sent directly to his house and it was a success. Only minor problem was that he said there were only 9 in what was supposed to be a 10 pack. Did not see it myself so I don't know if the box was damaged and one fell out or if it was just short shipped. Never the less he was ecstatic with his gift and I might send him another round for Christmas.

1832	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We've only had these for 6 practices and one game. They've been holding up great with all those little cleats running over them. I like that they are thicker & heavier than other brands I considered. However, I wouldn't use metal cleats on a rubber product. Really, for the same price there are many products which are inferior as far as thickness & durability go. Also, the "tread" on the bottom helps keep the bases in place. Obviously, if the grass is wet or the dirt is dry, they're going to slip...these aren't designed to compare to a secured base. Don't have unrealistic expectations. Still, I'm loving our set & think it should make it through the season. They fit in one of my baseball gear bags, but then it becomes too heavy & no room for helmets or catcher's gear. Got a collapsable wagon for the bases, tee, net, & gear bag.  Some have complained about not having a pitchers mound.  It'd be a nice inclusion, but for tee ball, we don't need it. Besides, temporary mound rubber would only mark distance, not give a push off point. I'd like one, but it doesn't seem real necessary for the price.
The Sprint is very easy to throw accurately and is great for both beginners and seasoned veteran throwers.
Can handle a heavy person (230 lb) without hitting ground

519	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love this set and would definitely recommend it. It's a very comprehensive set that is easy to set-up. The varying bands definitely provide increased intensity which I like from other sets. They can easily transition between arm sets and leg sets using your body weight or a door jam. You simply slide the band into the included door wedge and close the door on the wedge. The comfort handles are easily attached with a carabiner styled system. The handles are very comfortable to use. The system seems secure and of a solid quality for long use. As a woman without a lot of existing upper body strength, these are a great solution instead of using free weights. I love the travel bag, which means I can take my set wherever I go so I don't miss work out days. The included training steps are well pictured and easy to follow for an initial routine.

5762	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	They do the job.
3737	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Using this for over a year now. It pretty much works on everything, even from large valve air mattresses to those screw type valves found on the Therma-Rest brand. The small "thin point" adapter takes care of pillows and every kid toy I can imagine that uses plug stoppers. A single charge lasts forever. About 50 uses and it hasn't died on me yet.
Overall, I think these are a great value.  The package is complete and reasonably priced.  The quality (for me) has been great.  If there is a downside, it's the obvious weight limitation.  You're not going to be entering any Mr. Universe contests using these.  If you want to get *big* you're going to need a *lot* of bands (and you might end up destroying all your doors).

This is my 1st review of this product based on my first impression of, and limited experience with, the product. As part of my commitment to the product manufacturer, as well as the Amazon community, I will continue to update this review as I learn more about the product. Consequently, my product rating may go up or down over time. I purchased this product at a discounted price or obtained it at no cost so I could offer my unbiased and honest review of it. All opinions are my own. I do not automatically give 5 stars to every product. I also do not give just 1 star to products I dislike if it would still be good for someone else. I assess a product based on its description and my expectations as a consumer. Consequently, some products fail. This is valuable feedback for both the product manufacturer as well as the Amazon community, I hope my review will share some light into what's the product is all about and more important how useful it is along with its quality.

3208	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great buy is very comfortable and for the price is impossible to beat.  Is a hassle to blow up without pump but still can be achieved in around 5 through 10 minutes. For under 10 dollars to get me of the ground
From a veteran lifter (me), seems the quality of the belt is good, so I will replace it with another, sized Medium.
They are also, super super super tight and a bit hard to get your hand into. My 6 year old has no problem getting her hand in them but the other two struggle. It is very tight and snug. A bit too tight and snug.
1346	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good set.
8632	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect for a quick exercise of the upper body. All of the many brands of stretchy bands are convenient, but the SPRI I find to be the most comfortable to use and most durable. Another brand accidentally slipped out of my hand, snapping back and hitting the door, and shattered the handles. And because I have butter fingers, I let the same thing happen with the SPRI and the handles did not shatter. The rubber tubing is very well made and doesn't dry out and become brittle if you do things like, say, leave it on the floor for days, toss it in the back of your hot car and forget about it, or something like that. So if mine last for 2 years doing that kind of stuff, imagine how long it would last if you actually took care of it? The only caveat is that this particular package does NOT come with a door harness loop. So if you're planning on using it for that, you have to order one of those separately.
1078	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great price and fast delivery. Quite sturdy and the adjustable band makes it simple to add resistance when needed. Highly recommend this wonderful product.

This is the size ball this age group uses for their school and soccer league games, so it's perfect for practice at our local playground. The ball is stitched well, and I appreciate the shiny faux leather material -- it wipes off readily, and when the field is muddy, we can just rinse off the ball with no problem. Still, we were able to use a Sharpie to it our name on the ball, and that doesn't wash off. The ball arrives slightly under inflated, which is a good thing -- we were able to quickly inflate it to playing hardness. Very pleased with this ball.

However, although it does "fit most doorways 24" to 32" wide" (as advertised),  if you have an old house with narrow doors (mine are 29" wide), the half circular hand grips' end pieces project  past the main horizontal bar, which causes them to rest on the door frame and create dents.

Bottle Opener/Wire Bender/Wire Stripper/Big Flat blade screwdriver-- I don't drink alcohol, but have encountered soda that's been bottled in glass bottles with crimped on caps, and this does the job of opening them well.  The big fat blade screwdriver gets used often, as both a screwdriver and a small prybar for jobs requiring little force. I don't understand the whole wire stripper thing.  I've never been able to use it right. The one thing I hate is, that unlike an older Alox Pioneer I have is that it lacks the sharpened edge inside the bottle opener for stripping wire. Now, closing the sharpened edge on the wire stripped it quickly.

8046	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love it.  Take a little bit of practice to get it down, but it will come back to you.  I like the fact that its a pretty good workout disguised and fun.  Play boomerang for half an hour and you will get a workout.  I'm always looking for things to do in park near my house.  I really look for things that promote physical activity without just being a workout.  I bought the boomerang a summer after I bought the Aerobie flying ring.

On the down side, the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots. There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate. If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove, it sets in just right. But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well. The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them. (These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate) (I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store. I think they were "storm" grates. In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove. Also Lodge has a 8" castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well.)

This band seems very well made. The handles attach to the band through sturdy metal grommets that look like they'll never come loose. Black rubber sleeves over the joints add a finished look. Clad in thin sponge rubber over plastic cores, the grips are thick enough to grasp easily, and the textured rubber provides for a firm grip even with sweaty hands. The straps that attach the grips to the band have no loose stitching or sharp edges, and the sewing is tight. On the down side, the band exudes a strong, unpleasant chemical odor, but I'm sure that'll go away after a short time here in the dry Southwestern desert air.

4803	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My husband and I just survived "Sandy" in New Jersey and because we were without power for 5 days, and then another 4 days, really wanted something easy to use and small enough to store so we could heat up things and MAKE COFFEE!!!  This product is small enough to fit on my stove top and counter and with two burners, large enough to fit our needs.  Great product....great Coleman name.

There were about four of these on display, and I remembered reading in the reviews that the springs were pretty stiff in these and that some lighter kids would probably have some trouble bouncing on these.  I'd have to agree that these felt pretty stiff in the store.  I lined them all up and pushed down on each one and the tension was consistent in them all.  I did not feel that one was less than the other or easier to push down.  The plastic green base seemed fairly robust and the construction of the frame, handles, and foot pedals seemed to be up for handling younger kids.  I wanted him to try it out in the store, but the box is designed to only allow you to push it up and down with no riders (probably a good idea for the store).  Anyway, I took a chance and got it.  I didn't even know if my 5 year old even understood what this thing was, but he did tell me that he had seen a Curious George episode where George was bouncing around on one.  He seemed to think that he was going to be able to bounce over houses and cars.  Well, at least he's excited to give it a try!

3. Repair patch -- I haven't needed it yet.
1199	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I have used these resistance bands sporadically, at best.  I generally only take these on vacation to help be consistent with my exercise routine.  Two have failed at the attachment end (to the handle).  The first was the heavy yellow and today the red.  If you have never broken an elastic exercise band, let me tell you; it hurts.  Even the small diameter bands can cause a great deal of pain.  Will try other manufacturer.
1097	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We purchased two sets of these bands for use with P90X.  We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program.  We continued to use these bands for pull-ups
Ultimately this is a great set, minus the door anchor, for the money. I would highly recommend them for anybody looking for a portable gym. With my travels, hotels only provide treadmills typically but the lifter is left out.  Great way to keep up with your workout or mix it up.  It can be a fun way to workout also if free weights are unavailable or you do not have a spotter.  Again BEWARE of the door anchor!  With exception of the door anchor the other cons are not that big of a deal. Just being detailed, by no means urging you against these since they are very good for the price.
3623	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The Aerobie has been our frisbee of choice based on the softer rubber outer edges.  They are much gentler on your hands when catching the frisbee, especially on the longer throws where the disc is really moving fast or when playing catch with the kids.  The rubberized edge is also much easier for the "smaller hands" to grip and control when catching and throwing the disc.  We are very happy with the purchase.
9847	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic rod for the price, super tough!
Note, the hooks on the straps to connect to the car are unprotected metal (on both models). I was afraid this would scratch my paint so I simply covered them with black duct tape. It is thin enough to still allow the hooks to slip in the crack around the trunk but soft and strong enough to not scrape metal-on-metal.

4680	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For the price, buy it!  It's thin and light enough.  Makes cooking at camp so much easier.  Burner control is good and that fact that you can get spare parts from coleman is a godsend.  Other makes have not been as kind in that regard.  The liquid fuel stoves work as well, but the cleanliness of the burning propane and ease of refueling seals the deal for this.

Initial impressions regarding optical quality were that this scope provides a surprisingly clear field of view.  As long as my eye was aligned with the optical center of the scope, I didn't experience the blurring around the edges of the field of view that other commenters have reported on.  This scope did impress me has having "critical" optical center and equally "critical" eye relief when compared to the thrity year old Leupold Vari-X IIc 2-7X on my equally old Ruger M77RL Ultralight in .250 Savage.  With the Leupold, there's more "fudge factor" with respect to eye alignment with the optical center of the scope and eye distance from the ocular lens and that allows for a decent sight picture to obtained even with a hasty and sloppy mount of the rifle to the shoulder.
8741	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Nice! Love it.
8807	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It bought the blue one and it's plenty good. You can do many exercises with it and the best part is that it's not tough on your wrists as a dumbbell is.
8695	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for doing hip thrusts, but was disappointed to find that it was too stiff and large for me to use for this purpose.  I purchased this after viewing hip thrust videos, seeing the exercisers using this pad to protect themselves from the heavy barbell (Bret Contreras also recommends this).  Unfortunately, as a 5'4" 120 pound petite female, this pad is too long and awkward to use for that purpose.  It would also be too awkward for use on my shoulders during traditional barbell work.  I will use it for floor work, as it is impressively padded, but I will have to come up with an alternative for hip thrusts.
9815	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I checked out this surf rod and the Ugly Stick surf rod at my local Sports Chalet. They both felt like good solid rods.  The biggest differences were in the color and the price.  The Ugly Sick is black and the Tundra white.  The Okuma Tundra retails for less than half of what the Ugly Sick sells for.
5065	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Received as a gift 2 of these many years ago. Need 2 more so just bought 2 more.

First...it is indeed the greatest flying disc ever made.  The Whamo people cried the first time they saw this thing fly.  It flies far, fast if you want, and new ones will float so soft.  You'll have to throw to get that maybe.  There are some comments from folks that confused me however.

Unlike the flying discs made specifically for dogs, these fly just like a real Frisbee (both in distance and flight pattern) yet have the soft rim so the dog"s mouth isn't injured when she catches it in mid-air.  The brightly colored rim makes them easy to find when my throwing gets too wild and they end up somewhere she can't get to.  The rim is squared off and ever so slightly raised above the actual disc which makes it easier for her to pick up if it lands flat on a slick or level surface.

First:  If you use this scope at the higher magnifications, then you must have a better tripod that comes with it.  You need very solid support.  There was no problem in this area when on the shooting range as the scope was mounted on a very substantial bench and sighed in on a specific target.  The problem here, again at the higher magnifications, is the ability to quickly find your subject.  This at times was difficult to do as the picture is quite small and the slightest movement was quite troublesome.  the lower magnifications were great for scanning the shore line and river banks.

3735	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Although this pump doesn't deliver enough pressure to fully pump up an inflatable kayak, it is essential if you want to quickly inflate and deflate your kayak.  This pump will get the pressure to 1.0 PSI, but if you need more pressure, then you need a hand pump.  I would recommend the Sevylor hand pump with built in pressure gauge so you know when you reach the correct pressure.


745	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	There are well-made and come with all of the accessories you need.  I use them with P90X3 when traveling both for curls as well as the door attachment for modifying the chin-up routines.  The grips and attachments seem really solid, so no concerns about a "blow out" like I had with the band that came with my P90X3 kit.  It's nice to be able to combine the different bands to achieve resistance beyond the thickest band.  The travel pouch is nice, but I usually travel with just the bands I need tossed into my backpack.
I used the grill for the first time on the new stove to make the Chicken Paillards from Stephen Raichlen's Indoor! Grilling cookbook.

8167	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Product showed up on time and packaging was good, no problems with that.  What I am disappointed with, the one I received has a loose bevel.  Any time I try to set an azimuth the bevel moves a good 16th of an inch or little better in the direction of the force applied.  Honestly, after all the reading I did on Suunto and the quality they are known for...I did expect a little better.  Over all it looks nice and has some nice options, I really like the magnifying lenses and the see-through base.  To tell you the truth I will end up not using it on the trail or in the brush.  I will stick with my good old Army compass and use the Suunto to check my north azimuth from time to time.  If your busting brush, I just can't trust this device.  I don't think it would throw me off that much, but I would have to check my heading twice as much.  I think the every day hiker on the trail, for the price this is probably a very good buy out of the box.  I may be a little too critical of my land navigation, but it is...what it is.

Final Tip - the Suunto cover snaps closed VERY tightly.  It does loosen up a bit over time with use.  Also, I found that if you put your thumb against the cover lip and rest it on the baseplate and sort of twist your thumb upwards, it acts to lever the lid open easily, vs. just pulling on the lid.

I was so well pleased with the detail and how with its aid I was able to navigate the area that I decided to get one of these atlases whenever I was going to spend time in a state. So, when I headed to Arizona to combine a visit with my daughter in the Phoenix area with a trip to the area around the Grand Canyon I made sure I had a gazetteer with me. Like the others I have, this one proved invaluable. I was able to discover backroads that aren't shown on the typical roadmap. Plus, I was able to locate hiking trails and trailheads, thus allowing me to fulfill another passion while on my visit. I'm especially grateful that this is a topographical map, since it gives me a better idea of what sort of terrain I'll be encountering, whether I'm driving or on foot. I consider this to be an essential tool for serious exploration of an area.

The instructions are a little hard to understand at first. Luckily the company has a youtube channel with demonstrations on some of their models.

3321	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ahhhhhh sweet comfort has finally arrived for the outdoorsmen. I looked and looked for an affordable sleep pad for my backpack. I simply refused to pay over $50 for a sleep pad. I weigh 255 lbs and and I am a wide shouldered guy, so I wanted something wider than the typical sleep pad and something that would hold up my weight all night. Well I found  it with this sleep pad. It is soooo comfortable and plenty wide for a big guy like me. It packs up so small you can stuff it anywhere in your pack, I mean roll it up fold it or whatever. It holds air all night long, and it has a simple pool toy type valve. It has a comfy cloth type top and can be adjusted from soft to really firm with just a few breaths. It inflated in about 3 or 4 minutes pretty easily. I really like this thing, its so comfy and compact. Its not very heavy either maybe a couple pounds. They vinyl is suprisingly durable, like I said I am probably one of the heaviest hikers out there and it held me up just fine. No slow leaks through the night no rubbery feel just a very well designed and dirt cheap sleep pad. It even comes with a repair patch in case you need it. This thing is five stars all the way for its nice size, weight, durablilty, and last but not least its comfort. Highly recommended.

3763	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am not a dart expert, but needed a good dartboard starter set to try with family to see if we might like to play darts and also to get some practice so that I can play darts with friends when at a local bar.  The target and darts arrived well-packaged and the set was complete with no damage. The dart board is well constructed with accurately spaced target zones. The wire seems a little thicker than other boards I have checked, but it is likely to last longer without bending. The darts are low end starter darts, but served their purpose as we can upgrade our darts after we gain some experience. I consider the set a great  value compared to others I have looked at in stores. We have fun throwing darts. Only infrequently does a dart bounce off a wire; usually if the darts hits a wire it "slips" into an adjacent space and penetrates the sisal and sticks. After a lot of throwing, the holes left by darts are minimal and not objectionable. We have not had to rotate the outer target ring yet, but it is good to know that if a serious wear pattern happens that we can rotate the ring to bring less used areas of the board into play. I like the center bull much better than an older designed board because it is a cleaner metal construction and less likely to have darts bounce off than an older board we tried. The staple free construction is a plus factor as is the mounting hardware when choosing this board. As we gain experience, we will step up to better darts.
I received this for my honest opinion and was not compensated.

He hopped on and it took maybe an hour or two before he really got the hang of it and now he is going going going.  Excellent workout, he enjoys it so much and I love that it is very sturdy as well. We also contacted customer service and they were really nice.  No assembly required.  Just take it out of the box and off you go on your way to fun!

Update March 2017: I have now ordered nearly 10 of these rings in the last 5 months for birthday gifts for 9 and 10 year old boys and without fail, it has been an instant hit. The boys are always eager to show how FAR they can throw the ring and then are shocked when it sails two hundred yards or more. They puff out their chests as their friends exclaim "WOOOAH!" while the ring whizzes one or two streets over and then the birthday boy swaggers off to fetch the ring with every other boy tagging along, begging for a turn to throw it next. Children now double check with my son to ensure that he's going to get them an Aerobie ring for their birthday. I keep at least one on-hand for last minute birthday party invites.

Before, if I stood on one foot on the floor, there would be a very tiny version of this going on, continual slight adjustments; I had to concentrate on it.  Now, I guess I could say the same; there still must be small adjustments, but they're even much smaller than before, so it feels rock solid.  Put it this way: standing on one foot now feels almost like standing on two feet; I could stand that way a while and not be aware I was doing it.  That's a pretty amazing improvement for less than two weeks, and I just do it probably a total of ten minutes a day; I just step on the thing every once in a while when I'm home, fall off a couple of times with each foot, and go do something else.  I haven't kept track, but my mean-time-to-falling-off has probably gone from 10 seconds to 20 seconds, something like that (and of course, "falling off" just means having to put the other foot down on the floor; there's no danger).  Sometimes I do leg swings, lateral leg raises, hydrants, with the free leg, or go down into (very slight) one-legged squats, or "airborne lunges" (kind of the opposite of a pistol squat, free leg out behind, trunk and arms in front); it doesn't seem to make the mere standing much harder.  It's like, while I'm standing there, I can do some exercises, until I start to fall off, which is going to happen anyway.  In the future, I can imagine being able to stand there until I'm ready to get off of my own volition.

This is great to keep in the car.  For my littlest son, we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.  For bigger kids, they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.

8231	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very nice compass for the price. It is not cheap but it certainly is comparative to the much more expensive ones. I love the fact that I can adjust the declination with a tiny flathead (included) so I don't have to constantly add or subtract the difference in degrees from true to magnetic north. Also provides an accurate angle of the slope you are on or looking at for avalanche predictability. Excellent and accurate sighting and the ring actually glows in the dark along with the red north arrow. However, if you need to use the glow in the dark ring and arrow, you probably should be using a headlamp.

As for the band itself, it is very handy. It is portable, so you can take your workout anywhere. I have had no structural problems with the band, as it looks well made. The band comes with an instructional booklet, so you can test out different exercises. I love using the band, because you can get the same workout as a weight bench from just a single resistance band. The attachment for the door is also handy, allowing you to do pull downs, rows, presses, and even squats. After a couple weeks of use, the band shows no signs of wear, despite stretching it to full capacity.
The only thing that could be improved would be the addition of one of those foam donuts on a strap that lets you fix the straps to a doorframe by wedging it between the door and the doorjamb.  Fortunately we had one of these from a previous pack of bands so it wasn't a problem, but if we hadn't had that we would have been out of luck for this type of exercise.

1213	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I bought these bands to use with Tony Horton's 10-Minute Trainer.  For the most part these are great until you have to do a military press or an overhead tricep curl.  These exercises require you to stand on the middle of the band and push all the way up until your arms are fully extended.  For these exercises, the bands are too short for me and I worry how long they'll last if I keep stretching them that far.  I'm 6'0" tall, so someone shorter might not have any problem.  If you're 6' or taller, I would find something longer because these will disappoint.  The B-Line bands used by Tony Horton for P90x and his other videos appear to be roughly twice as long as these.
724	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these resistance bands after going through PT for my right shoulder which was diagnosed with tendinitis. The PT gave me both stretches and band exercises to do, and these bands have really made all the difference. I was given a few of those flat elastic bands by the PT, but they quickly gave out, while the Black Mountain Bands have lasted a full year of use 2-3 times a week. Using these bands has brought my shoulder from being painful to move without any external load to being able to do pull-ups, rock climb, and play squash completely pain free. The handles are comfortable and make it easier to pull with more force, and the door jam strap gives me confidence that the bands won't come loose. The bands do show some wear in the middle where they come in contact with the door jam, but it's not surprising given the friction and I'm counting on the lifetime warranty in case it does break.
 It's a trade off using biscuits, or dowels, you get totally hidden joinery, but you have to wait for the glue to dry. For finish projects with all sides exposed, that is the way to go.

Being 51 now, I desire to have some semblance of cartlidge in my joints later on in life: Elliptical offers low-impact cardio. When weather is really poor and driving is treacherous, or interruptions abound, I need something at home to use for cardio and weight-loss/weight-control. It's true that I too would prefer a better-regarded, costlier device--generally, however, such equipment is far bulkier and heavier than this: Naturally, I greatly prefer a gym's machine, as well.

6390	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We purchased this for our daughter about a year ago.  She has been loving frisbee for a couple of years now, and when she would try and catch the frisbee, it would smack her fingers and hurt her.  This was making her timid when she went to catch.  I decided to purchase the Aerobie Pro Ring for two reasons.  First because it was softer material then the old heavy plastic frisbee we have been using, and second because it had an open center.  I thought this would give my daughter an alternative option for catching the ring.  Mainly I didn't want her to lose her love for playing because her hands were too small and were getting hurt often with the old frisbee.  It worked like a charm!  It bounces gently off her hands ...and whatever it hits (and it hits many things...haahah).  Our daughter uses the ring to catch it around her arm, or sticks...She loves that alternative at times.  She has totally forgotten how she use to hurt her hands with the old frisbee, and runs into the yard asking to play as much as possible.  It is easy to throw, easy to catch...and bounces easily off things it hits.  It can go very long distances with little effort.  I find that I am enjoying watching my daughter play so much that I am jumping in more and playing with her.  Thanks for solving our problem, and making a little girl very happy!

8879	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I really like these bands for travel workouts. They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout. It's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents. For a thorough workout for each muscle group, it pays to get the extra heavy, heavy and medium bands. Honestly, it's good for some muscle groups, like the triceps, biceps, shoulders and even the back. I haven't used the door attachment, but for the chest, good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road, won't they? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber, you increase or decrease the resistance. Certainly worth the money, as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine.
Now of course I've only used this ball for less than one month and only a few times per week so I can't comment on the durability yet (will update review if anything notable) but so far the ball is holding up nicely - I've found that I don't get more than 6 months use out of regularly played outdoor ball anyway.

We have a relatively large family and I love that I can fold up a few of these, throw them in the back of the van, and they can play with them anywhere there's a little concrete.  The folding feature is especially awesome for travel, and it's quite compact.  It even locks when folded, which is great for getting children to carry their own (added bonus!).  I would buy another in a heartbeat, and eventually will probably end up buying several more!  I also love the color choices - great for multiple kids.  I can't recommend this scooter highly enough.

This Compass fulfilled all my requirements and I didn't even realize that it would when I bought it.  I work on Satellite communications systems and aligning antennae is part of my daily taskings.  This compass has a movable bezil ring which makes finding a bearing incredibly simple.  It works well in the northern hemisphere.  I have not had the opertunity to use it in the southern as of yet.  The Clinometer makes it quite simple to get elevation angles nearly perfect. I have also done some hiking with it and I have not become lost as of yet.  The literature that comes with the compass is easy to understand.

As some of you may Know PT is great but the work doesn't stop there you must do at home exercises as well. I bought these for just that reason they have helped me emulate some of the exercises we do during my PT visits. Now as for quality and value 5 stars. These bands are great quality, the handles are padded nicely and there modular design is very convenient. in comparison to some of the sets I have seen in stores and online you can not beat the value of this set. I wanted to wait a few day using these to give a review and I will say I would absolutely suggest you buy this set.

I took the pump apart, ripped out the battery, diagnosed it on my smart charger -- which told me that the battery was dead and will not hold a charge.  I ordered a ExpertPower EXP645 6V 4.5 Amp Rechargeable Battery for $11 and installed it -- it now works better than it ever has.  I am leaving 2 stars as I shouldn't have to replace the battery right after purchasing it, they are shipping these units out with dead/near-dead batteries.  Anyway, just thought I would let everyone know, in case you are having the same problem, it's the battery.
3162	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	good
Aside from that the compass works as all the good ones do: there's a mirror with a sighting window so you can take a bearing very accurately at eye-height. There's the grid lines so you can take a bearing (or find one) on a map. There's all the usual things you'd expect from a good compass plus a declinometer which can measure the steepness of the hill you're on. Personally I don't find this feature particularly useful not least because most hills aren't a steady incline but continually change.

5096	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Boys LOVE them!! They fit a 5,7, 11 year old, and a Mom with small hands. Pricing could have been a bit cheaper, as I found them locally for a better price after purchasing online.

Fun, and cheaper than a pool table and takes up less space!
492	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love these. Resistance bands are like having a portable cable tower at a tiny fraction of the price, though most are difficult to stack, thus making adjustments to resistance difficult. This set solves that problem. Switching out bands is very easy and there's room for additional ones, as I found out already, since I bought and added the purple stackable band to mine. I'll likely be adding the orange and atomic green, for a total of about 230 pounds of resistance. Which is not much lower than most cable weight stacks go up to, and for a total investment of like $75. Versus hundreds (or even thousands) for a cable tower. Bands have received an unfortunate reputation by their association with light-resistance high-rep use in trendy women's fitness programs, but I assure you that has nothing to do with their inherent nature.
2737	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great Product. Fast shipping
1642	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	You need a handy man to put it together... Very complicated:(

6705	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive, burly, tough, heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light, nimble, and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife, just not what I needed.
4483	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	When it comes to camping, it's hard to beat a Coleman. This stove easily heated my 12" cast iron pan as well as my coffee percolator. There is a lot of space on the stovetop and can handle large pots and pans.
260	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great looking necklace. In 5'9" 140lbs average sized guy and this necklace fits nice. Sits about a inch and half from my neck which is great for a "sports" necklace in my opinion. I didn't get it for its "healing" effects, but I do feel alittle better.
3726	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I have a Coleman mattress and for years I was trying to get by using the cheapo pumps. They worked, but I had to hold them on my mattress just right, otherwise they would just blow everywhere. This one, on the other hand, fits right into the mattress and inflates in the blink of an eye, hands-free. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a tie or something with which to attach the nozzles to the pump, to avoid losing them. I wound up using one of the twist ties that came in the box, but come on; there has to be a better solution.
bottom line is - if you're ordering from american vendors/amazon site, you're no longer able to buy the swedish, quality made silva compasses...the ones labeled as 'silva' but sold on american market are actually made by the current brunton company, and manufactured in indonesia, not sweden...brunton retained the rights to the silva name only for distribution in the usa because they were once a single company for a while hence the confusion... silva - the swedish co. -  no longer has the rights to distribute its swedish [quality] made compasses in us of a therefore the 'made in sweden' silva units you can currently buy in europe are completely different than the 'silva' compasses one gets here in north america...unfortunately for us here in the usa....the only way to get the high quality silva compass here in the u.s. is to buy an older, used model or buy from overseas...

2150	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Got this for my brother as a cheap accessory for night sky observing. He reports it works quite well and he gets good views with it. He's not real picky about optics, though he is a very accomplished observer.  It's a relatively stubby and compact design. So for a cheap pair of binoculars that you won't get upset about if you knock it out of alignment or lose it, this appears to be a good value. One of the lens caps was cracked when I received it, but they get lost anyway. Nice that it comes with a soft case and basic straps.
A couple areas of concern: the drag wheel turns the opposite direction that it should.  To me, it should turn clockwise for additional drag, but for some reason, turning it clockwise loosens the drag.  This won't be a problem once your used to it, but they could have made it more intuitive.
1756	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The velcro didn't last long so we had to fix it but not bad for a starter goal.  My son is on a travel team and is outside almost everyday practicing his shots.  10 months going strong besides the velcro.
3265	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It's a little heavier than I'd like, but my back needs an air mattress for camping now (age is catching up).  HOWEVER, it is durable, comfy, and easy enough to pack. Takes a little while to inflate, with lungs alone. But if you bring a bellows pump, it should be easier. It's not perfect, but what is? I'd recommend it.
8165	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Happy with the sturdy plate. I appreciate the ability to set the magnetic declination on the compass.

716	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Really great product that comes with a lot of accessories such as a carrying bag and door anchor. I purchased this item for the p90x program that I've started and it was definitely a great purchase. Most of the exercises you do in p90x can be done with resistance bands with the exception of pull ups, but alternatives have been made possible because of the door anchors. These resistance bands can be pulled to great lengths without feeling like its going to snap on you. They snap on to the handles which makes interchanging between these bands extremely easy. One thing I do notice is that it seems to deteriorate in color the longer you use it, hopefully it doesn't snap on me one day and hit me in the face.

6145	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I prefer this stove to the propane tank version any day.  If your camping trip turns into a real life or death situation you can always siphon gas from your vehicle to power this and other dual fuel devices.  On a mellower note, carrying a can of camping fuel is much easier than a bunch of little propane tanks, especially if there is not a Walmart nearby to resupply.
Ended up getting another pair at the gym.  Liked the brand until this pair.
I would recommend these for a younger age. 6 and below. I would get the ones that Velcro on the wrist in my next purchase but will hold off a while. Hoping maybe after sticking some adult hands in there a few times I can break them in.

My 13 year old son begged for heavy weights and resistance bands after he got to use them at a football training camp.  His doctor advised against heavy weights at his age  (can damage the bone growth and keep your smaller kid small if the growth plate hasn't fused shut yet. Anyhow, the doctor said that resistance bands can still help him bulk up like he wants WITHOUT inhibiting his growth. Yippie!!! SOOO, I started searching for made in the USA resistance bands. Trouble is, there's a catch. Resistance bands are made from rubber from a rubber tree which isn't indigenous to the US. I called and spoke to the owner (two brothers own and run this company, no pesky automated phone line or overseas language barriers to deal with when I called!). These are indeed assembled by hand by the owners in the US but because the rubber comes from Malaysia, they can't call it "Made in USA". Grin, but I can.

The locks have hard rubber, pyramidal teeth to grip the trigger housing and prevent much movement. There are also pins that expand and contract to supposedly surround the inside and outside of the trigger guard to also prevent movement. But a lot of the rigidity of the lock is in the strength of the compression you secure the lock. If you gently close the two halves together and lock it, yeah there will be play. If you firmly press the two together and lock it, there will be little to no wiggle room. If you give it the vulcan death grip, its not going anywhere!

This compass is intelligently designed and innovative. It is also full featured. The hard plastic casing and rubber boot offer superb protection for the the compass dial and transparent base-plate, which has all of the most commonly needed map scales. The Eclipse 8099 has a 1-degree graduated dial, marked for both forward and reverse sighting.  It has a magnifying lens over the graduations that allows for easy reading. A separate magnifying lens (larger than on many other base-plate map compasses) allows you to check out map details more easily. The rubber boot serves also as an eraser for pencil lines on your map. There is a magnetic declination adjustment, of course, and a clinometer for measuring heights and slopes. Contained within the boot are a set of quick reference cards that thoroughly explain how to use all of the map, compass and clinometer techniques. There is a tangent conversion table (Card 8). There are map and roamer scales (Card #6) Cards 9-11 even provide some basic survival and first aid reminders. I don't know of any other compass that gives you all of that in a self contained package.

2357	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I own/collect several multitool brands (Gerber,Leatherman,SOG,Schrade) and by far I am happiest with SOG multitools.  The Gerber tool's finish is showing some corrosion and the small flathead screwdriver's tip broke. The Leatherman tools are good (Juice S2 and Kick), but are overpriced (Juice S2).  Leatherman is the granddad of multitools and likely offers the widest variety of multitools, but comparative shopping is a must.  The Schrade tool is awkward in that some of the tools lockout and some don't lock at all.  I am sure it is because some don't require lockout to work, but my opinion is that they should all lockout. I have two SOG multitools (Power Plier and a smaller version)and am very impressed with the heavy duty, anti-corrosive finish, precision, and function of all the instruments.  The smaller version has some instruments (phillips screwdriver and a file) that don't have the shiny,chrome-like finish, but still perform well and show no sign of corrosion. All the instruments lockout and work as expected. I've noticed that once any multitool is used for a repair it is not long after that one gets to see how the metal finish endured the stress of the work.  I consider this one of the litmus tests of all multitools. Like I previously mentioned in the section about the Gerber tool, some brands just don't stand up well to duress and one will find that the manufacturer actually has a disclaimer that warns against using the tool for what I consider it's intended purpose:  on-the-spot, contingency repair.  I highly recommend the SOG multitools for that type of use.

We thought we were getting a blue frisbee, a lime green one showed up.  I assumed they were offering it in assorted colors not that they were going going to select a color at random. This was a disappointment for us because we wanted blue. We bought this one because there wasn't any logos on top that were bold so we can put our own vinyl design onto it. My daughter has decided to just make the vinyl blue so she still has blue on her frisbee.  We thought putting a vinyl design onto the top would be a fun way to personalize this, there are a lot of design rings / grooves but I think it will still work good.

After 1 year there is hardly any rust (it's been a rainy year here in southern CA with 30 days of rain).  It just BARELY fits into my SUV if I collapse the back (i.e. so the rebound almost faces up) so it's almost flat (no space for rear passengers).  That makes it pretty easy to transport 4 blocks to the park, and saves me time.  The only way to improve it would be to make it foldable.  There are 2 quick-release plastic collars (visible in photo) on the back to set the rebound angle <<<=== VERY QUICK AND USEFUL.

The practice itself is tough, with plenty of lunges and challenges to the lower body.  It does not have a fast pace, but not every yoga class needs to be fast.  In fact, holding some of those poses for 5 or more breaths is pretty darn hard and works your muscles to the point of fatigue.  I practice yoga regularly, and I had to pull back and straighten my leg in a few poses because my legs were just giving out.  In addition, keeping the breath slow and steady during the entire practice isn't as easy as it sounds and provides yet another challenge.

The workout begins with Leslie introducing the four basic moves, and in the warm-up phase, she gradually picks up the pace until you are moving along at a fairly good clip.  At this point (about 10 minutes into the workout), she introduces use of the belt or weights for some basic upper body exercises, including overhead press and flies.  For the middle part of the workout, or Mile 2, the weights are not used, as the pace increases considerably.  Although the movements stayed the same, I sometimes found it a bit difficult to keep up with Leslie's quick movements.  However, Leslie is extremely encouraging, frequently saying that it's okay to go at your own pace and not to follow her form exactly.  For the first half of the last mile, the belt or weights are again used, repeating many of the previous exercises.  The pace then slows down a bit to start bringing your heart rate back to normal, and finally, the last 2 minutes of the workout consists of cool-down stretches for a total of 44 minutes.
5054	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Much nicer than I even expected!!  Definitely worth the money (actually, this is the cheapest one like this I have found).  It's the perfect size, even for my 6 foot tall fiance, and it's soft but not too soft.  Still has great cushion and stability.

For the 6 x 4 goal...This goal can work as a competition goal for kids about 8 and under who play small sided games. For kids that age and younger, this frame can take their best shots. Probably when kids get to about 9+ years old, they will start knocking it around even with the stakes. For all ages, this is a suitable goal for small goal games on a soccer field or in the backyard. The goal is pretty solid and sturdy. The stakes are helpful and the netting is good. If you are looking for a goal to put in the backyard or use for youth games that does not need to fold up, this is a good option. It is light enough for kids to pick up and move around

I felt as though I might break it trying to put in the batteries.  It wasn't as comfortable as other earmuff earpro I have worn.  And  the sound quality coming through the speakers was not high enough for me to be confident that the pair I had was working properly, although it did effectively cut out when firing a 12-gauge (hence 2 stars).  Returned.
I don't think the paint is very good, so I don't recommend letting it get wet via sprinklers or dew.
The styling is very traditional, making it easy to recognize out on the pitch.  It's a great value and I am very happy with it.  It's in the realm of the go-to balls I would select for competition or practice.

My only complaint (other than like everything else they keep getting more and more expensive) is that the paint does not hold them very well anymore.  Some colors seem to be worse than others, but none of them hold paint like the old ones did.  A couple of knicks off of tree tops, stumps, rocks, or the side of the boat and the paint starts chipping away.  Love the Gold Tennessee Shad color late in the evening with mid water clarity.

I couldn't do shoulder presses, any type of dumbbell presses or flies, tricep pullovers, preacher curls, bench press, rear deltoid flies, barbell squats, etc. Upon switching to the resistance bands I have been able to do all of these exercises and more with no problems whatsoever.  And I have been doing very heavy resistance with the bands.  After having a bad shoulder for over 20 years, I never dreamed this kind of intense workouts would be possible again. the resistance bands have strengthened my shoulder.

I would like to just have 3 d-rings where you can clip to for a quick change.  Outside of that, the handles are soft and seem strong enough to last at least a year of constant use.

574	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I decided to start exercising at home since it was more convenient than going to the gym.  I didn't have the money or space to purchase a set of free weights, so I read about these resistance bands.  I assumed I wouldn't get the same kind of workout than I could from using all the different machines at the gym...but I was wrong.  I can do almost anything with these resistance bands, and I can really feel the workout.  I used pretty heavy weights at the gym so I thought I might end up needing more resistance but I typically use at most two bands and not even the "heaviest" ones.  The manual that comes with the bands has pages of different exercises and I haven't event gotten to every one of them.

I thought I'd update this since it's been three years. My son used the wooden trike until he was big enough for the metal one. Then I had another son so they've each had one to use. The wooden one has been used slightly more probably (honestly my first son wasn't that interested until he had a little brother), but I have to say that it hasn't held up as well as the metal one. The boys like to ride around our house in a circle which involves going over two baby gates. Each time, they stand up and lift the wheels up over a one inch metal bar on the floor. I'm guessing it's due to this lifting, but the steering column of the wooden trike is now loose. I'm not sure if it can be fixed, but it's pretty bad. The handlebars can be pulled forward and back several inches, and it's difficult to steer right or left now. The metal trike is still going strong with no apparent problems.

I'd been thinking seriously about getting the Bodylastics line this go round. After about 15 years my red band showed some signs of wear. I tend to default to the red one so it gets lots of use. I've never had a Spri band snap on me. I've never had a bit of trouble with one. They tend to last a very long time but you really should consider changing them from time to time even if they show no wear as any rubber band will lose some of it's strength after time.

I first discovered this while on an 1,800 mile tour in Central America, where every day was near 100 degrees.  It was almost useless on that trip, except in the mornings before it got too hot out.  Later, I started experiencing the same problem others have reported of the contacts not making a connection.  At first that would only happen when it rained, but later it did it even when dry out.  I would avoid this one, unless maybe you just want to use it on a stationary bike indoors.

There is no R-value to speak of, so use a good sleeping bag. It's a bit small for back sleepers; but for this side sleeper it worked great. It's too bulky and heavy to be a true backpacking pad but it would work fine for an overnight or maybe a weekend with a bigger pack.

Metal File/Nail Cleaner/Metal Saw-- Before 2005, Victorinox used case hardened steel which was chrome plated, in which the plating limits the filing/cutting ability to some degree. If I put pressure on the file it works fine.  The fine saw on the back can cut through just about anything the wood saw can't. In fact, once I needed to cut a piece of scrap insulated wire for an emergency repair, and had forgotten my wire cutters. The metal saw cut through the wire and insulation without issue. Problem is, the saw had slight tooth damage after only one use, a thing I hope the modern stainless versions remedy. I also use the metal file as a nail file occasionally.  A metal/multiple material file is much more useful than a dedicated nail file like many Wengers and some Victorinoxes do.

6445	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The Aerobie Pro Ring is a great toy for kids of all ages.  It requires almost now skill to throw due to its aerodynamic styling.  It can fly for long distances, and it is easy to catch.  The doughnut design makes gripping and catching quite simple.  One danger is that it flies so well, that if you through it high (rather than level), you can cause it soar into trees.
So, he isn't bouncing over cars or houses and the tension in the spring is pretty stiff for his weight.  I'm not sure he is even using all of his weight however or has developed full coordination on how to use it for the best possible "bounce".  I'm kinda glad that the spring does have some good tension to it because kids grow pretty fast and this pogo stick still has plenty of room for growing.  If I can get him to stick with the basics right now, and keep making a game of it each time...I am pretty confident that he will definitely get better at it.  I'm pleased with the design and construction of the device but I do think that kids with less weight (30 pound range) will have trouble bouncing on this due to the strong spring.  I do think, however, that after repeated uses, the spring's tension will eventually loosen up over time.  When his mother came home from work, he wanted to show her his "skills" on the pogo stick.  That is certainly a good sign.  Watching him makes me think back to when I had one.  Wonder if they make them for adults?  Hmmm...looks like I might do a little more research on Amazon.

Even after cleaning the valves the flame adjustment is pretty touchy.  Only a small amount of movement at the knobs makes large changes to the flame.

The color system is good one, but there does seem to be a larger difference between red and blue than yellow and green to red. I would recommend it because of its effectiveness. The brochure is not that good, but one can find exercises from plenty of other sources. The brand is found in most gyms so you can "try before you buy". I am quite happy with the equipment.

I have broken off the red plastic side with the pen twice. Usually this is from me throwing my keys from a second story or across the room, or just dropping it a lot.

The only thing negative I can find is the sensitivity of the propane knobs. Once lit, the minimum flame is about the 12 o'clock position and the maximum flame is about the 9 o'clock position. There's plenty of movement to the max position but it's unnecessary. That being said, just be mindful of the flame and you'll have no problems.

Much like the headlight, the taillight compares well to more expensive lights. Similar to competing products, it has various blinking modes as a well as an always-on setting.

Bezel ring - Besides being luminous, the bezel ring numbers are a slightly larger font on the Suunto.  The Silva ring had more notches for your fingers, so it was a bit easier to grasp.  The black ring, not being luminous, was impossible to see at night.  The Suunto and Silva had numbers every 20*.  This made it easy to know the 10* bearing in between as there was only one.  Also, since the cardinal directions (N, NE, E, etc.) are printed on the on the black part of the Suunto ring, and the luminous part has numbers all the way around the ring (16 total numbers), with 4 numerical bearings between each of the main cardinal directions tick marks. (N, E, S, W) The K&R had numbers only every 30*, (just 8 total numbers) so there were two 10* bearings in between, plus the 4 cardinal direction letters.  This made me double check myself more often, and seemed far less intuitive.  The K&R was luminous, and smooth to turn, but maybe a tad too tight.

I bought this lock less than a week ago. I didn't even have time to install the bracket yet.

Regarding the materials, I think for the price you get what you pay for. The green metal is a bit flimsy/thin, but if you are careful with it, I think it should last a while. I did notice that we were easily able to scratch the box when it is fully closed, so you want to be careful what you set on top of it while in the car or storing. The grill is solid and the burners themselves seem durable. The unit is easy to clean.

To set it up, you simply screw in the included arm to attach to your gas supply, finger tight only!  Don't let anybody come around with a wrench, thinking it will be better.  The seal is designed for finger tight only, and even with my relatively weak hands, I get a good seal.  If you are nervous about it, spray the connection with a weak soap solution after connecting everything and turning on your gas--I know I did the first few times, just to make sure!  It's reliable about connecting without leaking.  Extend the side wind breaks and clip them into the side of the stove (there are holes to accept the clips).

6779	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	With some trepidation, and not a small amount of insanity, we purchased this board for my son on the occasion of his fourth birthday.  He had been asking for (that is demanding) a skateboard for months so he could be like the big boys in the neighborhood.  We ordered the board and the requisite knee and elbow pads, gave them to him, kitted him up and sent him off.  He loves this thing!  He barely rides it, mind you.  He's much more impressed with kicking it up, catching it, tucking it under his arm and parading around, making sure the older boys notice him.  When he does ride it, though, he really does have a blast.  He has yet to master getting both feet on it at once, but he's having a blast trying to learn how.  It will hold his older sister (60 lbs), but creaks under my husband (200 lbs).  It has a very cool skeleton graphic on the top and is a nice little mimic of the older boys' boards.  I highly recommend this for any other (slightly insane) mother of a 4 year old!

If you're wanting something that can be used by the very little ones then this is a better size. My younger son is almost 30 months and still has an easier time with the wooden one than the metal one. If your child is older and big enough for the metal one then get it. It will last longer and can grow with them since it's adjustable. My older son is four and four months, and he still rides the metal one around the house. He outgrew the wooden one a long time ago.

Add to this, the day it arrived (today) I was chided by my grandparents for carrying my 2008 Soldier (a large 111mm model that looks more tactical than its 93mm Alox predecssor) into a hospital.  So, I figured it's time to buy the only 58mm model that checked all of the boxes for the stuff I always needed (blade, scissors, a couple or more screwdrivers) and then some (cuticle pusher/pharmaceutical spoon, orange peeler/cut and picker blade, wharncliffe blade, nail file, ruler, bottle opener, wire stripper).

They should come with a little extra padding in my opinion, but I just put my elbow sleeves on my calves with these around the sleeves and its a very tight fit. Hanging upside down to decompress my spine is my main use for these, but I do throw in some ab exercises as well. I have noticed its best (for me) to do the hanging after a workout or before bed, if I hang before a workout I experience some pretty bad back pain. I imagine decompressing before performing heavy lifts isn't the greatest idea, but I did try it out.
Since the board is soo affordable, I was able to purchase a dry erase board for 25$ with it (spending a total of about 55$ between the board, the dry erase board darts (I bought extras and shafts).... 55~60$ with delivery... pretty good price... worth the money we have already tossed atleast 1000 darts at the board each between me and my friends, and I can safely say that it will take another 4~5000 darts no problem if you keep "rotating the board" by removing the points ring (it snaps on and off) and rotating the positions every few degrees lowering the wear on key numbers (20 ~ 15) for us since we play a lot of cricket.

If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light.  Essentially, this will do.  The Bell light makes light and flashes.  I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road.  It is fairly cheap construction, but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work.

195	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've never avidly used resistance bands until now and I'm happy that these were my first bands. They are very well made and come with a handy door anchor and booklet with exercises. I chose the Green (medium) bands equal to lifting about 10-15 lbs. Handles are well cushioned and the band itself is strong enough that I am confident that it will be a long time before it starts to wear out. Great price too! Highly recommend!
I used to this sleep on in the mountains of Colorado. It isn't fun to blow it up, but none are. It is comfortable if you inflate it to about 75%, doesn't lose air after only a single night, and even on some rough terrain didn't develop any holes or leaks.

It can be annoying swapping out the bands between exercises, but it's worth it to avoid the expense and storage of a weight set. Black Mountain has great products, but I would recommend the set with attached handles.

This pogo stick's wide, removable base has really helped enable my granddaughter to learn how to use a pogo stick without becoming discouraged.

3630	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	There seem to be a few products like this, put the ball in the net and that is attached to a cord and you practice it from a belt around you, the belt by the way, used velcro to fasten and one can adjust the length of the cord that holds the ball. The exercises on then using the ball are ambitious if not exactly clear but it gives us a good idea of what to do. What they don't mention is juggling the ball but it seems to me some of the exercises are just that, they just don't call it that. Maybe they don't think they would sell as many, anyone can juggle but this allows you to foot/knee juggle in close quarters, like a room or I've even watched some games while having it tied on and practicing.

But this blade ended up breaking on me after a few weeks of use. And it's not like I was trying to pick up and 60k pound truck with it. I would assume it is a knick off made in China or some other country that makes knock off items. Guys i would suggest doing your homework when purchasing items off the internet.

8148	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Was considering several compasses. Looked at more YouTube compass videos than any sane person should. Ended up learning a lot that I didn't know. And in that learning, I decided on this compass. Happy with my choice. Well made, beautiful design, a lot of advancements (look at the YouTube videos), you'll see. Great price. Works well with a map, covers declination nicely, incline angles, everything - and glows brightly in the dark. I just shine my 500 lumens flashlight on it for a few seconds and it jumps to attention. Love this thing. By the way, I went to almost every outdoor, hunting, fishing, gun, knife, camping, hiking, provisions store around here and all I could find was a little, cheap button compass. Perhaps I am the only human in my area who thinks they need a compass. But Amazon had a lot. Which explains why they're killing physical retail stores.

I mainly bought this tube because I cancelled my gym membership as, contrary to the reason I was going, I was getting too lazy to to get to my $10/month gym on days I had preset for myself to go. I decided to instead do workouts I could do strictly at my own house. I already have a pair of dumbbells and a muay thai bag so I started using those exclusively and they're great tools to accomplish my fitness goal of being able to eat more cookies on the weekend without feeling too guilty. However, I was missing out on exercises I used to enjoy at the gym because the machines I used to use were not available to me at my house. In particular, I was missing out on the pulley machines which would give my muscles/joints a rest from having to move those "heavy" weights I was using. Enter the resistance band, a great tool to give those tired muscles/joints a rest while still providing a substantial workout for those days when I feel the need to exercise but don't feel the motivation to use the dumbbells or wander to my garage to hit my bag.

7814	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The limited description of this compass did not do it justice. The main body of the compass is surrounded by a tough grey plastic that comprises the cover and the sighting reflector. I say reflector as this is really a reflecting tape and not a mirror of either plastic or glass. The tape used however is of fairly high quality and gives a very clear and flat reflection with no distortion. If the tape ever becomes damaged from use it shouldn't be too difficult to replace. My guess is that was why they chose this method, not to mention the obvious cost savings in production. The entire unit and cover seat firmly in a dense black rubber base. The base cushions the compass appropriately during hard use and has a location for the included lanyard. The compass comes with a full instruction booklet, but since that is difficult to bring along a miniature version of the booklet and other handy guide cards are seated under the compass for emergency use. The dial is quick and extremely accurate. The dial also appears to be fluid filled and my guess is it would be filled with mineral oil like high grade automotive gauges. This would be to minimize shock to the dial when dropped.

The build quality is good but not on par with the $100+ lighting systems. But again, the selling point of this light is overall value. Some of the nicer features include a bright Xenon bulb paired with miserly LED lights that can blink for hours. Unlike some of the MR11-based bulbs (parabolic track lighting bulbs), the lens assembly has two ports on the right and left sides. This spreads light perpendicularly to the path of travel, which is a nice feature when in traffic. These features combined with a very modest price make this light an excellent choice for the budget conscious.

It is built well, and easy to use.  As I was teaching him to ride, I managed to sneak in a little ride myself ;)!  And though it isn't made to hold my weight, it did hold me, and it was fun!!

Slips out of the container and is completely adjustable on the child's ankle so it provides a perfect fit with no chafing with or without socks.  The instructions and visual aids help the adult explain with ease to the child what the objective is and the child can figure out within two or three kicks what the idea behind this product is.
4793	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	this is an awesome stove.  Does exactly whats it suppose to do.  Two burners let you cook two things at once.  Great fuel economy out of the propane bottles.  This model does not have an ignition on it, so you will need a lighter or match.  No biggie, i always have a lighter or match when taking this camping.  I would recommend this stove for anybody who's camping or needs it for emergency situations.
However, these goggles fit me better than any I can remember having, the fogging is minimal and they don't live big circles like so many. I have so many goggles in my gym bag, it's silly. Brought them all out when these broke and tried them all and they just didn't compare.

Once you get good at it, this thing can sail! When you catch this frisbee at high speeds, it does not hurt your hand because the rubber has some give to it. No pain, all fun, definitely by!

1773	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For the price, these bases are a steal(no pun intended). They're high quality, and they tend to stay more or less in place on a dirt infield. They'll move around a little here and there, but no less than can be expected from bases that aren't tied/screwed down. I just wish it came with the back part of home base for softball, but I know that's not what it's supposed to be used for so no points taken off or anything.

4183	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	These locks are decent for what I need them for. It secures the trigger like it supposed to but the spring loaded nubs that surround the center locking mechanism is cheap and can fall out where the function of those are questionable in preventing the lock from shifting that the trigger of the gun may be freed while still on the gun? May want to look into another alternative.

I am a very heavy guy (280plb) and this eliptical has helped me get started in my work out plans.  The only set back is that there isn't a wide range of motion compared to the elipticals you may find at a gym.  However, I wanted something private, in my own place, that will get the job done.  It is fairly quiet and I know it will last for years.

The instructions are limited, but the set up is relatively intuitive, and a person can set it up solo in less than half an hour.  The frame is sturdy and the net, though lightweight, has held up to everything our 8- and 6yos have kicked at it.  This goal is the "right size" for small kids to shoot at and defend in games, and is a convenient size to set up for practicing targeted shots at home for older kids.
My son was particularly happy about the included water bottle.  For some reason he has a minor obsession with them.  Hydration is his mantra.
4309	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I didn't buy this on Amazon but I found it here because I was searching for a new one to replace this exact model which I purchased at a kitchen store. The way it's designed with the curved handle on the plunger caused it to break off in mid-injection during the second use because it's impossible not to put more pressure on the raised side of the handle. By adding an "ergonomic" handle, someone tried fixing something that wasn't broken.

64	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I go back and forth between Benchmark and DeLorme atlases.  The DeLorme versions feature larger scale, greater detail, more depiction of dirt roads and trails.  Benchmark has a more eye-friendly color scheme and layout, detailed maps for selected cities and land ownership maps (BLM, USFS, State, etc).  Somewhat frustrating as I end up with both for states I travel a lot in.  Benchmark, while not showing as many "roads" as DeLorme, it does a better job of indicating which of those side dirt roads are "primary".  Sometimes the DeLorme is TOO much detail.

4660	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Solid camping stove, no complaints.
The real downside to having the batteries in the enclosure is the hazard created when the housing becomes dislodged during an impact. While this has not happened with the Bell light, it did occur with a Planet Bike light while riding through traffic in NYC. The distraction was extremely dangerous. Losing half of the batteries was not fun either.

4892	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Bought it for elderly relatives who are prone to falls (in between beds).  Not the best for this purpose.  The edge is too high and can cause them to trip, and the surface is shiny enough that it doesn't provide traction.  I eventually had to buy a different one that had tapered edges and a surface that had good traction, that was firm but lower.  If this had been advertised as a "falling" mat, I would have graded it even a bit lower (it does cushion, however).  It's a little bulky, but folds up readily and has carry handles.  The surface is easy to clean and wouldn't attract dirt.  So it's likely a good exercise mat, especially if you want some ample cushioning and don't have to lug it around (it can fit behind a door well).

Last trip up, the dog chewed up our frisbee so I had to find a new one. I ran across this ring on Amazon.

I would recommend viewing the videotape if you have never used pocket hole construction.  I would also recommend getting the Kreg Right Angle Clamp.
Pros:
- Burners. The burners are perfect. I don't know what ever made me think I needed two 20,000 btu burners on the Camp Chef. The two 10,000 btu burners on the Coleman are more than adequate. They easily adjust from almost no flame to a scorching flame with plenty of adjustment in between. I read other reviews that said the flame was hard to adjust, but mine didn't have that problem. I still took the knobs apart and cleaned and re-lubed the needle valves as described in another review. Now they are silky smooth and adjust over about a full rotation of the knobs.

  (d) The included nozzles fit the out-flow port, but not the air intake port.  Because the intake-port is so short, you can't attach it the Boston valves on mattresses or inflatable-rafts -- nowadays they are mostly seated within hard plastic recesses.  Yeah, you can just do the old squeeze-fold-squeeze-fold-squeeze routine, but if I spend $40 on an inflator, I'd like to be able to deflate a big raft with it, too.  Of course, with the battery being nearly dead, it wouldn't have worked anyway.
2093	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy binoculars for the price!
Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible product for the money.  But if you can afford something better, and basketball really matters to you, you can do better.
Overall, I wouldn't buy these again and would hold out for something much more rigid.
4728	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect.
1141	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great set of resistance bands. It comes with a variety of bands equaling different amounts of pound resistance. It also comes with the ankle straps if you want to use the bands to do leg exercises as well 2 handles to clip the band(s) onto for arm exercises. There is a bag if you care to store them in the bag and a small paper booklet giving you some examples of different exercises you can do.  These are a good alternative to free weights or weight machines. You can do so many different exercises with them and work a variety of muscles.  Keep in mind, if one band doesn't satisfy your weight resistance desire, you can double or triple them up, just hook them onto the handle or ankle strap and work with the combined resistance. I have been using these for a little over a month and stretching them pretty good during my use, and I see no signs of wear or tear.  Anyone looking to add a little variety to their workout or for an alternative to weights or machines, I would definitely give these a try.

I'm keeping mine as a backup and hopefully I can find something that fits me better. The mattress inflates nice and plump and I could not feel the ground below at all. It also felt comfortable.

6517	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I can't get over how far it goes!  No issues thus far and it works properly.  Kids are not too interested in it but the oldest is 6 so I am a little ahead of the curve!

8209	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love it.
4906	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I recently got a yoga hammock but the only place I could put it was downstairs in my basement which has cement floors, so I didn't want to go upside down without a mat underneath me. This fits perfectly in the space I have available and now I'm not so worried about breaking my neck. Lightweight, easy to carry with the handle, doesn't smell too much like new plastic. I'm happy with it!

3845	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These skates are ADORABLE. Beyond adorable, actually and such GREAT quality. My 4 year old cant really skate but these feel secure and shes all about practicing in them. Loves the pink wheels. I see a lot of super cool ones with personality for older girls, but we got really flashy accessories and she loves the look.
7084	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	love it
3221	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Kinda cheap but works!
7415	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Got this for my 7 year old daughter and she loved it. Only issue with it was the right handle bar was smashed into a oval vice a circle. I had to hammer it into shape. In most cases I would send it back for replacement but since this was from "Santa" I couldn't do that. The scooter works great and she rides it daily in and outdoors.
1879	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I got this on sale during black Friday.  The pair had some minor scratches on the knob for adjusting focus and one of the lens cups was a bit loose so I deducted a star.  Other than that, these look and feel nice.  They are surprisingly heavy though which can be annoying if using for a long time but since this is my first pair of binoculars that weren't kids toys, I don't have anything to compare it to.

2781	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This boat is very nice and durable. We took it down the river and the kids a lot of fun with it. I think it is worth the price and I like that it had the paddles with it.

8809	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	GREAT FOR THE KNEES EXERCISES. REAL STURDY & DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  I ORDERED IT THROUGH AMAZON.COM

4490	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	True to their reputation this cook stove is excelent
4102	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use and works well. Would recommend.
3749	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this pump in conjunction with a Coleman Comfort Control Air Mattress and I'm very pleased with both.  The pump filled the air mattress firmly in under a minute when plugged in, and the pump seems to hold a charge quite well.  The nozzles included make the pump ideal when inflating a Coleman air mattress, as they're custom made for each other.  The air pump takes the next step, though, in including additional nozzles that would (presumably) enable one to easily fill other inflatable items (short of a basketball or bike tire).  The only minor annoyance to me was that the pump is quite noisy.  If you're planning to use this at the campground, try to make sure you get your business done before other campers go to bed, especially if you're in close proximity.  (Also, this product would have been pretty close to perfect if it had 9V car adapter capability.)  Outside of that, this is a very efficient air pump - the price is more than worth the assurance that I won't have to spend an hour laid out on the tent floor getting chapped lips from blowing up the air mattress.
6371	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	love this frisbee
1478	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	great fun!
9186	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These aren't as good as Teeter, but they are less expensive and it's a good alternative when your Teeters finally break.
4481	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Same price at Walmart..  as expected...
528	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This products does not pass the test of time and by that I mean less than a year. My brothers and I use these bands just about every day and I guess you could say that we use them more than your average person. That being said all the bands have tears in them and one has completely ripped and one of the handles is broken. So if your actually going to be using them more daily they will eventually rip. I guess the saying is right you get what you pay for.
3822	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Freakin sweet I love this dart board it adds a nice touch to my apartment..however the cork seems to leave big holes after throwing a couple of darts suggesting that it will wear out soon and the darts will no longer stick but I haven't encountered that problem yet so we'll have to see also its kinda heavy but I think they're supposed to be a decent amount of weight..great buy though for quality.
8001	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Slightly better than the black Franklin ball but does not work as advertised.  Doesn't keep the glow very long at all.  Pink color makes it slightly less better than the Franklin ball.
2659	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	love these - they don't like sharp rocks but otherwise they are great and also comfy on land to lounge and read
931	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The items are just like you'd expect them to be.  They're functional and stores easily.  Customer service is great as well.  The ankle strap was missing and the red band had a tear in it.  An email and a couple days later, the ankle strap and red band arrived at my door.  Resistant bands are a nice alternative to weights, and if you're opting for resistant bands, you can't go wrong with bands.
I wonder about the other people here. I know some people you just can't make happy at all no matter what you try. I have seen this to many times. I think Bell products are good. Far as rain getting in my light that want happen I have a clear bag for days I think it might rain. I keep a few on hand at all times. Never know what the weather will bring our way when out riding. I have three lights on my bike. Having a light on a bicycle is a must have for me. I ride to work on my bicycle and I never know what time I might get off from work. I also have a small engine on my bike too. I don't our car much any more  I have more fun riding to work and going shopping on my bicycle. Yes I do have large Baskets on it too. Now go out and start having fun ride that bicycle again.
5296	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Comfortable and haven't had any issues with fogging up. I just use them to swim in the pool recreationally. Clear under water and doesn't leak which keeps my contacts happy. Good product
5667	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This gear is awesome, it does protect those sensitive bony areas. They fit well, not too tight and easily adjustable. They are quality.
405	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	To tell the truth I haven't used these as much as I had intended to. They are good quality and nicely made. The bag is super handy too, so you don't have bands laying everywhere!!
1691	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works great for a 6 1/2 year old.
8602	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Nice
6983	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works great, no issues after 5 months of ownership. Price was good.

8777	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great stuff, I bought it to cushion my hips when I do gluteus bridge with the olympic bar. And it is also good for driving long distant and sitting on hard chairs.  Most important for me is to use it for stability exercise-where you stand on one leg and balance ( I used it at my physical therapy treatment and it worked for straightening the knee and ankle ).

8641	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It works my chest which is good.
4980	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great workout mat for the home.
2286	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 2-year old loves it. It was easy to put together. Build quality is excellent! I'm sure that this tricycle will be enjoyed by my son, my daughter, and several other children after them. No complaints whatsoever.
173	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I am a teacher and I use these bands for an after school fitness club for middle school students. They are very durable and the students love them. The only problem I have with them is the material that connects the handle to the band is rough on the edges. After about a half an hour of use your thumbs can get pretty irritated by the friction if you do not keep adjusting the grip.

5201	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It is a good value and ours has lasted about 3 years until it broke from lots of use....for the money you cant go wrong.  I'm buying another one to replace the broken one. Very easy to assemble and light for kids to move around in garage or driveway or basement..
4590	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Works great!
395	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great to have when traveling or doing at home workouts. You have everything you need. Great quality.
