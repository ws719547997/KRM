These nonreinforced nylon levers are probably OK for use on most tires not containing an internal steel wire within the inner bead.
9953	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This is an okay waste container, but I found that it was not worth it to me to pay this much for something which has similar competition for less money. I bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. It is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price. It won't tip over, which is good, but I would hope that by the time someone is middle-aged like me, they would know how to handle garbage without making a huge mess in the car.
Hold the pump tightly at its junction to the container and start pumping LEASURELY.

-Extra filter is a nice perk.

5491	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This step hitch is more suited to compact SUV's rather than large trucks/SUV's. Originally wanted this for my F150 but it looked to small and dainty. Wound up going with a Go Rhino step hitch which looks much better.

7444	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is an amazing towel. I was very surprised how fast and easily it dried off my car. It soaks up large amounts of water & is quickly ready for more as soon as you squeeze it out. At first I thought it was leaving a film on the car surface but within seconds it goes away. I highly recommend this.

 Another thing I like is the simple windshield mounting bracket that has a big knob for easy repositioning on the window frame. The bracket has a generous opening to clamp over any windshield frame.

4- The vacuum pump is a "reverse action pump" meaning it creates suction on the up swing of the pumping action. That means you need to really hold the bottom of the pump down where it connects to the container (THIS is the weak link IF not used with care).
9248	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love putting the top down in my convertible during the fall and even well into the winter. This blanket keeps my girlfriend nice and toasty while we enjoy the drive.

1865	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I love California dusters for keeping my car clean between washes.  For some reason this last one I received leaves a little bit of of a waxy residue on the car, but I'm guessing it'll disappear after I've picked up a bit more dust.  This wooden handle model is very nice; my last one was plastic but still lasted for years.  A few quick sweeps keeps saves me a fortune in car washes.  Definitely a must for anyone that likes keeping their car clean but doesn't want to hit the car wash all the time.
I used it on several things, but I purchased it mainly for the LCD screens on my testing equipment and a fish finder, because of many hazy spots, most likely from rubbing while packed and traveling. But I don't recall using this product before and that was what was important in the end, and why reviews can be important.
8692	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Seems like a well made piece, I think the mounting bracket is designed to be a top of the windshield placement. Might have to McGyver something to get it lower for my use.

4668	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this along with their M40 (regular strength) in case it was needed. I used it on another older car and it was great and took less time than using M40. I prefer to to have both. If M40 is not strong enough, out comes this M39.  So you should own both. It is best to use, in my opinion the weakest strength product if you can. Many people said this M39 is great for removing wax that got on the black vinyl, and it is, but in my case the M40 was fine for our new SUV.
7805	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these for at least 5 years and it has to be hands down the best thing for taking care of my car I've ever used.  I leave it under my seat and it's perfect for when you get out of the car wash and need to dry your car off quick so you don't get water spots.  It's also great for wiping off the inside of the car, or even washing the car at home.  Seriously a great buy.
I don't usually writes review, but they deserve this good one from me.
8594	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Good work out  machine. But worthless. I pump 12-15 times then after 5 minutes the oil back flow back so you have to re-pump it.

Real disappointing given the rave reviews for this product on this site.

Bottom line: It does exactly what it say's it does! Excellent product!

Ultimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.

9110	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought a can of this at a big box home store several years ago to use in my shop. My main reason at the time was for my table saw and band saw tables. I found it easy to use and began using it on some of the furniture projects I built. It worked great for that as well and was easy to apply and buff out. My original can was getting low and I was considering what to get in its place. Fine Woodworking Magazine published an article earlier this year comparing different waxes. I was very happy to read this was one of their top pics, especially for the price. After that it was a no brainer for me to get another can. The big box no longer stocks this brand, but Amazon does!

4671	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It works pretty good.  I drive a 2013 taurus sho with black trim on the bottom of the whole car.  I got some wax on some of the areas which made them chalky white.  I bought this primarily to clean the whiteness off.  It worked well but I had to reapply a few times and scrub with a scouring pad.
Anyway, always test a spot that won't matter first, but this is a good product to use after toothpaste. It just does a very fine polish to remove the tiniest of scratches and did little on the haze on my screens from rubbing while they were packed and transported.
* There's a relatively high amount of friction in the material, so it's hard to move it across the car. After a few minutes of use it improves a bit.
1621	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these years ago and it worked great until I washed it.

4235	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Can't really recommend them. I was about 230 pounds at the time and all the cushions fell off 2 of these within a month or two of heavy use. Then I had to always fiddle around with them to try and keep the the cushions in place under my butt or to them from blowing away while trailering. Turned out it wasn't worth all the effort. What a shame. These would be the best cheap lightweight boat seats on the planet if they could figure out how to permanently attach the cushions. The plastic "snaps" they use now (or whatever they are) just don't hold up. On the plus side, the seats themselves are very durable and should last years and years. they are also comfortable enough without the cushions, so I say just buy the cheaper version that doesn't have cushions till this gets corrected.
5027	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for washing my car!
5418	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Tried to save a buck...you get what you pay for. The clamp actually popped itself off as soon as I mounted it.
4690	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Plugged it into a less than one year old normally working automotive battery. After leaving it plugged in for 20 hours and over night temperatures of 7F the vehicle would crank but would not start. Hooked up a battery charger I know works, it reported that the battery was at 50%. After leaving the other brand battery charger hooked up for ten minutes the engine cranked and started.
We are carry three adult and one child's bike.  The child's bike will only fit in the last space ( won't work with two small bikes). By alternating the two men's and the girl's bikes, we were able to carry all four without additional hardware.

5242	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car.  The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying.  The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts.  I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle, which works very well.  I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows...then go back over it with the chamois.  It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good. You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash.  It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois.
312	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	ok
7498	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cannot rave about this chamois enough!!!!  I had gotten a sham-wow before and was disappointed in it.

4725	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Hooked yo to a car that only gets about 30 miles a year and the battery is fresh as new each time I go to run it it starts right up.

I could have replaced it with the same but went to Home Depot and they had one type of replacement motor on the shelf.  In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference.  The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.

5183	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable.  It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.  I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist, bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific.  I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.

BOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  It comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.

4689	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My truck would sit for weeks, and the battery would go flat.  You know, flattery of the battery.  So, I'd have to take the battery out, drag it upstairs (my parking is in a basement garage in my building), scrounge up a battery charger, charge it, and reverse the process.  Again and again.  The breakthrough came when I became aware that there was an electrical outlet in the garage.  Time to get serious.  I thoroughly studied Amazon's website for an appropriate charger, and decided on this little beauty.  It is designed to be permanently mounted in a vehicle (such as a hobby car that's rarely driven), or a boat, or a riding lawn mower, or you know whatever.  It is permanently wired to the battery, and merely plugged into to go to work.  It has a little computer which knows what to do, so it'll charge the battery, then switch to maintenance mode to sustain the charge, and it communicates it's behavior and the battery state of charge through LED lamps.  I installed this unit in my engine compartment, bolted to an inner fender panel, and indeed permanently wired it to my battery.  I don.t leave it perpetually active, but when the battery charge wanes, I just unreel an extension cord, plug it in, and in a few hours it's charged, and the LEDs tell me so.  This unit, so installed and so used, has completely gotten me off the hook for the flat battery travail.  It's quiet, it runs cool, and it does the job.  Honest, it's doubled the joy of the vehicle.  This story emphasizes one of the chief secondary merits of Amazon, which is research on their website, which is a wonder of practical  information.

Will advise to use a foam applicator that has a more dense foam or else you will waste product and have the entire foam pad soaked. Instructions say to apply, let set, and mist with water and wipe to remove but I dampened a microfiber cloth and buffed it off then went over with dry microfiber as the repellent instantly works and spraying with water bottle just caused water to roll off.

I would rather have something like this device than nothing at all when venturing deer area.  I would install this on all my vehicles.

8638	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't realize there was such a thing as an oil pump until I decided in August that I would winterize my wakeboard boat with an inboard Indmar engine.  Of course, there is no hole in the bottom of the boat so how do I drain the oil.  Well, I considered this Hydro-Turf product along with 2-3 more expensive brands and gambled on this one since I would only use it once a year.  Well, this pump worked so well, that I used it on my Yamaha jet ski and my Yamaha ATV.  Using it on the ATV saved the need to remove the shield under the engine.  Admittedly, the pump is very slow, but they all are since the hose must fit, in most cases, down the dip stick shaft.  Highly recommended product.  Also, I was able to drain ALL the 5+ quarts of oil from the Indmar engine with one extraction cycle.

I found it helpful to use a typical tarp on top of this units "tarp" to try to have an easier way to gather the dirt from the corners, funnel the dirt into a wheel barrow while unloading, cover the load while on the road, and keep the dirt out of this units woven fabric. When it's time to unload, I first need to dig out the area in front of and behind the wheel wells (throwing that dirt onto the tail gate partly to help weigh it down). If I don't do that, any dirt that's between the cab and those wheel wells makes it seem like the load is hitting a wall where it's impossible to wind this up. Again, the pictures show the perfect pile centered in the truck (with almost nothing going into those sides), but after you've driven very far (going over some bumps etc) it will probably have shifted to the sides making you have to dig them out.  If I don't dig out behind the wheel wells, then the dirt near the edges can snag my tarp on the brackets as well as the trucks tailgate cables.

5275	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought my first Absorber in 1990 and still use it to this day. However, it has become frayed around the edges and has been relegated to cleaning dirtier parts like the wheels and exhaust. In 2006, I bought a new Absorber which I use to dry my sports car and my wife's SUV. However, I've noticed recently that the new Absorber is simply not soaking up the water like it used to. I even run it through the washer hoping that would revitalize its drying ability but it did not. That said, I'm going to buy a new one this weekend and hope it works better. Regardless, it's hard to fault the price of the Absorber and how long I've used it. For that reason, I won't use anything else to dry my cars!

I have a Sea Doo Speedster boat on a trailer made by Caravan.  Someone broke my right-hand ("passenger side" of a car) tail light when I was on the lake.  I couldn't find an exact replacement locally or online, but I did find this one that had the same dimensions.  I ordered it, and the holes fit perfectly on my trailer.  The plastic "ribbing" on the inside of the light is a slightly different pattern than the other side, but unless you closely inspect you would never know they aren't perfectly matched.  Bulb intensity is the same as the other side, which is good.  The wiring was easy, although I did have to just use wire cutters to cut off the little plug on the end.  The wire colors match exactly with the trailer wiring, so it only took me about 15 minutes of time to install from start to finish (and lots of you could probably be done in under 5 minutes).

Nothing really, just be aware it takes some time to dry out completely.  I usually let it get semi-dry by hanging, so it's still pliable, then fold and roll it.  I place it part way into the case so it sticks out abit then leave it out for a day before tucking the entire thing in the canister.  Otherwise it will take forever to dry.  I've never seen or smelled any mildew, so I think this technque is solid.  When you pull it out it will be stiff like cardboard, but a few drops of water will restore it to its useable condition(just like a real chamois!)
102	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It covers many Explorer models and is a little less complete than I expected but the price/condition/shipping cost was EXCELLENT!

I ran the fan for a few hours on each setting, thinking that the whistling may disappear after break-in.  It did not go away.  After experimenting a little, I found that the fan did not make the whistling sound with the front grill removed.  Air flowing through the front grill is definitely the cause of the whistle.  I like the fan well enough to keep it, and may try deburing and smoothing the edges of the front grill to see if it helps.  The motor and blades run smooth and quiet.  Other than the intermittent whistle I really like the fan and  I expect it to come in handy this summer.

Mine would, after a few weeks, have random clutter strewn about--parking garage tickets, receipts, fast food boxes, etc.  This little thing you can plop on the floor of the passenger side, drop everything in it, and empty it whenever you are at a gas station!  It's made a huge difference in the cleanliness of my car.  I really like the velcro on the bottom of the bin, and the interior is leakproof and doesn't get wet and sticky.  It's also a perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It'll fit a few soda bottles, but doesn't take up the entire passenger floor or anything.  Buy this product!
 This Milwaukee has the right speed, and it is variable if you want to go into a different level of polishing, than the automotive level. With 11 amps in the motor, you are sure to have the kind of power that will guarantee a constant speed, even when you have a 7" bonnet loaded with compound.

I leave it under the front seat and it never gets moldy or odd-smelling.  I use it with a single bucket of water -- I dunk the absorber into the bucket, slosh on the water to clean it off, then I rinse off the absorber again, wring it out and dry off the car.  Rinse and repeat.  Leaves very few streaks and has a "grip" that helps clean and dry at the same time.

These are just words. Why must I type so many words to say something is GOOD. This thing is REALLY GOOD.
- Shake it out once in awhile. As it accumulates dust you want to give it a good shake to get rid of the excess. Also you don't want to trap a piece of debris in the duster and end up dragging it across a scratchable surface.
Another reviewer mentioned the same thing.  This is not the same as it used to be.
I recommend buying the extension right away BEFORE putting together your yakima basket, if you're even thinking about buying the extension. Just buy it and save the trouble of screws stripping. In order to get the stripped screw out, I took a chisel and a hammer and banged the head of the screw off, then took middle nose pliers and removed the problem which was inside the tube. Was a pain in my butt, but I read the reviews and figured it would happen to me. And it did.

7226	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The "Absorber" truly is a great all-around product. It is a time-saver and quickly and efficiently cleans my car without leaving water-spots behind. It is sturdy and durable, and the provided container gives great convenient storage--these chamois last for years with proper use and stand up to the test of time. Only a small note for new buyers: don't forget the chamois on the driveway! The product stands up to pretty much everything--except being totally dried out and "baked" in the sun!

9836	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This one filter has done the job in my 2001 Silverado for 13 years and 225,000 miles. I have never had the heads off, so I cannot comment on the condition of the cylinder walls. Does not burn oil and still runs great. I have not cleaned it as often as I should have. Have only cleaned it 2 times. So counting it being clean when installed, it's been without dirt 3 times in 225,000 miles. No evidence that any dirt ever got through it. Use the K&N cleaner and no other cleaners. Do not use hot water as it can shrink the cotton fibers making the filter look wavy. All of the dirt will wash out with ease. Let dry, I sit mine in front of a fan. Recoat with the K&N oil which is red so you can see that you have fully covered it. Put a thin coat of K&N grease on the neoprene seal and you are ready again. This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow, even when very dirty. I have these in all of my vehicles, not to save money, but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow. Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest. Not possible with the oil soaked K&N.

 This stuff really shines once you get your car speed up a little and the drag of the air flow begins to carry away the droplets of water.  For me, with a fresh application, this is about 40mph to hit full effect.

If you're a smaller person, you may get full body coverage out of it.  Like most electric blankets, it works best if you have it under another layer of covers.
2383	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	That was the first time I installed a Starter and I was very satisfied I was able to identify the wirings. Their website somehow has a compilation of color-coded wirings for every car/year. It was very helpful including the installation videos on the net. I noticed that there is a connector in my car where those little wirings seems to converge to. This connector is not connected to any. It must be for the T-harness they call it. I might have installed it easily if I have it. I have a car manual and I can read diagrams so it helped a lot in the installation. The only cons: The LED tester that came with it was defective. It only light up RED on positive hit only! So I used a VOM for the Negatives.
2653	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This tool does what it claims to do. If you take into consideration its price and its being manual verse automatic, it does a very good job. I didn't find I needed to do the 'cut a 1/4" notch' and reposition the spacers as another reviewer suggested. It sounds like a very good idea though if needed. I did find that securely mounting it to a stable bench or welding table that is about waist high, plus placing a couple of wood slims between mounting base and the bottom side of the tool that fits into the mounting base really helps to make the tool stable and it doesn't move around while un-mounting/re-mounting a tire. You have enough things to do working with changing a tire without having to also do a balancing act with a moving target. Having the tool mounted at waist high provides you with the opportunity to use your upper body strength to an advantage. If you need more leverage on remounting the tire bead place a short piece of pipe as needed with a diameter just big enough to fit over the end of the tire bead mounting tool. Also having a good smooth end tip tire tool would be nice to have as needed. The smooth end is to reduce the chance of cutting the bead &/or inner tube. I purchased this tool at the local Northern Tool store.
4661	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought one for my car about four years ago. Still using it so got one for my riding mower. Mounted it on the mower so I just plug in, which is great in the cooler months.

They only pays toward your theft deductible! If you happen to be using The Club on a vehicle that does not have theft coverage then the "guarantee" is completely worthless!
3008	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great cover for the money. Fits well too. Wal mart carries these in our town, but sometimes they're out of stock, or not stocked in the size I need. I live in Northern California and the covers are mostly to shield the cars from the Sun. They do pick up morning moisture and dry out almost daily 6 months out of the year, but it does keep that little bit of water from mixing with surface dust and ruining the car's paint.

I cannot find anything that would scratch my car, except *maybe* those grommets. The car cover fit my little Hyundai Elantra OK, but it looks rather baggy in places. On a windy day, you will need to use twine (or similar) with those grommets.

1471	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After installing it occurred to me that perhaps the little membrane patches are meant to be overlaid with a real rubber patch. But since there's no adhesive on tops it doesn't quite computer. Buffed the area well and Applied the first patch to a small well-defined puncture in the tube, installed it into the tire and put it aside for a while. In an hour the tire was flat. Repeated the process and forcefully stitched down the little membrane patch as hard as I could, rolling  between my fingers. Reinflated to 60-actually 50 pounds per square inch and set it aside for 24 hours. Tested the pressure and got a reading of 50. Took the mtn. bike on a 5 mile riide on hard surfaces at speeds up to 25 on descent. Pressure held steady. Decided to check reviews upon my return and was quite concerned about the negatives-which have a high degree of credibility. However my experience so far use okay and I'll go with it and see. Wll update if something changes.

1787	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As always the way to go ,compared to then knock offs.
1342	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A very good useable creeper that could definitely use some kind of head rest. It gets you very near the ground while still having large wheels that roll over small obstacles very well. The main downside is that the head neck area is somewhat uncomfortable. Despite that, I would buy it again.
8657	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is rather expensive for a plastic contraption, but it does work well, so I guess it is worth the expense. My car requires that a shield be removed from under the car to change oil. With the pump, I no longer have to remove it, making oil changes much faster and easier.

It's my understanding that the se-1-12s is a true 'float' charger, meaning that after a regular charge cycle, it continues to deliver continuous current and can immediately respond to a drop in voltage by switching back to the high current charge mode. This style is preferred by people who plug in so that they can use 12v accessories when the engine is not running without fear of draining the battery.

8331	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I will say I was apprehensive about the mirror as it was priced low.  I am very happy with it so far.  If I get one full season out of the suction cup on the mirror I will call it a good buy.  I think it will last longer than that though as it appears to be of decent quality.  Not a large mirror but a good sized one for my needs.  I have a small jet boat and it works great for when I do not have an observer in the boat pulling the tube or skier.  I then take it off and store it when not in use.  No problems with it so far and I have used it on three weekends.

This is a great product @ a great price.
1000	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I've used countless type pans over the years and had to replace one that finally gave out.  I decided to try this one by Rhino because it was enough to cover two oil changes for my vehicles and could be closed up.  Well it has fit in two oil changes, however, the closing up is a different story.  My main complaint has been with the train spout: It LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!  I changed the oil in one truck, put the pan in the back of my other truck overnight and came out to a good half quart leaked out.  I thought maybe I didn't tighten the cap down enough so I gave it another quarter turn and the next day was more of the same.  As much as I liked the concept, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.
It works so well that I purchased another bottle when my first one began to run out.
It took multiple applications. I literally sat there with a stool and waxed on and waxed off for a good hour. After a lot of patience and elbow grease, the results were amazing. It even cleared up the damage my f&*(^ brother in law did. One day he thought he'd try and fix it himself with sandpaper. UGH! This product cleaned it up so good that unless you put your face right up to the lens, you can't really see the scratches.
This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need.
8979	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice product. I own a few of these. Great deterrent.
3212	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a good quality hose that can be used for a variety of applications depending on the fittings that you use for it.

3900	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Not the most sturdy funnels out there. the neck gets crushed easily.
5575	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It arrived in good shape and with not defects.  Would give 5 stars except for the fact that the anti-rattle wedge was too thick to work with my 2" receiver.  Less than 1/8" would slide into the receiver.  I alternatively use 2" dark gray duct tape just inside where it fit into the receiver on the first hole.  I also put two layers on the end, then cut the holes out with a small pocket knife.  It is mounted perfectly straight (horizontal to the vehicle) with no rattles and looks great.  My wife even likes it.  She can step up when washing our 2015 Ford Escape and it protects the bumper (with sensors).  It does not affect the functioning of the back-up or side approach sensors.  Others have mentioned that the end caps can come off, so I was going to glue them on, but found that, even though they are loose around the edges, they are attached in the middle to some sort of a bracket, so I left them alone.  For extra protection, I waxed it, including the rubber step, with Turtle Wax Ice, which doesn't turn white on black plastic or rubber.  This should help protect against the step turning white over time as some have mentioned.
497	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great direct replacement battery for your power wheels. Just be sure to check your model and the style battery connector that you need. This battery was kind of vague on the connector type.
3312	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a great product.  It's reasonably easy to apply and it works well.  Why only 4 stars? I'm unfortunately fairly lazy with stuff like this.  I get inspired, clean the windshield, apply the Rain-X, enjoy the incredibly clear view for a while.  Then what happens is the product starts to wear off and actually your windshield gets worse than it would be without Rain-X.  The rain drops seem to actually stick in place, like the surface gets addicted to Rain-X or something.  So anyway I often don't get around to replacing it until months after it needs to be re-applied. This means that although my windshield is perfect for a month or two, the average clarity of my windshield might be considered worse than if I had not used Rain-X at all.  That said, it does an excellent job if you keep on top of it.  If you use an inexpensive micro fiber detailing cloth to clean your window just prior to applying, it's really pretty easy to put on.

5266	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Any of you that have a boat and like to take care of it know that you need to clean it every time you take it out of the water. I don't mean a scrub down and wax, but wiping down the inside and outside with mild cleaner is essential to keeping the boat new. I use Ducky's on the outside for the water spots, but was just using a wet towel on the inside. I was not happy with the snide results. I use the final cleaner/conditioner at the beginning of the season, but every trip is impractical. This is the answer. Spray on, wipe off, done. Gets off soda, beer, sweat, sunscreen, everything that will make your seats dirty. Just spray and wiped own the boat and the seats stay nice and white. A must have if you ever plan on selling your boat down the line.

Working great.
5935	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good, thank you
9234	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I initially like this product.  It seems to be of descent quality especially for the price.  I hooked it up and ran it for about 15 minutes while just sitting in my truck and it got pretty warm.  The only thing I am concerned about is if it blows fuses after 30 minutes of use while driving my truck.  I will probably run another line for it directly off the battery.  Once again I urge you to think about what you are purchasing and how much you will be using it.  It is not costly enough for me to trouble myself with sending it back if not satisfied and I took this in to consideration when purchasing.  It is very inexpensive and I do not intend to be using it on a daily basis or I would not have purchased it.  Use your good sense.

There is plenty of room for even long lug nuts with this item. It has a lifetime guarantee, and you can't get much better than that. Highly recommended.

I also purchased white, black, brown and yellow coloring agent to match my gel coat very closely. Trial and error mixing of small batches without the hardener, will allow you to dab on the boat, compare and then wipe off. Keep in mind that this has no tint, so unless matching a colored hull, you will be mainly be adding white. Once I had a feel for the ratio, using a small putty knife, I mixed up roughly 1 ounce globs on a mixing board. A dab of white and then toothpicks to drag in just enough of the other colors to match the off white hull color. A little goes a long way!

I read of one guy who's been trying to remove this for three years. It does NOT wear AWAY with time in very hot areas of the country it gets baked on. This stuff shouldn't be sold if it makes your car and vision very dangerous. I am very unhappy with this product.
4931	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I love keeping my car clean, it is a necessity to have one of these when drying a car off after washing it. It can be used for multiple things but what I use it for is cleaning up the water off of my car. I have seen people use it to dry off their dogs, and other things...but it works fine for getting water off of cars. I am always amazed at how much water this one chamois can hold. I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn't like having to deal with towels, as this can be used more efficiently than towels. Towels have to get washed and once they have gotten soaked you cannot fully rinse out the towel like you can with this product. I keep mine with me in my car.

But installation is problematic. The sucking cup doesn't work, which is more or less expected. My Acura TL has a small tab on the ceiling where you can clip your garage door opener, I am able to squeeze the rubber cup into the tab and it stays there just fine.

7062	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't expect this to actually work this well. It's incredible. Just slide it across the surface of your car after washing and the water just disappears. It leaves no streaks, swirls, or scratches. I used to use a leaf blower to dry my car but this works so much faster, and no noise. Just wring it out and put it back in the box when done. I usually leave it out to dry for about 20 minutes before putting it up.

9451	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this on my 1995 Acura Integra (B18B1 engine). My only complaint is that it fit rather loosely in my crank pulley and kept falling out as I was setting up my wrench to pop out the bolt. But I still gave it 5 stars because I couldn't imagine getting that crank pulley off any other way. The Helms service manual calls for a very similar tool that I'm sure is only available to Honda/Acura dealerships. I don't like buying tools that serve only one purpose, but the $25 or so I spent on this was well worth it.
First, they still have the 1/4-turn actuation, which is not much leverage. Engaging -- no problem, you just twist and the spring load will push the splines into place as the axle turns. But disengaging, now you're fighting spline friction with low mechanical advantage. You just have to have the wheels loose/unloaded or you won't be able to disengage -- not always an easy requirement to meet in off-road situations. The other 3/4-turn designs from MM or RR are superior here.

Well it did fit nice but needs to be held into place. I have a lil tip for people that don't have a extra pair of hands. Take electrical tape and wrap it around the tool a few time, and that should keep it in place. I have POWERBUILT AXLE SOCKETS AND THEY ARE GREAT . Have not used this yet but should perform great.

If you are going to secure the car cover against wind with the grommets and twine, then go find yourself a little key fob or something similar. It need not be big or heavy, but it should be made out of something that will not scratch your car. Keep this object tied to one end of your twine. You can toss this object under your car when using the car cover. It makes the job easy.

Took it over to my truck and in just one application it took off paint transfer off a brake light where some jerk with a black vehicle swung a door into the light. I was actually prepared to buy a new taillight after scraping and multiple washes did nothing to satisfy my OCD personality but this just saved me a bunch of money. Still feels like I have half a bottle left even after all these applications. Bottom line is I highly would recommend this product. Time will tell how long it will remain haze free but even if I have to apply this monthly I feel it is a great value.
There is little to no seal, and the hose doesn't stay connect to the pump.
Since I didn't get the counter until we'd had the new boat a couple of weeks, I advanced the count about 10 hours (estimated use 'till then) so from then on hours counted-displayed were fairly accurate. (Useful for maintenance/oil change etc.) Do this with a couple of clips on the battery posts and watch a clock for the hour count you want.

Update: I use this only to power the stove long enough to shut down. I do not use it to power the stove for extended periods. It is not a pure sine-wave inverter, so it should not be used for sensitive electronics dependent on pure frequency controlled sine-wave power. For my application, it runs long enough to either shut down or give me time to fire up a generator that is capable of running the stove for longer and with higher quality power.
4702	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	A friend and I were invited to participate in an article for Muscle Car Review that was covering proper care and preservation of older paint jobs that was held down at Meguiars in Costa Mesa, CA.  The writer of the article decided to include a section devoted to vinyl care since my 27 year old white vinyl top on my '67 GTO definitely needed some TLC.  I had tried various commercial products over the years without success, and had even tried Simple Green and Purple Power that also failed to really clean the top.  Mike, the Meguiars tech, worked a small area at a time with very little effort until he had expanded the cleaned area out to about a one foot square. That portion of vinyl literally looked like new.  Since this was for a magazine article, that's where they stopped after getting the necessary photos for the article.  Although I was a little worried (OK, very worried) that the remainder of roof might never equal what a professional had done, I arrived home and placed my Amazon order for the #39 cleaner along with other products they had used on my paint with excellent results.  Well, the cleaner arrived yesterday, and we finished cleaning the roof by doing a small section at a time and working the cleaner in with a brush and then wiping off the cleaner and dirt.  While it was a slow process, it was not tedious or hard work.  Our finished result looked every bit as good as the spot cleaned down at Meguiars, and we cannot tell where they started and we finished the cleaning - and we know where the two joined up.  We did use a full bottle on the roof, but it really had a lot of embedded dirt that had to be removed.  I'll see if I can't post up a picture where we cleaned up to the tape with the other side of the taped area not touched yet.  We also found that a short, soft bristled brush worked best in getting into the pockets and lifting out the dirt.  On a side note, the guys also tested out the #40 cleaner on the vinyl roof and it was just about half as effective cleaning the roof.  I'm ordering more bottles of the #39 and going after my vinyl seats next.

I used it to change the oil on my Mini Cooper and it was great not jacking up the car.  I literally didn't spill a drop or get a drop in my hands.  I've heard from other research it removes at least as much as the old fashion method.  The only down side is that even with hot oil it took a good 20 minutes to extract.

Transporting the used oil for disposal was clean and easy. Highly recommend this product.
I wish this were installed on every vehicle sold! Great product
6103	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I considered purchasing the pricier plastic lens polishing systems, which are offered, but decided to try this stuff since it was much cheaper and was highly recommended by others.  I used it to polish the ten-year old headlight lenses on my van, which were very well scratched and oxidized so I could not see the lamps inside. But, after using this stuff with a regular shop rag, I was able to polish the lenses to where I could clearly see the lamps inside. Although, I was not able to get out the deeper scratches, It worked well enough for my purposes.

There was only about 12" of excess Brown/Green/Yellow wire left over when I finished, so I would not recommend this for any trailer larger than 5'x8'. I didn't care for the length of the white chassis ground wire. The chassis ground was only about 30" long (just the length needed for the plugin cord), leaving me with a choice of either splicing it with more wire so it would reach to an existing lighting stud further back on the trailer or drill a hole for a new ground point right at the end of the tongue. I opted for drilling a hole on the tongue so I wouldn't have a wire splice inside the trailer conduit where I couldn't get to later on. I also had to pick up a crimp terminal which could have been included with the kit in order to make the ground.

4663	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I commute via bicycle, and my truck has a farad capacitor on the stereo which has quite a parasitic drain on the battery.  So after getting tired of constantly having to jump the truck every time I wanted to drive, I got this unit and mounted it beside the battery.  Works great, battery is always charged.  I just wish the cord were longer so I could plug it in without having to raise the hood.  I'm trying to find a nice short extension cord for this purpose...
SO...buy it, install it, put the cool sticker on the airbox, look at it every oil change, and unless it's filthy....LEAVE IT ALONE!
7021	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works well, seems to be sturdy enough for it's intended purpose.
The "solution" for this Bulldog RS1100 or any other DIY remote starter is that you have to put your spare, factory supplied key inside the unit.  The "bypass module" can be a separate unit or it can be integral, as it is with this RS1100.  The car can then be started remotely because the car detects the RFI signal from the spare key.
They're easy to put together.
My mechanic uses a more sophisticated (and much more expensive) OBD scanner in his day to day work, but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own car, this tool is worth the $89 investment. If you paid more, you paid too much.
The slightest bump or movement and it stops working.
6590	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This unit works great, I'd would surely buy it again.
I really like that you can use this as a small humidifier without any oil. And my experience has been that using essential oils in the amount recommended will do well with a small room -- but not a big room.
Overall I'm pleased and very much like the fact that I'll no longer be laying under the Car to drain Hot Motor Oil. It's also a plus that our Vehicles have the Engine Oil Filter access on top as well.

7227	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I love keeping my car clean, it is a necessity to have one of these when drying a car off after washing it. It can be used for multiple things but what I use it for is cleaning up the water off of my car. I have seen people use it to dry off their dogs, and other things...but it works fine for getting water off of cars. I am always amazed at how much water this one chamois can hold. I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn't like having to deal with towels, as this can be used more efficiently than towels. Towels have to get washed and once they have gotten soaked you cannot fully rinse out the towel like you can with this product. I keep mine with me in my car.

Many automotive type fans are horribly noisey; they eat battery power like a wolf eats rabbits, and this fan does neither. It can safely be powered by an automobile battery, fully charged in good condition for a full 12 hours and not affect the battery's ability to start the car. I would not recommend discharging an automotive battery regularly like this, but it may demonstrate that an RV battery would have power to spare powering this fan, even for a lengthy overnight stop.

Some times with in hours of cleaning my car I can see a layer of dust building up on it. Now with my California duster I can touch it up in less than a minute and be good to go. I have tried the cheaper nock off brands but they just don't work, all they do is move the dust around. The California duster actually picks up the dust and leaves a clean surface behind. Be sure to break it in first by using it a half dozen times on your car body before using it on glass or it may leave streaks on the glass at first. It actually works better with age. To clean just step away from your car and shake it or tap it on a wall a couple of times to shake the loose dirt out and continue dusting.

There's a second problem, too.  When you want to read the time in the dark, and that was the only reason I bought this clock, you can't unless it tap the right side button on the clock.

I've seen many other multi-ball hitch systems, but this clever product works great, is well-built, all at a great price!  Switching the balls is easy, and the unit is very tough and strong.  One suggestion, when not in use it's a good idea to stow it inside your truck and/or keep it well lubricated.  We live in Oregon (can you say RAIN....), and I left it on mounted on our truck last winter while we were down in Mexico.  When we came back in the Spring, the push-button detent used to switch the balls was a little stiff as some corrosion had formed, but a quick couple of sprays with WD-40 took care of it and it works great once again.

8242	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.

606	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Very poorly made in China.  Look at the pictures -- the strain relief isn't crimped putting all the stress on the copper wires.  The copper wire strands are also starting to break and I just took this out of the package.
Bottom line is you don't have to jack up the car, pull off the belly pan, burn your hand, scrape your knuckles, or strip out the oil pan or its plug. I'm not convinced it saves time because the oil flow rate is slow. It does indeed make the oil change more convenient, especially assuming your car has a filter accessible from under the hood. Plus it's cleaner, almost no chance you leave oil on the driveway with this tool.
7767	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	worked fine, great price
I needed this same duster with a long handle.  I made one using an adjustable length handle from a car windshield squeegee.  A piece of one half inch PVC pipe will do which you can purchase at the big orange box store for about $3.00 including tax.  All you need is a drill and three zip ties.  I used a  inch drill bit.

 I have come to appreciate the heavy duty build on Milwaukee tools. Their new Lok Tor cordless drills are the highest torque in the industry. Their 11 amp sawzall is the best, and the list goes on.
But in operation, they don't work so well. During the upstroke, they occasionally suck in air from the seal at the top of the pump. This results in the next pump delivering an incorrect amount of chemical. An incorrect amount of chemical results in weak epoxy. This problem seems to happen more with the pump used in the hardener can.
594	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a heavy duty pad that I used for applying Finesse-it II. It worked great.  I suppose I could have used a foam pad instead.  When it loaded up, I dipped it in a little bit of water.  Don't use too much cause it will throw the compound all over.  That's where a variable speed buffer comes in handy.  Don't try to use the pad for differing grades of compound as it is impossible to clean the pad without leaving residue from the previous compound.  The backing pad and hook and loop is very durable as well.

Already plan on buying probably two more of these things! Highly recommended!
However, true confession. I bought one of these kits many years ago for a 2000 Montero, and just dove in, eyeballing and cutting all the wrong tabs off. So bad that I had to toss it and go to another Best Buy where they wouldn't recognize me and buy it again.
1561	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	After buying 3 different squeegee's from Amazon based on 4 star glowing reviews, I have determined that all these people must have stock in these companies. Please check out all my reviews of these worthless products. This squeegee has double lips on it creating a chattering noise that will wake everybody in the house if you shower @ 5am. It hardly removes any water off the glass Doors and tile shower and it does not come with a hanger. The rubber is very ridged and hardly flexes. I bought a $1.99 Squeegee from Walmart a year ago and it was the best $1.99 I ever spent. Going there tomorrow since I cannot trust these reviews at all anymore.

6505	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fan-Tastic little fan!  Moves allot of air.  It produces a respectable amount of noise on high, but I would not say it is obtrusive.  We use it constantly while camping.  The only problem that I have seen with the fan is that the feet are weak.  Be careful not to break them off.  After both cracked, I filled the bottom of the feet with JB Weld.  Now they are light and strong.

9526	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used on a 1998 Civic (1996-2000 should be the same) after my 650ftlbs impact gun wouldn't budge it.  This is a must have tool for the job.  There are a few different sizes, so measure before buying.  Just measure on the inside of the hexagon from side to side.  This is the 50mm tool.  Oh, don't forget to have two breaker bars available, one to hold the inner nut and one you put on this.

8171	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I needed one, but bought two. I wish now I had ordered four. Wear gloves when operating, they will pinch you. I am not too mechanical and it took me a few tries to figure out how to release the tension. The grocery bag hook is a joke, but I never had intentions to suspend my groceries in my truck bed. These are intended to keep cargo from sliding and they work as advertised. I am very happy I bought them and my wife said they look nice. Apparently they match the bed liner motif. The price seems fair and they arrived quickly. The best advice I can offer, do not get all he man and ratchet these puppies as tight as humanly possible. You will need some slack to loosen them, otherwise they will feel welded in place. You need gloves, but otherwise I recommend.
7663	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my 02 Xterra.  Since I have hard water, it always left water spots on my black X.  This thing dries it all off with out needing to wring it out once.  Easy to get into tiny crevices in the doors and big enough to fling it on top of my truck since I can't reach all the way.  Machine washed it and came out clean, minus a few dark spots of grease that I knew wouldn't come out.

I must say that having the code and a brief description of the error was a great little feature to have built right in to the unit.  Other scanners don't have the built in description of the error code, but rather a website you can reference the code.  That's is fine, but there is something to be said for instant knowledge, right there and then on the scanner's screen.
319	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Not as in depth as required for a beginner diesel owner of a 6.7L Cummins Turbo.  Great for maintenance but will not be your only reference if you are trying to replace ball joints, replace crappy oem interior parts (power seat and window motors), Ccv and erg issues.

3416	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Need I say more. It works and it works beautifully, even as an emergency de-icer! Buying a case of this stuff for the Amazon sale price  woith free shipping was kind of a no-brainer.  Plus good to stock up before the coming sales tax fiasco. Although I like the convenience of the big Spray bottle (which has a stellar diffuser), This large size bottle is still much smaller, easier to store in the car and significantly cheaper than buying the sprayer, unless you find a good sale. I think on the spray verison you are paying $2-3 just for the packaging, I don't really seem to get more covverage with that one an it does not seem to last as long as this large bottle. Everyon got a bottle for Chirstmas this year (except the kids).

Another reviewer mentioned that the item stinks after some time if you don't properly air it out.  I can vouch for that.  She said that she placed it into a washing machine but the smell was still present.  That was not my finding.  However,.. it may be because I actually hand washed it for a good 15 minutes using Tide brand detergent in my kitchen sink.  Now it smells freshly laundered lol.
5516	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very useful accessory allowing easy reach to the roof-top of a tall SUV.  Good installation instruction and very easy to put onto a hitch.
3897	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Does what it's supposed to do but I really did expect something a bit heavier duty from Master Lock. I'm not sure it would take much of a hammer to break it off. If I did it over I would have bought one of those HD braided cable locks to protect the spare tire instead of this. Sorry Master Lock but it looks like you have fallen into the cheapo products category now too.
8940	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like the slimness of this pump. It's easy to carry and light weight. I can see that the hose would start to feather out after multiple uses but as long as you're careful with it there should be no fear of ware.

6743	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Outstanding crate fan for dogs in vehicles. Very quiet (almost a white noise function for road noise if your radio is off, which is nice) and a great air flow. No issues with over a year of use. I bought two more. A bit pricey, but they hold up and saves money in the long run from buying 10,000 tiny fans that break easily over time.

5851	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Actually works. Doesn't get rid of all the dullness, but most of it.

1990	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've owned this for several years now and it does a really nice job of keeping my dash clean and dust free. The soft fibers are treated with wax to give the dash a nice shine and to collect dust without leaving a greasy feeling behind and it won't scratch the surface of your dash. You can use this on shutters, blinds, and appliances, but I only use it in my car. To clean it, just shake the dust off outdoors after each use and keep on using it. I do like that it comes with a plastic sleeve case to store it in and the compact size makes it easy to store it in the glove compartment for quick cleanings.

6872	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Seems like it was working good when I bought it, but now I don't like it.  I have had it for almost a year. Does not dry my cars very well, leaves them wet.  I have never found a good substitute to the real chamois.  See the before and after pictures, and that's because my vehicle was not even that wet.  I don't know of it's because of the humid climate I live in, but I never had a problem with the real chamois.  I agree with another reviewer that's it's more like a sponge.
2039	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	One of the best inventions of all time. Dusting has never been so easy!! Run this over your dash every day or weekly. Either way, its quick and effective
9084	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I finally replaced my long-ago destroyed and tossed wooden creeper after getting tired of keeping large, flattened cardboard boxes around for those occasions when I need to get underneath a car.  But this time I was going to be doing some strenuous transmission work and finally took the plunge of getting a new creeper.
walmart and Amazon.com, These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in. My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degrees
VW has a belly pan that requires 19 screws be removed.... to access the drain. It takes me 30 min from start to finish to change oil and filter with the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor. It would be double that going from the bottom and a lot more messy.
9634	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nothing spectacular but for the money its nice
9865	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this to hopefully increase the MPG in my 2008 Chevrolet Silverado 5.3 Flex. I have had the filter in for almost 4 full tanks of gas with 0 increase in MPG. I am disappointed in that however, I do like the fact that I will never have to buy another filter again as long as I clean this one regularly. I do feel that it allowed the motor to open up a bit, it does have slightly better throttle response.
7922	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this for  my newly aquired jet boat trailer. Its kind of long for a tongue lock, looks funny on the trailer, but gets the job done. I don't think it would take a huge amount of force to break this off if someone really wanted to steal the boat, but its a semi decent deterrant.

5041	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is an amazing towel. I was very surprised how fast and easily it dried off my car. It soaks up large amounts of water & is quickly ready for more as soon as you squeeze it out. At first I thought it was leaving a film on the car surface but within seconds it goes away. I highly recommend this.

Oh and mine didn't come as solid black.  It had a black head and gold rod which is OK because I live in IA and am a Hawkeye Fan... lol
I give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.  Solid manual from what I can see though.
 Luckily, the sprayer mysteriously started working once I took out this book within view of the car!!

3080	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	perfect
2187	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I keep this cooler in the trunk of my Audi A4, which isn't a very large trunk, and I use it primarily when I travel.  I take it out and into the house when we need an extra cooler for parties with lots of guests.  My wife thinks it "whines" but I think all coolers of this design do something like that and, after awhile, I don't hear it.  I take it into motel rooms with me when I travel and use the AC adapter, and it has operated flawlessly.  It is designed to fit into small spaces, like the footwell in the back seat of a car, so it's understandably a low volume cooler.  I like that it has a carry handle.  The lid has no lock; it's just gravity that holds it down, but I don't find a problem with that.  To my ear, it makes a whirring sound that you'd expect from a small fan, and what matters is that the cooler keeps things delightfully cold and doesn't take up too much room in the vehicle when I travel.  I use it to sit on sometimes when car camping, but I wouldn't want to stand on it.  It is what it looks like, and mine meets my expectations entirely.
936	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These battery cables are a great value! Some reviews criticized them for being so light but that is exactly what the description says..."light duty". For those applications these are certainly lighter and more flexible than the much heavier gauge would be and when you don't need the heavy ones why subject yourself to the hassle? They are well made and because the two wires are molded together you don't have the tangle problem that you have with separate cables. I actually bought them because I needed a 10 foot heavy 12volt cable to connect a power winch and these were much cheaper than buying bulk wire!

6920	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Product as described.  Thank you
3165	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product should be in every garage. I can only imagine how many lives would be saved if RainX was required at every oil change location. This works much better than the cleaner/rainX spray bottle. I use the spray for quick application, but nothing beats the original wipe-on formula.

Older issues actually showed where the differential drain and fill plugs were located. This one does not even do that.

3119	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't buy my bottle here, bought it at AutoZone since I wanted it sooner. Anyway, we all know this stuff works very well and should be re-applied every 4-6 months. Many of the complaints about the product is that it leaves streaks that are nearly impossible to wipe off with a cloth. Yes, it does. however, if you wait about 10-15 minutes for it to dry, after applying to your windshield, it comes off very easily. It has to be dry before you can wipe it off.
216	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Haynes manuals help with the basics plus some moderate maintenance and repair - nothing more.  This guide allows me to save money on those chores I could do myself with a little time and effort, and for that it's easily worth the money spent to purchase.

The top of the funnel is large enough to accept the pouring of about anything you might want to pour into your auto's liquid reservoirs without wasteful spilling and the bottom is just the right size to make sure it gets into the receiver end of the receptacle without undue run-over or fumbling. The funnel has earned a permanent home in my auto's trunk space for really needed and handy tools.

689	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this Milton accessory kit here on Amazon several years ago and still use the blowgun and tire air chuck that came with it all the time. The couplings and several of the other fittings are also in use on my nail guns and air hoses. The tire gauge that came with this kit is cheap plastic, so not that good, but everything else in the kit was of decent quality and so far has held up well to my use.
4972	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There is know other way to dry a vehicle, simply the best.
The real problem is that while oil by itself does stay where it belongs, microscopic particles of dust soak up oil and then pass right through the filter. It is these tiny oily particles that cause the problems with the MAF sensor. One is left to wonder how much dust goes right into the engine (this is something to think about if you happened to have a car with somewhat different MAF sensor that is not very sensitive to dirt).
For what it is, it's a nice product. It's reasonably inexpensive, solidly built, and has decent performance as long as you keep in mind the limitations of thermoelectric cooling.

9413	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It gets the job done. Its solid and heavy and will last a long time since I only used it once and maybe a few more times. it doesn't fit snug and tends to fall off the bolt head but it's not loose enough to strip it. If you need one and don't want to rent at your local parts store, I would recommend this tool for your tool  box.
9064	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	THE CUTTING WHEELS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO ROTATE WHILE CUTTING! SOME OLDER STANLEY'S DID ROTATE. THIS PRODUCT MAY WORK FOR YOU IF YOU SHARPEN THE WHEELS AND ONLY ROTATE THE WHEEL TO GET AN EDGE THAT HAS NOT BEEN USED.
3130	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Junk.  Cover kept blowing off until I made holes in the front and back so I could tie it down in 4 points instead of the 2 sides it came with.  I noticed the covers getting thinner this summer and then one day they just ripped and fell down to the sides.  Probably would have been just fine if they were indoor but these covers didn't stand up to the weather.
6419	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff but you need to understand its properties and when to use it and when not to.  1. It only skins over in about 24 hours and takes up to 7 days to cure a 1/4" bead so it can only be used when the item is not going to be disturbed before it cures.  This does help it from hardening up in the tube and I can usually keep a tube around all summer on the boat for small sealing jobs. (There is a Fast Cure 5200)  2. it is very strong once cured.  They claim it is for permanent applications.  It can be cut to remove an item but the residue is almost impossible to remove.  3. It is very messy and not as viscous as other sealants so caution must be exercised to get a good application.  Don't let it drip where you don't want it.  Set the caulking gun on cardboard when you stop dispensing and relieve the pressure.
6044	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used this to fill in holes on a porcelain tub as well as to partially re-attach the lower valance on my 2002 F150 which tore a little bit when I backed through a pile of ice.  The can arrived slightly dented, but it came with the hardener and there were no leaks, so I was happy enough.  I followed the directions for the bathtub repair and noticed that I had about 2-3 minutes to set it in place before it hardened and the remaining became unusable.  So, when I went to repair the valance on my truck, I used less (about 2/3 of what the directions recommend) hardener and was able to use it for about 5-6 minutes before it hardened, which was more than enough time for my needs.  There is still a ton of this left and I still have a fair amount of hardener to boot.
2376	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Did not fit my application and to be honest was too complicated to install. Won't buy again.
5587	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Needed these for a trailer to keep from always cleaning the posts before hookup...fits excellent and keeps all the crud out.
5385	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the perfect step to attach to  you hitch. If you have a lower hitch like the 2000 to 2006 chevy or GMC SUV, and not so good for the 2007's it's in the middle of the bumper.  It sure makes it easy to enter the rear door to load items and to put stuff on top of your SUV.
831	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Was not actually perfect fit , it was a tight fit , had to force into position , filter is well built

7749	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The water right off anything you use it on.  If the oceans ever start to rise from global warming we can just throw a few of these in there and we'll be good to go.  Gets very hard if you don't keep it in the container between uses.
With the weather the pins will oxidize without some protection.
8499	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It works but it's really slow.  I live in Florida and it's never really cold here and draining takes an hour.  But knowing that you just plan on it and it works.  It does store nicely in it's box so it's compact and fits on the shelf easily.
5996	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer.

Great lock. My friend bought one too. Very reasonably priced.
7070	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Speed 1: Wow! Speed 2: Damn! Speed 3: Seriously! I guess I don't need my hair dryer any more. This fan is incredible IN SPITE of it's size. It uses very little power and blows like crazy. However, it is a bit loud - not terrible, but noticeable. Part of the sound appears to be from the blades slightly impacting the side of the case, making an odd scissor-like sound. And the decal under the speed knob won't stay stuck to the case. But I still recommend this fan. It's small, angry, and doesn't eat much.
Disadvantages:
2303	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	relays always are the safest way to add accessories to any automotive application, I wasn't sure of the quality until I used it.  Has worked perfect and ended up buying 3 others for different applications

This is the best no doubt about out it.
It's simple, this stuff works great when applied correctly, the rain will slide right off!
6955	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These towels are great, I had to order another one after my first one got so much use. Super absorbent and won't leave streaks on your car. I keep it in my trunk so it's handy when I get my car washed.
6700	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I mounted them on my smaller tractors. They work well.
1670	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was sold on these back in 1999 when I saw a man dusting his $15,000 black paint job on a hot rod at a car show.  I was at first shocked to see him running it over the paint and asked him about scratching the paint.  He said he would use nothing else to get light dust and pollen of his cars and the proof was there to see.  My last one "died" the other day after 5 years of almost daily use when a defective bleach bottle spilled in my trunk after grocery shopping.  I am ordering another one today.  I've used these on many different cars and colors - including black and have never had problems.  This is truly a bargain even at twice the Amazon price.

5624	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love this cover much better the having the plug hanging down remember this goes with the mounting bracket not sold together!

8679	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great in your camper.  Stops things from sliding around.  I bought some of the rubberized slip stop from Bed Bath and Beyond but it still slips.  I replaced it with this and things stay in place.
It can also be used to keep food items warm - have to admit I didn't try this mode. The cool vs. heat mode is selected by the way you attach the plug - this is an area that could use a little improvement as it's hard to see in the dark. I could see someone inadvertently getting this backwards
supposed to be dry batteries that can be stored and then used.
7611	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Does what it says absorbers. Not alot u can say about it except they haven't changed in 10 years except maybe the price.

6605	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quickly absorbs the water...cuts drying time by minutes.  KEEP the plastic tube, it will allow it to stay moist and not get hard.
8676	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very grippy material.  Absolutely stops items from sliding.  I just updated the camper for the fourth time and this is already on order just like the first camper that proved this pads the shelf if items fall over, and it stops items from sliding around periode. Nothing else I tried could stop the sliding.  I totally recommend this for Rv shelf liner.  By the way I tried the stuff to keep area rugs from sliding around, it did not have enough of the rubbery grippy stuff to work like this.

I am very happy with the product.
I'm REALLY pleased and impressed, made my day! Fully recommended for headlamp cleaning.
VW recommends you change the drain plug and crush washer everytime.... another $4 every oil change. The oil filter is on top of the engine in a canister so there is no need to get under the car. Also the oil filter is vertical and sits on top; the base of the oil filter housing has some deep pockets in the base. I used the hydro-turf oil extractor is great at getting every drop of oil out of the oil filter housing, a significant amount, at least 3 to 5 ounces of oil......  Again what little old oil remains is insignificant and with the ability to drain the oil filter housing, not possible with out an extractor, it is as good as drain from the bottom at the pan method in my opinion. Highly recommend.

2433	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A sailboat was drifting towards danger, sail down and tied, and its engine stalled and wouldn't start. I asked the Captain if he needed assistance and he replied yes. I immediately took out the tow strap from my PWC storage compartment and got it ready for use. It took seconds to get ready for the hook up to the sailboat. I drifted with the sailboat and his engine finally started. The sailboat motored to safety. So, while I didn't use the tow strap, having it ready in the bag was a major plus. The rating may eventually get  5 stars when I do get a chance to use it. I have a couple other lines on board that could tow, but.....they aren't quickly available for emergency use.
1 star off for using too many layman terms.
9503	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this tool in 2005 in order to do a timing belt and head job on my 1994 accord and still use it today. Since then I have used it on many different Honda's from accords to civic. This tool makes breaking the crank bolt very easy. Great for replacing crank pulleys, doing head jobs or timing belts on Hondas.
5372	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased a brand new car and of course I wanted only the best equipment and tools to clean and pamper my car.  I tried a lot of different "shammies" and drying towels made of terry cloth or microfiber or whatever.  Simply said, none of them left me satisfied after washing and drying the car.  One day I was at T@rget and saw this in the automotive section read the back and said "hey why not, worth a shot". Well that shot paid off big time! This thing is amazing at what it does and leaves my car streak-free and shining beautifully when done.  What works best for me is that it HAS to be somewhat wet before starting to use it; not saturated or sopping wet but a good damp works.  The amount of water the absorber retains really is a feat in itself.  I recommend this highly and trust it fully to always get the job done.
4118	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used these for my 97 Seadoo GSI and my 96 Seadoo XP.
172	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	There is really no substitute for the factory service manual.  I did get a copy of the factory manual - it runs about 15$ more than this if you get the electronic version (probably preferable to the paper copy actually - easier to search).  The haynes manual is a few hundred pages - factory manual is over 2000 pages!  So, this manual just won't be as complete.  That said - the haynes manual will probably do fine for most repairs.
2864	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Doesn't fit Mercedes E500 very well. Used for 2 weeks. Had to stretch hard to get it on the car, and the antenna post ripped through the top. Also had issues with the mirrors and badge. Very tight fit and probably not the right fit for the car, as advertised. Material is very flimsy. The car was washed prior to fitting, and was absolutely covered with dirt when removed. I guess it probably was OK for the UV protection, but didn't do much of anything for the dirt.
4367	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good stuff.  Great flow when tank is dumped and best stuff I've found so far to keep the smell at bay.

1219	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This oil can is pretty nice. The flexible spout is just the ticket to force oil into vertical or upside-down areas. The pump action is not sloppy at all and is very easy to use. You can pump hard and get a lot of oil, but you can also easily meter out drops if need to. The pump action is really nice.
1410	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	If only it were 4 wheel drive. Or if I had a flat surface to put it on. Works well outside. Wheel bearings are excellent. I had no problem unintentionally rolling completely out from under the vehicle. A simple wheel lock would be a great addition.


6282	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought 2 of these, one to keep in my truck for road side emergencies and the other for automotive work use at home. The few times I have used them they work well, but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them. I think this is due to their intended use as a RV chock, where they would sit in the sun a lot and would degrade. But again they are cheap, and if the worries you, just buy a new one and toss out the suspect one!

5818	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very Nice
7194	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I love it, moves air well with minimal noise and low 12v power draw.

8542	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This unit works great.  I had a smaller extractor from a different manufacturer years ago, and this one blows (sucks) it away.  Nice long dip tube and builds a lot of vacuum.  I use it on my Yamaha FX-SHO Waverunner and it was perfect.  Definitely recommend.

8889	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very nice! a little on the heavy side but not at all bad, easy to clean and easy to use why pay $700+ for another brand when you have this one right here. quality custom finish with solvent or waterborne paints.

1988	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these before and loved it.  With the arrival of pine pollen season in the south and driving a Jeep with the top off, this duster is almost required equipment to keep the inside pollen-free.

8444	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I am on my 4th year with this battery. I have over 275 hours on my PWC (2006 Yamaha FXHO) and this battery is still going strong. I may replace it at the end of this year just to be on the safe side, but I will definitely buy another one. The lead/acid batteries I used in the past needed to be replaced every other year due to leakage or failure. This is a great battery for a PWC.

9683	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This was a little pricey, but I noted a 0.4 mpg average improvement on my 5.3L Silverado after installing, and will eventually pay for itself.
2670	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I had a dent in my car and it didn't do anything for it. it would just suction cup it but not really pull it out. I was let down. not worth it. I don't recommend.
5581	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this put a led bulb in it. It's brighter now. Cheap plastic and Chinese made, but the price is right.

6125	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These work fine on coarse or soft-ish surfaces, but tend to slip out on hard, slippery surfaces like painted concrete and garage floors.  They suit my needs, are cheap, and seem rugged.  I have a pair that is over 10 years old and another pair that I recently purchased to complement them.  I like how lightweight they are, but unlike some lightweight chocks these have never collapsed on me despite some abuse.
1108	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love not having to tie the old bonnet to the buffer.  AND it works with my orbital sander so I didn't have to adapt the buffer with the hook and loop strips.  Plus my orbital sander has variable speed so I can slow down the orbiting so I'm not too aggressive applying the wax around the decals on the RV.

4634	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	have this permanently hooked up to my car battery.  when car sits long time, I just plug it in and works perfect.  have 1 for each car, never fails.
A week later, I'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH, so it may be due for another treatment, but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds, and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers.
8957	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My wife and I have used the pump several times over the past few weeks and have not had any problems with it. It works well and is sturdy. Seems like it will last.

3703	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for use on windshield wiper fluid jugs. Just add a short length of poly tubing from any hardware store.
7890	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far this starter has turned the motor over much quicker than the previous starter I had on my 4.3l Mercruiser. Well worth spending a few extra dollars for quality.
When I used it, the blade worked well on the side windows, but not on the windshield for removing frost. Since I don't have any experience with ice scrapers, I can't compare. The brush is really nice for removing snow and scraped off frost. But save your money and find another product, because this ice scraper is too expensive to have it break on you so easily.
9756	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	perfect item for my Yukon. quick delivery

5316	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was dubious about this, but based on the reviews I figured it was worth a shot. It's BIG, twice as big as you'd need, really, and it's made of this unpleasant-weird feeling kind of rubber-jelly-synthetic-skin material. Quite squishy. And thirsty! I read the directions, rinsed it in warm water, wrung it out, then dried my car with it. I laid the whole piece down on half the windshield, voila, DRY, no spots or streaks. It holds a remarkable quantity of water. If it held any more water, they'd sell it for emergency water storage.
3761	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Perfect for the need I  had

7804	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so. The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.
1056	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Cheap. No fur on edges that will scratch. Only for flat areas. I doubt I will use it.
It also works best with manual cars because automatic cars will tend to want to continue driving over it. I have to put the minivan into neutral and let go of the brake for a split second to allow the wheels to adjust itself.
2508	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love it - Thank You !
3881	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Sent surprisingly fast.
9007	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the club lx from Amazon warehouse deals based solely on the price because I wanted to add another layer of protection or perhaps better stated just make my car a less attractive target.
Well I'll be darned if it didn't shine them up like new! Never noticed there was writing on the headlamp before. With this stuff the Infiniti symbol shows right up. No more haze, no more embarrassment, and no more cloudy nights.
UPDATE: Nearly 5 years later, no problem with the air filter. I would contribute a suggestion though. Be careful with the steel mesh network that screens the outside of the filter. I can see how being careless at times would contribute to them breaking.
I am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.

2349	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	this unit works fine, the install instructions need more work, I would recomend you get your vehicles factory wire diagram to insure you are connecting the correct circuit to the unit. It would help if bulldog would make a harness for optional purchase.
153	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a very typical Haynes manual. Great detail about simple things you could figure out on your own, and then it glosses over complex things that leave you clueless and lost.
8069	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	love it, keeps my wheel chair from sliding all around my truck bed.  great price

2030	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Overall this is a pretty good product, but it does leave some annoying red lint as it goes, on my dash.  I'm hoping this subsides as it gets "seasoned".  It's a minor annoyance, but on a dark interior is noticeable.
2497	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice quality locking pin. I use it in the snow and salt and it functions perfectly. Still looks good after a couple years use.
1162	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very well made.
5431	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I installed this yesterday.  It's a tad loose and came with a small rubber wedge.  I'm going to make up some of my own.  It really looks sharp.  This item was about mid range in price to others available.  I chose this one as it appeared to be the right size and it kind of molded with the looks of the truck.  I would strongly suggest buying a hitch lock as this is an item some may want to borrow and never return it.
9591	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I waited until my F-150 had 125,000 miles on it to get the K&N filter for it and now wish I had bought it sooner.  The engine response on acceleration improved noticeably, while gas mileage only improved very fractionally.  I like it a lot, but understand that cleaning and re-oiling it will not only be a chore when the time comes, but it might also be a bit pricey (almost as much as the original filter.)  Considering this costs about 2x what an air filter at Jiffy-Lube costs, maybe that's ok, and I'll reserve judgment until I've actually done the cleaning and re-oiling once.  In the meantime, I have smoother, quicker acceleration, and I'm pleased.  I used 4-stars instead of 5 because of the cost/work of cleaning....
 When I pulled the handle up, it sucked up about a quart of soapy water out of my bucket. It took about 5 qt to do my whole SUV. Saved a lot of time and bending to clean the lower portion of the car and worked quite well. This is not a piece of junk like you get for $12 or $14 in the discount stores. It's a well made quality product that will last quite a while.
2013	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works Well
9720	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We had over 20,000 miles on our 2015 Silverado crew cab 5.3L 4x4 truck when I installed it. I changed out the factory oil at 7700 miles, as per oil change monitor. Switched it to full synthetic, Castol Syntec 5/30, with Dexos, and change it at 4,000-4,200 miles,(ignore the monitor and reset it) and only using an A/C Delco oil filter. We drive long trips, 650 miles one way, back home, many times, so we got a good feel about the fuel mileage with the stock air filter and stock air box, and NOT EVER using cruise control. It will average 17.4 city and 27.8 hwy (@ 80mph) with the ethanol blend fuel (SUCKS) with the best fuel mileage so far, has been 30.7 mpg (+75 mph), running straight gas, no ethanol. This engine in not an E85 engine, and I think the ECM fuel table is set a little better because its not an E85 engine. We have put another 3,000 since installing this air filter, driving short trips on the weekends, and it has increased fuel mileage about 1.6 city and 3.3 miles per gallon hwy. In 2 weeks, we shall see what the change is on a long 785 mile one way trip across Montana.  Well, the best mileage to date with straight gas is 34.7 mpg. Our G.M. dealer took a picture of the MPG mileage monitor, and asked how we managed that kind of mileage. I told him, straight gas, and I don't use cruise control.  2 reasons,  1)  I can see a hill or raise in the roadway, and I can accelerate just a little, were the computor will notice a load, and then accelerate, using fuel, 2)  I like to have my foot on the accelerator pedal, because you don't know what may happen in a split second, and have managed to stay out of trouble doing it this way.
8910	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is an excellent tool to keep individuals from stealing my expensive automobile. I would recommend this product to others!
9244	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I kept promising to look for a blanket like this for my wife and finally remembered at Christmas time.  We use it for a longish trip yesterday and she kept thanking me all the way there and back.  She says now I can turn the heat down to where I want it and she won't care.  Thanks for a cheap way to make the boss happy!

2939	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I didn't like it because it is made with a very thin material. Perhaps, It is too small for my CAMARO 2010.

8438	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I first used Odyssey batteries in my stand-up PWC in 2005, because flooded lead acid batteries kept failing on me.  I'm still using that same battery today (2012)!  I occasionally use a desulfating pulse charger on it to keep it in top condition, but that's a long life no matter how you slice it.  We got a second PWC which needed a new battery, so I didn't hesitate to get another PC625.  Yeah, they're expensive, but not as expensive as multiple flooded batteries + hassle.  I'm so happy with the PC625 that I might invest in bigger Odyssey batteries for my bigger boats when the time comes.
I bought the book to perform automatic transmission and differential maintenance. The 7B Automatic transmission section is 4 1/2 pages in total. One page is dedicated to leaks, a second to shift linkage and a third to general operation and specifications.
4577	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This charger is light and provides a good onboard charging package.  I reduced by one star because it is hard-wired and would better with plug connections that could be disconnected.  The bracket probably won't fit many batteries, but it is easy to mount flat on an inside panel.  I use it on a Polaris Ranger and would recommend it to others.
8736	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have 2 axle puma travel trailer, these fit perfect. I also purchased a 5 pack of another brand that did not fit very well.
6659	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice and small but the numbers are quite legible. The white-on-black digits are hours, the black-on-white digit is tenths-of-an-hour (6 minutes each). It has a cool little "blinking thing" on the right of the display that "tics" every few seconds to let you know it's counting. (Helpful for installation.) The display is mechanical (wheels) and easy to read in bright sunlight. (Whereas those funky-cheap-popular LCD displays even on high dollar items are difficult to see at times.) I put mine in a very small plastic box, screwed to the podium inside wall instead of cutting a square hole in the dash. And being mechanical, it remembers the count forever without any power so winter storage or a dead battery aren't a concern.
811	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	perfect fit for my 12.5hp B&S riding mower engine.
7563	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Does what it says, and changing the balls is easy.  One star down because something minor has changed over the years since I purchased my last set for my other vehicle, and the balls don't QUITE interchange.  Some do, but some don't, and some jam as they kind-of fit.  This requires that the balls be kept tagged for which vehicle post they came with.  Not an issue for most I would assume.
7999	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a good wax
9496	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When I ordered this tool I did not know if I would need it or not, it was one of thous better to have it and not need it rather than need it and not have it. Boy was I right this time. I tried using my airgun on my 96 Accord crankcase pulley bolt, but it would not budge. This was a good deal, fast shipping, and I could not have replaced my timing belt without it.
8165	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	i use it in my truck bed and it works great
4527	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It filters oil....

2198	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great and every garage should have this.  This device puts me in control of my discussions with my mechanic.  Knowing the codes behind the light allow me to research and understand the possible issues before the mechanic goes on a wild goose chase racking up the bills.  Now I can walk in tell him the codes and my evaluation and start the conversation from a position of knowledge.

2704	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised.
1503	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Seems to be the answer I was looking for .
In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower.

7693	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Was a perfect fit for my 1994 Tracker ProMariner 60HP 3 cylinder motor for the vent plug.  The previous owner had installed this screw so much that I could not get it to break loose.  I actually ended up stripping it more than it was and had to go buy a manual impact as my 1/2" Dewalt Impact could not loosen the screw (http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-29200-Hand-Impact-Tool/dp/B0002NYDRG  <looks similar to that but purchased for $6 dollars at a local True Value Store).  I paired this with the lower drain plug (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O7H8FE?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4) for changing out my lower unit fluid.  I can see these not lasting more than a few changes due to the maleable steel used for them but definitely recommend these!
8087	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I agree, it is flimsy as  hell. Ratchet works, holds in place but I have a feeling the first can of gas to slide into this is going to break it in half.  Should have made this at least 4ft wide and then ratchet out from there.
8046	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ok

For a 4 pin connector, this works great on my smaller trailer and a great cover for my truck hitch receptacle.
2722	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	On the plus side, they seem heavy and sturdy, and less likely to topple over when in use.
4. The strengthening Ribs on the Reservoir are also measurement lines like on a Measuring Cup...the literature says they're supposed to represent "about one liter" each.
So, to claim 4HP is ridiculous.
6059	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used this for three year old headlights and while they didn't look bad, they really shine with this product.  I would recommend this first for any kind of plexiglass parts of your car.
7857	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a new black Cadillac STS that looks wonderful when clean and polished. When we travel, car washes do not do a proper job..I carry an ABSORBER to complete drying;  in 3 minutes I can turn a poor wash job into a beautiful work of art!! Wring it out, back in the tube, and it's ready for the next trip!!
8379	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this on an outdoor table and chairs. I apply it when I get my furniture out of storage in the spring and again before packing it up in the fall, plus once or twice during the summertime.
9106	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great wax.

6077	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	not much faith in the top twist to hold the ball on, but have been pleased with it so far.
2286	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I don't understand the criticisms. The switch for different voltages clicks from one position to the next (not too hard, not too easy). The fuse is easy to change if you should need to. It reduces the voltage just as it is supposed to. It is very reasonably priced (Amazon's price is 1/4 what my local Radio Shack wanted for this) What more could you ask for?? I'm happy with it.
6897	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product. fast shipper.
450	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this decal for the back of my Cherokee and it has lasted about four years. It's only now beginning to peel at the edges, but that's a pretty good run for a Jeep parked outside all year in Florida's sunshine and heat. The colors haven't faded at all.
8547	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It works exactly like advertised. Very simple to use
I used this product and was blown away buy how well it absorbed and better yet the wring out was so easy,
5788	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	solid product
7069	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I borrow a utility trailer from time to time that has a relatively short connector for the lights.  The owner has a long lead on his towing vehicle, so it's not a problem for him, but my truck has the connectors on a bracket bolted to the bumper; the lead on his trailer barely reaches, and has pulled out on a hard right turn.  This extension is perfect, completely solves the problem for just a few dollars, with no modification needed to the wiring on my truck or his trailer.
It's huge, not only it eliminated the blind spot on the right side of my car. I can actually see my kids on the rear seat clearly. Well, the one on the left side might still be able to hide right behind your seat. But the one on the other side has nowhere to hide except to go all the way to the floor.

2251	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Its rubbing compound, not a genie. It won't change your life, or make you a better person, but it will help with your clouded, scratched up paint and clear coat. And it does so well, and its been doing so well for a long time. Works best with a drill or powered polisher, and needs to be followed up with polishing compound and then a good wax. This Turtle is definitely "Winning It!"
6466	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Beware. The instructions say you must use within 24 hours of opening. Not a good thing if you don't use the whole tube.

3. Move the Absorber along in relatively slow motion, allowing the water to soak into it. Wipe half of one topside surface, such as the roof or hood. Wring out the Absorber, then re-wipe the area to soak up the residual moisture. Repeat those two steps for the rest of your car. If you're getting streaks, wipe a little slower. (A chamois is not designed to be used quickly like a rag or dish towel.)
8945	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very good clock in some ways and useless in others. The main problem is the face of the clock is unreadable at almost any angle other than straight on.  If the clock is mounted lower than your eye level - which it most likely will be -- you can't read the time.  This seems to be a function of the way digital clock faces work.  So, it's very effective in telling time, but you can't see what time it is.  Not very useful.

1743	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good
2677	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought two of these, one for me and one for a buddy who needed to clear out some zerks.  If you have any grease zerks on any of your equipment, then you need one of these.  Notice I didn't say "might need" but rather "you need" one.  Easy to use, and it blasts the hard contaminated grease from the zerk as well as the greased joint.  Add new grease, and you're up and running.

Now, regarding all the bad reviews of this mirror, I've done a little investigation for you.  The vast majority of them are by people who have only reviewed one item...this item.  Then there's a couple who have only reviewed one or two other items.  I'm not saying they (ahem) work for a competitor, I'm just saying they don't have a reliable track record...or any track record.  Next, there's the incorrect applications...like an RV with an electric sunshade (insert head smack smiley here).  Finally, there are a couple who seem reliable and probably just got a lemon which, as we all know, can happen with any product.  Fortunately, this product is sold and shipped through Amazon, so returns/replacements are hassle free.

3917	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	very  good, well made,  good  value
2656	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm very happy with this purchase. Some of the metal ones I looked at just seemed too flimsy and easy to dent. This plastic box is pretty sturdy. It's plenty strong enough for me to stand on top of it(175 lbs). Not sure what else to say. It's a plastic box that does its job of storing and keeping your stuff dry.

3614	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The lock works as intended.  However, it will rattle.  I solved the rattling issue by inserting a part of a shop towel into the opening that goes over the lug nut to take up any looseness in the lock assembly  The shop towel eliminated all of the slop and therefore it does not rattle.
4804	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	this is a fantastic product, it made the tired finish on our arctic fox glow.  Works better if you apply it by hand, the buffer I bought didn't do as nice a job.

This item is a little on the bulky side, but it quick, reliable, and it gets the job done.  It's also nice looking enough to be given as a gift so I really like these and would definitely recommend it to anyone.  I've also tested it and it's accurate to 1 psi.  Meaning, of all of these I've owned, the most they've ever been off was by 1 psi.

It is very durable & I believe it will last a long time. I have always had cushioned creepers but this one is just hard Poly with a head cushion of sorts. I may find a cushion or have one made to make it a little more comfortable when needed although so far Im not finding it to be that bad.

9534	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Previously, with a full tune-up and all fluids changed, about 90% highway driving, I was consistently getting 15.3 MPG with my 1998 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer (5.4L 4WD). The ONLY thing I changed was poking this thing into the airbox. As a result, I'm now averaging 16.6 MPG driving exactly the same route under the same conditions with the same fuel. Can't really tell if it added any horsepower or not - it's a big ol' honkin' SUV, not a sports car - but it'll pay for itself in fuel savings, alone, with the amount of mileage I drive every day. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.

Then, after first use the stitching that attaches the suspenders to the waist came apart.  Not worth another $10 to return.

It is a little spendy, but definitely worth the money.
The cast iron table surface of my saws is left silky smooth, which helps wood move across them and more importantly, I am protected from rust. I live in Minnesota and my saws are kept in a cold, drafty and sometimes damp garage. Rust is a stranger to my tools. I re-treat every couple of months. It's a small investment in time to protect my gear and keep it looking great.
Okay, there are probably even cheaper filters that will perform as well especially following my strict regimen of maintenance but, I just feel confident, after all these years, with the Fram filters.
UPDATE:  I have added an extra 53Ah+78Ah SLA (SealedLeadAcid) battery so I can run real-world devices for "many" hours.  These batteries are HEAVY (100+ pounds total), so forget about a "portable backup pack" that lives up to the hype at AMAZON etc...

So, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).
8445	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use this on a VW Jetta and it works well.  The dipstick tube is like the flexible sheathing that covers bike brake cables, so it's flexible, but stays on the bottom of the oil pan.  You just pump it up and about ten minutes later the oil is drained.  Plus, on VWs diesel you can use it to suck out the oil filter casing.  I wish it was easier to get all the oil out of the tube, or reservoir after use.  Drips can cause stains.

4011	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks I have ever spent. I originally thought I would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. She scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. In addition, she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. Amazingly, she was right on target. By holding the small end to my ear I could clearly hear her, the TV and the telephone. To my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. I never would have believed it if I had not experienced this for myself. There are some frequencies which I have some difficulty in hearing now that I have "matured". My wife's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when I want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. For convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where I can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. The uses for this item are nearly endless and I will order another one to serve the original purpose for which I bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.
5278	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	It doesnt do anything just hard to move around on the car, doesnt absorb any water. just useless. will not buy another.

I will be upgrading soon, however no regrets with this one, it did all I needed,  gave the code and general cause.  erases codes easy too which in some cases might solve the problem or at least allow you to rescan it immediately after the first time the light comes on again so you can home in on the original cause of the problem at hand as other codes will set behind it after a short time,  a sort of chain reaction of the first and its affect on the engine fuel and ignitions system.
9669	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Filter fit nicely, not much increase on mpg however under load seems to have more acceleration, main reason for changing to filter was the fact that you can clean and reinstall which with fuel costs and the push for doing more maintenance such as changing the air filter more often the filter will pay for itself quickly, I also got the cleaning kit on my initial purchase

1917	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a must for anybody who wants to keep their car clean between washes. My car sits outside, in parking garages, and old sheds. All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car. This model comes with the wood handle. Others out there have a cheap plastic one. Read the directions on the cover. You're suppose to let it air out after shipping. It has something to do with the wax on the brush. It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty. In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier. The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car. You'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car. The duster will easily remove pollen, dust, and any other light coating of material. It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits, but you'll still see the marks if you look carefully.

The Evercoat putty gets very hard and is easy to sand to a super smooth surface.
I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)

2664	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought a new 18ft aluminum utility trailer in June 2016 to mainly haul restored John Deere lawn tractors to shows and of course use it for other hauling also. I quickly found out I needed a tool storage box that could be mounted on the tongue for all the tie downs, jack and handle, dolly wheel, lug wrench, breakaway emergency trailer brakes battery and all the other things that's needed when traveling with a trailer. I ordered this box from Amazon because the dimensions seemed to be such that it would fit the trailer tongue very well. When it arrive and had the chance to install it, the tongue fit was perfect. The only downside is that I wished it had been made about a 1/16th inch thicker, it does seem to be a bit "light weight" as far as thickness. I've only had it on for about 3 months now, so time will tell if it's built for long life. I gave it a 4 star only because I think it needs to be a tad heavier in construction.

One person can use this tool, a breaker bar and a torque wrench to easily apply the correct final torque.

6038	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I adapted this to be used on a 3 inch wide tube. Essentially I heated up the metal with some map gas, and then straightened out the little dog leg on each support some with a 3lb sledge hammer and anvil.  This allow me to use the existing four-inch keel roller. Took about 15 min. to modify, and then I painted the entire thing with black enamel to match my trailer. My only complaint is it only came with one axle or pal nut, and the 5/8 diameter ones are not easy to come by at the local hardware store. I ended up ordering a few off of eBay which cost me an extra five dollars with shipping. I guess I could have sent this back, but I just wanted to be done with it. The rubber is a little bit soft, but keel rollers are only about four or five dollars to replace, and they do tend to harden over time by themselves. If you put a lot of weight on this from the get-go you may end up with a flat spot, so be advised.
2217	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The most stressful part of getting a check engine light is not knowing the cause of the problem.

However; it is a good feeling to be able to scan and clear your own or your neighbors vehicle at any location because of it's portability.

980	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have looked all of the polishers available here at Amazon. Using something at 1750 RPMs might be ok for some finishes, but to get true high quality gloss, you need a 2400 RPM machine. Less than that, you don't bring up deep gloss. More than that, with the speed of a sander or grinder (4500=6000 RPM) will burn your finish right up.

So instead.. Here's how you use the tool.. . Disclaimer: (DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!) Verify that the engine does have a clockwise rotation as viewed from the crank pullley bolt (my 02 acura mdx does.) Then, get a long breaker bar with a socket on the crank bolt and wedge the breaker bar against the frame (so that when the engine rotates clockwise the bar doesn't move, I used the lower suspension A arm.) . Make sure everyones' hands are clear and just Bump the start just for a split sec ( don't start it!) and that bold will come right off!!

But after 14 yrs of Bass and kids it was tired.  He had towed it behind his truck on more than one occasion w/o the tarp on.  The diesel fuel is very unforgiving even if it's only for the tip home from a successful weekend out.  The short of it I have been a Mcguiars fan for my auto stuff for years.  Saw the kit for Marine restore and that started with a four day detail.  Was pretty wiped out from the buffer after two days, before we got to he interior.

8598	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I originally got this because taking off the lower engine cover to get at the drain plug is more of a pain in the ass than the actual oil change. The reason I love this sooooooo much is that I can now do a full oil change in my TDI without lifting the car AND I don't spill a drop of oil this way. Another great use is changing automatic transmission fluid and power steering fluid. Another bonus is I'm not as concerned about overfilling fluids because I can remove a little bit so easily.

1327	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This is the third strike for APC in my book.  Their equipment has now failed me three times.  Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended, then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed.  With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working.  Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.
A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.

A proper patch is all in the prep and making sure you remove the source that caused the flat (usually for me, its a small fragment of metal wire that embeds itself in the tire. Removing this solves the problem of repeat flats.

1710	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Since I have a small version of the California Duster for the car, I decided to try this for the house laminate floors.  Quite frankly, it works better than any other "dry mop" I have used.  Why?  Because the fibers of the mop head are waxed, making them sticky.  Consequently, debris sticks to the fibers and stays in place.  Just shake it outside to clean.  I would certainly buy it again
8260	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this mirror and it is the only one that works great on my 1958 King Midget M3 micro car.  It attaches right to the windshield glass and gives me a perfect view of what is behind me. Great product for the little car.

I made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.
7233	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have owned many Fan-Tastic Fans in my RV's and generally they are an excellent product, if pricey. It was with this expectation that I bought this fan. Well, I guess everything a company makes can't be a home run. This fan is a full 6 dB over my $21.99 Wal-Mart fan and an irritating noise to boot. When you charge $80.00 bucks, only $40.00 less than you can buy an window a/c from home depot, you expect an outstanding product. This is not an outstanding product. Yes, it's 12V, which I guess adds a dollar of two to the cost of a fan motor, but come on, this is not good for your reputation. $29.99 maybe....It's coming back for sure...
4425	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nice trickle charge.  This is definitely a trickle charge.  takes a few days to bring battery back to fully charged. I use on Dump trailer where hydraulic motor lifts bed and lowers. If you use battery load daily you'll need a larger faster charger. If in frequent or couple times a week this works great. I added a marine 110v plug to side of tool/battery box and wired to charger inside. That way can plug in power cord externally and use in inclement weather. Glad I purchased, dead battery not so good with load of gravel in trailer.

I remember swim team kids having chamois in Korea that they used to dry off with and this cloth does an excellent job of that. The pool, the beach or as a sweat rag, this chamois can handle anything.

4124	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This polystyrene Soft Bristle Brush is worth every penny.  If you need quality, if you want quality, in a brush this is the product for you.  It retains enough water from the bucket to what ever you're washing which aids in getting the job done quickly and thoroughly.  We used this product on our light cargo trailer and are completely pleased with it performance. We believe we will get many years of use out of this well made brush.  It exceeded our expectations.  We would recommend it to all of our friends and neighbors.

6574	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	When I received my fan I noticed an intermittent whistle that increased or decreased depending on the speed setting.

I listened to one of these fans that someone had posted on YouTube and I could hear theirs whistle in the same way mine did.

Unfortunately, this unit does not have such a features.
Here's the deal- I use this knowing it can cause scrathes- why?  It is one of the most minimal interventions you can use to get dust off...
The spray version is a little easier to apply, but is not good for shipping, lying in the trunk of the car, etc.
6778	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Probably the best Marine Adhesive Sealant I have ever used. Takes forever to cure but once it does, very strong watertight bond. I have used this to seal screws into a transom, seal other stuff where a watertight seal is needed and never a problem. I have also used this to glue bimini top brackets (along with screws of course) to a boat. Anything I attach to a boat, inside or out, I use this 3M 5200 adhesive as a precaution against vibration loosening the attaching screws. Just keep in mind that it might take a week for this 3M 5200 to fully cure. If you need a faster cure, use the fast cure version as that is almost as strong. I would also look around at prices as you might get this cheaper.
The bag itself is just amazing, carrying handles are comfortable, bag is actually pretty thick and lined with a fuzzy material that keeps the helmet protected from scratches. It folds up nicely and compactly in my backpack too.

the creeper is very study when being used. it doesn't flop or loose its balance when you're moving yourself around, which i was glad to see. the creeper moves freely, there isn't much force needed to move this thing. when i get up from the creeper, the creeper doesn't stumble or tip over. it is recommended from the instruction sheet that is provided that the wheels and caster should be torqued and lubed every 6 months, if i recall that correctly. either way, it's still a good idea to check the torque and the condition of the wheels.

Machine washed it and came out clean, minus a few dark spots of grease that I knew wouldn't come out.

Also fished a year with a hole in the boat and it was submerged every trip. it always worked. I sold the boat to a friend and he is still using it. My skeeter bass boat came with an on board 3 bank pro charger. If it didn't I'd buy 3 of these at 20 $ a piece.  Instead of the few hundred for the single pro charger. Shumacher needs to make this same charger with 3 banks for 60$ and I'll buy it. I know all my friends who are anglers would do the same!

9476	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you own a Honda or an Acura and plan on doing any major work involving the removal of the Crankcase pulley then you WILL need this adapter, at least two breaker bars, a long extension bar, 19mm socket (1/2" drive for all these) a pump jack (to lower the engine allowing the adapter to clear) and a jack stand to leverage the extension and socket coming of the bolt to the breaker bar. I picked up those up at the nearby Harbor Freight for about $12-$15 bucks a piece. Save yourself hours of frustration and buy these in advance since there is no other way of doing this without these tools. Definitely worth the money. The bolt is on there with at least 190lb torque so will will need these tools, sorry but the air guns just won't cut it.

8863	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. Just used it once to paint a wood table and chairs with latex enamel paint. I thinned it per instructions but in reality, should of gone slightly more. Being the first attempt, It took a while to get the pressure/volume adjusted but by the final coat, everything was flowing fine. As others have said, a larger tip size would probably work better for the projects I'll use it for. I'm looking forward to using it more and getting a better feel for it. Cleaned up easily and seem very well built. Time will tell.

I changed the ring connectors to a Deltran quick-connect, and I leave the unit plugged to the end of the extension cord in my garage.  For $25 plus $6 for the quick connect, this is about half the cost of a Battery Tender, but works just as well.  It would be nice if a Deltran connect was included with the unit.

It has performed very well in the amount of time I have had it. Even in the winter environment, it has not corroded. There have been a few times where I had trouble getting the pin to pull open, but it eventually opened after tugging on it a few more times. I removed one star for this problem.

[Edit Sept. 21, 2011: In my original review I stated that the Tripp Lite APS750 was a pure sine wave inverter. I removed that statement from my original review as it is pure sine wave when running on mains power (as expected) and PWM (pulse width modulated) sine wave when running on battery. PWM sine wave should not be confused with the fixed square wave output of cheaper inverters. PWM provides tight voltage regulation (+/- 5%) and eliminates harmonic noise - the static hum you might hear with sensitive equipment if run on a cheaper square wave inverter. PWM sine wave is suitable for sensitive electronic equipment and motors. Anyway, I've been running sensitive radio communications equipment and computers on my APS750 with no problems.]

The K&N filter is like opening up that butterfly valve, it allows air to more easily enter the engine when the throttle is open, meaning upon acceleration the engine has to work less for that air, since it is open and pretty much already there, and can adjust more quickly to the ratio it needs to increase the fuel used. This makes throttle response better and acceleration smoother. MPG increases, well, im not sure are very much, Horsepower, possibly a few but it is only a drop in filter.

I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.

I bought it after trying several other "drying towels" for after you wash your car.  This product is by far the best.  It doesn't leave any lint or fuzzies on your freshly washed car, and it drys the car better than the other products too.  I was a  little skeptical at first because it doesn't look or feel like a traditional towel, but I'm a believer now.

Also when preparing to get a load, I extend this units tarp so it not only comes off the pipe down across the full bed, but also have it go back up the bed wall along the cab. That makes it so as the load is being pulled toward the back and some dirt falls toward the cab, the extra couple feet of tarp will catch that dirt and bring it along with the rest.  Someone else also suggested putting some "folds" in the tarps to make it so you pull part of the load first, then more as the "folds" pull out.  That may work to some extent, but I doubt you have enough tarp for very many or very big folds.

P.S; after having used this, I have noticed that this does not fit snugly on 2004 TL; there is a slight play and it marred the corners of the crank pulley. The actual size seems to be 55mm. Genuine Honda tool comes with an adapter & a LONG bar (longer than my Snap-on 3' beater bar).

Koolatron Battery Saver did not work for us. We purchased this accessory after our return home because of the dead battery incident.  Although we already knew the car would still start after 4 hours, this is probably too long.  We wanted to keep the cooler running for stops on the next road trip, but to shut off before the battery got too low.  We tried 2 of these units in 4 different cars, and the greatest time the battery saver would allow the cooler to run was about 4 minutes after shutting off the car engine. We did discuss this issue with Koolatron customer service, but didn't come up with a satisfactory solution.  We did like the fact that Koolatron does have someone to talk to without a long wait, which is rare today.

Cons:
1331	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery. It does not. If I had known that, I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff.

I used the same sponge head adapted for application with drill that came with the 3M kit (just wash/rinse well before using the meguiar product) which made this final step rather quick and easy.

I'll also add a bolt with a locking lug nut later, as an extra deterrent, when I find the one I need.  Theft is a reality and anything of value is subject to a theft.  This Master Lock 262DAT will not assure that there will not be a theft of your spare, it will make it harder for that theft to happen.  I like it for the price of $6.77 delivered free with my Prime membership.  It is the least I can do, to try to deter theft!  I'll do more later.

7445	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I don't like this for drying cars.  It seemed to smear the water rather than absorb it.  It always left streaks on my newly washed car.  After "drying" with this, I'd have to go back and get rid of the water spots.  I now use Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.  Sucks up the water for a streak-free shine.

4856	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great price and free shipping and big to boot.  Absorbs lits of water, make sure you keep it clean and store wet.
If you've been using microfiber or terrycloth towels to dry your vehicle after washing it, give this thing a try and you won't go back.
2502	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I could not lock the pin until I ground off about 1/8" of metal on each side of the receiver around the hole, tapering it to match the shoulders of the lock.  Chevy and GMC HD 2500/3500 pickups put on an honest Class V hitch that is a full 3 1/2 across, and in spite of the claim, this product is just a bit short.  Regardless of the needed modification this is a quality lock that should deter even an ambitious thief!  I would not recommend grinding on the lock as that might weaken it.
3161	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is exactly as presented.  It is a light duty dust cover.  It is large enough to cover the largest cars from the 50's and 60's with room to spare.  It folds up in small package for easy storage when not in use. I use it in a grarage where the door is open a great deal of the time and it gives sun and dust protection.

4621	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really works to make the drying job go faster.  Wish I had two.
Recently I had to flush the differential oil and wasn't able to undo the drain plug due to it being stuck and not being able to reach it as the exhaust was in the way.
4165	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Been using this product for around 7 years now for coating the rust prone underside areas of my car. The vehicle was already two years old at purchase, but applying this a least once a year kept the corrosion from spreading. It's a Marine Grade product so help greatly with the winter salt mixture on the roads. Driving a new 2017 now, so will very shortly be applying to any rust prone areas BEFORE any road salt has a chance to get a start!
1)  This product is built heavy duty, no doubt.  The delivery man hates me now.  This is about twice as large as the 1250w Tripp Lite inverter.
6324	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Creates a spark, and the mower runs.
I apply Meguiar's Headlight Protectant every oil change, but unfortunately it gets a light haze before that so I apply some PlastX and it completely makes it look like new again. It also works for non-restored headlights if they aren't badly oxidized.

Since the van takes less than 5 quarts, I poured about 1/2 quart into the engine and proceed to flush that new oil out as well with the hopes it mixed with any remaining "crud".  I then replaced the oil filter (which I will do over a pan next time) and added the correct amount of oil.

In testing, I found the above combination of two batteries in parallel with the APS2012 2000W, I can power my four servers, routers, switches, and digital phone system for up to 2 and a half to three hours in a power failure. To increase the run time, I need only to add additional batteries. For now, this configuration works very well for my needs.
50	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini-van, this one can continue to look new as long as I take good care of it. I like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction. But in between visits, this is fairly good for quick touch ups. I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.

650	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	These seem small for 4 guage, unless they are counting the cheap insulation wrapped around the copper colored, aluminum wire. These are cheaply constructed. Returned 1 minute after opening box. I'll agree that these are probably o.k. for the occasional user.

Also, the headrest is a complete and total joke. The company seems to be more concerned with getting their logo onto the product, rather than making a functional and comfortable headrest. I wish that this is something that the company would change, or even offer a "real" headrest as an option, if you are reading this Dale Adams, fix this problem!
The lid is the real stand-out from the Drive Auto Products bin, which has a very flimsy lid. The High Road has a semi-rigid lid that blindly lines up the velcro, making it easy to open and close without looking at it, nice while you are in motion.

Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wouldn't want to use it on newer cars. There is no explanation behind this just a hunch. I have used it on Honda civics, Kias, Acuras all 5+ years old and it worked fine.
I bought this because I was adviced by a mechanic that the drain plug was almost stripped (even with the larger drain bolt).  The cost to replace teh oil pan would have been about $400.  Not the thing I want to do on a 14 year old car with 215/K miles!
3541	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as it is supposed too.
4450	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cut this in 1/2 to use on my car. It soaks up TONS of water. What I don't understand dis why these companies don't make this in a bath towel size. Ladies with long hair love them, and they just aren't big enough for hair. When I first got it I used it after a shower to see if it really absorbed water, and it did. A bath towel size would be awesome! Let me know if you make them big, I want some of them!
8939	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	If you need a bike/ball pump for a resonable price this one will work for you.  Nothing special but seems to work fine
I filled it up it dosent bend or lean it's just what I needed. It handles grain and tiny pebble sized particles and rocks but anything half the size of a dime or so will clog it. But to full anything on the vehicle this funnel will reach it. And or give you the sturdiness or a lil flex if you have an angle issue.

8011	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Saved my bacon when I got stuck in DEEP mud.  Definitely did it's job extremely well - the "yank" and "bounce" that the strap affords makes it a far better way to extract a stuck vehicle than a chain - and we didn't have a winch at the time.  The strap was great.

9351	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works could be better. The tool fits but falls out if you don't hold it. A bit awkward to hold it into the hole, then use the socket on the crank nut. It is strong and it fits. A ball to lock it in the harmonic balancer a bit would be a big help, similar to a how a socket fits on a extension. If this didn't fall out would have made the operation a lot easier.

8625	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Tipping a lawn mower on its side to change the oil always leads to a big mess for me.  The oil catching pan I place underneath the mower tends to slip or tilt out of position and oil spills out.  I was very pleased with the Hydro-Turf oil extractor - no more big mess.  Someone wearing a coat-and-tie could now change the oil in my mowers!  I am sure that a purist might complain that every last bit of the old oil was not removed.  Probably true and perhaps after removing 80-90% of the old oil I may pull the drain plugs next fall and remove the last few drops before winter storage.
1319	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	When you pull off the label that the distributor uses the original sticker reveals that the battery is only rated at 7.5A. At this price (priced similarly to others rated at 9A) it should be rated at 9A. Also, it is NOT manufactured by APC as the description on Amazon suggests... You will be better served by buying directly from APC. Be warned also that you cannot return a battery to AMAZON for any reason...whether the mistake was theirs or yours, or you ordered the wrong item, etc. No returns period.
The only reason I knocked it one star is assembly. After paying over $100 for this creeper - I get it and had to attached the wheels myself. That blows because it is 16 bolts and 16 nuts. Not hard or anything I just would have thought for $100 creeper they maybe could have done this at the factory.

7264	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic. Dries very well. For those that think it should be a 100% streak free dry go elsewhere. That is not how a shammy works. A shammy will dry most of the water but not all and you will always have a small wipe up with your favorite microfiber. However it won't be much wiping with your microfiber. I highly recommend this product it is a time saver.
7247	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this fan for tent camping for a weekend. This little fan pushes some air! I actually had to get under the covers and lower the fan speed during the night. I had a deep cycle 12V battery for the entire weekend and never lost power. I ran it for approx. 12 hrs each evening, never ran low on power. The fan noise was low and reasonable for the air flow you were getting. Other campers with us had different types of 12V fans and they all liked the one i purchased. Good job MFG!

One day I turned it on and a noise like a toy machine gun came from the control box.  No heat.  I took it to my brother who is an electrician and fixes all our electrical gadgets.  He tried but said that the controls were very cheaply made and he would not spend money on another one.
I have since used Actron CP9135 autoscanner to diagnose issues on several makes and models of vehicles.  It has never failed to steer me to failed component.  In recent years scanner has been helpful with a 2002 VW Jetta Station Wagon vehicle with two liter gasoline engine.  Autoscanner told me when the catalytic converter was failing and needed replacement.  I think scanner may have helped with real savings though when a VW 4 speed 01M automatic transmission problem occurred.

5284	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Yes, I'm weird.  I choose to use a shammee instead of a towel to dry myself off after a shower.  My dog has one too, different color, for her monthly baths.  It's amazing how it extracts the bulk of moisture from her coat.

1790	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	If you have a Black, highly polished car-stay away.  It will leave red lint everywhere, and wax droplets.  This is after following the break-in directions.  What a shame.

I was worried that the coating would leave a smudge or visible residue, but it's quite minimal. Apply the Rain-X, then smooth it out with a lightly moist towel. Worked well for me.

If the swivel plastic feet do break, big deal: I'll glue a swatch of Velcro on the bottom and another on a tiny board, mahogany or teak or whatever and suddenly the fan is no longer "chintzy (remember that word is their's not mine)".
I am 6'4 tall and this creeper is a little short - but then again most items I try to use that involve my height usually are too small anyway. For the average size person I think this would be good.
You won't be doing any work requiring precision movements of your fingers though; they are rather bulky. Getting the dog's leash on and off the collar was about the finest task I could complete with confidence while wearing these. If you need more precision (and the conditions permit), consider Ironclad's Ironclad's Tac-Ops model instead.

472	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice flag decal.
When I used it, I'm almost sure now that I overloaded it, so my tail gate now has indentations where the brackets for the pipe were (despite the rubber in them to cushion it). Also the plastic mount brackets (2000 lbs model) have pulled off of the tail gate when first starting to pull the load off of the truck (because it was easier for the pipe to move toward the load instead of the load move to the pipe), so I've had to have someone help hold them down as I start winding it. Note; this one has a strap to go to the bumper on each bracket, so that should help hold them in place (the 2000 had a strap for 1 side).  Perhaps the overloading seems like my wrong-doing, but they do say "helps you with hauling, rock, dirt, & much more" even showing that in the ad pictures. A full size truck like mine can easily end up with ~4000 lbs load and how do you know just by eyeballing it what the weight is? Running some math now, to keep a load of dirt under 2000 lbs even with pretty dry soil (that is said to be about 75lbs per cubic yard with wet soil being over 100lbs), in a 8 X 4 foot bed you need to get only a 10 inch high load and that is about 1/2 the height of most beds. I can understand it being hard to engineer something for a full bed load, but if it's to be used for such things as they say & show who wants to only get 1/2 what they could in each trip? The pictures do show the peak of the load just at the bed height with very little on the sides, but is that what you're likely to get when at the nursery?
4539	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this on my Case 480D backhoe. It's the same oil filter as the one used on millions of Ford engines, from Fram, an old favorite brand we all know and trust. The Suregrip section on the end gives a good hand-hold to make it easy to get off at your next oil change without the need to use a filter wrench. Highly recommended.

The suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. It runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. Sample provided for review.

Some procedures are just wrong. For example, to check the thermostat they say to see the engine temperature displayed on the dash. The 2010 Prius does not display the temp so clearly the authors did not even go through the procedure themselves.
6542	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ordered on the way home from the auto parts store where the booger picker behind the counter was so lost he couldn't find these without a specific year, make and model.

1289	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect fit and works exactly as it should!  I should have gone the route of a real APC battery to begin with.  Instead, I tried going "cheaper" and paid for it in the long run.  The less expensive battery (purchased here on Amazon) would simply not fit the unit.  And have gone back and forth with the seller so many times  that I've finally just given up.
I used this product and was blown away buy how well it absorbed and better yet the wring out was so easy,

Just run some warm water over it. It actually dries better when It's a little wet.
Manufacturer should redesign the feet so people who don't mind the noise might consider keeping it for the excellent air flow it creates.

6773	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I tested this out on my transom before doing the hull and I'm glad I did....unfortunately it still took a long time that'll I never get back. I thought with some hard work it would do the job and it didn't look good at all afterwards. You need to use a lot of this product for it to do the job and it will get expensive without the final result desired. I will keep the kit to bring some shine to my hull stripes....hopefully it's enough to do that job. Needs much to be desired...unimpressed again by Meguires. Note: my boat is not heavily oxidized and this should have handled the job.
3641	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works good, small enough to carry with you in your car. All of these plastic funnels and bottles are way overpriced of course, but if you have to buy one this funnel works well.

You NEED this tool if you are going to attempt this procedure. The 14mm timing/balancer belt/tensioner adjusting bolt was also tight beyond belief. A hex box end wrench with a pipe extension helps with that one.
Decide for yourself whether this breach of security is worth the convenience of a remote starter.  Personally, I think it's foolish.
3767	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	For the price, it's a nice deterrent but it won't keep a thief from ripping it off. I had to drill a bigger hole for it to fit over my spare tire mount stud. Also, you can spin the lock (and nut) and bring it all right off. Luckily for me my spare rim has a lip and it keeps the lock from spinning.
2840	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this filter to clean my vacuum pump oil and act as a water separator.  It's working great.  I have a small pump circulating the oil to/from my vacuum pump used in my freeze dryer unit.

1538	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have an off-road trailer that I use for research. I purchased the APS750 and coupled it with a 105 AH AGM battery in the nose box of the trailer. Away from mains power, it provides excellent run time for several laptops and communications equipment. I keep the battery charged with solar panels off-road and take advantage of the 20A charging capacity of the APS750 when mains power is available. It's a 750 watt inverter, transfer switch, and battery charger in a rugged package - perfect for my needs. I highly recommend the APS750 for mobile applications where high quality and reliable power is important. I can see where it might make a good emergency power system too.

3923	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's a perfect funnel for pouring oil in a small engine crankcase. I'm sure I'll find other uses for it. It's cheap enough to have several of these around. A big plus is that it is made in the USA. It's hard to find things like this that aren't made in China.
9915	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love love love the K&N lifetime air filters. They may cost more up front, but you only have to buy it once and you can go longer between cleanings. I won't claim that it increases gas mileage because with my driving habits I wouldn't be able to tell anyway, but I can say that the engine runs smoother and feels more powerful. That's why every time I get a new car, my first upgrade is to swap out the stock air filter for a K&N.
9908	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I keep coming back, Amazon seems to be the go-to place when it comes to buying parts for my truck,  It's easier to find part numbers elsewhere but once you have that, your set.

1165	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I put 3 in 1 oil in this. It works extremely well. The pump performs as it should. I like the control I have with this and the ability to get into very tight spaces. This can also helps keep the oil from getting everywhere because it's application is smooth and accurate. This is much better than using the plastic container the oil comes in for applying the oil. I am extremely happy with my purchase.

It saw its first action.  I helped a neighbor jump start his car; my Mazda 5 to his Sienna.  No problem.
9797	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	K&N has always had an excellent reputation for their products, but they are expensive. A special offer made this reasonable. I plan to keep my vehicle for an extended period, so it will pay back for itself some time in the future. My filter is a little hard to examine, so I'm glad that I will not have to disassemble the air box as often. Beware if you have the vehicle serviced by others, the "grease monkeys" will be quick to rip it out and try to tell you it is bad and you need a "factory style" to replace it. Put the enclosed sticker on the air box and tell them to leave it alone! I have not used it long enough to measure any overall improvement in mileage or responsiveness, but the main reason was its reusability for almost an indefinite period. Make sure that it is the correct model to use for your application, as any misfit will cause damage to your system. I double checked on K&N's site, got the correct part number, and then ordered through Amazon. You will need to buy a "recharging kit" to clean and restore the filter in about 50,000 miles, so be prepared in a couple of years

6149	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	PlastX seems to work well on light to moderate yellowing, and not as well when the deterioration of the surface is more serious. It also seems to work all right on slight pitting and scratching.
5727	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It would be extremely difficult to screw up this product.
8300	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Mounted on my ski boat.  I actually started with a more expensive, windshield frame mount mirror but it would not adjust to the correct angle.  Provided you adjust the pivot ball tension screws first, if necessary, this mirror easily moves without breaking and stays where put.  I look over to top of my windshield so I have this mounted just below the top, out of my line of sight.  I can easily move it to the walk-through windshield (on center) when it is closed or to the driver's windshield when the walk-through is open.  I can't imagine a better mirror for the money.
5768	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This will polish up your lenses very well but old, yellowing lenses will need to be re-polished regularly as the plastic is old and deteriorating and can't be fixed, just polished.
5255	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Are you serious?  It turns stiff as cardboard when it dries.  I purchased this to dry my camera gear when it was raining and took it out of the container so I could store it in my backpack.  Low and behold, it dried up like cardboard.  Then I found out you have to keep it in that thing, and it was coated with some alcohol like chemical, which I am sure is not good for my gear.  Crappy product..give me a regular microfiber towel please.

9481	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have not yet used this to replace timing belt on my 2004 Honda 3.2TL. In the image, the tool looks like it's made of some resin but it is heavy steel.  The hole inside is large enough to allow heavier-duty impact gun socket (19mm for the TL).  I checked the Honda SST and it looked almost identical.  I will update when I'm done with the job.
Wrings out dry with ease, ready to soak up water again
6409	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what was expected.  I was a little surprised that this does not stay flexible.  Harder than I thought but that is fine for a sealant.
4615	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Would not remove an ink stain on white vinyl. It was advertised as "Heavy duty Vinyl Cleaner" SO I WAS HOPING IT WOULD WORK ON THIS STAIN.
7817	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have used this three times. It dries my car well. After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube, as per the manufacturer's directions. Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels.

46	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	How this item got 5 stars is beyond me. It had a problem picking up six little quarter inch pieces of dried leaves from the carpet in my vehicle. Calling it a toy is an insult to toys.
5962	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	NICE


-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard. (Dip it on water and it is good to go again).
3012	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very high quality which has a built-in Guage same quality of any auto shop. Super buy...
2115	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really good price for what you get.  The net is adjustable and strong.  Good product!
5058	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really works just like a real chamois if not better
Background:
Overall, this product is a great value. You can't beat the price and it does its job well so long as you cover up any parts of the car you aren't working on and you are quick to clean up after any splatter as it happens. It's also important to know that this rubbing compound will not give you a mirror finish. It's made gritty enough to help remove oxidation, deeper clear coat scratches, and overspray. You should be sure to follow this up with a finer polishing compound in order to restore your car paint back to factory condition.
Second, the dog hair does not weave itself into the Absorber like it does on towels.  And any hair on the Absorber is easily rinsed right off, fast!

8588	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really makes oil changes easy. I hate getting under the car, and I can change the oil on all my machines easily except for my Armada which requires that you drain from the drain plug because of how they designed it. You also have to remove the brush guard to get to the oil filter.
2834	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	like the clear bowl and filter system
9843	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great filter, haven't measured mpg difference yet...But I can "feel" the difference! Save the paper filter to use when servicing [cleaning] the K&N. Get one! Got one for my Harley too.

See my "before" and "after" photos above!
3067	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  They have it in spray bottles now but this is the way I was introduced to this stuff back in the 80's when I was a kid. For those that have not used it, this is not a gimmick or a fake product from a "Seen on TV" advert.

8595	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The extractor is very easy to use but took me 60 min  to get all the oil out. I had to pump it a few times during the extraction process to keep the oil flowing. No big deal and better than having to put the car up on ramps to get the oil out. Plus, no mess at all using this extractor and easy clean up!
1225	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Don't think they've changed the mold in 50 yrs. Just like I remembered. Long tube is handy too.
7448	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	just as it stated
It's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case. I hope there's some other manufacturer who can do a better version, and I'm willing to pay a little more for this concept well executed. It's a shame.
7063	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have an older absorber that I was looking to replace.  The new one doesn't seem to soak up water like the old on did when it was new.
867	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect fit. Works great.
I like the overall size and shape - it fits well on the floor behind the front seats where it's easy to reach, even while driving (of course, that depends on your car). Compared to a similar sized non-powered cooler, you get a lot more usable space in this guy because you're not wasting half the capacity on ice or freezer packs...virtually the entire interior can be packed to the brim and it all stays cold. This also makes for a lighter and easier to carry unit.
6909	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very water absorbant, holds a lot of water and wrings dry with ease. I have already bought 3 of these and I love them more and more every time!
The top butterfly controls how much air CAN come through, open more to increase the air, less to decrease the air


8524	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as described. I had no problem sucking oil out of my bro's BMW E46. The entire process was a bit slow but I think the oil wasn't as hot as it should've been. The important thing here though is that the unit worked well.  It was my first time using so I'm not sure how fast or slow it was going to take. I had to stop a couple of times to make sure oil was still being sucked out. When you pull the tube out and you hear a draining sound that means air is releasing and oil isn't being sucked in anymore and you see the whole tube drain oil. So I know it was working since every time I put it back and did it again, the oil started to be sucked out.
8014	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After watching my buddies break about 5 of the straps you can get at walmart or autozone this one has continued to hold up! I bought one of these about a year ago, It wasn't quite long enough for some of our adventures in mud pits though, so I bought another. I've pulled 3/4 ton trucks buried in mud out with these on top of many cars stuck in the ditch in snow. When you use these make sure to clean them really well, dry them, keep them out of the sun, and make sure they're not frayed.
6971	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great fan but pricey.
3741	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Poorly made, not worth the bother

Bring in the Meguiar's #17 Plastic Cleaner.  13 year old Subaru headlights look like new.  I've never had any of the expensive commercial services or anything but this product.  Same for my wife's 2002 Audi TT.  No mechanical polisher devices are necessary, just a little elbow grease and Meguiar's #17.  You can follow up with #10 polish, if you're a perfectionist, but this alone will keep the light shining through your headlight covers.

1477	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this item about a year and a half ago when I left a light on in my F-350 pickup and the battery was very dead.  No lights, no clicking when trying to start it.  Nothing.  I was pulled all the way into the garage where the front of the truck was against a wall.  The grill comes up with the hood so there wasn't sufficient room to open the hood and I couldn't put it in neutral to push it back without power.
9363	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
2990	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The fitment is perfect. I've been using it without an additional cables to tighten the cover together in order to prevent it from comming/flying off with the wind. So far so good. I purchased it for my 2002 acura rsx. The quality isn't great but it works.
2839	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit perfect in my ford Bronco

8051	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good economical solution for light duty needs
The saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the "drain, cap and transport" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.
2703	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These are heavier than I expected, but that is good.  They are sturdy and deploy easily, my only minor gripe is that the legs have to be bent back somewhat before they will unfold.  If you were to unfold them without bending them first, they are going to break.  This wasn't a problem when I tried them at home in good light, but I could see if my first attempt was by the side of the road in the dark the legs would break off.
The only bad thing is that you have to reapply every few weeks
9582	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used K&N air filters for years in everything I have had for which they make the filter.  They work fine and I have never needed to replace one of them.  Simply clean them occasionally and reinstall.  I can't comment on any power increases but like the  product.

I tried propping up the headrest mirrors up between the window and seat and that didn't work because my window would move it everytime I opened it.

If you do a quick Internet search, you can find a lot of stories like mine.

1002	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This oil pan is a fantastic concept: drain the oil, cap it, and transport it. If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.
9190	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My Treeing Walker Coonhound loves it.
8497	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Great concept but flawed execution.  It would literally take hours to remove all 7 liters of oil from my BMW 3.0L I6 engine.  It doesn't matter if the oil is 70F or 210F.  The extraction is SLOW.  That's assuming the vacuum remained constant.  It doesn't.  I have to go back to the extractor and pump some more every 10 minutes or so.  Otherwise the flow of oil will stop.

6908	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this thing!  This is actually my second one I had to buy because I accidentally left the other out of the tube overnight (don't do that).  The best thing about this, is that it does not leave scratches or swirls on the paint of the car, and it does an awesome job absorbing the water.  I would absolutely buy this again, and suggest it to anyone that is on the edge on buying one.
It works.  It's metal, strong, rust-resistance (it's not a grade of rust-proof stainless as there are already spots from road-salt), but given the narrow space where it fits, it's difficult to get the locking end on and off.  It's hard to get a good grip on it,  even with the knurling on the ends.  But the ends ARE small enough so there's no interference with other hardware.  The hitch on my truck is just wide enough outside that there's almost to end-play on the lock shaft which makes getting the end on even more difficult.  Takes some getting used to.  I don't think there's a better product out there though, which makes this worth the price.
2647	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to replace the factory tailgate on my Silverado which was dented.  Now with an 8 foot bed on a crew cab 2500HD, I can actualy see behind the truck while backing up. Very good price with Prime 2 day shipping is a fantastic deal.

5335	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	NGK makes some great plugs.  I cannot say I have ever had any problems with them having used them in boats, a waverunner, and lawn equipment.  This particular plug (BUHW-2) is not as shown in the picture.  It is is a marine type plug without the electrode tab sticking out like a regular plug.  I have been running these in the same Mercury engine for twenty years.  I do replace them frequently however, as I am using this particular model on a boat that is mostly used in saltwater and the bottom two cylinders get exposed to salt water and therefore rust.  On the one hand, you could see this as a bad thing, but on the other hand could be seen as a positive because in galvanic corrosion where one metal ( the plug) corrodes preferentially to another (the block) when both metals are in electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte (salt water), this means that it basically protects the block (since one or the other will rust first in galvanic corrosion).

7852	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased a brand new car and of course I wanted only the best equipment and tools to clean and pamper my car.  I tried a lot of different "shammies" and drying towels made of terry cloth or microfiber or whatever.  Simply said, none of them left me satisfied after washing and drying the car.  One day I was at T@rget and saw this in the automotive section read the back and said "hey why not, worth a shot". Well that shot paid off big time! This thing is amazing at what it does and leaves my car streak-free and shining beautifully when done.  What works best for me is that it HAS to be somewhat wet before starting to use it; not saturated or sopping wet but a good damp works.  The amount of water the absorber retains really is a feat in itself.  I recommend this highly and trust it fully to always get the job done.
6758	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not as good as the ceiling fan, but excellent for move lots of air. It is a little noisy, but even my restless wife slept like a baby.
4978	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent seller 100% Recommended
7783	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used these for over 10 years as well as natural sheep skin chamois. This works very well. If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois?  Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa)  I do recommend it. Hope this helps someone.
1786	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	First time I used it, it did a GREAT job.  No streaks, no smears.  I think the secret is to use zero pressure, just the tips.  BTW, I read the reviews and placed my new duster on newspaper (changed it twice a day) for a couple of days.  I found that if I turned the duster upside down and placed the newspaper on it, then flipped everything over, I got the duster to spread evenly on the newspaper.
8868	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have used this gun on a few projects now and I like it more and more each time I use it. I have found that an air pressure of about 27 or so pounds (at the gun inlet, not cap pressure) gives me the best results with most automotive basecoats and clearcoats. It seems to clean up easily too, which is a big bonus when you apply epoxies and 2k urethanes. All in all a good value.
7308	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've ordered this very item probably 10 times in the last 2 years and always gotten a Wesbar brand wiring harness in retail packaging.

Instead of the wire insulation being the same color all the way through, the plastic on all the wires is brown (lighter in color than the genuine Wesbar) and the green and yellow is paint over the brown plastic.

6833	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There's nothing like this product.  I use it for sealing rv seams. Don't use the 4200 for boat or rv repairs. It came up after 6 months & I had to redo all of them with 5200. This was a lot of work. I've used sealants for decades. This one blew my mind & was the answer to those serious needs & ended the better-quality product seeking I was forced into for years. It probably isn't the best idea to use it around windows though, where you may need to take the repair job up ever again to change glass out. It is so good, and maintains flex so well, but removing it can be a big undertaking due to it's great permanent sealing. I tell everyone about this product. Everywhere I've found people talking about repair jobs then I tell them & a number of them have gotten the product. I just got it for a retired police officer to repair his rv. I got it on amazon.com & it came very quickly in the mail.  The price through Wesson was very good. I emailed Wesson & asked if they'd keep more available on Amazon, because it isn't always easy to find the 5200. A very good price was offered on Amazon. I was real glad to see it there.

8838	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Wow, a product that does what it is supposed to... not much to say here other than I wish it was available through Amazon Prime to ship to an APO.  For some reason Amazon doesn't ship certain things to APO addresses.  Being in Iraq, I have such an address.  I guess they think I can build a WMD out of this or something.  LOL!  Anyway, I'd have given it more stars, but the feet pop off and the metal ring around the hose where you have to hold it to push the lever down to secure it to the tire has a jagged part.  Cosmetic only, but still... It's functional so far, having inflated my tire.  The pressure gauge didn't seem to work, but I inflated the tire till it was firm and I've been doing ok.  If you're stateside, you might have better luck getting a different model, but if you're stuck somewhere and need it shipped, this seemed to be the best deal.
665	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased these for jump starting our Yukon XL that we infrequently drive. We've had problems in the winter keeping the battery fully charged enough to turn over the engine. These cables are great because we can easily connect to the other vehicle without moving either one to get close enough for cable connection. They are long enough for the job and I love the 4 gauge wire - easily boosts the Yukon's battery without needing to sit connected for a long time - just long enough to start the boosting car, get out, walk over to the Yukon and start it! Despite being 4 gauge, they are very pliable and wind up nicely without kinking and twisting.
7169	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this Absorber for drying my cars. I've had it between 5-10 years, can't remember for sure. I live in the south and have four cars so it gets used a lot year-round. In fact, someone gave me another one a few years ago and I figured I'd use that when the first one wore out. It hasn't and it's not even close.  Why you you even get a leather chamois?  Awesome for a give for anyone who washes cars. I'm sure there are other uses, but I just use it for cars.
9096	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I keep finding new ways to use this product. I recently put new interior doors in my home. after staining the wood I didn't want a poly (Varathane) finish. Instead I applied the Johnson's wax with a cloth and then removed it with paper grocery bags. The paper bags act like a fine sandpaper and absorbs the excess wax. The final result was stunning. A fine furniture finish nicely sealed. I've noticed a resurgence of old products Like Johnsons Paste Wax coming back on the market. This is a great product that rates 5 stars.

2574	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	wondertful product .. the second one i have had and would buy again
  I will give you an idea how good this stuff is.  I had a job that was a 2-hour drive from home.  I drove from work to my home in the middle of the night in a heavy rainstorm and made most of the trip without using the windshield wipers at all. Only to get out of the parking lot, as I said the wind speed is what moves the water.  and when passing through a little town with a lot of street lights, at night the street lights and moving at a slower speed creates a lot of little points of light/glare on the windshield but not an issue when at speed down the road and oncoming traffic.  I basically drove without wipers the entire trip and had great visibility, more so than I would have had using wipers and no rainX.  I do not recommend you do it, it works for me and I know at what points to use the wipers.
4370	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	no problem
7787	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is great!!!
This product here is designed for step #3 above.  If you have very light oxidation or marks on your headlights, this should take care of it.  However if the headlight is deeply discolored and heavily oxidized, other steps will be required for full restoration.

9525	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Be ready to exert some force to remove the bolt. This tool did the trick for holding the crank pulley while I went medieval with the breaker bar, 19mm socket and extension pipe. The first socket from the auto store split open, the extensions bent and broke and I resorted to using a Craftsman socket and 4 foot long pipe on the breaker bar.
3369	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is really incredible!
Initially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.

1558	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent product. I don't rememeber how to spell the thing this is...that starts with an S...so I will just keep calling it a product (see picture to remember what it is, as drug dealers will talk about their product, and they don't mean this...and when I say "buy this product," I am not saying you are going to get a bunch of cocaine...really, coke's not that cheap). So, it's curved, but flexable so it really hugs your windshield, and if you want, if you really really want, you can use it on flat windows too. I bought this to keep in my STi (car), and it's perfect, much better than the stupid ones at gas stations. However, they will not give you a break on gas because you brought your own...don't even ask. I hope you like and vote for my review!!!

5446	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've used Meguiar's waxes and car products for over a decade in professionally detailing cars.  Had tried another brand's high priced 2-part headlight lens refinisher on two different cars (1993 Mustang, 2007 Expedition), using a buffer as recommended.  Within a couple of weeks, they both were turning cloudy/yellow again.  Was immediately impressed with PLASTX;  easy to apply and remove by hand, and you could see the cloudiness/yellow immediately disappear (I used two light coats, removed in between, just to be sure).  Lights look nearly new and are bright again.  Also used on the taillights to return their glossy appearance.

The product is absolutely and unequivocally, not what 'common sense' would call gas resistant.  If you only need it to hold for 24 hours before dissolving, this is the product for you.  Otherwise, get an epoxy sealant for applications involving exposure to gasoline.
About 20,000 miles after installation, Check Engine light started flashing. I read the stored code, turned out to be Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor malfunction. Good thing I didn't go to a dealer with this (MAF sensor is not particularly cheap). Instead I took the sensor out and had a look: the body of the sensor had blackish oily residue inside. So I bought MAF sensor cleaner (you don't want to try anything else instead), cleaned the sensor, put it back. No problems for another ~20,000 miles. Then again, the same story: Check Engine light, MAF malfunction, blackish oily residue inside... And I think I know what happens.
at first i was skeptical on buying a creeper at such a price, but after using it now, its worth it for me.

Yesterday I had the same problem but I had replaced the battery with a larger one with more cranking amps.  It took me 2 1/2 hours to get enough of a charge to start it.  The truck battery measured 12.1 volts after it started and I was able to back it out.  I was then able to use a charger to get it up to 12.6 volts.

Amazing absorptive capacity!  I was impressed!
Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective.

Some of the reviews talk about blowing fuses and would not work.  Well the reason for the problems is the tip has to be installed properly.  If it is installed backward it creates a direct ground. That blows a fuse.  The center pin has to be positive and the outside has to be negative.  It is not marked so I used a volt meter to assure which was which.  It works great.
212	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I truly believe that every car owner should purchase a Haynes manual to go with their car. Even the most seasoned DIY owner can be thrown off by the unfamiliar designs of their new car and owner's manuals can often be lacking in certain critical areas (and as seems to be the very bizarre case with Audi A4s of the B6 and B7 generation, the owner's manuals oftentimes seem to just be lacking- as in totally absent from the car. It's a very well known thing... check it out), so something which goes into deeper detail is a must. Having all the torque specs, gap settings, bolt types, fluid levels, OEM part numbers, etc., a book like this is essential. As simple as Google is to use, it can be frustrating to try and look up torque specs on a car that is known for having a gang of gnomes seemingly roaming around stealing the manuals, then you go onto a forum, ask what the torque specs are, and the first reply you get is "Read the manual"

7075	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Product would probably work better if using a more powerful buffer machine.  I used the kind from Autozone and it worked okay but probablye would of got better results if I used a more powerful buffer.  I intend on using this product very often!

875	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great replacement for my 20hp B&S motor
5293	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product PURELY on ratings. It paid off this time because this thing is awesome. I wash my cars a lot in the spring and summer, I go through one chamois per season. I normally like the lamb skin ones because I feel they are the most absorbent and don't leave streaks. The old chamois made of cloth start piling over time and lint on the car. Years ago all of the synthetic chamois were so crappy, they weren't that absorbent, they left streaks or smelled bad. This thing is awesome and its big so very absorbent, it holds a lot of water before you have to wring it out. I am very happy with it so far, I've used it for two washes already. Glad i found this.

UPDATE: It's 6/2015 now and although the Plastix was good, it was a lot of work and elbow grease. In 2014 I ordered this stuff http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00429NKWK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage and it was night and day difference. So much easier and it has a bottle of UV protectant that is like magic in a bottle. Definitely using it from now on. It's been a year so far and the Sylvania stuff is still holding strong.
7424	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just as expected. Long enough for my small utility trailer. No problem installing. At the connector end I taped the wires to hold them together and protect from abrasion.

8146	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nice product, lighter weight than my previous cargo bar. Looks to be well made.
6703	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've use this often. Patched up a leaky canoe and enclosed trailer. It's really runny at first, so make sure you don't overkill. Extremely sticky. Once it's on you, it's on everything. If used properly, it works great. Started using flex fill though, instead. Goes on thicker and dries much faster.

8343	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very neat stuff! It really does clean up a plastic screen/windshield quite well.

2019	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is mini version of the lager car duster. It does an excelent job of picking up dust and surface dirt from your car, inside and out. It's especial good for getting the dash where it's close to the windshield.
4018	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	In these cases, when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price. There are no frills here... you pour things through this into other things... end of story.

Otherwise I think of this as a 5 amp battery charger that plugs into another car instead of your house (it pulls ~8 amps from the good car while putting over ~5 amps into the "drained" one).  It will take at least 10 minutes to get enough charge in the cars battery to get you going, so don't expect to instantly crank an engine like "jump starting" with old cables.  The "dead" battery still must accept that charge and return it to crank the car, if it won't then you will need heavy jumper cables.  The wires on this are at least 14 gauge and ~15 feet long, so it's not cheaply built (I've seen similar units with only 5 foot wires for about the same price or another going for $30).  Also FYI I've heard from mechanics, "Expect a battery to take as long to recharge as it did to discharge IE: if you drain it fast while cranking an engine it'll recharge pretty fast (from a fast charge source), if you drain it slow from leaving lights on it'll take a long time to recharge".

If you own a Jeep, you should own one of these.

8163	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great and the Amazon price is really good!  I bought one of these at a mom & pop truck store for more than 3 times the price.
6802	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really strong adhesive and sealant. Using it to build a boat. Stays kind of rubbery and flexible after drying. I also like it because of the long drying time to fully cure. Gives me time to get everthing in place and fastened down. Comes out like a caulk so you can bead or spread with a plastic applicator.

6543	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	arrived fast and packed well.  This is a great product at a great price.
1360	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Things really can change for the better over time.  The Bone is really quite comfortable to lie on.  Some reviews have noted that the headrest is uncomfortable.  I find that if I set my head a little off of center, that the headrest is fine.  Also, I can tilt my head over a little and rest it on the wheel housing.  This is very comfortable.  No more do I have to contend with cords or any other small objects getting in the way.  The large wheels glide over effortlessly.
If you purchase a properly functioning unit and don't abuse the wattage usage these Tripp Lites will last decades, whereas every time I used to turn on an electronic inverter I cringed expecting it to start smoking or beeping with alarms.

8072	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does an Excellent job securing cargo items; Quality Product; Heavy duty design.
I wanted to like this extractor since changing the oil on my Audi is annoying (one has to remove a plastic splash shield underneath the car to get to the oil drain plug).  Still, the extractor is so slow I can perform several oil changes "the old fashioned way".
6775	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Probably the best Marine Adhesive Sealant I have ever used. Takes forever to cure but once it does, very strong watertight bond. I have used this to seal screws into a transom, seal other stuff where a watertight seal is needed and never a problem. I have also used this to glue bimini top brackets (along with screws of course) to a boat. Anything I attach to a boat, inside or out, I use this 3M 5200 adhesive as a precaution against vibration loosening the attaching screws. Just keep in mind that it might take a week for this 3M 5200 to fully cure. If you need a faster cure, use the fast cure version as that is almost as strong. I would also look around at prices as you might get this cheaper.
8223	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup and worked great.  I should've had one these years ago.  Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady.  I would recommend.
4801	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The squeegee is making a comeback. This does a great job of quickly drying.
4200	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really seems to stick to the under carriage of my car.  I think it will really help with rust.  I will say that I feel you should use it in a well ventilated area.  I used it in my garage and could see the fumes in the air.  The smell was pretty strong for awhile...although not totally unpleasant.
5476	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What a time saver! Had been wanting to get one of these for quite some time. VERY handy to use, especially when I switch from one trailer to another with different sized balls... Pop one off, pop the other size on. DONE.
543	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use these along with my angle grinder for many tasks. You have to also add a different backer pad but it is a whole lot cheaper than a separate sander/polisher
When the ring is needed you just pull it up and it engages to stay in place. When done, a light tap sends it back down. I have had to haul items that rest on top of the rails so this feature was important.

8067	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Certainly solves the problems with cargo "slipping and sliding" in my pick-up. East to use and hold tight.

7716	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I know these have many many uses but I just use it to dry my car after a good wash.  You will be surprised by how much water this thing will hold.  You keep it damp in the tube for storage so it's always ready to go when you need it.  If it dries out just wet it again and it's good to go.  I wash this in the laundry and it cleans up nice, so easy to use and care for.
4243	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Mounted this on my diesel truck battery.  I don't use the truck regulary, so the batteries drain.  This solves the problem.  The power cord is only 1 lonf and shoild be 3
5858	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Attempt to stretch that loop over your trailer plug and it will either tear off at the cover end or break at the loop. I know this because I bought two. These are fragile, inferior materials were used. Avoid.
5846	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is excellent for restoring foggy headlights, tail lights, turn signals......Any kind of plastic lens on your vehicle.
1375	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked well on my vehicle, I have also used the application and polishing bonnet over it.
1026	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These do indeed fit the Jerry Cans very well.  I was disappointed to find out that they bolt holes on the carrier do not match the bumperette holes on the back of my 1991 Wrangler.  I have to make an adapter unit to get these to fit.  Also, if they had gone where the bumperettes had been, they would put the Jerry Can too high and it would not fit due to the taillights.  A very nice product, but hardly mount and go ready.

I wish I'd bought one sooner.
119	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	bought this for my Ford Explorer as my old manual decided to go missing. so i adopted this new manual! Screw you old Manual!
It took me less than 5 minutes to install with a phillips screw driver (2 screws on my 96 S10 Blazer LT)  then twist light socket and replace original back up bulb  and reinstall 2 screws..

8709	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product, now that it is summertime and we use a swamp cooler to cool our home that places a lot of moisture in the home and that is not good for any of our fire arms.  Moisture is bad for any of your fire arms. This is a great and inexpensive way to keep them looking new.  Rust is one of the worst thing you can have on your gun old or new. This is a must have product.
3930	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this style lock that is put on one of the lug nuts that hold the tire to the mount. I also recommend using a chain around through the tire and the frame of the trailer. Very good product for the money.
You need to buy a recharge kit as well which costs ~$10 and is good for 20-ish cleanings. It doesn't have to be right away as the filter comes ready to go for the first use cycle.
7435	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say......it's a spark plug.

Lastly, the fabric itself is excellent. It's double stitched and clearly some thought was put into the materials on the outside. It doesn't seem to collect salty water and looks significantly better than the much newer and less used Drive Auto Products bin, which is gray and shows dirt.

I hope you enjoyed this quick review. If so, like my review as helpful. Thanks!
3379	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have been using this product for years.  It turns the raindrops to small beads that floats upward on your windshield, not downward as the raindrops would.  Entertaining to watch, as well as very effective.  When the raindrops stop beading, it's time to reapply. Very easy and quick to reapply.  In an emergency (wiper failure), you can actually  see well enough to drive safely, as long the rain is light to light moderate.

7300	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We do a lot of camping in western Michigan along the lakeshores of Lake Michigan. Michigan summers can be like a Kentucky heat wave with high humidity. Because we stay at most campgrounds that don't have electricity (Amish camping, but with ipods) we cannot run our AC 24/7 with the generator. Therefore, the endless breeze becomes our best friend, because when it's HOT & Humid, my wife is grumpy and she is no longer my best friend....
3142	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Came off once in the wind one of the grommets came out before I used it the first time. I wish it had more of them so that I could tie it on better.
It has 120v RMS on the hot line of the plug, and 0v on the neutral line. Perfect for me to wire into an auto-transfer switch to run my pumps.
8818	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's not really that great, it's not that stable and one of the feet came off the first time I used it, but I bought it because it was cheap and it has held up.  It does the task. And if it were to break, I'd throw it away without any concern.

5229	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product. I purchased this to make a carboy cleaning brush for home brewing.  My initial concern about the 'toughness' of the material to withstand attachment to a drill are completely alleviated.  The material is also super absorbent, non-abrasive and has a nice tacky feel when wet.  Be aware that it dries hard pretty much like a natural chamois when dry.  This size is big enough to make 4 carboy cleaners.
7773	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Easy to use and sets up quickly
4495	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works super !!  Keeps two 12v batteries charged on my RV when we're parked for long periods !!

Using a #2 square bit, took the two screws out of the bottom and popped off the rear cover. Easily found the problem once the rear cover was removed. The power connector to the cooling fan had been jarred loose. I reconnected the connector, wrapped it in a little electrical tape so it woudnt come lose again, and now the cooler works like new again.

732	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Lomanco Power Vent is a must in the south. My undersized dedicated AC unit for the upstairs part of the house could barely keep up when the existing vent motor gave up the ghost. This is my second time replacing one of these motors. Mine seem to last around 5 years, running nearly constantly in the summers. You'll know the motor is about to die when it starts getting noisy. You can reuse the fan blade as long as you don't bend it (as in permanently crease it) when extracting the motor from the suspension bracket. Just make sure the fan is relatively balanced, meaning the blades are uniformly shaped from one to the other, before mounting the fan to the new motor. You can set the fan blade on a flat workbench or concrete floor and spin it to evaluate its balance. They're pretty easy to bend back into shape.
3103	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works just like everyone else has said. This is a cheap and proven product.
3526	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The hole is too small for the lug to fit through, and the lock does not secure tightly; a pair of pliers or a screwdriver could beat the lock.
4358	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does a great job on any holding tank in an RV.
4289	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect
The brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.
So... the takeaway is that this thing really works, and it's a genius design.  Make sure your good car's engine is running and don't leave it connected any longer than you need to.

2364	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This scraper is disposable and the sliding feature that helps to protect you from getting cut when you are using the scraper, gets in the way when you want to use the scraper. It does the job but I have other better quality scrapers that I prefer.
4866	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased and used 5 of these (different colors) over the past 16 years. Some as gifts and a few for myself.

2231	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This tool is one of the best I have seen and used.  It is so user friendly and even tells you righ in the scanner what the code number is and what the code means.  This item is priceless!  If you own a car you need to own one of these.  I have an Audi TT, which made me skeptical that this tool would do an accurate job of reading the diagnostic codes.  The other reviews I read were all about domestic made vehicles.  But; no problems whatsoever!  it read the codes and erased them easily.  You can also check different sensors throughout the engine to make sure they are working properly.  This tool diagnosed my faulty air mass meter with a P0172 code = System to rich.

He went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.
I feel much safer with a wheel chock behind my pickup when I work on it. This chock is light and small which is nice, but the contour also hugs the wheel nicely so I am not afraid of my pickup rolling over it. I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.
9822	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Packaging was nice as always and shipment quick. Of course this was a drop in so it fit nice and snug for my 2004 Tahoe Z71. Was giving the newly used Z a tuneup so I replaced the plugs, wires, cleaned MAF, TB, cleaned out the filter housing as it had grime inside of it, then just dropped this in. Z breathes better although I would really like to acquire a tube to replace the quiet factory one! Anyways, I recommend the filter as it looks better than factory, and will be used and cleaned for MANY miles to come!

7026	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	fit fine. works as was expected.
The major design flaw is the size of the mouth for catching the oil. The diameter of the mouth isn't wide enough to catch the stream of oil that shoots out at an angle (which is the bulk of the oil) AND the oil that drips straight down at the same time. Some spilling is inevitable, so you need to be sure to have plenty of cardboard or newspaper down on the garage floor. You have to constantly reposition the pan in order to minimize spills.
1557	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nice kit for my 2004 Honda Odyssey EX.  I used it to install a Pioneer single-DIN stereo, model DEH-X6700BS (nice unit, btw).  Having a Dremel rotary tool with a round saw blade makes a MUCH easier job of cutting off all the un-needed tabs.  Pay close attention to the instructions for your car model and experiment with dry fitting.

From an ease of use standpoint, it doesn't get any easier to figure out. Simply drill a hole, pop a rivet in, slide the riveter over it and squeeze a few times. The rivet tightens and pops off.

My trailer is white gelcoat and after having applied this product I could see a white 'haze' over much of the surface the product was applied on.  When i started out the surface was pretty much a mirror finish, but now had a slight haze on them, very disappointing.  I went back over the entire unit to ensure I had buffed it all off well enough but that didn't seem to do anything.  After being on the coach for about a month now I'm resigned to the fact I need to go back over everything again with some carnuba-based product (which is frustrating given the effort required).  A sample area I have already re-waxed with Mequires "cleaner wax" (a carnuba product) brought back the high luster that the Flagship Marine Wax screwed up.

1930	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more.  As long as the surface is dry, it works wonderfully.  Once some contaminants start to build on the paint, use the duster, then some Quick Detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean.  My cars always look new with these things.  I just traded in my 2004 RX-8 after 2.5 years of using the duster, and it still looked absolutely new.  I now use it on my 2006 Lancer Evolution and, again, the car looks brand-new (which it is).  I love them.

777	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	On full-size truck, F150 2013 the bar has is extended all the way. where they meet is so flimsy it bends with the slightest pressure. It would be smart to not make them one-size fits all. Not every-one has a Ford Ranger, which they no longer produce. It fits perfect in my wife's Ranger. narrower bed.
1964	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quickest way to keep your interior looking freshly detailed. Still use your protectant every few months but whenever you see enough dust just give it a quick once-over with this tool and it'll look awesome.
5064	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works really well. Be wary of storing it damp, as suggested. Mine started to smell after a couple of days. I store it dry now and presoak it for a few minutes before using it.
~PROS~
739	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Not bad for the price.  Easy to install.  My last one (different brand) lasted 3 or 4 years.  This one is very similar so I expect the same life.  Been running for two summers now with no problems.
5341	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are amazing, I would not wash my car without it.  I went from using and washing 4 or 5 towels to just my absorber.  They work great, no smears or scratches from the absorber. I would recommend using a towel on windows though, the absorber doesn't clean windows well. My wife actually cuts them up and uses them around the house for cleaning and spills.  Great multi-purpose product.
5131	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great quality...works excellent. Nice price and super fast shipping. Very happy.

I can put gas tanks propane , helmets, boots etc. in the back and not worry about it rolling around or tipping over. They aren't designed to strap refrigerators down. Common sense goes a long way.
8082	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is awesome.  I use it most to keep stuff from sliding to far forward in the bed of the truck so I can still reach it from the tailgate.

4731	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great was for our Black pontoon boat panels! Easy to apply, no streaks, really shines when finished! Recommend highly!
When it arrived it was bigger than I though but this turned out to be an advantage as I can store not only my helmet, but both my summer and winter gloves, glove liners and next protector, and it looks good enough that my wife doesn't mind it sitting in the dining room.

Shame on me I cut the packaging in half and put it in the trash container before I checked the steering wheel lock, so I cant send it back.
5545	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It does just what it says.  I'm not sure there is a lot of difference in any of the brands of rust stain removers, but this works as adverstised.
7621	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A lot better than the cheaper ones you find everywhere else. The other ones just leave behind a trail of water, this doesnt.
9371	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The fit is a little sloppy on the loose side but it does get the job done. I had a matco MST6010A it's a better fit but I lost it. Compare the price I'll stick with the Powerbuilt since I don't work on honda and Acura all day

This one seemed to have a short chamber; pushing a small quantity of air with each push (I might be wrong).
7633	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was prepared to write a "sham-why" review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber, but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up' and began working pretty well.  It wrings out easily and leaves no lint, which is pretty rad,  because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy.

7369	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ABSOLUTELY amazing! I have never had anything like this before. Takes the water off my car without leaving streaks or marks. I have a Pontiac Trans Am that I show so it is washed often. On the flat surfaces of my car I just lay the Absorber out flat, grab the two corners facing me with my thumb and forefinger, then just drag it towards me leaving a streak free shine. On the sides of the car I fold it up into a rectangle and gently swipe it down the sides. Just remember to ring it out regularly while you are doing this and you get the best results. I love this product so much I came back and bought another one for the house!
8160	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This product doesn't fit my superduty truck bed.  If I want to place it anywhere that requires both ends to extend fully (e.g., nearly anywhere within the confines of the bed), the release mechanism no longer works and I literally have to get tools to force it to release.  If it had been made just 3" longer, I wouldn't be giving this terrible review.  Anyway, don't waste your money on this lame product!
6516	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Just opened the box. Really nice selection of built in mounting methods. Decent amount of breeze generated, BUT the blades are out of balance.  While sitting on a table in the van the first speed is fine, but above that it definitely isn't going to cut it with my wife, guaranteed! It turns the entire van into a magic fingers vibrating bed.
- Results are temporary unless it never sees the sun again :)
3021	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works pretty well for a month or two but you do need to reapply. The first rain after applying sometimes makes adds a bit of friction for the wipers and they will "catch" or bounce along the windshield.  Not great. But other than that this works really well.
5246	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product
2456	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	ok, this is not ready for new york city, but then few locking devices are.  if someone really really wants your bike and they have enough time they will get it.  this is easy to use, easy to reset the combination, and has a nice dust cover (important for my application since it will be behind the car collecting dust).  nice length too.

4905	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Had my last one for years.  Absorbs great and nice storage tube.

It is easy to empty all drained fluids into recycle containers with the included pour spout. So it's good for the environment too.
3632	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the only wax I'll use on my 29 year boat. Leaves a nice glossy finish and lasts a long time. I only wax the boat once at the start of the season, and this stuff does a great job.
4606	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow do I love this system! This kit seems to have superseded older part numbers and it was a bit confusing as to whether this is what I needed. It worked perfectly with the A size resin and hardner (there's an extra pump). The kit comes with a set of tubes that you swap out according to the directions. Once installed, I'm under the impression that there's no need to clean out the pumps and close the cans, from what I've read about other woodworkers' experience. Sweet!

 Very easy, no hassle. I am doing a slow oil renovation on both cars, which have been neglected regular manufacturer reccomended intervals. As everybody should know a complete oil change on a high mileage transmission, could resault in a breakdown. It is much easier than what i attempted before . Thank you!!!
1007	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it.  Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it.  I bought to save myself time in the clean up.  I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.

6090	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works Great
8612	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's cool that the vacuum pump is never exposed to any oil. It comes off the base, so storage is easier and the container can be easily emptied. Marks on the side of the container tell you how much oil has been removed so you can add the right amount of fresh oil without measuring and re-measuring. Since the drain plug on most pans are not at the lowest spot of the pan, I'm getting more used oil out than I did before using the plug and without the mess.
7253	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for the cabin of my boat. Have not used it yet but did test it out on the boat just to check if it works.
12-oz cans fit best in this unit. Larger bottles work too, but you'll only get a small number in the Koolatron. If you tend to like bigger items, you might want to look at one of the larger coolers. The good news is that I find that the unit itself is fairly well insulated, so even when you shut the power, it will keep your stuff cold for at least several hours, depending on how hot it gets inside your car.
6107	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works like it should..Light to.
8985	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Solid tool as with the others in this product line.  I like the key "technology".  Easy to attach and lock-up.  No problem getting undone.

4286	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff smells but keeps the porta pottee from stinking so I like it.  A little goes a long way so this will last me a couple of years.


There are gentler use buffers out there designed for polishing. The PORTER-CABLE 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher is the number one seller here at Amazon and is tamer than the Makita 9227CX3 7-Inch Hook and Loop Electronic Polisher-Sander with Polishing Kit which is more than twice the power of the Porter Cable. It also takes full sized standard in the industry buffing pads/wheels. If you really want to tread lightly while experiencing less elbow grease you can opt for the WEN 10PMC 10-Inch Waxer/Polisher in Case with Extra Bonnets. The WEN is actually one tenth of the power of the Makita and one fifth the power of the Porter Cable.
This is not a paint or varnish that only needs to be used once. It is oil that the wood absorbs. eventually the wood will start to dry out and you'll have to re-apply the oil again to keep up the wood's finish, otherwise the wood will start to weather faster.

8080	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This bar is excellent.  It allows the items in the bed of the truck to stay in their places.

Inexpensive and great quality.  Every truck owner should have one.
PlastX rich gel formula quickly restored the clarity to both of my headlight covers; which were yellowish before using PlastX. Apparently PlastX uses a microscopic abrasive that diminishes the scratches and oxidation in the plastic headlight covers making them look brand new for quite some time!

675	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I picked up the 20ft 4ga with a bag that is good enough to hold the cables for a casual user at Wallmart. If they would have had the 25ft I would have/should have got that. Streched the 20ft and it barely clears my F150 from nose to tail. The ones I got at Wally World for $25 are the same here for $35 and I did not have to pay shipping. Just found this posting on Amazon about Warranty with the Coleman Cable Inc., (I was wondering how to make a claim if I ever had too!) Of course this is on an extension cord but a company warranty is a company warranty in my opinion..

I think there is some sort of timer or energy meter in the circuitry that signals you when the unit thinks you've been hooked up long enough, but it's arbitrary and only a suggestion.  The LED turns from red to green.  Likely a voltage trigger is hit and it turns the unit off, but that does not specifically mean there is enough amperage available to start your engine.  When a battery is charging it can get up to voltage without actually being charged, if you unplug it then, the voltage will likely drop and balance out to match the available amperes over a short time.  This is especially true in the cold or if you have dead cells or need to put distilled water in your battery.

5285	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have this for my 21' Sea Pro and it definitely does what it is supposed to do. I did leave a blue rag on top of it that was wet and it turned the absorber blue! but the die does not come out when wiping down the boat.
If your lenses are extremely cloudy like mine were (or worse) expect to put in some time and effort. I did, and it was worth it. It saved me $100 to have a professional detailer do it.
It would have been impossible to remove the crank pulley without this one. The original OEM Honda crank pulley tool (goes for around $120, depending where you ship it) is much more awkward, and consists of two parts, which makes it way too difficult to remove the pulley. So at first, I was skeptical of the Powerbuilt variant of the tool, but in the end - I couldn't have done it without this powerbuilt crank removal tool.
5595	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I put this on my RV. It lights when you step on the brake, turn on your park or head lights or four way flashers. Does not light when you put on your turn signals. Therefore it works perfect. That's exactly what I wanted it to do.
3736	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	easy to use with lawn equipment
9751	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great fit and helped a little on the fuel usage
2640	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Its a cheap bag, but for what you pay, you get a great value. There are much better looking/feeling bags out there. But if you don't care what it looks like, and just need a bag to protect your helmet, this is it. It smelled a little weird when I first got it, kinda like walking into Harbor Freight, but after a couple days, its been just fine. I have a XXL helmet, and there is still room in there for gloves and my other shield.

Don't recommend and will NOT purchase again.
3566	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've been using Flitz off and on for several years to clean and polish small brass instrument parts. Sometime I wander away from it and try other polishes and cleaners, but I always come back to Flitz and I haven't found anything that's better. It does a very good job in getting rid of tarnish spots in brass and that's my main use for it.  It does take some elbow grease and maybe a second application for deep tarnish spots but it works better than other polishers/cleaners for this particular purpose.

929	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've owned a few sets of light-to-moderate duty cables and have replaced them due to fraying cables and back connections.  These cables were built to last and though I haven't had to use them yet, I fully expect them to work better than my other cables and to hold up better over time as well.
7576	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have been using these for years,they last forever. You buy new ones because the old ones start to look grungy after 4-5years. My wife constantly steals mine to use in the bathroom for cleaning the mirrors and shower.
8691	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had a convex mirror on my boat but still had blind spots on both sides that compromised safety in the busy channel I frequent.  This mirror is actually 3 separate mirrors. Once you've adjusted the center mirror as you would the rear view mirror on a car you can then adjust the two side mirrors individually as they are mounted on their own ball sockets.  All of the adjustments are somewhat stiff but that's a good thing as the adjustments stay in place even when bouncing through some chop.

4640	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you need to clean rubber and don't want a greasy film left then you should try this. I use it on my weather tech floor mats, the break and accelerator pedals and it improves the grip. I use it on my tonneau cover and it works better than the cleaner they recommend.
9626	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	On the recommendation of a mechanic friend I dropped one of these into my 1999 Silverado 1500. (202,000 miles and still running strong.) My unscientific testing revealed a pickup of 1 MPG. Not too shabby. When the time comes for a new air filter for my wife's Tahoe, I'll buy a K&N. Plus I can claim that I'm helping to save the Earth because I'm no longer dropping used filters in the trash. You can't put a price on that kind of smug self-satisfaction.

The negative thing i noticed is that where the pumping handle connects to the container neck, if you loose the handle position while pumping you will loose pressure. I think it is a very good alternative to getting under the car for people who can access easily the oil filter but not the drain plug.

The Bone with its 5" tall and 1" wide wheels practically glides over the surface.  Unlike other reviews, I felt the headrest was comfortable and the Bone easy to get on and off.  The raised corners to hide the casters does cut into your peripheral view a bit, but it is worth the trade-off.  The quality of the unit, including the hardware, is top-notch.  I expect I'll never wear this thing out.

5964	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I find that this can produce some amazing results, but I am not sure if it is plastic dependent or what.  The instrument cluster lens in my 72 Vega was really cloudy.  This was the first time I tried this and the results were amazing.  The lens looked like new!  I tried it on headlight lens, and although it made it better, it wasn't as dramatic as the previous use.  I have used it on several items, and it always works, but sometimes it works amazing, and sometimes it is so-so.  Overall, it is a very good product.

Of course, as Abraham Lincoln once said, one must take information found on the Internet with a grain of salt.  I meandered over to Amazon, and priced out the #17 and #10, and found out that with shipping, it came out to around $25.  For that price, compared to buying a $400 fishfinder/ chartplotter, I did not have a lot to lose.  Click, click, BUY.

7345	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I can't believe how well this absorbs water. I've always used a natural chamois and this totally blows them away. For drying flat surfaces (hood, trunk, roof) all you need to do is lay it down and lightly drag it across the surface. It picks up any moisture with no pressure at all. Be sure to wring it out frequently as it doesn't really feel wet, but will be filled with water and its effectiveness will decrease.

This one is a little taller for that but rolls nice on rougher surfaces, even outside in the gravel yard. One nice feature is that the wheels are covered, on a lot of creepers I get my jacket or the extension cord caught up in the caster wheels. Update: Just purchased another. They fixed the issue of people bitching about the headrest...eliminated it altogether. still a must have creeper for rough surfaces and uneven concrete, but will not work in loose stone driveway.
After 18 months of continuous usage of about 1 kWh it is still chugging along without a hiccup.  Since my original purchase I've purchased 2 more for future use if need be...Yesterday, Just for kicks I fired up my 2.5 hp compressor via the inverter.  Got a couple red lights initially, but after a couple seconds it ran normal as could be for that load...I have to wonder just how long Tripp-Lite will keep making these pretty much non digital inverters, which is why I did purchase 2 more as mentioned earlier.  Again, just buy one if you want 2000W.

After plugging this in and letting it do it's thing for 10 minutes (the green light came on) nothing appeared to have changed.  I unplugged it from the donor vehicle and plugged it in again.

I am going to use it again because it seems I missed a couple spots. This time I will shield the car around the headlight. No longer a 10 minute job, but they are absolutely correct; you do not want to get it on paint.
I finished my mods by putting a couple of small pieces of Gorilla tape on either side of the slot in the mounting plate where the gate handle goes through then cut a slit in the tape to push the end of the handle through when mounting the bin, so the handle doesn't flop around loose in the slot...kinda anal about stuff rattling on my quad.

2663	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a very good box for the money and it is lite, reasonably strong, and lockable. The description measurements seem to be accurate and it mounted well. I do think it would need some type of support on the bottom. I bolted mine down to the expanded metal carrier on my trailer tongue with 4 stainless steel bolts with lock nuts. The box is very solid mounted this way. It is exactly what I needed. Mounting bolts are not included.

One thing I thought was weird was that with the extension, now there are 15 rungs, without the extension, there were 10...anyhow, with an odd number of rungs the basket is not symmetrical. What that means is either the front or the back will be longer depending on how you set it up, you do not have the option to completely center the basket. It's like a 55/45 split, if you are trying to maintain the Yakima recommendation of not having your crossbars further than 30" apart.

The instructions say to run the engine for at least 5 minutes to warm the oil, but I strongly recommend setting up your oil change when you get back from a long drive - your commute, a big box run, etc. Really get the oil up to temperature so that it thins out and is more easily vacuumed out. This is what I did and it worked like a charm. I removed the dipstick and inserted the vacuum tube until it hit the bottom of the oil pan - don't push it any further as it may curl up and not adequately empty the oil pan. I pumped it about 25 times and went and had lunch. When I came back about 20 mins later the oil was mostly removed. I pumped it another 20 times and in about 5 minutes I could hear it sucking air, so I knew I was at the bottom. It easily held 4.5 qt's of oil (the capacity of my car) and had plenty of room for more - another quart at least.

Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.  Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores "damp" which means little to not maintenance to maintain.  Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was.

2386	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I received this unit for Christmas, and installed it in my Ford Explorer. The instructions are not as direct as they could be, but the video helps organize things. I needed to call tech support for a question/clarification and after a fairly long wait on hold (two days after Christmas so I expected that) I got the info I needed by a cheerful tech. The biggest problems with any of these self-installed units (this brand or others) are (1) people who don't have any electrical experience or tools, and (2) installation on cars that have difficult to access wiring (most). The latter can make the difference between a relatively easy or relatively hard installation. The kit electronics appear good for this type of item. All parts (and a small installation tool kit) are included - - except for any small relays that may be necessary for some door locks, security bypasses, and some dome light activiation situations. They are not needed on every vehicle, but many. A couple should be included since they are cheap and these Remote Starters are not. Also, if under-dash wiring is a bit hard to get at (or not), they have plug-in T-harnesses available that range in cost between $10 and $20. Using one would eliminate almost all hookup problems. I didn't use one. My unit works great. I don't anticipate problems, but I have experience in tapping into wiring properly so the connections should last. If there is going to be a problem, it will be in that area. This thing makes getting off to work on a cold, snowy morning more bearable. It's also kinda neat, in general. Take your time or have someone who knows more about these things do the installation. Enjoy. Happy New Year!
9041	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I am still getting used to it to avoid the water spots, but have enjoyed it so far using it on my motorcyle and lawn tractor.

I use it to spread excess amounts of dressing throughout the engine bay, fender wells, large mud tires, etc... I cut the hose down so that I can hold it with my left hand and have the shortened hose loop around my back, sort of over my shoulder and use my right arm to carefully reach over a vehicle and blow the water off of the car.

5348	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it. I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.
6668	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Did not work as well as expected. I ended up going back to the Meguiars cleaner and polish wax which was cheaper and worked better removing the haze from the front cap of my RV .

8705	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Had no idea how much I was missing this!  The way I have it positioned the view is  from one rear bimini support to the other and the entire rear end of the boat to include the motor.  Fantastic!  For how I mounted it there is one swivel point missing so I fabricated a simple frame to enable mounting high on the bimini top frame rather than the windshield.  Check out the pics of the install on my pontoon.  Perfect.  It comes with 3 different thicknesses of "wedges" that mount to one side inside the bracket jaws to accommodate various mounting thicknesses.  Choose the one you need.  This is the only one on the market that opens to 1 1/4" and fits standard pontoon rails.

The bottle says it can also be used on motorcycle visors. Maybe I should try to polish my drugstore glasses which are all scratched? (My headlights are fine, all nice and clear, don't need polishing.) Too bad this stuff is not intended for real glass. I have lots of scratched up glass items.

6914	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is amazing. It absorbs so much water so easily. It is easy to wring out. It is comfortable to use... it has revolutionized the way I dry my car. So much better than any other chamois I have used.
Now . . . . on to the product. The locking mechanism works fine, but it does not take much effort to unlock the unit. It takes less than 1/8" of a turn to get it unlocked. ( the key turns 90 degrees from lock / unlock ). It takes almost the whole travel of the key If you use the key to lock it.
5613	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Disappointed.
CAUTION: Be careful attempting to polish using the edge of the pad. The pad will separate from the spindle. If you must use the edge, I recommend a speed of no more than 2000 RPM.
279	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As stated well packed
3546	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Not worth the money, the hole is too small to fit the stud through it, plus it can all be spun around and a thief could steal it anyway.  On top of that the spare tire holder on mine is held on by nuts and bolts anyway.  This would do nothing more than "keep an honest man honest."

3) EGR valve replacement
2248	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this from a local auto parts store.  It did NOT remove any oxidation or gunky stuff.  It didn't clean anything.  To be honest it is not worth the purchase.  Pay more and get something from a higher end company that actually works.
7657	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable.  It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.  I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist, bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific.  I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.

5127	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This was the perfect replacement for my old boat trailer winch that failed after 26 years of service.  This winch appears to at least equal to and perhaps a little beefier than the one it has replaced, and installation was a breeze, fit perfectly in place of the original trailer winch. The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is the lack of new bolts to bolt the winch to the trailer. Maybe there's a reason -- perhaps the bolts vary too much in length from one trailer to the next to include new "universal" bolts. But to me, the absence of bolts that are an absolute necessity to install the item is hard to understand. I was able to use the bolts from my old winch and they'll probably be just fine for the life of this new winch, but.... just make sure if you order this item, you can either re-use your old bolts or purchase new ones separately.

5273	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I know these have many many uses but I just use it to dry my car after a good wash.  You will be surprised by how much water this thing will hold.  You keep it damp in the tube for storage so it's always ready to go when you need it.  If it dries out just wet it again and it's good to go.  I wash this in the laundry and it cleans up nice, so easy to use and care for.
7571	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These work excellent and are better than having several different hitches.  They do need to be lubricated and if you live in the rust belt I would NOT leave them in the receiver when not in use.  If they get rusty it can be really difficult to get the ball off.

2882	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	It was okay for the price, but I didn't realize how thin it was until it arrived. It's porous so it's definitely not waterproof. I had to cute a hole in it for my antenna, which was fine, but it didn't withstand the wind and frequently blew off, even with the tie on the underside. It also doesn't protect against scratches at all. If you want this cover, just know that it'll only work for sun protection or if you want to hide your car for some reason, and will not work for other natural elements. I ended up throwing mine out and will invest more money into a better cover in the future.

Pros:
4) Wax again with polishing wheel

 I have found the cheaper 8, 10 or higher gauge cables, in not to much time and use will deteriorate to the point when you really need them they won't work. These are a heavy duty 4 gauge wire that will last for many years. In fact they might be the last jumper cables you ever have to buy. My vehicle as do most newer vehicles have side battery posts. These cables slip on them and lock in place, making a nice solid contact with no worry about sparks. For posts mounted on top of the battery it has a alligator type clamp on the end which will lock on tight, since the handle is spring loaded. This cable is 16 ft long for easy access for cars, SUV's and smaller trucks. If you have a larger truck or motor home you might want to consider longer cables.

8433	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quite often a battery only lasts for as long as it is well maintained, but so far this is the best small battery I have tried.  It was definitely not inexpensive, but has been worth every penny so far.  I have tried quite a few and many of them only lasted 4 months.  The reason this one seems to work is that it holds a charge while sitting.  For a car, it is not an issue because you start it every day, but often recreational vehicles sit for long periods waiting for weather or waiting for you to get a day off.  If your battery gets drawn down too far, you cannot always save them.  This one has held its charge well.  The negatives are the price and that you are not supposed to use a regular battery charger to charge these. I am using a BatteryMINDer, but have only charged it once or twice in the last 3 years.
5281	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product! It is if I had a set of headlights in the rear of my car.

Once you have your battery and this Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger, you will also need battery cables and I highly recommend a battery box to keep the battery safe.  Amazon sells a variety of "invertor" battery cables, any of them will do.  The setup I used had a red, black, and green cable for ground.  I did not use the ground cable.  Also, some guides recommend a 200 amp fuse to be installed on the red line of your battery.  I chose not to do that, but you might want to do it for extra safety.

403	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The item arrived earlier than expected and was just as described in the product description. I haven't had touse the rain suit and I hope I never have to. It's the type of thing you buy for "just in case." The price was right as well.
This thing works as long as the oil is relatively hot when you pull it out. It is mess-free on extraction. It gets a little dicey when you transfer to a waste container. The thing comes with a spout to connect when transferring to the waste container. For me, emptying the tank with that spout connected was not mess-free. I ended up using my funnel without the spout. The spout has a small diameter, and there does not appear to be an air release, unless I missed it somewhere. The result is a slow glug... glug... glug... and resulting spurting stream of nasty black oil, all while you're bent over, trying to keep from spilling everything all over. Once I took off the spout, it poured quickly and neatly into my funnel. The good news is that transfer operation can happen away from the car, on a piece of scrap cardboard, so spills are not so terrible.

266	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Covering large ranges of models (In this case two main models and three separate model generations for each) is complex, and shortcuts have to be taken. Haynes always makes a good manual, and this one is no exception. But don't expect hand-holding of a 'youtube video' level. You'll have to be able to think your way through the repairs.

Be careful though, this is the short shaft version,  I actually needed the longer shaft version but was able to barely make this one fit, and it might wear out sooner because of the way I had to modify that.

1011	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Most of these reviews are correct.  I've used this product for over 10 years.  I've owned at least 10 of them.  They ALL leak, but they are very nice for oil filters and catching plugs.  Here are some tips.  Do not over-tighten either caps, the plastic will break.  Do not do more than one oil change before draining pan.  Do not put this in your vehicle, drain it into a 5 gallon gas tank to transport to Autozone.  It's better that way anyway so you don't have to go everytime you change your oil.  When you drain the pan make sure the big lid is facing up the best you can.  You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.  Use a big flat metal pan or a piece of cardboard if you don't want stains on your floor.  If they would improve the threads on the caps, this product would be perfect.
9257	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	So I bought this to use while I sleep in my camper when it is cold. Works great, but can only be ran for 30-45 mins! After that the timer shuts it off. Went back and read the product description - says nothing about shutting off after 30-45 mins. Great for a car ride, bad for a sleeping blanket.

This inverter worked flawlessly in starting a 13 amp Skil-Saw, a 12 amp vacuum cleaner and a 13 amp microwave oven.  The red overload light would come on for a second or so while the saw, vacuum and microwave ramped up and then it was smooth sailing.  I ran the microwave and vacuum about 5 minutes to my satisfaction.  Since these units were pulling 1500 watts continuous and close to 2500 surge for start up, I feel these results were very admirable for a 1250w rated inverter.
1211	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I think ill order fixed spout.  General good design i think but they lleavs wet spots where it placed after dispensing.  Tightend the spout as i would a garden hose in good working order. I think lhe coil wrap leaks. It dpes seem good.
I'm attaching a few pictures of what i got in the package.  The quality is really better than expected.  All the accessories fit tightly  and there is no air leaks anywhere. I like the carrying case and everything fits in it perfectly.  The cord is super long! I give this 5 stars no doubt and highly recommend it if you are looking for one of these.
5425	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This step is great and works as advertised. Looks great also. It comes with a little plastic anti rattle shim. Mine would not stick in place. They sent me a whole new step free of charge and didn't even want me to ship the other one back. Couldn't be happier!

So on Monday i will get on the phone with Schumacher to ask if my SE-1-12S-CA is defective, and will see if i can send it back. I had to replace the ring terminals on the cable to install it, though, which might prove to be a very disappointing problem.
6919	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I tried several other products including a polish and a "cleaner / wax". My RV had light oxidation but these products didn't remove it satisfactorily. The Meguiar's M4966 kit does the job. The only thing it doesn't include is the elbow grease. I did use a polishing bonnet on a cordless drill and an orbital polisher. I gave up on the polisher since it seems to load up when applying the second step polishing compound. Maybe I don't have the right bonnet. At any rate, that step isn't too bad to do by hand. I am really impressed with the pure wax. I applied three coats on the front of the RV and after a recent trip through farm country, I had quite a sampling of bugs to deal with. The bugs washed off fairly easily and didn't leave marks or residue like I have seen before. Once the RV is completely treated, regular waxing should keep it looking good.
Your old motor can be fixed. Run a continuity test with ohmmeter on it. If it has continuity, the shaft/stator is seized. Remove the four bolts from the seized motor and separate the housing. The back part will easily separate. The stator will be seized to the front. Fill coffee can with WD-40 and soak front motor and stator for an hour. Remove and twist stator and front motor housing until stator separates. Clean stator shafts with 0000 steel wool, lube shafts with lithium grease and reassemble. Dun. zoz

I have tried several lubricant sprays and greases but nothing works for long, this does not work well for a boat trailer where the coupler gets wet frequently as it just starts to corrode and get hard to use, my original coupler lock was still going working great when I maimed it and this one is now dead and I am looking for a replacement.  I had expected it to last at least a couple of years of use and it hasn't lived up to that expectation.

This is the only Duster that I will ever own. It is of very good quality and will get every dust particle off your newly washed and waxed vehicle without marring the finish. The only concern I have was that I  did not realize just how heavy this Duster was when I was using it for extended periods of time. This is the reason I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 star, that, and the fact I could not give it a 4 1/2 star.  It does cover a lot of surface in a short time because of its size. The mop head itself is 13" long and and when you add the handle to it, it makes the whole Duster 24" long. It does come with a nice plastic bag to store the Duster in when not in use. .As far as I am concerned this Duster is the best I have found anywhere.
3552	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Primarily use it to add engine oil. It funnels a big liquid pour into a small opening. :) I really prefer this style of funnel vs. the older classic style. It's like someone went back to the drawing board and redesigned a more practical shape. Also, pretty easy to clean.

1484	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Since the Prius doesn't have a starter motor, I wanted a set of really light duty jumper cables.  I got this instead.  I figure I won't need much charge to light up the dash and get the car running, should I run my battery down.  However, a friend brought up one caveat, which is that with keyless ignition, one can't always go power plug to power plug.  So I got a set of these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065L2D8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19 to go with this device.  They are a nice set of light duty battery clips - perfect for the little battery in my Prius.

It is sad that companies get away with selling this low quality merchandise on the market. But sadder still, my beloved Amazon, in whom I have become a firm supporter over ten years SELLS the stuff. Is there nobody who examines this merchandise before they begin to sell it?  You would think that there would be quality assurance departments staffed with people knowledgeable in their fields with certain kinds of tools. Or send ten out to carefully selected "experts" who would try them, evaluate them, and send them back to Amazon with a critique. I have to admit, I'm scared of what I see happening with Amazon over the last few years. Walk away from this one.

8597	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome pump.  I tried two other cheap pumps (under $15) and either the hose was too big to fit down the dip stick tube or it did not have enough suction to get the oil flowing.  I used this pump on a Sea Doo jet ski and it worked perfect.  The hose was long enough to put all the way down the dip stick tube and still be able to place the canister on the ground.  I pumped the handle about 12 times and the oil started flowing down the tube.  Because I had already removed the battery, I was unable to start the jet ski and get the oil warm.  I store the jet ski in our garage over the Winter, so the temperature was about 50 degrees.  Because the oil was thick, it was not flowing very fast.  I walked away that night and came back the next morning and the canister was full.  Ive read other reviews on other pumps where you have to pump the whole time to get the oil to keep flowing..not with this pump.  Very easy to assemble and even easier to use. Loved it!!!!

1006	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	As stated above this thing is a piece of crap.  I took a lid off a windshield washer bottle to replace the small cap and it worked better to make it seal.  I changed my oil the other day moved the vehicle and pulled my other vehicle out of the garage and accidenty ran it over when almost full.  It actually left almost the same sized spot in the driveway as usual.  Glad it's dead.
3294	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Rain-X causes the water to form little balls on the windshield instead of flattening out. When water flattens out it acts like a lens to blur and distort your vision making it difficult to see clearly enough to drive safely. With Rain-X there is no lens effect and when you focus on distance objects the little water balls disappear. This is similar to not seeing a screen in a window unless you focus on the nearby screen. Everything looks much clearer and driving is much safer. On my car at about 45 mph the balls climb up the windshield so no wipers are necessary. Under 45 you only need intermittent wipers if at all.

2784	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I'm sure it does the trick but I do not have the patience to put this on my Ford Explorer. I tried and gave up almost immediately because I didn't know where to begin. I assume it'd be the result with all car covers, so to judge this one specifically... the material felt strong on the outside and soft on the part that goes against the car.
note: for my application i did need to remove some of the back shroud (mounting bracket) and trim two of the built-in mounting connectors, but as i said i did not install this on a boat.  the space i dealt with was crazy cramped.

  AH-HA, I found a great set of replacement clamps at a great price. I purchased the code #14-600 Goodall booster cable clamp set from Century Tool and Equipment in St. Peters, MO [phone 877-977-TOOL] [...] at the reasonable price of $12.08+$6.45 S&H. Let me tell you, these puppies will never break and they have a copper strap built in so both sided of the clamp will conduct power to your battery. These are 600 amp clamps and they come with a lug and screw to attach your cable. The lug looks pretty heave for the wire size on the charger so I might reuse the existing lug if I can drill out the rivit... nevertheless, the fix only cost me $$18.53 for both clamps and from the looks of these things I'll never have the broken clamp problem again. Good luck! BTW, I would have written a whole new review about replacing the clamps but The AMAZON system would only allow me to ammend my existing review. It's still a great charger and I wouldn't want to change my opinion in that regard anyway.
I highly recommend it.

7740	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using natural chamois cloths for years to dry off my cars, due to their high absorbency. But they are expensive, not easy to work with, and don't last very long.

4841	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Absorbs water as it says. The only issue is you can't use a true wiping action as far as a back and forth motion. It will catch on the paint and roll out of your hand because the water dries so quickly. Overall does the job as described.

Update 11/03: After having this generator for 2 seasons I would like to add that starting has been getting better. I called the factory on the inital problem and they refered me to a local servicer. I didn't bring it in though because he couldn't gaurentee free service and had a 45 day wait to get to it. I don't have to go to extremes to start it anymore but I do have to hold the throttle closed for the first 2 pulls and it will usually start within a couple more even at temps down to zero. Running Mobil one oil seems to have helped too. Overall I am happy with my purchase and haven't had any other problems in about 100 hours of use.
6653	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this to repair a leak in the tank of my water fountain. I used a wooden spatula to spread the sealant up and down all side seams and on the bottom of all four sides. Material is very sticky as it comes out of the tube. I let tank sit for 7 days before refilling. I still have a very small leak somewhere in the top inch of the tank as leak stops when water level goes past that point.  I can't see any breach of the sealant anywhere. I used entire tube and don't have anything left to reapply, but I can live with the very, very slight leak.

Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method.

Also remember that to get power thru the lighter socket into the car with the drained battery, you want to have the key switch in "Accessories" position in the dead car.  That's because you want the lighter socket to be "on" (connected to the battery), but you don't want the cars engine circuits to be on until trying to start it (since they would be draining much of the charge power coming thru if you left the key in the "on" position).  Also you do need a certain plug in the "source" car (the black plug) and the other in the "dead" car (the red plug), so I hope the reason for 1/2 of the "It doesn't work" reviews aren't from one of those items not being done correctly.

1528	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I put one of these in my 18-Wheeler and am very happy with it. I use it to charge my batteries when at a 'sure-power' station, and at home, and it provides 120volt power when not plugged in to an outlet. Having constant 120v power in my truck is fantastic, and I run a bunch of ham-radio gear (HF and VHF) off this thing as well. Although not completely pure sine-wave, there are NO 'birdies' or noise issues from any of my radios on any band, so thats great, but this thing is definitely NOT pure Sine-wave. I have a couple of laptop and cell-phone chargers that do not like the power this thing provides, and will refuse to operate when plugged into it. As far as 'Power', All i can say is 'WoW'! It definitely has no issue with providing power, and a lot of it. Microwave, computers, 1/2" drills, I have even used a big shop-vac with it. The battery conditioning cycles it does when plugged in have definitely extended the life of my truck batteries, so that is good too. I installed a 250-AMP leese-neville alternator on my truck to go with this thing, and the alternator barely gets warm when using A 900watt microwave.
9824	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I buy K&N's for my vehicles for the durability more so than any performance increases.  I'm not racing, I'm just a daily driver who wants to not have to replace an air filter EVER again.  These come PRE-OILED.  More than likely, unless you live in a very dusty environment, you'll NEVER need to clean the thing.  I read about people cleaning/oiling these things every --------miles.  NO NEED.  You're defeating one of the attributes of it...that being longevity.  Unless you can't see the mesh screening...leave it alone.  Also, IF you clean/recharge it, use the oil VERY sparingly.  For a panel filter such as this, a whopping 1.5 OUNCES is all you need.  Over oiling can lead to problems in the MAF sensor, as it lies directly downstream and can/will become coated if over-oiled causing driveability issues.

Rain-x needs to be re-applied every so often.  For me, I just re-apply every now and then after I wash the cars (which is not frequent - 6 months?).  Application is simple:  use a paper towel or a cloth, apply rain-x to the cloth/paper towel and wipe on glass surfaces.  I use the lazy method:  squirt directly onto glass surfaces, allow rain-x to run down to the base of the glass before spreading with a paper towel.  Either method works.

Update-11/25/12.  Even champs can let you down.  Based on my info. above I must have bought this in 1998 which makes it 14 years old.  I've been using this, lately, in conjunction with a 10KW generator so that I only used the Generac at night, when there was a power outage, to run the refrigerator since it better on gas.  During Sandy (no power for four days) my Generac died-engine runs great but no electricity.  I brought it into a shop and was told the stator was fried and it would cost more to repair it than it was worth-that assessment costs me $50.

I had a wipe new kit with the little buffer, and quickly scratched the holy heck out of it to where it was surely ruined, and almost impossible to see through. I went to price the screen online, but soon found I had to buy a whole cluster for several hundred bucks. Then I saw this. As soon as this arrived, I went to work, an 10 minutes later it was clean and clear as new. No scratches or splotches. An excellent product for a reasonable price!
2802	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I was expecting something a bit more substantial.  This does not block water or even dirt.  While it does protect from the tree that I have to park under I am still having to wash it.  On a positive note clean up after taking the cover off is quick with a hose and no scrubbing.


8715	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The works exactly as advertised, really good product for a good price.
Electrical connects via push-on tab connecters but I soldered (carefully) the wires directly to my tabs. You want to connect it to 12VDC coming from the "engine on" post (or wire) on the ignition switch. In my case (Tracker Bass Buggy) it was convenient to connect to the tachometer supply. (That's actually the same logically as the ignition switch; tach is energized only when the engine is on.) And the counter draws nothing unless the engine is running. (Unlike some instruments/devices which draw very little current but will drain the battery in long periods of non-use.)

I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel.  It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.

8589	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a car with a diesel engine.  Scheduled oil changes are critical to maintaining the life of the engine.  The cost of an oil change at the dealership is over $100.

1468	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've used all 20 patches in this kit, and the key is that they don't work unless you prepare the area carefully, and the hole isn't next to a 'ridge' in the tire.  Bike inner tubes have a fine ridge that usually goes down the center of the tire, which is left-over from the molding process.  This ridge can create a pocket under these glueless patches and allow air to escape, since there is no rubber glue to fill the gap. Out of the 20 patches in this kit, I think about 3 failed because the hole was so near to one of the ridges on the inner tube that I couldn't get the patch to rest flat against the tire.  Later on I realized that you can still use these patches near ridges, but you have to use the buffer tool to grind away the rubber of the ridge so it's very flat, and then the patch will hold.  I also pre-stretch the rubber a bit by applying the patch when the tube is partially inflated, and then press down hard - basically grinding the patch into the surface of the tire like someone trying to squish a bug that they absolutely hate.

This fit perfectly in the cargo are of a Kia Sportage under the privacy cover while plugged in to charge.  It also fits great on the floor of the back seat in a Nissan Altima and the power cord fit around the right side of the passenger seat to charge in the front connection.  The front passenger seat was one notch from the farthest back, but still plenty of room for the passenger as long as they don't plan to lean all the way back.  Neither of those charging ports provide power when the car isn't on, so I wasn't concerned about the battery being drained when not in use.

7844	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For a convertible in the pacific northwest, this is almost a must have. I'd rather not leave the softtop wet after pulling into the garage. My Audi A4's softtop is not exactly small, so it takes at least 2 big towels to dry the top. This product not only makes it easy and quick, it's very easy to clean too. I need something that absorbs fast without any rubbing that wears the softtop protectant faster. Plus it works for drying the car in a self car wash.
2883	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	fits well. I am only using this  as an indoor dust cover
5298	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great on wet cars.  very soft once you get it wet and soaks up a lot of water,  much more than a chamois.

8845	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS CLUB!!!! I read the bad reviews first and many said the put it on an then it was locked on and could not remove. I figure the majority reviews were good so I like the dark blue because they are hard to find. It arrived today. Took family out to Olive Garden for a night out to eat. I TRIED THE CLUB OUT FIRST!!  I extended it then unlocked it. Cool. We go inside to see people sitting on the floor and out the door a 1hr 30 min wait to eat. So we go back to the car and now on my brand new car i can't get this damn thing off!!! Tried every way possibe. Placing tension, removing tension while trying to wiggle the key. After 30 min off trying. A lock smith will run you anywhere from starting out at $100 up to$250. I had premier AAA membership and it covered a lock smith. Great! Except nearest lock smith is a hour out so total time sitting here will have been 2 hrs. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE.

When used properly, this product works better than natural chamois. It's noticeably more absorbent and easier to work with. But I stress, it needs to be used properly, like a natural chamois.

5880	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I might as well have been using water. Tried cleaning my motorcycle chain. The cycle gear stuff was way better however it also seemed way worst for the environment.

2141	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I just got this in the Dremel Cleaning/Polishing kit, intending to use the felt wheels and rouge to polish some gun parts and smooth them out. Well after about an hour of almost no progress, I looked at this little bit and said "hmmmm..." Wasn't sure exactly what it was yet, but gave it a try. Fantastic! Worked much better than the polishing compound, with less mess from compound slinging everywhere, and did a better job, faster! didn't seem to remove hardly any metal, helped smooth out minor toolmarks and general minor scratches and gave a nice even finish. I was using it on stainless, so not sure how much it will remove on softer metals...
9992	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Fits nicely in the front of one vehicle and in the back of the other.  Glad that I read other reviews so I knew that I might have to put cardboard in the sides to help maintain shape. Plastic bags from grocery store fit nicely inside. I would recommend this product.

9266	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Happy with it so far. Wife likes it. I keep one for a spare in the car in case of bad weather.
6302	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I don't deny this is a well-made product at an affordable price, and it may likely work for your purposes, but the angle of the chock is designed for a really big tire given the size of the chock.  They look downright silly on my Coleman pop-up with 13" tires.  Only about the first rung and a half of the chock actually touches the tire, so the rest is left sticking out in nowhere.  I'm left thinking a simple block cut from a 2x4 will work just as well for me. Maybe an improvement to the existing design would be to make the back half gently curved down as well, rather than a straight shot. Then users would have two options, one which could fit smaller tires better.  As is, they really are over-kill on small popup campers.  Sticking with a simple block of wood works too.  I'll be returning my chocks.
9765	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good Product
5374	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use the Absorber Chamois on my classic car, my boat, my truck and my daily driver. The latest use is for drying out my shower at home. Great product! In particular I like the ability to store the chamois in the container still damp without getting mildew. When the chamois get dirty I simply dump them in the wash machine and run through a regular wash cycle.
7527	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I haven't pulled anything with these hitch balls but I am sure everything will worl as advertised.
1096	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good, high quality.
When using this tool, the 50mm 6 sided grove has some tapered edges on the deep side of the harmonic balancer. The tool weighs a few pounds and when you place it inside the indention, it doesnt really sit flush and can fall out easily. Im not sure if other hondas/acuras have the same thing but it has a tendency to fall out when using it..If they compensated for the round edges it may have fit a little better. The tool is square making it once again not super flush with the inside of the balancer. Another idea is making it magnetic so it doesnt fall out. Otherwise it was a good tool and got the job done. Thanks

6612	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I took off two stars because of the build quality. My fan came missing 4 screws on the casing and I will have to call customer service and have them send me screws.. Quality control with all "fan-tastic" products is REALLY bad. For a fan that has MADE IN AMERICA on all sides of the box I am shocked with the condition both my RV roof fan and this endless breeze fan came to me in.
UPDATE: I thought I got all of the M17 off with a soft cloth, I was originally thrilled with M17, but now I am just angry - I don't know if the problem was the M18 or M17- I used it to take the oxidation off my convertible's window- It did a great job- I removed as much as I could with a soft rag- but then something weird happened- when it rained, some of the residue was washed off the window onto the fabric around it- wherever it touched I have white staining and white dots- they seem impossible to remove. I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.
5117	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well on my silver 350z but a little harder to dry off my black z3... Pick your battles wisely.

6922	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It was perfect for a hard wire to the existing wiring for a lighted hitch cover.
6042	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Rather than pay three times as much for a multi-step kit that can take up to an hour of work per headlight, I opted for this inexpensive and simple alternative.  Not only did it WORK on my sister's 2007 Corolla's 100,000 mile, VERY yellowed and foggy headlight covers, it worked in just FIVE MINUTES PER COVER!  And I used only 1/3rd of the 10oz bottle!  So my cost was $2 and time was ten minutes.  The covers went from under 50% light transmission to at least 90%.  With the lights on at night, standing in front of the car, you can still see a bit off fogginess, but when driving the lights work great!
Here's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.

7821	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is amazing!  I have had mmine for since early 2003 and it still works as well as the day I bought it.  I wash two vehicle about every 3 weeks or so during the spring to fall seasons and there is not a sign of wear on it.  Best way to dry your car money can buy!  If it accidentally gets dirty, I throw it in the wash and it comes out ready to go again.  You can't go wrong!

I did use a large buffing wheel because I have one, I would recommend a small foam wheel even on a drill or whatever to make it easier. I think with some effort it would work by hand if the lights were not that bad. The pad on my wheel was a medium foam pad and I used it at low speeds.

8992	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Someone stole my vintage motorcycle from my gated, "secure", fancy parking garage in Santa Monica and it was sitting right in front of my fully-restored classic car. As so, it made me paranoid that someone would steal my car too (Vintage Volkswagen Beetles can be pretty easy to break into). I bought this for a little extra security, though to be honest, if a thief wants your car, they'll find a way to steal it even with the club. That said, at least this product will slow a thief down or act as a deterrent. It's sturdy and I've had no problem putting it on or taking it off. Comes with several keys too, but don't lose them because there are no replacements for security reasons. Anyway, I'm happy with my purchase and for the price, the added peace of mind is worth it.

As is the case with any lock, a motivated thief will get past this, but as a deterrent, it is certainly satisfactory.

1929	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint. I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.

6014	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked pretty well. I can feel when the haze is polished off because my cloth has less drag. This is not an "instant" cleaner, takes some elbow grease.

I learned my lesson:  If you want something to be made well, and be reliable, purchase it from a U.S. company - who will also support the product if you do have any difficulties.

9897	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	very noticeable upgrade

3000	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have used this style before and they last a long time. Only reason why it wasn't a 5 star rating was becauce the tool came about 5 PSI out of spec. The tool I learned can be calibrated yourself fairly easily. I couldn't find a youtube video on it but the procedure is pretty strait forward you will have to disassemble the gauge portion of the tool. Just compare the readings to a known good tire gauge after each adjustment untill they read the same. The only tools I used were a medium sized and a pocket sized screw driver.  NOTE: It is probably a good idea to calibrate this at about the middle of max and min pressures.
I highly recommend this inexpensive, gem of a product!
CONS:
You are REQUIRED to use the original registration form that was included in The Club's packaging for some reason, although there is no serial number on it.

but i just use this when cold or raining
3328	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	thanks, its nice

3950	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It is a good solid lock. Some reviews are correct the the bolt hole on the main locking device is too small and will have to be drilled to a bigger size. .The hole is an 3/8"  hole that needs to be a hair larger than 1/2". There is plenty of room to drill the hole bigger if you have access to the equipment, Which I do. Once drilled the lock will sever me well.
3836	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The lock seems to be decent quality material, but the locking design is not great, and it is sloppy and loose. I put a zip tie around it to help the flopping, but it only cuts it down, it will not eliminate it.. My lock is on a boat trailer, so the rattling is far from the cab. If you put this on a spare tire on you car or jeep, it might drive you crazy.
The cons: Albeit hard to tell, the granulation of the product may slightly scratch paint. The price was a little higher than I would like it to be.

2233	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	With the blend of features and the price point of this unit, you will not find a better deal.  Assuming your looking at these reviews you probably fall in to two main groups.  1.  Someone who is having issues with their vehicle and 2.  Someone who is really into cars or working in automotive towards being a mechanic.  If you fall in the first group and just want to know why the check engine light is on, you can go to a major auto parts chain like Advance or AutoZone and they will tell you why in an attempt to sell you the parts to fix it.  No sense spending money on a scanner if thats all you want. If you want the power of knowing and not have to go out of the way then consider a pocket scan which is cheaper.  For most people you will need to subscribe to Alldata or Chiltons online, or buy a book like Autodata's diagnostic trouble codes to solve some of the problems with your vehicle.  The scanner won't do it for you or put it in laymans terms.  This scanner is more for group 2, this does the i/m readiness test for emmissions as well and is a solid entry level scanner.  If you work in the field I would suggest getting a unit with enhanced obd capability if you can afford it.
5641	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Item fits, works, and does what its supposed to. Durable, and has taken normal abuse.

Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27" x 17" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.

2477	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	While this product appears to be a quality USA manufactured item, it is in fact produced in CHINA. I personally do not feel safe using this item to pull my 9000 lb.

Second, the designers of this device capitalized on several ideas:  one, that every car has a cigarette lighter / 12V accessory port, that port is setup so hooking it up wrong is impossible, AND the fuses for these ports are almost always at 15A or more.  And since a typical car battery charger maxes out at 15 amps anyway, that's a safe and good charge rate.  It's brilliant.  Hooking it up is clean and easy.
Wet it, wring it out, and lay it on wet car and it dries completely without any spotting or danger of swirl marks. Even on my delicate paint job. I guarantee you will love this.
Electronically it's well designed, with a protective fuse in the plug.
6494	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works very good. Seal nice and tight.
8476	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For the price you can't beat it. It works great, keeps suction, easy to use, easy to drain. One tip - if you're using it on a boat with the thicker oil (I run 15w40 diesel oil) warm the motor all the way up first, when the oil is warm it suctions out a looooooooooooot faster.)
Redid my cleaning a couple of weeks ago and while they started to fog up again I believe it was mostly from daily driving in dirt and off roading some. The second time I applied the cleaner and polisher I feel like I had a better understanding of using my buffer and did a better job of protecting the canvas around the windows (the polisher will turn your canvas white if you're not careful). The good news is I still have enough cleaner and polisher for another 2 or 3 complete cleanings.
I washed mine in the washing machine and just put it damp back in the tube. Got all of the black dirt streaks off.  Looking forward to using it for a long time.
Once all the oil is out it is in spill proof contaner and easy to bring to the local tire/oil change/auto part place to recycle. I really love this tool.

2334	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you are even moderately mechanically inclined this is a very easy install and it works fantastic. Rather than using the electrical tape I would recommend purchasing some 12v T-taps  electrical fittings - they make it much easier. I gladly recommend this product to anyone interested in an inexpensive upgrade for a do-it-yourselfer.  Don't let these bad review scare you off.
I gave this 5 stars because this tools probably works well if you work in a shop.  However I'm just a DIY home mechanic and don't have an impact wrench set (yet).  This crank shaft pulley takes a lot of force to remove, especially on my van after 240K miles!  After fighting with this for an hour using the tool, I found a video online which shows how to break the nut loose simply by using a momentary crank of the engine.  You will definitely need this tool for installation and it worked great for that.  Perfect for my 2006 Honda Odyssey EX-L.
9245	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great. It puts out great heat in the car. The auto shut off is good and adjustable from 30 to 45 minutes. Keep it handy for when you pick up Al Gore hitch hiking through all this global warming. Better yet, drive right on by and use this blanket for yourself.

3868	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have a Suzuki Jimny. The spare tire is held on with 19mm round top nuts. This lock fits on with no problem but there is too much play - its loose and shakes around. By moving it you can create a large space to stick a flat head screwdriver in and pry it off. This is a deterrent, like a dummy security camera, but gives little protection.
747	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very satisfied

1633	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great for a quick car "dusting" to get the dust off and make my car look great.
The first two vehicles the lights were discolored and slightly foggy but could still see the bulb inside. They were a little yellowed. I did them twice with the wheel and they came out great, clear and great shine. Spent maybe 2 minutes each application and no more than teaspoon of the polish, so it did not take long. The last vehicle the surface was bad, could not see the bulb inside and it felt rough. I went over those maybe 6 times, I think I should have wet sanded them with 2000 grit first or maybe compound but wanted to really test this stuff. They look pretty good now and clear, can still see they are not totally smooth on the surface if you look very close. There are still scratches in the plastic and texture where it was really bad. However it is all clear far as the light getting through the lens. For the price this can't be beat, there is enough to do a lot of headlights. Also hit some plastic emblems and it shined them up nicely, the type with writing inside the clear. Maybe not recommended but it also worked great on the chrome grill of a truck.
1073	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Solid, quality product.
Now I need to get the oxidation off this used trailer we just bought. I tried regular Mcquires for cars clearcoat cleaner compound on a 3000 rpm polishing wheel. Not good enough. I ordered through Amazon McGuires RV 3 step oxidation compound, polish and wax. Fiberglass is a tougher finish then clearcoat and this Oxidation compound is designed to cut through and really remove all the garbage and oxidation built on the finish. It restored my dull slightly off white finish back to bright white and very shiny. As well as me tired, But its well worth the effort.
The charger is still charging but would not spend the additional $$$ it costs for this unit.  There are many other 3 stage chargers that would perform equally or better.

2501	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I ordered 2 of these locks. They came keyed with the same key for both, which will be nice. One lock fit perfectly on the end, the other was very difficult to get on. I figured out that the internal rubber gasket had some extra material on it, and will need to be replaced. I'm hoping the vendor will send me a replacement gasket, it just pops in and out of there. I may have to buy one at the hardware store. Overall the locks seem very nice.
1898	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I gave a five star rating because of past expierence using this product. The first California car duster I had recieved as a gift  lasted 15 yrs.

5361	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After using chamois, microfiber cloths and everything in between, I bought the absorber.  It really works.  It is almost like a magnet that draws water to it.  I use it to dry our cars after washing and now would not use anything else.
838	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits my old B&S 17 HP motor perfectly.  I have a hand me down Murray Select ride on and I was really happy to have found this part for a good price on here.

4215	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good product, spray on thin film, dries quickly, stays on very well, stops corrosion.  I will buy more when needed.
OK, Funny story, unrelated to installation, I need to come clean about my stupidity. So I get the light on and I go turn the headlights on and it works fine. A few seconds later it goes off. I go and turn the headlights off and turn them on again and the tail light goes on. Shortly after, it goes out again. I kid you not, I spent the next 5 minutes trying to figure out what I installed incorrectly, continuing to turn the headlights on and having the same results...light goes on, light goes out... (Like "The Clapper" except only "Clap On, The Clapper") Long story short... when the key is not in the ignition, the headlights automatically shut off after being on for a minute. It must be easy to install if someone as dense as I am can install it and make it work,:)
5543	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very good product, but I recommend using fine compound, it also removes the hazing on headlight. Remember it takes about 30 mins of rubbing on each headlight to see some effect. I would recommend waxing the headlight after using this product.
5560	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I was looking for. The ONLY product that shined my Saturn's dull reflective bar between taillights. I use it twice a month to maintain the shine.
Makes it easy to fill hard to reach items such as mowers UTV'S etc.
6518	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for some through hull fittings on my jon boat.  And to permanently fill some holes in the live wells (the guys before me cut speaker holes in each 40 gallon live well.  I was able to glue a .080" piece of aluminum to the inside of the live well to block the holes.  I used some duct tape to hold the plates in place while this set up, it has a surprisingly long set up time, it was still moldable even a couple hours later.  This means two things, first it's able to flow into all the little cavities if you were using it to fill a fiberglass/wood hole, second it means you have to kind of watch it if you fill a holes that vertical (like I did) because you have to go back and make sure the adhesive hasn't run out of the hole.  It's less viscous than a bathroom caulk but more viscous than a wood glue.

7864	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	No more wet dog towels to dry.  Its curious how this material seems to suck out water on contact.  It's a fast job to get a Golden Retriever damp-dry, only wringing out the absorber once.
8367	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It arrived well packaged, new and in good shape. I bought a teak bench for our shower and this oil is great for keeping the bench in a like new condition. It does the job and was cheaper than the same stuff at Home Depot.
3230	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For the price I expected a very cheap and badly made cover. Was just a temp solution to a temp problem. But was well beyond what I expected. Packaging, delivery time also well done.
9082	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The best creeper I have ever used. I have a "bone" creeper, and I like this one better. Works great and more comfortable than the full size with the high wheel houses.
5811	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	No complaints, but it could be of better quality. It gets 4 stars. Plastic gets a tad slippery when wet.
Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure.
5211	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use it on my skin when it is dry. Works good
9563	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Installed into a 2007 Ford F150 STX V8. It has been a great purchase.  I can actually feel the improved response as well as the fuel efficiency increase.  If you plan on a tune up this is a must have item.
4900	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like the Convert-A-Ball system. I have a number of trailers and three different ball sizes. Convert-A-Ball makes it very easy to adapt to all trailers. Care must be taken to have the "stud" with the hole facing front to rear and the ball installed with the pin inserted front to rear. This way the trailer prevents the pin from trying to remove itself. The vendor via Amazon was very  pleasant and professional!

827	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well with the mower
1870	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I admit that I'm somewhat anal about keeping my BMW looking pristine. Frequent detailing, washing, waxing etc to keep my garage queen looking her best. Within several hours after washing or local driving the layer of dirt starts to accumulate again. Previously I used a damp microfiber cloth to remove this. While effective it was time consuming and left water smears on the paint. The California Car Duster solved the problem. It's fast. I can wipe the entire car down in under 3 minutes. This product saves time and is worth the money. Be advised that it doesn't wash a dirty car. It maintains the paint after the car is washed. You will not be disappointed.
4507	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great charger,  very simple to install.  I used it for my 1992 K2590 diesel (dual battery) that didn't get much use to keep the batteries topped it.  Keep in mind this is a 1.5 Amp charger so it is slow, as designed.  Two complaints (doesn't change the rating as I was aware of these when I bought it) - Led indicator location and no quick disconnect on the wires to use clamps. I installed it under the hood and one of the batteries blocked the LEDs.  A second set on one of the long sides would have been nice.  The other improvement would be the quick connect to add clips for charging something else without having to remove this.

8121	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful, well crafted item for use in various applications - thanks!
It far exceeds the cheeper plastic cover it replaced. I'm very happy with it but order a reveiver lock pin to keep it from being stolen.
5319	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these for at least 5 years and it has to be hands down the best thing for taking care of my car I've ever used.  I leave it under my seat and it's perfect for when you get out of the car wash and need to dry your car off quick so you don't get water spots.  It's also great for wiping off the inside of the car, or even washing the car at home.  Seriously a great buy.

I ran the tank empty, angled the car on stand to make sure the remaining gas did not come out, then cleaned and applied Seal-All.
We also use them for keeping the dogs cool as if they weren't already cool looking.
It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.

8229	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some "give and take" where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.

6997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We purchased an old (10+ years?) Hobie Cat that had dull green/blue pontoons. Using this kit we were able to greatly improve the look of the pontoons, although it did take a bit of elbow grease. The oxidation remover, polish, and wax all worked well and the included supplies were top quality. If I were to do this again, I might look for a drill attachment to make application easier, but the kit is otherwise first rate.

8712	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use this stuff on my firearms, my kitchen knives, my car, tools, you name it! The cleaning, lubricating, and corrosion resistant formula is truly multi purpose. My only complaint is the spray cap has given me problems before. Easy fix, just replace it on the can.

This is pretty much a 4 foot wide woven "tarp" that gets wound up on a pipe on the end of the tail gate to "conveyor belt" things to your tail gate. The crank handle is just a flat bar that slides in a slot cut in the pipe (which easily falls out of the slot when you're not holding it) and has a bolt with a plastic sleeve as the actual "handle". I have a plastic bed liner where this tarp rides fine on it, but if you have a spray-in liner I'm not sure if it would work well since they are like "sandpaper" and the woven tarp would likely snag on it (see their "double mat" for use with it if you have such).
8239	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
7721	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The chamois is very soft and comes in a plastic container that keeps the chamois from drying out between uses.
The only thing I had to watch out for was that it froze my soda pop because I used it in a cool environment when it should have been switched off.  Only the things in the very bottom of the cooler froze.  Everything else was just fine.
Description not clear at all. Beware!!!
5685	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	After I using this product I found that Novus2 plastic polish performed better at a lesser cost
3684	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	price and quality cant complain
9808	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this as a 'spend to save' measure rather than any desire to increase performance.  I'll have my money back in a couple of air filter swaps.  It's very slightly noisier than the OEM paper filter, and can just be heard by the tuned ear accelerating at freeway speeds.  The truck *may* be slightly more responsive but I doubt you could measure it!
Easy to use, great keys, very smooth locking and unlocking. I definitely recommend getting this. The blue looks awesome, too.
Pros:

2090	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There is nothing worse than a stinky ash tray. This ashtray stores the butts and ashes underneath the top collection tray. This unit is made from stainless steel so it will last.
680	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't own any jumper cables and had not needed any for many years. But I do need to keep several batteries charged up when not in use and with the cables can maintain 2 sets of RV batteries at one time. Not wanting to lose much amperage while charging I decided on a 4 gauge set. A good value for the money.
7044	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good quality and does what it is advertised to do...extend the trailer plug just enough.

Here are some PROS & CONS:
2136	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice and works really well.  Was unsure about it when I purchased it but have come to depend on the net to keep everything in the pickup when we are on the move.  The Hooks and the adjustment straps are what I really appreciate the most since I am only 5 foot tall.  They are easy to access and attach to the truck with ease.

Kurt
2524	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The hook may hold 1000 lbs. although the plastic that holds it into the pocket will crack and break. When it cracks and breaks more each day eventually it is just a loose hook into your trucks pocket. I see they make a better stainless version # 05653 for $10 more and that would eliminate my issue altogether.
Very heavy duty.
9051	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you do woodworking and don't have one of these, this one works pretty good. You will use it more than you think.
5779	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great cover for trailer plug
5071	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Generally I never give a one or two stars to items on Amazon, but in this case, one or two stars is a gift.  Yes, the item will absorb as advertised, but compared to other chammies, I am not so sure. The reason for a one star is that one cant wipe or clean up with this item; it will not go over any surface with out hanging up, twisting, etc.  I bought two of them and will return the other.  Don't waste your money.
8995	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	WORKS GREAT TRUCKS STILL HERE
9002	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Heavy duty, smooth operating, attractive tool, with a luxury feel.
-----------------------------------------
It does have some good uses though, as it is just the right size to fill my motorcycle transmission oil.
5170	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great product but expensive and doesn't cover a lot of area. Should be larger bottle and a few dollars less, does a better job than Armorall.
The Fantastic Vent is used in better RV products as a ceiling vent fan. I think they took that fan design and put it in a box .

They simply do not work. You will have as much luck using scotch tape as you will with these patches. They do not stick or adhere in any way. They peel up upon any additional inflation or deflation.

3. They used a decent quality cord and 12v plug, although it could have been longer.

6905	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great when making trailer harnesses! !!!!!!
7089	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow, very powerful, not to loud.  Perfect in my Casita when it gets to warm.  So glad I purchased this fan.
5. Fits my hitch very well. I have seen other reviewers complain about it being too long for class 3 and 4 hitches. I can't figure out why they have a problem with that. There is very little side-to-side motion, which does not affect anything.
1081	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	just right
6840	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I'm getting read to box and send this sucker back.... I've had good luck in the past with this company on a previous fan ten years ago. They must be making them off shore. I hope The Donald can get these made again back here in the USA.
8574	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did exactly what I needed. I changed the oil in a boat and a Jetski and the transmission fluid in a car the first weekend.
1455	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this on sale a few years back and I found it more of a chore to use.  The plastic tip does not create a good seal on the valve stem and It usually takes me 2 sometimes 3 times to get an accurate reading.  I think this could be avoided if the tip was metal.  Also, there is no bleeder valve, so if you're tires are overinflated, you need to do more work.  I personally use the Accutire MS-4021B which I find far superior and it's way cheaper.  Strangely, it's cheaper but more ergonomic and practical as it has a nice thumb rest to help you get a better reading and it also has a rubber grip.  Personally the best gauge from experience is one of those analog ones that have a built in bleeder and have a filler chuck so you can fill the air through the unit and bleed off whatever you don't need.  Trust me it saves you a lot of time.  But if you insist on one of these digital gauges, I recommend the Accutire MS-4021B.  It's cheap, it works, and it's more practical.  I give the MS-4000 2 stars because it wastes my time and there are better products out there for less.
7678	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product. I purchased this to make a carboy cleaning brush for home brewing.  My initial concern about the 'toughness' of the material to withstand attachment to a drill are completely alleviated.  The material is also super absorbent, non-abrasive and has a nice tacky feel when wet.  Be aware that it dries hard pretty much like a natural chamois when dry.  This size is big enough to make 4 carboy cleaners.
2688	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a modest car cover. The material is single layer fabric. I appreciate that there are two big grommets on the bottom of the car cover. On a windy day, you can use these to attach a length of twine under your car. A length of cheap twine is included.

3687	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is absolutely great.  I didn't get to wax my boat last season so the two year old wax is still on there.  The picture below  was taken while putting the boat away for the winter after two years of sitting on the fresh water lake through sun and storm.
The instructions say only use in heat mode 'up to 45 minutes' if that makes a difference to anyone.
5307	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love drying my Evo X with these. They get all the water off and leave to streaks. Its a must have when detailing your car
620	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great
  I ran across this internet spot while searching for the company to order parts. The guys who gave this charger a bad rating and complained because the company won't send replacement clamps are all wet. Those clamps are riveted on to the wire and the wire is doubled and riveted to both sides of heavy copper clamp jaws so is not really practical or safe for the company to allow a user to try replacing these clamps at home. Now, if they would supply a replacement clamp which could be attached by bugging on to the wire with a screw, then maybe that would work. unfortunately, that is not in the cards so sending it back is the right approach.

688	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The air pressure gauge is a little cheesy.  Not a good quality but the rest of the kit seems to be well built
5433	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	All product made by Mequiar's are excellent and provide the results promised.  I have used this product for many years.
I feel it is well worth the couple of extra $$ for the peace of mind, knowing these cables will work safely  when I need them.
If you need to remove the crankshaft pulley, do yourself a favor, and buy this tool. I have done 2 timing belt jobs using this, and I think it's definitely worth the money.

4258	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I installed this into my '98 Jeep TJ which has been retired as a yard truck. As such it only runs very occasionally for plowing and the like. This maintains the battery during those long dormant periods without overcharging it.
6118	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This product claims to restore plastic but after 10 minutes of scrubbing one headlight cover with it and a terry cloth (as recommended), there was hardly any noticeable difference. I do some bodybuilding so strength of pressure application is not the problem! There are better products out there but I don't know if I'm allowed to mention a competitor's name lest someone think I work for them (I don't)--it's Novus' 3-step system!
866	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Don't bother with cheap aftermarket, buy Briggs oem parts.
6610	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works as advertised. I'm sure if others manufactured these fans the price would come down because they aren't worth half what they cost but it is currently fair market value. I like the fan but feel they are over priced.

152	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I've always liked Haynes Manuals in the past, but this one does not include any information about the 6 cylinder engine (H6-30) and thus is useless to me since I have the L.L. Bean Outback with the H6 engine.  I'm really shocked by the omission of an entire engine type, it is totally unforgivable and a tremendous oversight by Haynes.
I was looking for an efficient (LED) aromatherapy diffuser that could fill the (smaller) spaces I have. It does.
The key when running a new harness is to keep it all tight under the trailer and eliminate it from snagging on anything you drive over, to do this I use staples and staple it into the bottom of the wood decking on my trailer. Place some harness protector or rubber line over the harness anywhere it contacts metal to prevent it from rubbing through the insulation and grounding out to the trailer frame as well.
3029	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good quality.  I actually bought this to cover our lanai furniture.  With its large size, it covers a large sofa and two large chairs without huddling them together.  Much much cheaper than any lanai furniture cover.  Thumbs up!
I would buy this again.
9576	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good service good product
You will also need this tool to hold the crankshaft in position when you are tightening the bolt back in place.  Well worth the price, but be aware, you will need more than just this tool to do the job. I would consider this tool a must have for a single person repair shop or a serious hobbyist who does work on Honda engines.

1624	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have previously purchased three of these over 17 years. The last one was about 10 years ago.  The three I have were all identical.  I prefer the wood handled version.  The Original still comes with the same black plastic cover/case with outer pocket suitable for the mini duster if you have one.  One small difference is that the small velcro closing strap  used to be centered but is now offset to one side.  Not the end of the world but centered seemed better to me.

  However, before I reached that conclusion, I tried to replace my broken clamp and I've noticed something else to be taken into consideration here. I actually did purchase a set of replacement clamps at Auto-Zone but upon closer inspection, I would not use those. The plastic clamps on my charger really seem far superior to the metal clamps I bought because the plastic clamps have heavier teeth and the wire is attached to both sided of the copper clamp jaws. The wire can only be attached to one side of the clamp jaws on the replacement clamps I got at Auto Zone and I don't think those cheap clamps with wiring to only one side of the jaw will stand up to the 100 AMP starting mode on my charger either. By the way, that starting feature works great as well. SO, be happy with your new charger but treat it kindly with care ... it will do its job if you do your job right when using this tool, it will do its job right for you.

The seller contact, David Bernstein, cooperated in refunding his $18 (as I recall) shipping cost, but not the $32.04 UPS charge to return it. He never acknowledged that the drier is not satisfactory for use on a black car, writing, "Sorry you don't care for the product," and somewhat strangely, "I understand what you are saying but everyone takes some 'risk' buying online." His refund policy was pretty good, but I would have been happier with a more customer-friendly tone.
9330	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit well and got the job done.  We put a 1/2 drive ratchet on it, and wedged the handle against a frame member with a wood block underneath it.  Put the socket on the crank bolt with about a 3-foot cheater and the bolt broke loose without issue.  Nothing more to be said.
4. The lock mechanism can seize up from corrosion. If you end up having to cut this off your hitch, there is possibility of damaging the chrome or paint of your bumper because the cutter can and probably will slip.
So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.
The only problem with funnels is, you never know how full the chamber is,and always need to remove the funnel to look. Someone should invent a meter on the funnel, that helps in overflowing,and an end valve in case the chamber is full, to prevent it from overflowing.
8001	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is what all the pro's use. I just bought a boat that had one side completely trashed from rubbing on dock fenders for years. After wet sanding 600 and 1000 grit, this really brought out the shine. Looks like brand new.

Materials quality seems good, though that will be proven more over time than on initial impression. Quality of the reservoir material is definitely good - thick and heavy duty. The pump and seals are where I question durability.
1659	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good purchase. Cheaper then Walmart, and the same one :D
8837	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I've only had this for about a month now and it already has a leak. Not just a small leak... The tube developed a whole in it. This pump was taken care off and not abused. It was placed in a storage box when moved but still developed a whole. When it was working, there was a small back flow leak on the plunger. Also, adjusting tire air pressure by just 2-3 psi takes a while. I would invest in some thing with more quality. I thought I was saving money since I don't use the pump but a few times to make subtle tire pressure adjustments on my motorcycle tire.. I was wrong. I do not recommend

5384	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using absorbers for longer than I can remember. I never dry my car or motorcycles with anything else. They don't damage the finish, soak up tons more water than towels or other chamoise, and actually help you stay streak free when drying. This is by far the best drying tool available anywhere. Swimmers use them, car cleaners use them, any time you have liquid that needs to be picked up... this is it. You can even through them in the dishwasher or washing machine when they get dirty. One of the best inventions EVER!

Easy to use - shake, pour, spread, and buff. Does take some work and you must use an electric (or air) polisher. Admittedly I used a drill with a Velcro attachment that easily accepted the buffer pads. Do follow the instructions on the bottle. Don't worry if it seems as if there is a build up of compound. As you work through the area (no more than about 2ft x 2ft) the compound will essentially disappear and leave a glossy shine.

9188	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	For about 3 weeks my wife positively reported that it worked great.  Then she ran over a fawn.  Thankfully there was no damage to the MDX.  Maybe it just works for adult animals.  I would recommend purchasing if you have a teenage driver that drives to school.  The teenager reports that it works well.  The kids she passed in the parking lot gave her more attention than a yellow Lamborghini in Miami.  She reported no near misses with humans.

8634	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I tried doing this on a day it was pouring outside so I had run my engine for 5 minutes like it said, then gave it a few pumps until it was getting too hard, went inside for 20, came back out to see if it was done and noticed not even one whole quart had been filled in there.  After a couple of times doing this I ended up running my engine for 20 minutes, keep in mind I was only down one quart at this point and still was registering on the dipstick.  After warming up the oil that much more it made it easier but I had to pump it every couple minutes.  I think next time I'm going to do it after driving for a while.  I love how you don't have to touch any oil though, except even after trying to clear out the hose at the end, I had oil residue come out and get over the floor.

8849	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Save your money. The plastic head on this item broke off attaching to the valve stem before getting a single use. The only positive thing about this purchase was Amazon's typical excellent customer service in handling the problem. I've come to the conclusion that no one builds a decent foot powered air pump. Hey Amazon, how about having one built to decent specs and sell it under the AmazonBasics brand?
1784	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm not sure why there are bad reviews. This seems to be the real one, the quality is very high, it's strong, works perfectly on my new car, it doesn't leave residues. It's great, I don't need to wash my car as often. I just don't scrub my car with it, I lightly do a pass to remove the dust and it leaves my car shiny even if it doesn't remove actual stains. My car does look way better than when I don't use it.

No problem so far. I'll update my review, if any changes in performance of the unit.
Turned my garage into a hazmat wonderland.
I use it for pouring Lucas Gas Treatment in my truck. The end is small enough to depress the silver cap inside your gas tank the gas spout at the gas station normally does. I'd say this thing is perfect for any auto refill needs. Highly recommended.
it does tangle easily with all those plastic hooks though. I removed them and replaced them with snap rings which are more secure and greatly reduce the propensity for tangling.
Meets my expectations 100% suitable for the whole web  bien muy bien


3996	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Might be a nice product were it not for a tiny hole (3/8" ?) where at least a 1/2" hole should be so your spare tire bolt can protrude through the lock. Most spare tire racks I have seen have a long protruding bolt after the nut is applied. This product is worthless unless you have only a short (1/2" to maybe 3/4") section of bolt sticking out.
I've always had great experiences with Meguiar's cleaning products and this kit continues the tradition when the random need arises to cleanup some fiberglass.  At $35 currently for this kit (3 cleaners, 3 sponges, 3 microfiber towels) I think this is a pretty fair value and it does what it says it will - so overall I rate this product 5-stars in consideration of price/value.
In the end, my boat looks great.  I used this in sequence with the compound and marine wax from this brand.  I really feel like the compound and wax do most of the work.  The polish is only slightly beneficial, and almost not worth the effort.  My boat was in bad shape, though, so I did the whole process.
593	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	With this Buff Pad and a Buffer (Makita), I was able to take a paint job and make it look new. The Pad held up though the whole process and is still very usable on any other buffer project I may have.
9101	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This is no knock on the paste, but they put it in that old-fashioned tin which is difficult to open and close and voila! Clumsy me spills half of it on the floor. Which would have been ok if I wanted to wax the floor.

The quality of this product will likely be sticking around your garage for years to come, and be ready for your next washing project.
6204	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I could not believe the great price on the single wheel chock!  I bought 12 & bolted two each together to make them easier to be seen on the garage floor for a car stop.

9416	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Best $27 you will ever spend to remove the crank pulley.  I used it on a 2007 Acura TL.  Fits a little loose.  Use a 1/2" breaker bar.  Duct tape this to the breaker bar so it won't keep falling apart.  Put some duct tape around the edge of the socket to hold it in the crank a bit better.  Then tape the breaker bar to the lower suspension arm.  Now you can put your entire body into breaking that D*MN bolt holding the crank on.  I have a 600# and a 200# impact and both were worthless.

This one is similar in shape and design to the others I have but it weighs about 1/3 as much.  I was really surprised when I took it out of the packaging.  It doesn't look like it will break easily but there is something about it that just makes it feel kind of cheap.  That being said, I haven't used it long enough to really judge the reliability.

I find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.

The bases are heavy and the triangles fold out to size and orientation to prevent tipping over next to wind created by traffic.  The case is another matter and after opening I am unable to get the latches to catch thus the 4 stars since the case is part of what the description sells.

942	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	does the job
This new version looks the same but weighs less than half as much. My presumption is that the charge circuitry in the old version is inductive (uses transformers or coils for major funcitonality) while the new version is more capacitive (uses more caps, probably depends on switch-mode conversion). I have no qualms about the choice of technology, either can be done right or wrong.

1024	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this carrier as a last minute solution to carrying a Jerry Can on an offroad trip a few years back. It is mounted using the 4 dimpled bolt holes to my aftermarket swingout tire carrier on my SUV. It is only used on trips where I need extended range and so far it has been loaded for 4 off-road expeditions. Last weekend after returning from an off-road trip I removed the gas can and noticed the carrier had ripped apart on one side around the top bolt hole where it had been dimpled and cracked around the other top hole. This carrier is flimsy and made from thin metal, not heavy-gauge as stated and not made to stand up to off-road use. I will not be buying another but instead will fabricate my own out of some thicker steel made to last. It did work good for those 4 uses and the red finish still looks good after being outside for about 2 years.
9744	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Highly recommend. One of the first maintenance things I do on each vehicle is replace the air filter regardless of condition with a K&N
2206	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this Acton scanner 2 years ago when our older vehicle was repeatedly showing its MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp). I was able to clear the code immediately. When the MIL illuminated again later, I was able to track down the problem (O2 sensor heater trouble)and correct it by reseating the connector. Later, I used the scanner to diagnose which cylinder was misfiring. By tapping on that cylinder's fuel injector, I was able to correct the misfiring. Again, the Acton cleared the MIL display.

738	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ordered two of these to replace worn out motors in my attic. They are what they are but from my experience, expect to replace these about every 5 to 8 years if you live in the South. I've replaced mine twice within 15 years. Not knocking this motor, but the fact is, attic fans are typically useless. If I ever build another house, I won't have them installed. Gable vents and even roof top vents are usually efficient enough to allow hot air to escape the attic. And you save money in the long run. Besides, studies show that attic fans can draw cool air from your house into the attic. That's not a good thing.
The other improvement they should make it the headrest is a really nice soft excellent quality piece but it is mounted too low on the creeper. You have your head stuck between the two ends of the bone which for me is a bad angle unless you are laying directly below your work and I try not to that at all. I find myself resting my head much more on the actual wheel housing on the end of the bone propped up a slight angle while working off to the side or above/below my face.
965	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	OEM REPLACEMENT PART.

7224	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	While aH, watts, etc are important.....it really boils down to how efficient a fan is at those figures.  I have one fan that only uses .5 amps on high; however, it moves very little air, even on high.  The Fantastic Fan puts out far more air (cfm) than any fan I've ever used.  You can't compare fans simply by how much power they use.  My camper has been solar powered for 14 years and I do pay close attention to amp draw, but efficiency is critical to me.  I wouldn't even think about using battery power without a way to replenish

In case you wonder: I did not over-oil my K@N filter. In fact, I have installed it the way it came to me, and it didn't look over-oiled. Another thing: 40,000+ miles after I took K@N filter out and installed a regular high quality air filter, the MAF sensor is about as clean as it was the day I cleaned it. The blackish oily stuff was coming from/through the K&N filter.

2766	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This would be perfect if there was an extension adaptor to add to the unit base. The only issue I have is it makes it difficult to use a rear gear box or bag on my atv with this attached. An extension would solve the issue (even just 2 inches). That being said, I use a gear bag with the boottector, but accessing the pocket on the boot side is cumbersome. This is my second one, and I trust the strength and durability.

I have used the balls twice so far now, once for a local trip and once on a 1300 mile trip and they work great.

The first one I got had a voltage of around 11.2 which is mostly discharged - not good for a battery that is not deep-cell.  I attempted charging the battery, but it would never hold more than 12.5 volts: a useless battery for cranking anything.  I called amazon since the battery could not be returned.  The told me to keep it and they would send a new one.  The new one came in a few days and it was fully charged and did fine.
2681	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Really like this helmet. It fits great. I was worried about sizing issues due to other comments, but had no issues. I wear a large helmet and ordered a large. When it arrived I put it on and it fit perfectly. Not too loose not too tight, but the perfect snugness you want from a helmet. The only complaint I have is that the visor snaps aren't that great. It's difficult sometimes to get them lined up and when you think it is snapped securely it's not, but when you do get them snapped properly it stays on just fine.
Install it on June 4, 2015. It was working great during the summer. My attic gets very hot and the motor seems to be on constantly. Then this year, May 18, 2016, I went up to my attic and it was hot, over 95 degree. I set my thermostat to 90 and it wasn't working. Checked the current and it was getting electricity. Motor died. Call CSH Inc. who was the seller through Amazon. They were very nice and explained that I had to go through Amazon for the 1year warranty even though they were the seller since I bought it through Amazon Prime. CSH said to call them back if Amazon didn't help and they would help me. Amazon said they don't do warranty but would take it back with a 15% restocking fee. Amazon said I could call the manufacturer for the warranty. So I called Lomanco and they honored the warranty with no problem. They asked for the model #, manufacturing date which is in the motor but I didn't know it - I give them the date on the box and when I bought. They sent me a new replacement one. I didn't have to send back the defective one. I received it in 5 days, call Monday received it Saturday. Excellent customer service, excellent warranty. I hope the new motor lasts a lot longer than a year.

1032	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use these in my garage.  I placed them on the floor so I cross over them as I pull the car towards the front of the garage. They serve as a gauge as to how far I can go into the garage before I need to stop the car.
I used this to wipe my car dry and it really works well.  Throw away all of your $10 for 25 towels - just buy this.  It will take about 2-3 mins to get used to it, you have to just lay it on the surface let it suck all the water and then squeeze the water out of it.  Repeat.
I also " as Reviewer George C writes " had cheap jumper cables literally melt when using them, it is not unusual for cheap bargain basement cables to do this. It's a scary and dangerous situation when this happens, particularly  when battery acid is in the mix.

8541	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome tool for DIY oil changes. A lot of new cars I've seen have a "crush washer" on the oil drain plug that needs to be replaced if you undo them. They aren't expensive, but I'd forget to pick them up sometimes. That meant holding off doing the oil change and wait to get some, or risk a leak and re-use the old one. But using this means no need to undo the drain plug. Plus it's just easier, and cleaner. I'd still recommend the occasional regular procedure - especially if your drain plug has a magnet on it to look for metal shavings.

6108	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect, as advertised and works excellent.
8153	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	At any point in time I have 4-6 of these in rotation. I use them in my business to secure items to one wall or another in my work van daily. Soooo why only 2 stars? Well... The ratchet itself holds up, it's the bar with notches that ends up giving up the ghost. The holes wear out from daily use or the small piece of metal between each hole bends ever so slightly and the trouble starts. It will begin to be VERY hard to unlock. Once they wear a bit more it will start skipping gears. Why do I keep buying them? I'm stuck... This allows for minor adjustments in pressure unlike others I've tried. I'll keep buying them but only because I haven't found better.

How much air is "That Much Air?". I placed the fan four feet from my face on an 85F day at 30% humidity. On low I felt the fan on my face, but at that temp I switched to medium and liked that amount of airflow substantially better. The high setting surely didn't blow my hair straight back, but then again my hair is a quarter inch in length.

1500	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have two of these. I brought one down to Costa Rica to deal with the unexpected power outages that happen on a semi regular basis. I connected two 12v - 100 amp hour deep cycle batteries. This will run a few lights, my electronics, wifi, computer, music and short use of tools for a day or more (maybe longer). I would leave equipment with higher amp draws (like the refrigerator, pumps, washer, dryer, air conditioner) off the same power out electrical line or expand the battery bank for some mid amperage use.  When set to operate automatically and grid electricity goes off, this inverter takes over and supplies the 110 volts of electricity from the batteries via its' inverter without one noticing what happened. This unit will also switches to battery inverter mode when grid voltage drops low or spikes high. The batteries are automatically recharged when the grid electricity comes back on.  Likely best deal on the market.  I believe Tripp Lite knows what they are doing when I study their line of products. They also make auto power supplies for medical use. 2014 Update: My Tripp Lite APS750 has been working flawlessly for 6 years in a humid beach climate. A Plus for burglar alarms or security cams: This APS works 24/7 as long as your batteries do.  This unit does cut off when battery voltage gets too low to protect your batteries from early death via excessive discharge.

8801	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good quality, very sturdy and made in USA !!!!!!
2377	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was very reluctant to purchase this product. I read every bad  review and some good reviews, but I went ahead anyway and installed this unit into my 08' dodge Dakota. along with a dball2 interface. Yes it was a lot off work, but worth it.....I do not have to go outside to start my truck up in foul weather.....awesome. Bulldog technicians are very good, and know what they are talking about. I would advise though if you do not know anything about electronics do not attempt this install, but if you have any knowledge, basic knowledge would work. ....it is well worth it.
8008	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used the Imperial Compound to restore a 17' fiberglass boat.  It had scum line stains as well as the white fiberglass was dingy looking and oxidized.

1701	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It works.  When you want to admire the mirror finish of your recently waxed car, and a thin layer of ambient dust has settled on it, this product takes off the dust without scratching.  Contrary to the description, it does not do the job in one swipe.  It takes two swipes.  Also, if your car is actually dirty, like it's been rained on, leave the duster in its bag and wash your car properly.  It's not going to wash your car for you.  No issues with red lint or streaks as reported by some reviewers.  Very happy customer.
1717	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Hey! Original wooden handle. Works fine
8977	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Really nice lock. Simple, easy, straight-forward to use. The keys remind me of trypophobia though...
But until then, this funnel will do just fine!
316	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The photos in this manual are the poorest I've ever seen with fuzzy gray on gray images that don't show much detail. There isn't much technical detail either and the wiring diagrams are hopelessly incomplete. It's not bad as a starter manual but you couldn't use it for any complicated repairs.

3026	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The quality on this piece is great.  I'm very pleased.  I purchased this and a lock on air chuck in order to create a remote tire inflation device for airing up split rim wheels for the first time.
5429	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After reading some complaints about the mount not being welded on straight, I was a little concerned but the one I received was fine.  It looked good and also came with a small plastic wedge so that it does not vibrate when driving.  It also has adjustable holes so you can mount it closer or further from the vehicle.
522	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	the battery was exactly as described and fit into the car as expected. the price was great and the battery holds the charge for a long time, even sitting idle.


730	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Fit perfectly and was almost and exact replacement motor.  I should have got the 4 amp motor but this one seems to do the job.
6467	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very good stuff - strong and a great water seal.  It's what the pros use.  Only thing is, it takes forever to fully cure (5-7 days), so don't rush things if you're using it for an underwater application.  The good news is that 3M makes a fast cure version (in white only) that cures in 24 hours - IF the thickness / depth is 3mm or less.  But even that can take 5-7 days if you lay it on thick.  Small price to pay for a great product.
7154	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	long thats good
1677	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This duster has cut our car washing by 67%.  By dusting often in between washings we can go without a wash for months at a time.

4859	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have an older absorber that I was looking to replace.  The new one doesn't seem to soak up water like the old on did when it was new.
To insert, used a small amount lubricating jelly. It helped to slightly open the gaps (on either side of the ball joint with a flat head screwdriver) then push down I.Trek suction arm with ball into the mirror ball joint. It's not a 100% perfect fix (as ball is slightly larger than CIPA ball) but should work.
1735	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	leaves residue, does remove dust well. BUT WHATS WITH THE WAXY RESIDUE!?

Pros:
3256	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Easy on,  easy off. Works like a charm.
2375	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very easy install. Clear directions works great

2919	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this a long with Meguiar's M17 to clear up some scratched and foggy Jeep Wrangler windows of mine. It did a great job coupled with the Craftsman random orbit buffer I bought locally. Not only did it reduce the appearance of smaller scratches it nearly cleared up the fog left by other cleaning products and from natural weathering of the clear plastic. I feel that after a few more applications that it will more than likely return my windows to a near new state.
9925	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just right to save the paint on my wife's Cadillac! Easy to install. Helps us prevent arguments and frayed nerves.
Comes with a nice storage pouch.  Bright colored.  Seems water to be tight.  Good venting in back + wide wrist cuffs = good venting.
5757	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Includes both male and female cap covers. Great buy easy fit, and snug fit.
* Easy to clean after use
Good value.
9538	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far so good in my Mustang GT.  Did not buy it for any potential MPG or power gain.  It was simple math.  Two throw away replacement filters cost the same as this one so in 60,000 miles it will have paid for itself (minus the cleaning kit).  Seems like a good deal to me.
7017	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My boyfriend loves this marine fiberglass restoration kit.  He said this brand is high quality and works well.  He also said it is hard to find these products specifically for the boat and when he does it is a very small bottle and very expensive.  He loves the size of these bottles, that they all come in a kit and the price is not to bad.  He said these products work well and he would buy this again.
3790	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This item was recommend to go with a specific spare tire carrier. Well, once they came in, it's glaringly obvious that this item, does not fit on that carrier. The "exit" hole for the bolt (what will stick out above the nut), is far too small, and will never work on any size tire carrier that I've ever used or seen. The only way this item will work at all, is if the nut ends up on the very end of the bolt, and unless you have a hard mounted mount with specific length all-thread welded on, then this will not work without taking it to the drill press. And if you're going to do that, may as well drill a hole in the bolt itself and throw a regular lock on it.
3502	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As described  8-)
8639	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have the PELA 6000, which is exactly the same thing as this unit. I bought it a year ago off Amazon (my favorite store) just after I bought my used BMW 325ci. I read the reviews and simply took a chance. This thing has totally transformed what was an ugly, messy, and somewhat dangerous procedure, and transformed it into a fun project that takes less time than crawling under the car and fooling with a drain plug and unbelievably messy catch basin. You can do this in your street clothes, but do wear rubber gloves. You need to change oil while the engine is hot so the oil will flow quickly. The black dipstick tube is heat resistant and will not collapse from the heat. Keep in mind that the vacuum is not sufficient to pull cold oil out of the engine, so, only use this if the engine is hot.
9240	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for the cold days, I use it because my husband like it cooler then I do in the car, this keeps me nice and warm even when off
4811	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works and waxes..not much to say.

5856	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Is what it is
8802	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	We haven't had much snow in this area for years but this year was different. We were slammed with snow all winter and I needed a long scraper/show broom to clean my SUV. I am rather short so this item world perfectly. Amd it is strong enough that I can really apply pressure to break the ice and to remove the snow.
Update:
9888	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice, perfect fit, seems to hold any dirt without any problems, and stays in place.  Very pleased with the liners.
I couldn't imagine not having one after 25 years with it.  I bought two replacements just incase they quit making them.  They should last long enough to see me through my life.
4058	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great OEM plugs for the VTX.
7699	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased my "Absorber" in 1998, and have used it several hundreds of times over the 15 years or so. I've also washed it about a dozen times in the washing machine with washing detergent, but definitely wouldn't think putting it in a dryer is a very good idea. Mostly because, you want it to stay moist/wet, always. Works as good as when I first purchased it, and the condition of the skin has not changed. Remarkable material. Mimicks a real chamois in feel and absorbency. Can't imagine another product of this type being better.
9959	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought the smaller one and the fit is just right for me. For it's intended purpose I believe it'll do just fine. It's not junky and it really does stay put. I left off a star only because of the lid when closed needs a little adjust to "square it up"
3685	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ALWAYS WORKS GREAT ON MY BLUE HULL SEA RAY
701	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect replacement for a 25 years old Certain Teed attic fan. Seems well built and of good quality. ##In my case, removing the fan blade was a pain in the neck. I had to take the motor apart to expose the opposite side of the shaft. If I had to do it again, I would have bought a new fan blade. Hopefully it will last a long time.
6871	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Follow the instructions and watch how well this thing works.

6461	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I am impressed with how much water this soaks up. I bought it to use on my truck, but it is hard to wipe and dry with this thing, as it just adheres to the surface you are drying. There is probably some secret to doing it, but I am not versed in it... I will likely use it as a cooling rag in the summer.
8513	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I am not super happy with this purchase.  I have to pump it a lot to evacuate the crankcase of 5 quarts of oil.  I've used these type of products in the past and they haven't been so slow to suck out the oil.  Not real happy with the product.
2192	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We had a full size Coleman electric cooler, but thought a smaller size cooler would be better for our planned road trip.  We purchased the Koolatron P20 18 quart cooler. We just returned from our 5 week trip, and are pleased with the cooler, which ran the entire time.  It fits nicely behind the front seat of our car, and the sound is not bothersome. The size and well-designed handle makes it very easy to carry into the motel room at night. The top opening lid is handy to reach into from the front seat of the car.  We like the fact it is made in North America (Canada).  It did run for up to 4 hours when we were away from the car and the car still started, but we forgot to unplug it one night, and it did totally run down the battery.
But the cables did the job. Make sure to get a storage bag for them though.
WOULD NEVER DRIVE A CAR IN THE RAIN AGAIN WITHOUT IT
4708	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Big fan of this little device. My wife's 2006 Range Rover tends to lose its battery if the weather drops below freezing overnight. This device won't bring our battery back from the dead, but it will keep it alive if I plug it in before retiring for the evening. Super satisfied with this little problem-solver.


8866	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is good & easy to lock. Material used for making the lock overall seems to be of good quality.
The plastic is thick and well made and built to last.
9469	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This worked exactly how it was supposed to. Nothing really else to say about them. I would recommend this to anyone trying to remove a crank pulley. DO NOT attempt to take the pulley off without this though. I had a friend break his crank pulley in half trying to get it off without this tool.
5691	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Work well.
6083	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After reading some of the negative reviews I think I understand what the problem is. If you purchased the product from Amazon you didn't have the benefit of reading the back label. The back label indicates which product to use for various oxidation levels.
5855	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect
6754	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works as expected. a must have if you wash your own car.
9698	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using K & N  air filters on all my race cars, muscle cars , pickups etc, great products,I instantly noticed the improved performance on my 2004 chevy, which has aftermarket flowmaster exhaust,

4660	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	leaves streaked on glass. ok on paint but you will find re-doing your car windows :(
2630	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great bag for the price.  I needed a bag to throw me helmet, gloves, and tape in and this filled the bill perfectly.  Only 4 stars because this is a no frills bag - the handles, zipper, and lining are its only features.
I do wish it had some storage for tools like my older creeper does but due to it being molded one piece that may be difficult to add.
The wool pad is important as a component of the 3M "system" Wool pads cut fast. Be sure to use a pad spur to keep the pad from loading up and marring the finish you are trying to produce. When you first start to use the product, you don's think anything is happening, but as the pad and compound continue to work, the abrasive in the compound changes and then the surface gets shiny and glossy.  You will not need anything other than some wax on a white or light colored boat after you finish with the Imperial Compound.  The bottle I received says " Marine Compound" but is the same formulation.  3M just changed the name.  This product seems expensive, but the results on a boat are well worth the finished product and the time saved.
7818	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I do not know how this thing works or where it puts all the water, but it works. I dried my infiniti QX56 in about 10 minutes with this thing and only wrung it out twice, unbelievable!
6520	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff will glue most anything & has tremendous adhesion to anything I have used it for. I frequently use both black & white for several jobs. Last week I fixed a favorite sandal of my wife's where the sole had separated from the upper. It now seems very solid as when new. The craziest "fix" was glueing a 2 inch galvanized pipe to a large rock for our street signs (it kept jiggling in the soft earth). That was 4 years ago & still holding tight. The only downsides; it is quite slow to set up (2 days minimum) and it is a bit tough to get off your hand. I almost always do & find that citrus hand cleaner is best for removal.

3115	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Doesn't fit a 2007 Grand Prix GT...need to work on your fitment software.  I think it will fit my son's Z/28 and I can use his cover that was too big last winter, otherwise it will be returned.

1995	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great on the interior of the car.  Greats in the cracks and small places.
Continuous power rating is 1350W, not 1500W.  Most units have 3x17Ah=51Ah, not 3x21Ah=63Ah capacity.  Loads approaching the rating will deplete the batteries in a matter of minutes, not hours--better read up on this one at Xantrex's website before getting soaked for $400 thinking you can, e.g., run a normal fridge for hours during a blackout--you can't, and you'll need a "noisy generator" anyway to recharge this unit and run other loads.
6000	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	They keep the contacts clean and lubricated however they are both the same and not a matched pair for vehicle and trailer.

I wasn't so sure about purchasing a suction cup mirror but I didn't want to make holes or clamp one on my windshield frame either. I Google'd several times and kept coming up with this same product. I'm very pleased with it. Our used 2006 Yamaha SX210 didn't come with a mirror. I wanted to see behind the boat so I could keep an eye on those I'm towing in tubes or the wakeboard. It's also nice to see if there are any other boats closing in from behind.
8902	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great
8851	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quality sprayer

If you're willing to put a little elbow grease into polishing your so so headlights, use this!
5158	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a black car so i need to dry it to avoid spots.  this works great.  holds a lot of water and takes me few min to dry whole car.
8585	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Used this on my BMW and I am now able to do a full oil change without ever needing to go under the car thanks to this device!
5968	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	this stuff is the best for cleaning/polishing headlights are aren't too bad...this will maintain your headlights looking new...not for restoring cloudy ones

174	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I had high hopes for this wanted a good manual for my used jeep 2000 SE (TJ) and couldn't find one just for that.  This manual has very poor photo's lacks a lot of detail a shade tree mechanic needs.  If you are very experienced mechanic this would be a 4 star (maybe).
6524	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product at a great price.  worked with no issues
-Be careful when using the long flexible tube. Mine unscrewed halfway during use. But, I realized it was probably mostly because I kept twisting the hose around. Also, it easily screwed back in and can probably be held in place with a little duct/electrical tape.
7268	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	woks great
830	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent quality of part and fast delivery
1955	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is PERFECT in the car. I literally never bothered cleaning my car because it was such a pain in the butt getting to al the parts when your driving or sitting at a drive through. Use this and Boom- stop light=clean car!  I'm more regular cleaning my car with this than some people are who use Metamucil!
2754	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great cover

1888	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an absolute must if you're not in to washing your car every few days! It pulls dust off like some sort of black magic. -I'm convinced that it's made by wizards.
8644	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The service manager at the VW dealership recommended an oil extractor for our diesel Jetta. Since the oil filter is on top in the engine compartment, I don't have to drive it on ramps, get under the car, remove the sound pan, etc. Makes for a much cleaner and easier job of changing oil. I've used it on other vehicles too, but still have to get underneath for the filter. Handy for changing oil in lawn equipment and removing oil or fluids from anything that doesn't have a drain. Overfill an engine with oil? Not a problem, the oil extractor will take out just the right amount. It is all plastic, but seems very durable. The Amazon price was right - $12 to $15 less than I found at other vendors.
1673	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Followed the instructions and let it sit in newspaper for a few days.  It does a great job dusting off my new Challenger Scat Pack.
579	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good stuff
Delighted with this purchase.
1276	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've had this a little while, but it didn't really hold up. No longer pulls the rivets.

3903	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	What can I say negative about this, It did not have any holes in it other than the one it needs to have.
1552	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Worked as required, it's bracket mounts weren't perfectly seated so some filing with a rounded file was needed to make it fit in my 2003 Honda Civic.
8867	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good bike pump. I haven't had any problems with it. Seems high quality.
It can handle both wet & dry dirt.

9278	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	fits nice !
After a proper rain x treatment, the water stays beaded up, NOT blocking your vision. Doesnt matter how hard its raining, YOU CAN STILL SEE!  Glass needs treatment, especially old cars with old glass.

204	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As expected.
1245	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product! this thing will last a lifetime and it's well worth the money
Update 9/08 Generator runs great after around 600+ hours. Starts without fuss now in 2 pulls even after sitting all winter. This is the Generac motor not B&S that I see on some new models. Runs perfect and no oil consumption. Did 2 oil changes otherwise 0 maintenance.

Will bond nearly everything.  I've bonded marine hardware to boats.  Great for stuff like cleats that have strain placed on them & a low likely hood you will ever need to remove it later.  Used to glue tiles to stair risers in my former house.  Good luck changing THOSE tiles new homeowner!  Ive injected it between metal panels to prevent squeaking & better form a seal.  Lots of uses!
7472	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have 3 of these already.  one in each car and RV.  This one is larger than most.  Really works great.  Take care to $3.00 car wash, wipe down with this chamois and good to go.  Just like a professional.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes to do a good job easy and inexpensively.

3157	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
3460	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Used it to put oil into my motorcycle, at job at which this funnel excelled thanks to its extra long "nozzle", as it didn't require me to hold the funnel in place while doing so. Also used it to pour kerosene into a spray once, and the funnel didn't seem affected. Very easy to clean, just ran down water through it, although I wouldn't use it for the kitchen now. It can also be used to improve your audition, by amplifying noises around you or used as a horn.




8055	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm old and short!  Stuff was always sliding up to the front of my truck bed just out of reach.  This keeps those must haves (my step stool for one) close to the tailgate where I can easily access them!  Takes a little learning, but I'm not too good with ratchet straps either.  Got it figured out pretty quick
1142	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This pad is great. I would recommend this pad to any one who wants a shiny car with little effort. The pad does it all

6268	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Well I am glad these guys don't sell shoes, because you would only get one shoe, which would work about as good as one wheel chock. Come on, I've never seen these being sold that we're in pairs, thus my disappointment in receiving only one...I guess I can put it under my one wheel trailer......

The item arrived in one piece, lid attached.  It's a nice size and looks like it will last a while. His covered deck keeps it from getting soaked during a rainstorm, which is a good thing.  Wet cigarette remains smell awful and I don't think that this ashtray will keep out water.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  This seems like a real value to me.

It even says "this Chapter contains only those procedures related to general diagnosis, routine maintenance, adjustment and removal and installation." The book is only slightly more useful than the vehicles Owners Manual.
To start, I purchased this product with my own money. I believe a company's customer service and confidence in their product is essential to any purchase, big or small. Hotor is one company that deserves the "Amazon's Choice" banner that it currently has for this product. Reach out to them directly before leaving a negative review--I'm sure they'll do their best to make you a happy customer. I mean their contact information is directly on the box itself!

4362	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	ok
7984	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought as a direct replacement for a gauge I ruined by running the outboard with no battery.  The engine has no voltage regulator and the the voltage went quite high and burned out the meter.  The gauge is comes with all the hardware for installation and the backlight works well but it's accuracy is a bit lacking.  Using a volt/ohm meter (fluke 85) on the back of the gauge shows the gauge reads about 1/2 volt low.  Not a big deal as it's more for telling me the battery is charging than the state of charge but disappointing none the less.  Construction is a bit "economical" so time will tell if it will hold up but I would expect to only get a few years out of it.

Other notes, the lighter socket plug and wire is anything but bottom drawer. The plug has it's own tiny LED to let you know the socket may be playing possum and not the fan, and the power cord is substantial as well.
The red and dark blue on my 27 year old Powerquest looks amazing and I get told the boat looks only a couple years old.
Its not the product at fault, more likely the people doing the install. Be careful and you shouldn't have any issues. It is less messy than glue on patches and work just as well. I use these on my 700x23c road tubes at 130 psi, so they definitely hold up fine.

Note - The description says 16oz but what I got was 10oz cans.  So the 5 star rating is for the product, NOT the description!!!
Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.

1384	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this along with the 7424 thinking it was OEM and a proper accessory.  But I just thew them away once I got one of those Velcro backing plates.  Using an aftermarket Velcro backing plate opens up so many different options.  I just can't see myself buying bonnets and using this foam disc anymore.  I'm not even sure why one is included with the buffer.  Why not include a Velcro backing plate instead?  I bought 2 of them not knowing it would come with one also.  All 3 went right into the garbage can upon getting the Velcro plate.  Sry to repeat that so much...  cheers.
3043	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product, like many people have experienced, is very well made, and great to have around, and many are working at 30 years of age. I have no real complaints about the quality of this product for my primary use, which is speedily checking the pressure and airing up the tires for my trucks, trailers, daily drivers.  The only flaw with my gauge, which doesn't bother me, is it tends to read about three pounds high, which I just started mentally compensating for.  For stuff I am concerned with getting very accurate, or low pressure readings, (motorcycle, ATV, drag slicks, high performance radials) I still use a quality gauge to check the pressures anyway.

Pros;
2174	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After reading a lot of reviews - good and bad - for this cooler, I ordered one. This one replaces a much smaller 9 can cooler (different brand). First of all, it is very quiet. Above road noise, the radio, and the cabin fan, I can't hear it at all. Koolatron may have gotten some bad fans - a lot of people complain about noise - this one is infinitely quieter than the smaller cooler. This cooler would benefit from a gasket for the lid (which I'll probably add). The only thing that is slightly off is the interior fan shroud - it does not fit well, and I'm not sure if I can straighten it or not. There is a bit of a gap all down the right side - which means that some of the air is not moving across the cold plate. I think our friends to the north could do a bit better. Other than that, this cooler is great. Plenty of room, and cooled down to 40 degrees in about 40 minutes - in the car. I'm going to try an inverter and 120 volt adapter to see if that's any better or different than the 12 volt plug in. Unlike the much smaller coolers, this one has an interior fan to distribute the cold air - which means you can't totally pack it full - the air needs to circulate. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.
9086	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use this on the farm and at times have had to use it outside of shop to roll under combine. It will roll on hard packed stone as you pull yourself along. I Love it.

4654	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought two of these and like the way they perform.  They seem to absorb a large amount of water before they start to leave streaks behind.  I would have given them 5 stars except when you get them out after being stored damp (as the instructions tell you to do) they have a mildew smell.  I started putting them back in the clear tube case and leaving the top off until they dry completely.
2522	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I had a set of these on my previous truck and after buying a new Denali I had to purchase a few new sets.  Easy install with just a screwdriver.  Sleek look on the top rail and a great design.  Highly recommend.
Well it does work well.  I used this originally to put a transom mount plate for depth finders on the back of one of my boats and it worked great except for the grueling cure time.  I also used it to mount a composite plastic transom motor mount plate on my 12ft boat and it worked great.
i will never buy another brand again. soaked up the water in seconds.
6705	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	3m makes the best marine/rv sealant. 5200 is the non removable / very difficult to remove kind. If you may want to remove it later use 4200. The regular 5200 takes 7 days to cure. If you need it to cure faster get the 5200 fast cure. I have used both and will be buying the fast cure exclusively in the future.

8126	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great and it's designd well.  No complaints what so ever.
Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water.  Need at least a second try.  I detailed the clean with a nice towel "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight.  They work as advertised and am impressed with the results. Easy to use and no streaks.

Applied coverage will remain tacky to the touch with a slight gold or tan tint color. No odor soon after application but does have a smell while spraying  not really all that bad to me.

3343	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you are in an area that has freak rainstorms that come down like cats and dogs, you may want this. I've used Rain-X before and totally forgot about it because I was living in an area that doesn't rain often. Now I'm in an area that pours rain and I park my vehicle outside. This helps with the visibility while driving in those rain storms and reduces that fun morning dew that develops on your windows. What I found helps me when using this is using a microfiber cloth to clean the window and dry. When dried I use a different microfiber cloth to apply the liquid to the windows and then when it's dried I use the other side of the first microfiber cloth to shine up the window. I go this route as I heard from others that this isn't good for your paint job or the plastic or something... I'd rather not make an expensive mistake and drip on the wrong stuff. I haven't used this on the interior of my car windows so I'm not sure if that would help with the interior condensation and won't try. I'll just use my microfiber cloth to wipe that down before driving. Happy shopping!

It is ergonomically designed; fits well in your hand and it is not bulky. It does not hinder with your work when you carry it. It is mechanically sound and the thin profile, long and flexible spout is a huge plus. Made in USA. Recommended!
I don't now what the manufacture is doing wrong, but the red coating is sticky like glue!

I tried everything I had in the house.  Nothing would take it off.  I used a powdered cleanser that did nothing.  I tried a clay product that usually works on most anything and it may have faded the stain a little bit.  Then on to a scrubbie.  Nothing again.  That is when I started my search for a new cleaner.  I came across this and decided to try it.  I was blown away.  Squirt on a little green stuff and scrub with some pressure with a dry microfiber towel.  Then polish with another clean cloth.  The stain was gone.  It left the surface of the tub ultra smooth and glossy.  I am going to do the entire tub now.

6112	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good product at a good price.  I've used these for years and they do their job.  Their advantage is their light weight.
  All in all these Porter Cable pads, with their tight yet silky smooth nap, fill a niche for polishing that is very helpful. Hope this helps.
8580	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this specifically to change the oil in my John Deere tractor.  The drain plug on the tractor is fiddly and I usually end up getting oil all over the frame and axle when I use the drain plug.  Using this extractor is so much easier!  Pop the dipstick out, put this tube down the dipstick hole, and pump up the extractor about 10-15 times.  I had to pump it up again about 5 minutes later to get the rest of the oil out.  It made changing the oil in my tractor so much easier.

1691	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I am so pleased with this product. I needed something to dust off the top of my kitchen cabinets and tops of doors and high window sills. I have read elsewhere that you may want to rest the mop head laying on a newspaper overnight before you use it - to remove the 'excess wax'. I didn't do that and used it as is. I didn't mind having some wax on the wood. It flips a bit too easily if you are trying to dust at some angles but with a little finesse this is easily overcome.
1315	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Not much to say, I removed the old battery, installed the new battery, plugged the unit to the wall for a couple of hours, then moved it back to the location where the PC was to put a real load on it. My power is so stable here I only need a few seconds of UPS time to live through the average brownout/blackout.
9854	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	K&N will always be better than a stock filter.  I did notice a little better pickup and mileage but not a huge difference.  I put the filter in my 08 silverado 4.3l v6.

It has a thick rubber spongy feel. It absorbs alot of water off the car.  I was also impressed that it doesn't get all deformed and stretched out when wringing it out.
If its true, then go amazon!
5188	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	GOOD STUFF. DOES NOT STAY SLIMY.
5296	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a good chamois and sucks up a lot of water.  I wish it did take the smaller beads of water better.  Great for a first pass to get the larger amounts of water.
7464	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	bought this for a utility trailer i am  building  and it is what i was looking for. 25 feet of 4 color trailer wire good price. what more can i say

***** END OF UPDATE *****
1363	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have an old creeper from a local auto store that I've been wanting to replace for years.  Unfortunately, with my 30-year old exposed aggregate driveway I need large wheels to not get hung up on large rocks or deep holes.
Want a good heated blanket? Keep looking, this ain't it.
7203	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	"Endless Noise"  is the better description.  For the outrageous price, I had hoped for at least some air flow.  It looked like the best out there but am disappointed at this point.  Yet to use it in a camping situation yet.  Will try it then, just hoping its worth it.  Then again, I was warned.
A drawstring waist and jacket bottom
2530	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I'll start with the pros... this net is fairly well constructed, with nice heavy duty bungees.  The adjustable hooks are a pretty cool feature too.
1198	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Clean elbow grease for my Chevy
So far we have used this cooler for about 60 or 70 hours of drive time and it has worked perfectly. Today I pulled it out and found that it STOPPED WORKING!! It would heat up but the cooling fan did not turn. Boy was I furious, as we have barely used this only a couple of times. I started looking into the warranty, and then the engineer/mechanic in me said take it apart and see if it can be repaired. So that's what I did.
2860	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have two of these and use them on both of my tanks to gas and diesel on a 13 gpm Fill-Rite pump. I live in an area where we to get H2O in our fuel. These filter system save me a lot of headaches on all of my equipment and Boilers. Using the water blocker filter is the way to go. If any water reaches the filter nothing will go through. Recommend stripping the bottom of your tanks once every three months. With this system you should have no more issues of Water getting to your injectors. I would also recommend putting anti-seize on the threads of the bowl to keep it seizing up in the head.
2490	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This locking pin does exactly what it's supposed to.  It's a little tricky to get it locked the first time because it doesn't self lock when you insert the pin into the locking end; you need to lock it with the key.  The rusting of the pin inside the locking end concerns me a little, but we have a short tow season here, so it will only be in use for probably no more than 6 months at a time (I bought a locking pin basically so I can leave the ball mount installed).  Those that would install it and forget it may want to rethink that plan.  It may not fit all receivers (as evidenced by the reviews), but it fit mine, with a with little to spare.  2014 Nissan Frontier equipped from the factory with class IV 2" receiver.
9817	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	awesome
7731	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Much better than expected after reading some other reviews. I would not use the to secure a large boat, but used as described, I believe these are more than adequate.
7427	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ended up not needing but I would order again!
3507	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We use this when we'll be on the road (more than 250 miles). We go to Maine every year from Florida and I do most of the driving at night when a cleaner windshield is nice to have. I mix it with distilled water and their 2 in 1 glass cleaner. While on the interstate I rarely need the windshield wipers if I clean the windshield well before heading out.
670	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a "jump" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.
9896	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	You never really know if you are getting anything from these air filters but the kid in me likes to think that they give a little something to the truck.  I have not noticed anything in fuel or power but it is a quality looking filter and never having to replace it makes for a good investment.
9611	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit my 2004 Yukon very well.  I had to take the wheels off to make a good installation.
In retrospect, these matching On-Off switches would have been the best choice in the first place as, when I got them in, they look great, work well, and feel like they are made with excellent quality. Further, the very long shaft will allow clean installation in VERY thick panels if need be.

1586	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works great.  I was a little concerned about it slipping.  Before placing it on the garage floor, I made sure to clean the area so there wouldn't be dust or sand that could help it slip.  So far, no problem at all.
8448	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works great. Perfect for small engines. First one lasted about 8 years and lost vaccum, company was no help so I had to order another one. If they had helped I would have rated it 5 stars.
5498	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Three screw, quick installation.  9" paper plates fit perfectly.  Good product, good price

I would recommend to family & friends
5619	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Same quality as leading parts stores. But cheaper in price. Has started yo rust a little bit on bottom side.
For beginners, the 1 ounce creame hardener which comes with it looks far too inadequate, but if used correctly...
2806	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits my Cadillac CTS perfectly! Almost like it was made for it. I already own two other Budge covers and I am very well pleased with them. I do not use them outdoors though. All my vehicles are garaged and these covers work well to keep my vehicles clean.

1280	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting.
3882	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good value
2838	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good cover.  Would buy again
i broke a 3/8 socket and wounded another trying to break the flywheel pulley bolt loose using cheater bars on sockets.... bad idea. the fly wheel pulley can be torqued from 200foot lbs to around 300foot lbs!!! id guess it easily gets near or over 300foot lbs torqued with a good 50k on the engine...
Drying my car with "The Absorber" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.
It's practically the same pump I had when I was a kid- that pump still works by the way... so I bought this one for Iraq, rather than a smaller/more portable model.  Function was key.  I had a small hand pump and it didn't work... this did the trick though.
2890	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Not great on all scratches mostly used as a protective coat
6177	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works, but seems to wear easy than expected.

713	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect replacement for my burnt oit fan motor. Keeps my attic much cooler
1418	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Without a doubt the best creeper I have ever used. I have hated working on anything I had to get under a car to get to. This creeper has changed that. No more hanging up on cords, hoses, tools..... No more pinched arm skin and or hair caught in the rollers.
2760	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Thought about giving a 1, but went up to a 2 because I might have picked the wrong size, wanted to give the benefit of doubt.  Got for a Maserati Quattraporte, based off of the description dimensions I thought there would be plenty of room.  However, this cover only fit about 3/4 the car, and that is being generous.  I kept pulling on one end, then the opposite end would pop off, very frustrating.  This is after several attempts to get the cover to secure to something.  It was too slippery and kept sliding off onto the ground.  I could not get a bite on the car for it to secure to, no mirror pockets or anything to latch on to the car. Is there a shortage on fabric?
498	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Didn't really hold a charge long.
9133	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This wax is great for all your shop tools, like the bench saw table, miter saw table, guides and supports. Try it on your tractor and you will find a "tough" shine and a very good protective finish. It is a tough wax for the farm, woodshop or workbench. Oh yes, it is wonderful on wooden furniture too!
1614	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Greatest duster on the market just got rid of one I had for over 10 years. Great for keeping clean between washes.
Let me know we your software include MB and Fiat
8536	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This saves me so much time, especially on my vehicles that have a belly pan under the engine which normally would have to be removed before oil service. Easy to transfer the extracted oil to another container to transport for a recycle dump. Worth it!
1197	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely great oiller.  I use primary on my old cars and with the flexible hose it will go in some tight spots.  Well constructed and USA made.  This thing has become a favorite which is built to last.
7507	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ordered 1 and came in super fast... even to hawaii! It's expensive here so this was a great deal. Got this for stocking stuffer for my uncles and my dad. They're into cars and love this shami :)

8097	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as described.  Handle is a little bit of a pain but nice and strong.
The "Dash Duster" works great in wiping the dash, console and doors. Don't think that because it's called a "dash duster" that it's limited to just your car dash. Due to it's size it's perfect for using inside for shelves, cabinets, entertainment center, televisions, desks, window sills, etc.
5540	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Incandescent bulb is brighter than the LED versions I looked at.  It's of good quality, and useful.  Bulb responds with both tail and brake lights.  Recommended!
4526	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Worked great! Thank you.
This is the second K+N air filter I have purchased, and while I don't know if I have seen a performance increase, I appreciate the reusability.
469	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Looks awesome I put these on each side of my trailer fenders and they are good size quality and color and they are made in USA. Fast fast shipping specialty emprorium is one of the best sellers I've dealt with on Amazon thanks
4351	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great price for charger to maintain battery charge in trailer when parked
2158	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
2716	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very tight fit, and the logo wasn't stitched on straight, but functionally, this seems like a good product, and an amazing value. We'll see how it holds up, but so far it's been doing a great job protecting my car from the snow/ice, which doesn't seem to soak through and freeze into like my previous cover. It seems more water resistant. This effect could wear off over time, but even if I have to buy one every year, it will be worth it.
7795	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use a couple of these to dry my truck and they work wonderfully.  I am able to dry my truck before the sun does and without scratching the paint!  I ended up ordering a couple extra just to have around the house.
7379	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a fantastic Synthetic Towel. I have a black car and this one towel is all I need to dry it with. Sure I have to wring it out several times, but it is well worth the extra effort. Once I am done, my car's finish is streak-free and the glass needs little if any wiping with a microfiber cloth. I do suggest wringing as much water as you can and then storing it in the tube it came in. This helps keep it moist and mildew free.

4366	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	it is the best

6300	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It looks like what I wanted and have used in the past. Other chocks like this have kept my trailer from rolling.
7953	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	everything I expected
It did initially shed a bit, and right now some of it is super stuck in a gap on my windshield wipers.
7463	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Well made and worked perfect.  What more can I say.
803	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a 1998 Snapper mower, my problems started when my old fuel filter got plugged up, I went to the local snapper dealership.  The new 50 micron filters kept running out of fuel.  I checked the manual finally the book calls for a 75 micron fuel filter, the local store only sold 50 micron fuel filters.  All the new mowers have electric fuel pumps, the 50 micron filter is great, doesn't work for my gravity fed system.  Well I did order a 75 micron fuel filter off of Amazon, my fuel filter would run out of fuel when I had a half a tank, because there wasn't enough pressure in the tank to keep my gravity fed system full.  I finally ordered this 150 micron filter, no more problems.  We mowed all weekend long.  I will be ordering several more of these to keep on hand for my future needs.
NO streaks on the finish
2430	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected, but only fits the outer side of my basket because of the mount rack holder.
2215	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have a 2003 Ford F150 that started missing and as usual the Haynes Manual is about as useful as a sack of marbles on the steps of Angkor Watt. Ordered this code reader and got two messages; both saying in effct that the number three cylinder is missing. Odered a replacement coil from Summit and with a minimum of grimy knuckles the beast is purring like a kitten. I like this tool... but electronic ignition systems will never be as reliable as 1950s technology. Detroit is making it harder and more expensive to do simple home repair. Good tool, bad auto-motive design! Baaaaad!
623	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It was great finally finding good jumpers of the length I needed.  Too many times I've found I could not get close enough to the vehicle needing the jump.  This solved that.  Prior to this I was using heavy welding cable.
battery perfectly. Before this I would have to
1725	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awsome!  Gets all the dust. Great for inbetween washes on the travel trailer!
Of course, as Abraham Lincoln once said, one must take information found on the Internet with a grain of salt.  I meandered over to Amazon, and priced out the #17 and #10, and found out that with shipping, it came out to around $25.  For that price, compared to buying a $400 fishfinder/ chartplotter, I did not have a lot to lose.  Click, click, BUY.
5943	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These 4-wire dust covers are inexpensive and look perfect. I haven't installed them yet, but what could go wrong? They'll beat the heck out of having to scrape crud off my connectors when I use my trailers.
If it doesn't work at first, not to worry - it takes a while it seems.  If fact, I thought mine was broken and had to re-start it after a day as I had no reading.
1239	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice product. Thanks.
The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it's small.  I could be a couple feet longer.
6344	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	worked like a charm on our aluminum boat when we had to replace some and cover up some screws.
8494	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works great because it's so simple to use.
4227	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Over all pretty good. Got it used saved some money was only missing a few screws no biggie.  It was in great shape well worth it.
2999	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After trying several cheap alternatives, finally bought an inflator gauge that is heavy enough to last for years. This is the less expensive choice in the long run.

Non standard wiring colors make installation mildly more complex.
7514	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The redesigned model is awesome! The cost is a bit more than a standard ball, but the ease of changing ball sizes makes it worth it. I'm absolutely impressed with this setup and will buy another if needed.
95	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Everything you need to work on this car
4354	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works.

5119	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic product with 100's of uses!!!!
2149	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this wheel to polish parts on my guns, it works wonders on stainless steel. My son had some surface rust on his rifle and it cleaned it right up. The only problem is when they are about a third worn down they start to shed a lot of fibers/dust. I have found that just a slight pressure works the best, work it slow and light. I also like the fact that you do not have to use any compound with it, it's imbedded in the wheel so there isn't any goop flying off of it. Great product
Going on a few months as they are working great.  They really help in keeping the road spray off the truck and they are holding up well.
3227	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not too much to say about this tool.  It help you remove, and re-install the wheel covers with relative ease.  It does the job.
2127	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I tried this out immediately on my bike and I was very impressed. For the price i expected to get something cheap that would only last a season. I was wrong. The bands on this are thick and the hooks are good quality. This is much larger than i was expecting so it may be tough to find a place to hook it to without anything in it. Bottom line, good buy.

4154	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works great
1560	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this same squeegee since 1988.  The old one just finally fell apart but only after many years use and I used it alot.  This lets you get the water off quickly before it starts to dry.  A towel is still needed to finish up but it cuts drying time way down.  The angle flattens out easily for hoods ect.  Soft edges won't mar or scratch your paint.
Original:
7747	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised, I used it to dry my car after a wash.  I haven't tried to wash it in the washing machine yet, so I might adjust the rating after i try it.

9286	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works great.  You can't replace Honda CRV crankshaft seal without this.  Inexpensive.

7388	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this before realizing we were in SUPER DROUGHT MODE here in CA. Has just been sitting there, since fear of getting outed using water terrifies me.
1757	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is my third Cali duster.  Be sure you follow the instruction when you open the duster DO NOT JUST OPEN AND USE.  It will leave smears of wax all over your car and windows.  Follow the instructions - take it out of the bag and lay it duster down on some old newspaper for 48 hours.  The paper will absorb the excess wax that the fibers are impregnanted with.  Even then the first few uses might result in smears -DO NOT PANIC the smears wipe right off.  After a few uses the duster is amazing and will reduce the amount of times you need to wash the car.
3772	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for transmission tube filler.
8019	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Was really good I helped several people with it,  until I decide to remove a tree trunk and us works perfectly, but tangled really bad on the trunk,  I can't take it out without destroy it,  now is gone,  but I pull heavy trucks , suv's , and one sport car,  never had a single problem
8822	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Gets the job done but is t of the highest quality.which I wasn't expecting.  But easy enough for kids to use it
5023	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the VERY best material for cleaning rubber or acrylic stamps.  Stays moist a long time before needing to wet it...and leaves NO lint!
9102	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got this for elder neighbor lady friend. It's a favorite with elders, what they used years ago and not locally available. She was tickled to get it.
8823	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought it to add a pound or 2 to top off my car tires.  works great with 15-20 pumps to add a psi or 2.  Good to use in the garage in a townhouse vs loud electric pumps that bother the neighbors.

9969	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked as adv. So far, I just use it for clean trash (no food). So, I don't know what happen after washing it.
6916	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works very well at removing gel coat oxidation although I needed two applications for best results. It's a bit of work with a good buffer but the results are worth it.
59	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this necklace diffuser. I can put different scents on each color and wash them out to switch scents when I want. I don't know yet how long a disc will lasts before it deteriorates but they are a cotton blend sturdy material thats soft to the touch. the aroma from these is very strong with only a few drops needed.
7291	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I agree with some other reviewers that it is a bit noisy on the highest setting, but not enough to bother me or my wife.  The ten-blade fan moves a lot of air.  I'd recommend it to others.
4486	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does the job for a great price!
4062	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product fast shipping

2029	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recently ordered this product due to high pollen count in my area. I have a black car and I couldn't resist washing the car every day. Buying this product has saved me hours. I'm able to dust off my car within 5 minutes. I haven't had problems with scratches or leaving residue on my paint. The product works just as advertised. I will re-order 2-3 additional units for my house and to serve as backup for my current one.

293	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wanted this to do some basic maintenance and repair to my CTS. Standard issue Haynes manual, has all the basics to suit my needs.
2309	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for keyless entry but ended up not needing it. A week later my son needed a relay for secondary fan in his Jeep Cherokee. I was surprised when he told me none of the local auto stores stocked the correct relay. I actually ended up with two of these so I gave him one since it was the same relay. Im sure the autoparts stores would have charged $25-30 if they had one in stock so we also saved about $20. Good deal all around.
3920	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Only works on certain rim styles. DOES NOT FIT JEEP WRANGLER WHEELS
5739	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This plastic polish works GREAT! I recently used this on a headlight restore and I loved it. It works well enough that you don't have to be an expert at wet sanding. I like it so much that I'm going to go find another project to use it on right now!!!!

6443	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this to seal around the seams of my Valco aluminum boat.
8491	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The wand won't fit down every dipstick tube, hard to know ahead of time. This one didn't  fit my 2013 ram 1500. It did fit my mustang but once I siphoned out as much oil as possible (which took forever and hundreds of pumps even with very hot oil)  I pulled the plug to see how empty it was and another quart and a half came out of the bottom. Maybe it's the shape of the pan, maybe it would work better if you have the car jacked up on one side or the other or raise the front or back so the oil poops directly under the wand. Either way a siphon is a siphon and I may find use for it down the road in other areas.

4159	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As ususal, Meguiar's delivers great quality.  We polished a boat we purchased that had some neglect on the gel coat.  We used their oxidation cleaner first to remove the worst of the gunk, but this polished out the swirl marks and left a great surface to apply wax to.  We used a DeWalt buffer with a green foam buffing pad.  I will mention, that if you're working as a team to polish something, the polisher should wait for the buffer to catch up because we got too far apart on timing and the polish was difficult to remove, but that was our fault.  Just try to get it off as soon as it hazes.

One more thing, no matter what it says, it can indeed get moldy. No matter what, DO NOT store this in a dark place. First the smell arrives, then the spots and before you know it, you have an absorber that has mildew damage and while it still works, it won't last as long.

3468	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I never used this product, but have been told by many who have to try it and I won't be disappointed. I applied with a paper towel after each wash and I can say when it rains the water seems to fly off the windshield as if it were being pushed off with an air dryer. Each application seems to last very well for about 2-3 weeks or in between each wash. Try it and you won't be disappointed.

Finish: Advantage Trimax, it is less intrusive visually and has a nice brushed finish and even the pin feels like it slides better when you put it in.
8336	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like the fact that it does not have to be removed, so it is easier to use. Worked well on my automobile interior. Cleaned and restored the original color.

3179	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	First of all, If I used this cover for outdoor storage, I probably would not rate it this high.  The time I used it outside and it rained, it was not waterproof.  Now, that said, the cover makes an excellent indoor/garage dust cover.  I just replaced mine after 10 years of indoor use on my Z3 Roadster.  Not a bad deal at less than $3 per year.  It keeps the dust off the car nicely as it often sits for extended times and is really just a weekend car for me.  The cover is soft and fits very well, and if you use your car and cover like I do, why spend more?

3646	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If I could give this six stars I would. I purchased because of the good reviews and the relatively low price. My headlights were not in that bad of shape, but I wanted to improve their overall clarity, and this product absolutely delivered. With very little effort, my headlights looked brand new! My friend and I, both of whom have used more expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming products in the past, were blown away. Not only was this product easy to use, but both of us thought the result was better than the aforementioned headlight restoration kits we had used in the past. We were so impressed we ended up cleaning the headlights on three different vehicles, and each time walked away extremely pleased with the result. Is the effect permanent? I don't know, nor do I care. If the headlights fog up again in a couple of months, three minutes will be all it will take to get them shining again! I followed the M17 up with the M10 polish, as directed. Do yourself a favor and buy this product.

1309	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had a Black and Decker electric lawnmower. No cords. Just a battery and this is it. The original battery was like $100 or something. This was much cheaper and only 10% weaker. No biggie on small lawns. Is a problem on larger ones and a much bigger problem on wet large lawns, which is why I dumped it and got a Sears mower that increased my carbon footprint, but is a breeze on large lawns. If you're in California, where it's increasingly hard to mow your lawn with anti-pollution laws and you have a Black and Decker lawnmower, then this likely will fit. Just look at the description. They are easy to pull apart, vacuum the leaves out and assemble in reverse. Likely will last two years, maybe three before you will need to replace. But so worth it. Otherwise can pay $$$ to have Black and Decker to do it for you. Not necessary.
6694	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	You have to put it together with 3 screws onto the hitch insert.  Then it wouldn't fit under the bumper on my F250.  The top of the flag hits the bumper.  Waste of money.

6129	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this on the headlights of my 2006 model year car and it work wonderfully. I was noticing the beginning stages of oxidation, some very mild haze on the plastic. After washing and clay baring the car I taped off the area and used this product. It restored the clarity and shine. Realistically I wouldn't expect this stuff to make a ten year old and neglected car's headlights look brand new. In fact, I tried just that and it didn't work; even after sanding with 1,500 grit paper, using a rubbing compound, then this product. However, as a preventive maintenance or regular use item, I think it works superbly. It couldn't be easier to use, just follow the directions.

7178	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fan has plenty of power...but is not very quiet...especially on high.  Has the sound of a small vacuum cleaner...probably because the blades are spinning so fast.  :)

6609	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	love this quiet fan.  We use it in our travel trailer.  Even if the electric is off, the fan will work on the 12 volt.  This is a nice insurance for when our dogs are in the trailer and we are gone for a couple of hours.


6015	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The headlights on my '06 Tundra had reached a point of needing to be replaced, but I read the product reviews for the PlastX Cleaner & Polish and decided to give it a try. My lights are not restored to 100%, but pretty darn close. Probably removed at least 80% of the haze and scratches on the clear surface. For the price, it's worth a shot before spending hundreds on new headlight assemblies.
- If you let any compound dry on any car panels or glass for too long, it takes a lot of elbow grease to remove. Because the polish is red, it leaves very noticeable splatter

265	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The first thing I purchase when I get a new car is the Haynes manual.  While I haven't torn an engine completely apart in years, these manuals have enough information to enable you to do so.  They are usually great for performing almost any job on the car.  Notice on this manual it is for Civic and CR-V.  Most of the manual is dedicated to the CR-V and mentions the Civic is "similar".  Also, my Civic is an EX which has an LED 3rd stop light, which I had to replace.  This manual did not contain information for replacing this light (it is very unlike the light in the other trim models), and I had to get the information through Google.

My only negative thing about this bag is that it sheds a little on my helmet. Kinda annoying having little white pieces frizz material on my black helmet. But it seems to do it less and less and I think after a week or so it won't do it at all. So not worth slashing a star over.

Be wary of your prep work though as if you don't take care to tape up the fabric near the windows it will cause your top/frame to take on a white color.

7228	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love this -- works better than a natural chamois, or other water absorbing products.  As others have said, it has many uses besides drying your car.

- When it's new, use it a lot. When new it has a bit of an odor and damp feel to it. I think it has some kind of solution possibly for "attracting" dust. It could potentially could stain fabric. After a few dustings the odor and odd feel are gone, so don't worry.
1175	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this oil pump can by Goldenrod. It has a long metal hose that can flex. It can even fit into sparkplug holes. You can put thick or thin oil in it.

And pumping a little MMO oil down the Intake while working the pedal.keeping it at a high idle. And I also seen on the Goldenrod oil pump can. That it is made in the U.S.A. and very fine workmanship.

My Audi A4's softtop is not exactly small, so it takes at least 2 big towels to dry the top. This product not only makes it easy and quick, it's very easy to clean too. I need something that absorbs fast without any rubbing that wears the softtop protectant faster. Plus it works for drying the car in a self car wash.

8079	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	item is to lite for my needs
There are two niggling complaints I have with the Bone-ster: I wish it had a thin pad to rest your head/neck on (a folded towel always slides off at the most inopportune time); and I really don't look forward to the day when I have to clean an accidental spill of oil and grime that gets into the deep narrows of its strengthening ribs; I've already spilt some coolant in a couple of the most narrow grooves and had to fold thin swatches of paper towels to clean it out.

Not as perfect as new, but much better than the ugly, yellowish hue that was present before I used this product.  You do not need any sandpaper products or rough matter to sand the headlights first.  Just apply like you would car wax and rub it off when it's in the hazy state.  A little elbow grease will produce a better result.  And if you desire and you have the equipment to do so, then a drill and a buffing pad will make the job a bit easier and the end result will be a wee bit better than just rubbing with your hands.  But...  you don't need to run out and buy a drill or buffing pad and attachment.  Rubbing vigorously with your hands will produce some amazing results.

No heater in my 61 corvair, so this blanket is a life saver.
Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
Note: I do not work for Amazon nor anyone involved in making this device.  I bought this at the listed Amazon price with my own money.
There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.

3657	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This does a pretty good job at cleaning plastic but do not expect miracles. I used this to clean some headlight lenses and as a first step to polish some stone guards on a Porsche. This product seemed to have little impact on the headlights, but I have to assume it did clean them well in preparation for the polishing with Meguiars M10 plastic polish:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-M10-Mirror-Glaze-Clear-Plastic-Polish-8-oz/dp/B0000AXMD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's M10 Mirror Glaze Clear Plastic Polish - 8 oz.</a>. On the stone guards it did clean the rubber and embedded bits up pretty well, but again, it did not have polishing qualities. If you just want to clean plastic, this product should be sufficient, but if you want to polish, you need to follow this up with M10.
2384	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I spent countless hours on trying to get this to work. I even bought the T-harness to make the install easier. The T-harness only hooks up the remote car starter part of it. I was under the impression that it would hook up everything just to find that it doesnt. I also bought a bypass for the anti-theft system. I put this system in but couldn't find the power lock wires that I needed to. So I went ahead and figured I could go without the locks. This is where it got interesting. After spending hours and getting everything hooked up,I pushed the start button. The Trailblazer started........and shut off. Tried it again and the same thing happened over and over. Well went to the computer and found that the $120.00 bypass module I got needed to be reset because it was giving me a code. Huh,no problem,went through the list to reset it and got to the next to last step. You need to hit the lock/unlock button. Remember me saying I didn't wire the locks. I went back hooked the lock wires from the remote starter to the bypass module. Went through the reset list and nothing happened. After a hour of trying to wire this and that I came to realize that it must have to go through the anti-theft system itself and I couldn't find those wires to wire it up. I called support and left messages to which I still haven't heard anything yet to date. I emailed support and still haven't heard anything yet to date. All in all,I spent $240.00 for complete junk that I counldnt get to work. I also spent hours on the computer doing research because their directions suck and aren't clear. If you have no expereince in automobiles or wireing STAY AWAY from this crap. Its nothing more than a headache. Remember nothing is universal!
3983	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this to change oil on my 2005 Honda Odyssey and it made the job of changing oil very easy.  I was able to get nearly 4 1/2 quarts of oil in a couple of minutes with out any spill.  It's also multi purpose!  Very good value for the money paid.

Still, that is a much better solution than those regular UPS, since the battery in resular UPS can only last 15 minutes.  During summer, when we have the rolling black, which lasts about two hours each time, we don't have to shutdown our computers due to power outage.

2100	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The armor all auto care cleaning pack came a bit dry upon first use. I was using the glass cleaning wipes and noticed that after lightly using it in a small area, the wipe was relatively drier than expected. I was able to clean the windshield as a side window before the wipe was completely dry, and this was the most effective way to leaving no streaks on the car. I tried using one wipe around the entire car, and this only left streams and leftover material from the wipe itself. However, when I used two wipes conservatively, I was able to clean the mirrors and windows thoroughly. The cleaning and shine protectant wipes were also relatively dry, but I was able to use them on the dash and the hood of the car. These wipes seem to offer a great way to safely wipe down your vehicle temporarily to battle against road grime and dust before you have to take it in for a car wash.

7468	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are AMAZING!!!!  I have used one for about 10 years on my car.  After washing my van I dry it off with one of these and there are no water spots.  This is particularly fabulous on the windows.  I purchased more to have a 'clean' one to use on the inside of my car windows.  You do not let these dry out, if they do it is a pain to get them wet again!  THey stay moist in the container, and miraculously DO NOT mildew.  I love them.  I bought the 6 pack because of the great value, and I have gifted a couple to friends. (Yes it is a weird gift, but it was a random gift not a birthday gift....)
I have a Kinetic HC 1800 up front, and a pair of Kinetic HC 800's in the back, and my voltage after being fully charged, while still on the charger, is around 13.5- 13.7 usually (even in winter).

8649	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have used the oil extraction device twice and it works well. For a car or truck it requires several cycles of pumping a vacuum to keep the oil flowing out at a decent rate. It takes considerably longer than unscrewing the drain plug and draining into a pan but you can do it from the top of the engine. The only problem is you still have to go under to remove and change the oil filter! Of course that is not the purpose of the extraction device.
7112	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  Black gelcoat has a few scratches and little nicks from docking and the oxidizer made the fine scratches disappear.  The polish filled those little scratches to point of not being able to fine them.  The wax brought out the luster and made the whole process worth the effort.  Did the job by hand and it took about the same amount of time as a one step application of another brand.  Did not require as much elbow grease as anticipated.  Very satisfied with the product and will be purchasing their other detailing products as well.

2454	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The only thing I don't like is I expected the numeric lock to be permanently attached to the cable on both ends, allowing me to simply insert one end of the cable into the other and locking.  It's not a deal breaker, but you do have to enter the combination, remove the combo part of the lock, and then slide the cable through.  This length is perfect for locking either two bikes side-by-side, or locking an adult bike and a connected trailer bike for a child. I also use it on my bike rack as a deterrent for theft.  Obviously a serious thief will cut it, but as a deterrent for a casual thief, it does the trick.

A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!  They are inexpensive and top notch quality!

Bottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.  If it ends up leaking one could easily buy some seam sealing glue from your local Camping store.

If you're using the spray stuff, throw it away, scrub your window with soap and water with a scrubby, then put this stuff on.  It's the original formula and actually works and rinses off clean.
4808	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Follow the instructions and watch how well this thing works.
8635	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I can not beleive how GREAT this tool is. It makes oil changes a JOY, clean and easy. I have been changing oil in my cars for 35 years. I have lots of memories of laying on my back with oil running down my arm, or spilling oil out a pan or dropping the drain plug into a pan full of oil..... NO LONGER..... I am sure I am getting 99% of the oil out by going down dip stick hole.
4844	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absorbent. Durable. Effective. Washable.
Great device for say a mini-van (Ody) or my 2007 Honda CR-V.  Power cord does NOT get hot unlike my old cooler.  Seams to pull less than 4 amps which is nice.  It does heat up if reversed the plug but rarely do that (can melt if left on too long).
52	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When the manufacturer sent me this in exchange for an honest review, my husband rolled his eyes...he is really particular about his vehicles (has them detailed professionally), but he agreed to give it a shot.
9507	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When it became necessary to remove the crankshaft pulley bolt on my 2000 Honda Civic I used a chain wrench to hold the the pulley as I didn't yet have this tool. Though I did get the bolt released, I immediately ordered this holding tool so installation would be much smoother. The tool worked as described so I could properly torque the pulley bolt. Price was reasonable for a weekend mechanic and even if I never use it again it was worth the purchase.

7712	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I liked the absorber because it did not leave any streaks on my vehicle.  The material was sturdy and not flimsy.
3877	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got a new trailer with a spare and was concerned about the opportunity thieves. I think given the time, and a place they could make noise (i.e. out in the boonies with no one around) they could probably beat this lock off and steal the tire if they really wanted it.  What it's good at is deterring the opportunity thieves who could have taken the tire in under a minute with a battery powered ratchet, or heck even with a 4-way.  Those thieves will see the lock and go on to the next guy that doesn't have one, and for the price, it's good insurance.  Let's face it, the vast majority of crimes to vehicles are crimes of opportunity, meaning, you made it easy for them. Get the lock and they will pass you by.

187	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Manual not as informative as prior books I bought for other vehicles.  Hayes tries to cover to many years resulting in limited details on specific model/year.  In my opinion not worth buying.  More and better information on Internet.
7874	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well & look good after installation.
2646	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just as I wrote for my review of a headache rack, the same thing applies here:
9008	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This part came in in a timely manner and was packed well.  Not sure the packing would matter since this thing looks pretty tough.  My Jeep wasn't been stolen so I guess it is working fine.  I do like that it collaspes down fairly small and fits nicely next the the seat.  Looks like it could be used as a weapon if need be!
5737	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Does not work on extremely cloudy headlights.

6283	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Larger than I expected and solid feel like. The only cons is the curve is not snapped under wheel smoothly and there is a gap between curved surface and wheel line. So I do not know if it is really working or not because the function of chock is for the accidental circumstances the car slipped back,however, it is not usually happened when the car is put on the parking gear and hand brake is applied.  So hard to say it's good or working, unless the car is really accidentally slipped back and blocked by this wheel chock.  Then you can finally see if the chock is good or not.  But anyway,  it worths that money.

2109	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Just the thing for my 06 Buick Terraza.  The 4 stick on connectors didn't have very good adhesive but there were attachment points in the back for use anyway.  It does a good job of keeping things from rolling out the back of the van when the back gate is opened. I'd recommend for anyone who has a van and needs to keep cargo from sliding out the back
682	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Much heavier cables than most of those you find in retail outlets.  The wire guage is what is most important, and these cables are heavy enough.  I wish they had soldered connections at the clamps, but if you keep them clean and dry these will last forever. The clamps will attach to side terminal batteries.

2692	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Fits my 2006 Jeep Liberty very well. The plastic grommets for the antenna is worthless but a little hole without the grommet seems to work just fine for me. Good cover here in the South during this pollen period.
3971	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Why are they selling this as something that will work with a Jeep Wrangler/Rubicon?  This does not come close to being able to fit on the spare. ..  . in addition, it is cheaply made and I doubt that it would work after being exposed to the elements for a couple months. . . .  Being able to secure a spare tires is a priority for me, so wasting time by ordering this and having to send it back and finding a better answer is frustrating. . . .  No wonder they don't show this lock actually attached to the spare--- IT DOES NOT FIT. . ..bogus product. .  . Come on Amazon, take down this bogus product
7859	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	these 1/2 hose fittings are high quality and do not leak, will purchase again if I need to.

They did not even say thanks :( Love NJ !
3948	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought and use  this to put additives in my gas tanks to eliminate the destructive aspects of today's ethanol gasoline. If you are not using such an additive, you run the risk of ruining any rubber components in your fuel system not to mention other components. I am not a mechanic so please don't chastise me for any differences of opinion on these matters. I have had two engines ruined by ethanol gas that is sold at most fuel centers today. By the way there are several good fuel treatments on the market for this purpose so just do a little investigating and you will find them here on Amazon.com. Best wishes and God bless.
9018	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These gloves indeed deliver solid protection from cold, wind and water while working outdoors in cold climates.
9201	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	It does not work for deer or any other animal for that matter, and the cheap toggle switch just came apart in my hand one day when I went to turn it off.
Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap, maintenance(READ: Trickle) charger. It's definitely not going to jumpstart a dead battery, but it's not made to do so.
It's full of warning labels but there's no point to them. Tried again in case I just got a bad one, but no, same result with 2nd one.
4255	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	OK
226	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used Haynes manuals for all of my vehicles.  They are very informative and have helped tremendously in doing repairs at home (I do almost all of my maintenance and repairs).  Anything I cannot find in the manual (and it does not have everything) I can find on the internet.  For the most part it has the information in it. I would recommend this to anyone interested in doing their maintenance and repairs themselves.
7735	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this item to dry my car. I own a black car and don't recommend this product. Instead use a soft microfiber waffle towel. This product leaves streaks and swirl marks on the paint finish its to rough.
365	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good car repair manual. Fast delivery.
3933	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The base won't clear the ridge around the lug hole so the top can't be secured. The base should be slightly recessed inside the cover but the raised ridge on the wheel keeps the cover from engaging the base plate far enough.
8042	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works very well with the surge protector I ordred with it
I really love not going through a ton of towels.
7710	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have used a smaller version of this product for many years now. It really does do a nice job drying, and holding the water. You might think it will leave streaks at first, but they dry and it leaves a very nice finish. Go ahead and get one, you should like it.
4706	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I just received this item yesterday for my 12V Marine Battery on my boat, and I installed it today in less than 5 minutes. I placed this inside the battery box, on top of the battery, and with the included L bracket, and screws, it can sit on top of the battery, and it's held in place by the L bracket (placed in between the battery and the battery box). I didn't have to actually install it onto the battery or box for it to sit without movement. The ring connections (as pictured) were a little large for the screw terminals on my battery, but tightened down properly they still made good, soild, tight contact, and work just fine. I plugged this right into a 50ft extension cord that I run out of my garage, and over to where I park my boat, and it powered right on, and started charging. Other reviewers say that it's loud, but I couldn't hear anything until I put my ear to within 6 inches of the charger. VERY quiet. I also tested the ability to store it in the battery box in the configuration I said about before, and it fits just fine. When I unplug the charger, and lay the power cord on top of the battery/charger, I can close the battery box, and it closes just perfectly with everything stored inside. I recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to have to lug around a battery charger everytime you need to charge your boat battery, this can install permanently near the battery, and all you have to do is run an extension cord to your boat, and plug it in. It's literally like plugging in your boat to charge it, and once your done, you can just tuck all the wiring inside your battery box, and head to the lake. Other reviewers complained about not having a 12 ft power cord, but if you're going to permanently mount this on a vehicle, or boat, or whatever, do you REALLY want to have to wind up, and store 12 ft of extra cable SOMEWHERE on your vehicle, boat, mower, or ATV? That's alot of cable to have to stash somewhere, especially when there really isn't much room on a boat, Mower, or ATV TO stash that much cable. I love it. It works perfectly, great/easy install, and I don't every have to move or reconfigure it if I don't want to. I recommend this to anyone looking for a compact, permanent install trickle charger.
1568	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Just buy a sponge mop and bucket and save $$.
9767	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love these mud flaps. Moved across the US after installing these. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
All of the polishing I did was by hand, not with a powered buffer.
4698	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Been using these for years. They are so much better than old fashioned chamois or water blades.
1426	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Rolls easily on hard packed roadbase or dirt even over the occasional loose rock on concrete or pavement. If the wheels were wider you could roll on softer dirt if needed.
Never a problem and when they get dirty or dusty I just wash them in my washing machine and air dry outside.

Product is not a liquid - it is a solid block of wax
3307	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't believe the cheap price!  They cost 3 times this in Japan, which is odd because they're probably made here.
200	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good manual, however some details are missing such as when I needed to repair the trunk release lever cable there was not any information on how to do so and resorted to looking online.  A lot of info is available online these days, but it is nice having a manual next to you when doing repairs or looking up torque specs.
9401	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It does the job. I have had to remove the crank pulley numerous times on my Honda and thank goodness someone invented this. Just set the breaker bar against the floor and lock in the crank and use the impact wrench to remove the bolt.
5057	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have 3 of these already.  one in each car and RV.  This one is larger than most.  Really works great.  Take care to $3.00 car wash, wipe down with this chamois and good to go.  Just like a professional.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes to do a good job easy and inexpensively.
3320	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Love it. I've used it before. I think it's a good price.  But not sure.
7724	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've owned mine for 6 years now, I've used it hundreds of times to date. It's the most versatile drying cloth I've ever owned. It does an amazing job at clearing huge amounts of water off of a car, cleanly, and streak free.
2546	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did a lot of research before deciding on the Buyers brand. Love the mount and ability to quickly remove and reattach. Unit is well built and functions to perfection.

2973	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	LOVE this, I've had/used these Milton air tools for decades. Every tire shop uses them. THey are GREAT!
1897	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent car duster, It is easy to use because of the long handle with plenty of dusting fibers to easily clean the painted surface of a vehicle. WE have a plethora of pine pollen and it cleans it with a wiz. It doesn't hurt the painted surfaces in any way.

5864	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works fine. Takes yellow out and some fogging.
3890	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Can't beat the price and does the job, though if it was a little bigger it would make for a slightly faster oil fill.
I can send my 3 kids out with three bikes and one lock, and this one is it!  (and they can't loose the key, either!).  Price is more than fair; I felt like I may have cheated the company a bit! ---

2439	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Well made. 10' is the perfect length for securing bikes on a trailer mount bike rack. It seems you can only find them in 7' and 15' lengths; both either too small or too long.
2040	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great little small duster .  Takes longer to dust but not as heavy as the large one!
Highly recommended.

9713	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great
2297	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have been using these in my cars for many years.  My complaint is that they don't seem to last more than a few years.  I wouldn't mind if they were just a little louder also.  Some have had the beeper fail, some the bulb.  In any event I really like having that extra attention getter when backing out of parking space.

2762	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't fit my 2000 s430 Mercedes. Little bits of the paint showing near the bottom of the car. Can't beat the price though.
9172	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I don't like it, produce birds sounds
7368	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Well, you can't have everything. I really reviewed the reviews of this product here on Amazon before I decided to purchase this fan. Yes I read all about the complaints about the "chintzy" feet, and the apparent "cheapness" of the construction. I had to balance these negatives against what other reviewers on other websites chortled about "The fan was w-a-y out of warranty when the fan motor quit and you know what, they sent me a new one at no charge". Others chimed in with similar claims of exceptional customer service.
5501	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product! I own a mobile detail company and I use a lot of the stuff it's the cheapest on Amazon
8877	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	For the price it is a 5 star gun. Compared the purple special sold by Harbor Freight, this gun is much much better for only a few extra dollars. The gun has stainless and brass parts compared to plain steel like on the HF gun. This is a real plus if you are spraying waterborne finishes as it will not rust. It is also great for shellac because the denatured alcohol solvent will attract moisture like mad.


This extractor was well worth the money.  Highly recommended.
8	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Its just not as expected. Maby my expectations were too high. It works just not good enough.  I give it 2 stars because it is built well. It just don't cut it.
8647	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It arrived today, just in time to change the transmission fluid in my jeep. It worked just like I hoped it would. This thing sucked all the fluid out without dropping the pan and no messy pump to clean up after or spill like my electric pump.
1747	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does a great job of removing dust from my car
3116	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using Rain-X for 30 years. Keeps my windshield visible during rainy season. This product is a must buy for everyone during rain.
9463	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I needed this for a timing belt job on a 14 year-old B20B engine (still runs like a champ).
1020	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	just a standard oil pan, easy to pour into jugs or containers so i can take my old oil to Autozone or O'Riley's.
8903	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	No better product for its price and simplicity of use. Just a note for potential buyers, it will automatically lock without the key when extended, a brilliant convenience when you are locking up. Upon unlocking, you must turn the key a certain way to remove it. But that extra step puts the Club in the automatic lock readiness when you extend it. If there is a downside, it'll be its weigh which probably a characteristic of its high quality and purposeful protection feature.
5723	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product. Thanks
5317	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Every time it rains, my glass patio table accumulates puddles of water. Before purchasing this, it would take several large towels to clean off and dry. Now, with this chamois, all I do is wipe the entire table one time, wring out the chamois, than wipe the table again. Within minutes, the table is not only clean, but dry. This is definitely worth the money.
3139	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product previously. It is fairly easy to apply and buff. I applied in sunlight which made it a little more difficult to remove. Not only does it help with rain dispersal but it is a lot easier to remove to remove bugs and it is fairly long lasting.
It prevents scuffing, chipping, scratches on visor etc.
8529	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Makes changing your oil a breeze.  No more climbing under or jacking up cars to change oil.  I have two Fiat Abarths and the only way to get to the oil plug is to jack up the vehicle.  Simply run the hose down the dipstick hole, pump it a few times and sit back and relax.  There is no mess from getting oil all over the ground and keeps hands clean.  The design allows you to quickly and easily dispose of the used oil by pouring it into a separate container.  Highly recommend.
9812	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome filter fit just right for my 06 silverado 5.3
5888	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Only complaint was the loop.  It's a little big and I'm afraid it may fall off when I'm towing but it really can't.
3921	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works like it was intended for.
3240	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got this cover to use on my Dune Buggy when out at the dunes in Bad Weather. The cover was easy to install and secure. Also kept all water out during an overnight rainstorm
Also, after inserting the tool into the pully, I would suggest smacking it with a hammer a couple times to get it nice and snug.  I was having a little trouble with getting the car back in time, so I had to remove the pulled half a dozen times, worked just fine.
6620	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought for sealing a new hatch door frame on my boat.  Waterproof.

8897	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Solid steering wheel lock. Will definitely slow down a thief. With enough time anything can be stolen. Love the club though. Easy to use and remove.
7557	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was skeptical when purchasing this but it works really well.  Just dry the car and wring out the sponge like material.  Our water is very hard so have to dry the car after washing or get water spots.
They work so well I bought 2 more and gave them to friends who are also always cold in the car as Christmas gifts this year. These are terrific and I only wish I had known about them sooner.
3162	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say about this.  It just works.  Rain-X helps keep your windshield clearer when it is raining.  I live in Houston (50 inches of rain a year) and this stuff makes a difference.
2622	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great size, and great price.  My open face is a medium and there's so much extra room.  It looks like i could fit a large, maybe an XL into it if my head were larger
I always had to ask myself , do I want to take it apart someday ? If I did I wouldn't be using this product . I've had to patch up my boat , basketball size below the waterline by beaching it and waiting for the tide to go out . Used a piece of plywood about ten screws and sandwiched in between , 5200 ! It cured about 8 hours in 50-60 degree nasty weather and I fished 3 more days . Never leaked a drop ,  . Saved me a bunch of money but wasn't pretty .
2147	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is what you use after you have dulled the gold from removing scratches.  The tip is very easy to modulate.  The shine it leaves is very bright and long lasting.  It is the best polishing wheel I have used so far.
474	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	very nice adhesion, was not difficult to apply and very easily removed bubbles thanks!
3164	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Only been in one rain storm so far, worked well and application was not that bad, clean glass is paramount for said application so you want to have a clear view in sunlight or oncoming cars at night. So spent the time to do it right, you won't be sorry.
These have held up well for our first year of camping in our 1,800# pop-up camper. No structural or quality issues have arisen at all, and I trust these will last a good 5-10 years before having any sort of quality issues.
There are some differences between old and new.  The part where the strands are sewn, the top binding if you will, is not as substantial as the older ones.  Also, I measured the length and width of the top binding.  Old was 2 3/8" wide by 14 3/8 long.  New is 3" wide by 14" long.  The strands themselves seem a bit longer.  New are 5" long with the old ones closer to 4 1/2".  Each strand is also noticeably thinner. But there definitely is a difference in how tightly they seem stitched together.  Newer version does not seem to be as tightly packed.  Seems like overall you up with less strands.
9632	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just what I needed to hold all my paperwork and sunglasses!!!




This really is the best of the best for 12v box fans. It's quiet and moves good air.  I purchased a second one for the other end of my camper.  Even though it's not cheap, you get what you pay for.

4732	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	excellent
7671	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Don't know why, but the 4 foot straps were cheaper than the 2 foot straps.  So, we installed our brand new 4 footers and cut off the excess.  Then we took a lighter and burned the ends so that they did not fray.  This makes for a perfect fit!

2861	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had to come up with a mounting scheme which this doesn't have.  3/4 pipe is too big for my system so I used adapters to convert down to 3/8 inch and then 2 standoff pipe clamps to mount 3/8 pipe to a backboard and it's very secure.  To minimize fire hazzard I used fyrite and anti-siphon valves ahead of the filter.  I love the see-through bowl (it's plastic but replaceable) and the whole thing looks easy to maintain (get the bowl wrench!). Tested it for vacuum leaks and it held with normal tightening of the bowl.  I used a little dielectric grease on the gasket, though it ships w some grease on it.

The humidity of South Florida, the exposure to the weather and salt water takes its toll. The kit reduces oxidation, restores surfaces to almost new condition, eliminating scratches, stains and water spots.
2818	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used to have a very expensive cover for my C5 corvette which cats destroyed, this one has a great quality for the price, can't go wrong with this cover, very recommended!

3110	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Overall this is a pretty great product, but I think they have changed the formula over the years or something.  This product works great but wears off very quickly.  If you live in a very rainy climate, you will find yourself reapplying this once a week or so.

4342	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	does the job and no odor, breaks down waste pretty quickly
9249	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	It was a good idea, but it will only let you keep it on for 30 minutes or 45 minutes. I got this to help keep my girlfriend warm because i always run way hot and her way cold. Well, with the 45 minute shut off if you fall asleep you wake up freezing. Also, there is no way to regulate the temperature like there is on all other heating blankets that i have ever used. It is just one heat level and its not all that hot, more like a warm, so over all I'm not to happy with this product.
8275	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	nice mirror.. It is full size.. just so you know..
2725	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Single layer, thin and not the size you'd think when comparing stats on vehicle to size of cover.
8315	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was a little skeptical on a suction cup mount, but I'm impressed.  I stuck it on there over a month ago and it's showing no signs of letting go.  That's over a dozen trips to the lake (30 mile trips) plus hot days in the sun.

6821	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	vibrates a bit much for the price, but in all, good fan. I sent this fan back to amazon 3 times because they all were not packed well.  They all vibrated.  I also noticed the sticker on the front of all of them was not even close to being center.  Seems like a little thing to complain about, but working in consumer electronic is they don't care about getting there stick right, then I can only image what they care about the rest of the product.  Seems another deal were a family starts a business with good morals, then they get bought by a large company and quality suffers because now they nickel and dime every penny.  One final thing,  Amazon needs to learn how to pack its shipments however.  yes this is opinionated, but to often I'm finding issues with products these days

4405	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Hooked it up and it showed fully charged on a very low battery after 10 minutes, had to unplug it to get it to reset, after that absolutely no problems. Very happy with this unit, does a great job keeping battery at full charge.

2853	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought a couple of these to use with my fluid filled tractor tires. Well made and appears to be accurate compared to my other gauges. I would purchase these again.

7471	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great...This is my towel after the surf session...
8551	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I previously purchased a metal oil extractor that was just OK; this product is great.  All of the other oil extractors stop working if the hose pops out of what you are extracting for a second or two.  Not this unit, it continues to pump out even if you move the hose and hit a dry spot.
4489	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this filter as a larger alternative to the OE sized filter on my 2006 Jeep Liberty CRD(diesel). It adds about a half quart of extra oil capacity over the stock unit which can't hurt. I see pretty positive reviews of the Fram Ultra line on Bob is the Oil Guy so it has to be somewhat decent. The tremendous amount of soot that ends up in the oil of my jeep is not good so having that better filtration and extra oil capacity helps a bit.
700	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	GOOD
4396	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is my second unit. Love this item and would put on all my vehicles.
Did I notice any fuel mileage or performance increases?  Of course not...its a nearly 6000lb truck and this is just an air filter.
8231	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.
3091	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	very light weight, so if it is windy, good luck finding your car cover across the street.  I didn't secure it like I should, but it works and is a great price.
5288	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is obviously manmade but is equal to or better than any 'natural' chamois I ever had.  It's just marvelous.
BUT...the side spout cap is made of extremely weak plastic.  As others have said, it leaks.  Actually, the threads on mine broke during my 2nd time using it in only 4 months of ownership.  I did not tighten it excessively.  The thickness of the top of the cap is maybe 1/16-1/8 of in inch so it is prone to just break.
4345	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this in my van which is seldom driven.  I soldered on a Philmore cigarette lighter plug so I could plug it into a power point but that is a personal preference.  The 17 year old battery starts the V8 every time.
I've used these for a couple of weeks so I don't know about durability (hence 4 star) but they look like they should hold up well (1 year later & no they don't). I've found them to be a quick and solid connection for my rear mooring line to the jet ski at the dock. I put it in upside down so I can more easily reach the tab that locks it in place.  Prior to having these I had to feed a rope through the holes in the rear deck of my Waverunner which took longer.

4116	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	They work as they shouold
8952	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this recently and have used it to refill bike tires and refill basketballs. I don't know why I waited so long to be a pump like this (compared to foot pumps). Easy, little effort and very portable. Awesome!
4835	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this to dry my hair...way better than terry cloth or microfiber.
The cover is a light fabric that will last a season or two in the sun. If it was heavier and made to last longer, it wouldn't store as easy or be as easy to put on. It helps keep the car cooler and protects the interior from fading when it sits in the hot sun all day. That's all I ask of it. As a bonus, I think it will keep the pollen off in the spring and may keep frost off the windshield this winter.
9039	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Get this. Takes about 5 minutes to dry off the average motorcycle with this device. Handy accessory for any motorcyclist.
Avoid gaps and vents with wet wax rag

7692	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked Great!
5865	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised.  A little elbow grease, depending on how bad the lenses are, and viola, you got some really clear lenses.  One of my cars was pretty bad, it looked like frosted glass, so I used rubbing compound first then this stuff.

4485	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as described
6985	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Many boats that are made of fiberglass have a coat of paint on them. Generally speaking the more expensive the boat, the more pure colored fiberglass you will see. Why am I mentioning this? Because the heavy duty oxidation remover in this kit is designed for rock hard fiberglass, and not for paint. It is a bit aggressive for paint unless it is super oxidized, and needs a layer removed. This level of scrub is not designed to give you polish or gloss, but rather to remove the surface oxidation. So that is why they provide three different formulas. This kit includes: Meguiar's heavy duty oxidation remover (M4916), boat/RV polish (M4516) and gloss enhancer, boat/RV pure wax (M5616), soft foam applicator pads - 3PK (X3070), microfiber towels - 3PK (X2020), mirror glaze apron.
2756	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Fell apart after one season of rain..
Let it sit on newspapers or brown paper bags out in the air (for a couple of days) before using.


7910	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had another long lock from some cheap company and it failed.  Was towing boat to river this last weekend and it actually just rattled and fell apart.  So I bought this masterlock and I'm very happy with it.  Durable, key turns easily, disconnects easily, and locks very well.
After I use it awhile I may update this review.
6864	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Boat looked like new when applied via variable speed buffer
870	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit perfectly on my Sears Craftsman rider.  Just like the factory originals.
7771	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These worked great.  Very strong and good material.
8289	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this mirror to use in my work van, which has no side windows in the cargo area. Consequently it can be impossible to see certain angles when pulling out of parking spaces, driveways, alleys, etc. I placed this mirror on the inside of my windshield on the passenger side, and now I can see just about perfectly at the angle I need. It falls off once a month or so, but fortunately seems pretty sturdy. I just stick it back on and it's good.
7979	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These stainless steel towing balls are super, they stay nice and clean , and you never will have to get dirty from steel towing balls. The great part about it one shank and three different towing opions.
9647	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It holds what I need, where I need it.
8931	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	it works, it's cheap.  Folds in place.  needed something for the back yard toys, footballs, soccer,  and this was perfect.

9690	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	the best, have them in every vehicle I own.
3078	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This item is exactly what it says.  It's "generically" fitted, but it fits an Audi A5 just about as well as you could hope.  I use it to cover the car inside a garage, which is pretty much what it says it's good for.  I highly recommend this.
591	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	One of the accessories I bought to use on a conventional angle grinder instead of purchasing an expensive sander/polisher just for buffing.
8751	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After years of riding a Goldwing I recently purchased a  used Harley ultra classic.  Everything was great except that the wind from the custom windshield came around me and hit my wife directly in her eyes.  This caused the riding to be unpleasant for her so we thought that a shield would help.  After a short ride her comment was "why didn't I have one of these 40 years ago." It is well made and does the job, she is happy therefore I am happy.
8856	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good Spray gun for the Price. JWH
9402	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Save yourself the headache and buy this! I fought a crank pully on an 04 crv for an hour with no success. Bought this to hold the pully and had the bolt out in 15 seconds!

Shipping a bit high.
5798	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great value for the money and is well made. I really love it. I have seen others that cost more and are not as nice.
Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.
2491	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like this, it's stainless steel and seems well built. I oiled mine real well before installing so hopefully it won't seize up from the weather. I am leaving my hitch on all the time to help protect the back of my truck.
 also for back up sump pumps in case of power outage
3107	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I remember years ago Andy Rooney gave these people some grief about the product not working. I was very surprised by that at the time, because I had used it for quite awhile with good results. You do need to make sure the windows are clean before applying, and it does take two applications, each time, to work properly; and it lasts for about 6 months here in Florida; and our cars aren't garaged. Instead of sheeting, which is hard to see through, the rain or dew beads up, and when the beads collide with each other they combine until they are big enough for gravity to move them off the glass. Even when the beads are still on the glass, they are easy to see through. When the car begins to move, wind and vibration push the beads together and the windows eventually become mostly free of the water. Areas that don't get any wind movement may remain beaded, but still you can see through those areas. I DO NOT however recommend it for your front windows, as the wipers then tend to skip and behave annoyingly. I DO NOT recommend their windshield wiper fluid for this same reason, it also makes the wipers skip. I have recommended this product to many people and all have indicated their satisfaction. I did find that the spray on version of this was NOT very good however and went back to this concentrated form.

6141	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	All I have to say is wow! I used it on my wife's Honda today and IT WORKED! It's a simple application too.. no sanding, no extraneous buffing.. just squeeze it on an applicator and rub it in! It just plain works well! Not sure if any of you have oxidized lenses on your bikes or cars, but if you do, consider getting some of this! I'm impressed! (I taped off the painted surfaces, just FYI).

8680	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These are about the same price so did not save monies, just not having to drive to the store that is miles away.
6823	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product
7932	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	A direct replacement
My only complaint is that the "neck padding" is extremely hard and painful!  As the item is pictured on Amazon, it just looks like a soft rubber pad, but IT'S NOT!  It is a very hard rubber bone design that becomes painful after about 5 seconds of resting my head or neck on it!  Basically, it is completely useless for what it was designed for!  The only options are to either flip the thing around and place a different pad on the blank end, or roll up a soft towel and hope it stays in place while you are working!  I mean for this amount of money this thing costs...I almost expected the thing to lift me off the ground and stand me back up, but a decent neck pad would have sufficed!
If you lose power regularly you are better off charging the battery for 8 hours before putting a load on the UPS.
997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Value priced, worked like a charm. Did not leak after filled with used oil and very easy to dispose of contents at the local recycler.

2245	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used to rub out a scratch in my F150
2301	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I installed this in my ford van.  The sound level is plenty loud enough for me, as I want to keep people from walking behind me in the parking lot, not alert the people in the next state over that I am backing up.  The reason I don't like this product and can not recommend it is two fold.  First, the beep beep noise is actually like a beep beep squack squack beep squack.  The pitch changes all the time and it actually is embarrassing.  It was my fault that I called to inform the company about this like 6 or 7 weeks after I got it, as it was just not high on the list of things to do.  They have a year warranty.  Well, they want me to pay the shipping to return it.  I explained to them that while I did fail to call sooner, I am not a liar and the product was bad upon receipt.  I already blew 25 bucks on this piece of junk, so I'm not sure I even care to spend another $5.00 to get a replacement.  That is my experience and how I feel about this product.  I bought this item at etrailer dot com and because of the way they are handling the return I learned the hard way that I should have got it from Amazon and now I know where I will not be shopping.  It's not a huge amount of money, but I have to budget every penny I spend so it affects me more than someone who might have discretionary income.
5280	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good light and all parts needed included
3027	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	this is the second one of these that doesn't work will not stay attached to valve stem.first one bought from auto parts store.my compressor maintains 170 psi- that could have something to do with the failures, but there are no warnings of how much pressure they will handle.
I really like this product and keep it on hand all the time. Great for the lawn tractor and tools too.
1266	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice well constructed riveter with adjustable head allowing flexibility for tight spaces.
6657	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This hour meter works nice in my boat. I have a Tiara Open 38 and bought them because every time we wanted to see how many hours my Cummins marine engines have being running, I had to send the keys to the mechanic to open the switch and look in each of the two electronic monitors that are installed in the cockpit's console. Now I just installed one of this meters next to each engine and the mechanic just goes there and knows if the engines needs an oil change or a certain service, without having to ask for the keys.
3934	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit my ST175/80-13 boat trailer tire perfectly
1390	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This pad it too soft and not durable, at all. I was lucky to finish lightly polishing one vehicle before the foam started tearing. I will not be purchasing or using this pad again.
7987	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked well for me on my dark blue boat. Took off all the paint oxidation other cleaner waxed could not. I used a orbital buffer and it worker well. I did not use a high speed machine. Follow the instructions on the container and you should be good to go.

1457	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product after a long time of using its other model (LCD display).  I was happy with the other one, but hey, what if I have to read my tire pressure in the night with no light?  So, this is the BEST solution to this, RED Backlit so you can read it in the night or when it's pretty dark!!
~$35 locally, ~$19 on Amazon = "cool beans!" as my niece would say.  :)
8017	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great  strap, Very well made.
When you first plug it in its okay.... But, after about a half hour of running this fan gives out the most god awful high pitched screeching sound. This fan could surely be used to get information from rag heads in their cells. It would be better than water boarding. After listening to this fan for an hour they would sing like canaries...
it fits like factory one with more airflow, you can notice that by 6.2L exhaust sound.
3458	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's Rain-X. I have been using this stuff for 20 years and the quality has always been consistent. When you do a fresh appliciation, you can almost drive without the wipers on a rainy day. Not recommended, but it is pretty wild how the water just slides off the glass.
7982	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My father before me used these ever since I was a child. Now I have little ones and they help me load up the trailer as I did my father. This set is perfect, I have all three ball sizes at all times. I also have the case that holds them so it's really easy to store them. I expect years and years of use out of them just like my fathers set.

3. Move the Absorber along in relatively slow motion, allowing the water to soak into it. Wipe half of one topside surface, such as the roof or hood. Wring out the Absorber, then re-wipe the area to soak up the residual moisture. Repeat those two steps for the rest of your car. If you're getting streaks, wipe a little slower. (A chamois is not designed to be used quickly like a rag or dish towel.)
6335	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got a couple of these for my generator.  I decided it would be good to have some backups as it would be terrible to have the spark plug go out in the middle of a storm/power outage.  Gives me some cheap peace of mind!

5859	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Kind of a ridiculous thing to review, but this is awesome.  I did not have a cover for my hitch plug and it would always corrode and refuse to make a good connection.  This little plug stays put and keeps the junk out.

When it did work, it worked really nicely, though. The power cord is nice and long; it was able to (just barely) reach the bed at the back of my standard length ford cargo van. The blanket has a nice texture, didn't feel cheap, and also the electronic part of it didn't feel too obtrusive. If the blanket had worked out, I was intending to put in a new cigarette lighter in the sleeping area for it.

I really enjoy washing the bike now since drying it is not such a pain.  No water spots on those hard to reach places.

I've tried the multi step sanding method with a drill on 6 family cars over the years and well yes that works too but its laborious.  That's why i switched to this and finished in record time.  I used a drill mounted polishing pad and completed this is record time.  Spray some clear coat sealer on top and done. If you find that this review was helpful please mark it as such.

9154	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Seems to work well so far heats up fairly quick
798	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	It will not work with a gravity feed.  Must have a fuel pump behind it to provide enough pressure for fuel to pass through.  It would have been nice if this was noted in the sales details.  I found this item when Amazon listed as something others bought when they bought a carb. rebuild kit.
9139	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For anyone who gets cold in the car this is a must have. I put this thing on me when I first get in the car in the morning on my commute and it keeps me toasty until the car heats up and the heat can do its' job. This is a great product.

8928	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the only bike pump I bought that always makes me smile when I use it. I bought this at $6, tax included, delivered in my front door. Cheaper than Walmart. It has no bells and whistles, just a plain pump which delivers air to my kids' bike tires. I don't need a gauge. I already have a tire pressure gauge to do that. Pretty durable. Used it 2x/month for 5 bikes. Still working after 6 months.

Perhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.
I loved it so much I purchase several more.  You can't use it in town, it's too loud. However, I have seen animal move off the road when they hear it coming. This is not perfect, because a sound that would scar them completely would be best.

5282	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	They aren't the brightest 55 watt bulbs out there because they use H3 bulbs, they just don't put out that much. But these lights put out plenty to flood the area behind the car. So don't have any doubts on that. And yes the output is a flood light. I added pictures above to the product to help show that they are. The kit comes with a wire harness, 2 lights, and 4 big zipties. They zipties are definitely big and I didn't have issue using them to attach to my hitch. I'm running these lights off a relay.

If you are considering buying shorter cables and have a newer vehicle, first make a note of where your battery connection points are located at and determine if a shorter cable would really work for you. Many newer vehicles (especially trucks and SUV's) are putting the battery in strange places and the recommended connection points are located apart from the battery, sometimes in a location that requires a longer cable.  And, even if your car has the terminals right up front, the nice person offering you a jump start might not!

I can't be any happier with the results.  The bench looked good after assembly, but a bit dull.  After applying this once, it looks great.  I'm about to add another coat.  I'm excited to see what it will look like after three full coats.  If one is any indication, it should be really nice.
The Honda bolt is torqued down to 181 ft lbs from factory. Trust me, it's on there. At first I thought an impact wrench can take it off, NOPE! You just have to take my word, it's still tough to remove it, even if you have an impact wrench that is rated more than 181ft lbs. You can refer to the pictures of how to remove the bolt. This is basically the exact setup I used to do 2 timing belt jobs on my Accords.

Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the "dead" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...

941	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice tool. Very hard steel that is great for deburring metals and such chores as removing blemishes from woodworker's hand planes and surprisingly I've learned, woodworking. I've used this more lately to scrape wood before and after finishing than for restoring vintage tools. Overall a very handy tool for a machinist, mechanic or a woodworker. The wood handle is rather nice for a tool in this price range but the finish on it left a lot to be desired. It was full of abrasive feeling bubbles and very rough. I had to sand most of the clear off to make it comfortable.

70	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a fine publication. Well written and the dialogue is presented in a friendly fashion. Many tips to help the novice wrench. Much cheaper than the factory manual. The only beef I have with it, is the pictures are not as good as they should be for a modern publication. The other thing that might bother some, is the measurements are in metric. My feeling is that it is WAY past time for us to not be using metric, in all our systems.

If you have a boat, this is the only marine adhesive sealant to use.
3006	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you cant see when its raining, its because your windshield is contaminated and pitted from age and road debris.

They don't realize their windshield is so pitted is why they cant see.

6097	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	First of all, if you are thinking of using this to restore your old, hazy, yellow headlights, then just forget it.

6098	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a 2006 Honda Civic Coupe LX. My car sits in my driveway here in Hawaii and the lenses got so bad that people asked me what was wrong with them. For an '06, it shouldn't be THAT cloudy. I'm a waxaholic. I'm sure the build up of wax, cleaners, combined with Hawaiian Sun oxidized the darn out of them. I tried a lens restorer I found on ebay for $5 and it worked somewhat, but not enough. I got Maguire's Plastx and I could not believe how well it worked. I uploaded pictures on here so you could see the difference.
2066	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The duster is perfect size and comes with a plastic bag to carry in your trunk, It works great in dusting the interior of the car.

1533	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product!!!  After installing it I ran it's load up to 100% of rated and it ran without a glitch.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat.
2046	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As described. Works fine.
7457	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The name really says it all. I keep this shammy in my trunk at all times. Just ring it out, roll it up, put it back in the tube and it is ready to go next time. Does not get moldy and it is machine washable.
If it broke, for sure would replace it.
But if you are looking to clean headlights, give this a shot before spending much more money. Ive seen restore kits and all that, but unless you think your headlights really need it, and your lights are in really really bad shape, this will probably work fine.
I've done 3 recent services on our hondas
I'll come back with an update if there are any issues.
5724	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great
3427	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It truly works. Needed to come back and write a review here. That's how amazed I was! It is a much safer way to drive with less intrusion in vision out the front and the back. I used it on all windows and the sideview mirrors.
3663	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works fine

UPDATE: 7/22/17 I emailed the company and they assured me the problem had been corrected so I ordered another one. Arg! Same as the first one. I've already got it boxed for return and won't be ordering another. Probably be okay in a kennel, but not in my camper. Downgrade from 3 stars for the hassle.
*UPDATE: It has now been over a year since I have done this review, so I thought I would give some feedback about observations I made recently. The product and air filter still work great! However, I would highly recommend using a "less liberal" amount of oil. When I looked at my spark plugs, they were very rich due to an excess of air filter oil. How do I reduce or prevent this? When applying the oil, apply it to only part of the filter and give it a good twenty minutes; theoretically, this will allow the time needed for the oil to naturally absorb into the fibers of the filter (as they say in the instructions... anxious me). Less excess, less spark plug buildup, and maybe an extra charge out of the kit! If you experience the buildup on your spark plugs, you can just take a wire brush to them. However, blow them off well before re-installing them. We don't want particles in our cylinders :). Also, as a result of a reply to this post, I found out and affirmed through K&N's FAQ that unless you are in an excessively dusty environment every day, K&N's recommendation is to clean their air box filters every 50,000 miles and their conical filters every 100,000 miles! It is very dusty here in Arizona, but my 10,000 mile recharge is still way too frequent. Thank you Gator J. I pray this helps!

Sorry to have to update an item with poor results from one of my favorite companies.  After just 2 uses, the foam broke apart at higher speed and rendered it useless.  And I wasn`t hard on the pad either.  Porter Cable should send me a replacement since the cost should be offset by decent lifespan.

Before getting this Hotor I was using a little broom and dustpan. Don't judge me. When I was offered this vacuum at a discount in exchange for an honest review I was eager to use it mainly because I NEEDED it, and I was curious as to how well it would do.
1193	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Turns out everything needs oil. This oil can is so perfect and retro and awesome, I've finally stopped making do with WD-40 on things that should never get WD-40ed. And I'm putting a thin coat of oil (and wiping off) on tools like ax heads, shovels, mallets, etc.  My dad or grand-dad had a few of these, or the little ones where you push the bottom, and I finally know why. This is a tool I'll have for a lifetime.  I sould've bought it decades ago. Or someone should've given me one for a gift.

Very few electronics in this workhorse.  I much prefer the old school inverters and chargers with the large transformers rather than using electronics, as the electronic versions have always let me down by burning up.  I have been using the little brother PV1250FC for a couple years now without a hiccup.  We have upgraded our solar array plus we've been working the PV1250 really hard so we decided to upgrade to the PV2000FC.

6996	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The polishes and cleaners you use for painted metal surfaces are not effective (in my experience) when used on fiberglass.  I have been looking for a complete kit that was specific for fiberglass.  I have a Honda riding mower and a fishing kayak whose surfaces have been neglected because I've never found a product that is designed to detail fiberglass.  The Meguiar's M4966 Complete Marine/Rv Fibergalss Restoration Kit is unreal!  It cleans and resurfaces dull fiberglass and brings the surface shine back.  It still requires elbow grease however, so be prepared to be a Karate Kid - "wax on, wax off" :)

1475	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	used in my motorcycle, saved me a couple of times
6072	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It works beautifully!! Just like car polish but for plastics. The rag turned yellow from the oxidation. About as close to new as one can get without paying 600 to 800 bucks replacing both lenses. A restoration kit should be used first for really bad lenses. Then this stuff will take off what the kit leaves behind. It works great!!!!
8681	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this at a great sale price so bought a few rolls.  Very useful for RV cabinets, inserts to jewelry cabinets, tool chests, ... everything!  Lays flat, grips the bottom, and prevents sliding of anything on top.  Easy to cut straight, since you can follow the grid lines.  No curl up on sides, does not degrade easily with use, and washable.  Cheap too!  Buy some, and you will find some use for it.

6092	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was initially skeptical about any product claiming to produce a cleaner, clearer headlight lens with almost no work.  I have tried other similar products and found them to be a waste of time and money.  But my wife has been complaining about her headlights for a year so I thought I would take a chance with Meguiars and found, to my surprise, that this product actually works.  Before I used Meguiars, her high beams would shine little more than her low beams.  After Meguiars, the high beams were bright, and her low beams were back to original specs.  All this on a 10year old car that had the original lens.  Great Product.
4216	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I like this stuff, but do not think of it as a lubricant because it is for corrosion protection only.  I bought this after reading the Powerboat Magazine corrosion inhibitor tests.  It definitely protects better than anything else I have tried.  The negative is that you don't want to use this on anything you are going to be touching because it is a sticky yellowish film.  It will protect your stuff, but dirt and grime will stick to the film so use accordingly. This stuff sticks tenaciously, so if you decide to clean/remove it expect to use quite a bit of solvent and elbow grease.
541	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fast ship great product
7057	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I needed on a boat I recently purchased, where they had wired the plug too short on the trailer. This extension was the perfect way to add a few feet of length, and avoid having to mess with the wiring on the trailer. Great idea.

2- Consider the size of the extraction tube; three mm in diameter. Sucking oil at that! It WILL take time and plenty of it.
4027	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling.

1126	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good Product.  Porter Cable makes good application and buffing pads as well as a good D.A. Polsiher.  I will buy this again as needed.  And, the price is lower than other competitors selling Lamb Wool Hook and Loop Bonnets.  This is a value purchase.
5. Takes a little while longer versus draining the Motor Oil.
9443	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This pulley removal tool fits very sloppy on the harmonic balancer.

This last tube I bought however, did not make me very happy. Over three days to dry/cure. this was indoors.  I am assuming this is a very rare exception as this has never happened to me before. Like I said , I have used this 3M product for years and have always recommended this as a ,  pretty much ,  permanent flexible weld. Well worth every penny .  I will assume it was produced on either a Friday or Monday.

Charger is easy to install and I ran the cord out of the grill so no need to open the hood every time I use it. NOw I have a fully charged battery no matter how often I drive the truck. Best $20 I have spent in a long time.

For the purpose of this review, I mixed UV dye in the oilier with my WD-40, then took pictures using a UV light.  It clearly shows the problem areas.
8623	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	They really need to improve the design of this item.  The parts slide together, but are not really attached by catches or threats.  Thus, when you start pumping to create a vacuum, the mechanism wants to come apart.  For greatest efficiency, you need two people; one to hold the unit together and work it, while the other manipulates the hose.  I managed to suck the dirty oil out of my Troybilt mower by myself, but it took more effort than I felt should have been necessary.

Since I was in a hurry I paid for it and for the Oxygen Sensor related to the failure, a total of $300. So I decided to buy this scanner and it has turned out a terrific product, I am now charging $20 bucks to read codes on friends cars and it has already paid for itself twice.

2379	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This kit is great if you can get it installed correctly. I'm an engineer so I've got a technical mind and many years of experience servicing my vehicles. I still found this kit to be slightly difficult to install due to bulldog directions being wrong or unclear. This was installed on a 2002 dodge dakota quad cab. One of the ignition wires said it required a relay but I read from several sources that the ignition 3 wire was not required. I called tech support to confirm and they agreed, so I wasted 10 bucks on a relay and additional wiring, oh well I'll use it in another project.

Observations noted after the first and only use so far...
3655	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This tool works absolutely perfectly for antifreeze jugs and makes topping off antifreeze a no drip, no spill job that doesn't require a funnel or paper towel.  I invert the antifreeze bottle into my open radiator tank and then open this little gem with a small turn and antifreeze flows quickly and gently into the reservoir.  Absolutely no dripping or spilling... perfect.

When transporting, you have to be very careful. This isn't exactly the most sturdy design, but it seals well enough as long as it isn't flying around your trunk. I haven't had any issues with oil spilling out, but based on the material, I could see that as an issue.
4207	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Seems to work well to prevent corrosion. Smells a little funny and is not clear, but it works to prevent corrosion.

Now that Winter is approaching, I haven't had too many opportunities to see how this device interacts with the local critters but in the few opportunities that I have, this product has failed....miserably.

8321	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Its a very nice mirror and worked great for the first year. No loss of suction, never fell off. However, starting in year two, it would never keep suction. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cup; huffing a little moisture onto it prior to sticking, not huffing on it, nothing worked and so I went without a mirror. Plus you cant really make it go above your windshield, so it blocks some of the forward view. It was a quality mirror for the price, but now its in the give-away box. Will be buying a clamp-on that I can position above my windshield. So I do not recommend this product.
I applied this rubbing hard and then wiped it off with a soft cotton t-shirt. I did two coats on each headlight lens and was fairly happy with the result. It brought some of the shine back that the Wipe New had destroyed.
5533	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice quality product, sturdy, stylish, and easy to install.

1392	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a Nissan Altima, and the clearcoat is sun damaged. I didn't want to get overly aggressive with a polish. and used Meguiar's polish with a cut rating of 3. Worked just fine. The results are not perfect, but a 100 percent improvement over the original condition.
2943	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this not just for rain but to make it easier to get of normal water spots from washing or rain. Also to help reduce the pitting from sand and dust, plus ease in getting off bugs.

8282	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I read most of the reviews and was cautious but this mirror has a great viewing area and so far it hasn't lost it's suction on the wind shield of my boat. It has not moved in 3 weeks and my boat takes a pounding when we go offshore or have to jump wakes from other boats. I don't think you will go wrong if you purchase this mirror.
7801	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are constructed better then the ones I had before.
There are other designs addressing this problem. The three balls welded to a receiver didn't have the necessary drop. The switchable ball with the lever lock looked too mechanical. Rust, mud, ice.... anything could foul its operation. I went this route and I'm glad I did.
7909	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Strong one soooo good
3079	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits my 1985 Mustang GT great, just wish I bought the water proof one.  This one just protects against 'light rain'
RainX is great for conditions like this.  In higher speed driving, much of the rain just rolls off your windshield without being wiped.  Visibility is much better.
5397	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Cheap, does the job kinda...If I earned another 30k a year, I would probably purchase a real mirror, but since I am living the American dream, cheap for me.

2726	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this to have a place to put my trimmers inside my enclosed landscape trailer. It has room for 3 trimmers, and removes them from the wall enough so they are not touching the wall.  What holds the trimmers in places is a 1/4" spring loaded lever that presses against the trimmers shaft.  The spring on the trimmer rack and the lever lock thing is heavy duty enough that it will last.  I was about to post this review and give it 5 out of 5 but I noticed after a few days of using it and driving around a little bit I could see that there was wear marks where the trimmers shaft was being held into place, I put about 3 rounds of electrical tape on the shaft in a 2 inch swath and it seemed to resolve the issue.

8963	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I needed a tire pump so I could pump up my car's tires when they got low (yes, you can use a bicycle pump for this because the valve stems on bike tires are the same as the ones on car tires. It just takes a bit of time, since car tires are quite large in relation to the small size of the pump.) So, I walked into my local hardware store and looked at my options. They had one pump for $13 with a three year warranty, or they had this one for $10. I bought this one. I have used it to pump up my car's tires and it worked perfectly. It was easy to hook up, and it made an air tight seal to the valve stems. It did take a notable amount of work and time to pump all that air on such a small pump, but with a little elbow grease, it went fine. I prefer the simplicity and inexpensiveness of this anyway, as I do not need electricity or an air compressor. It also allows me the ability to easily stow it behind my seat and use it whenever and wherever I need it. If I get a flat in two years and my spare is low, guess what? I'll have an air pump.  Overall, it's a great little pump that does exactly what you need it to do. Note that you will need a separate tire gauge if you want to know how much to inflate your tires, as it does not come with one.
For those of you who hate this thing, you're obviously doing it wrong.


That being said, i now only apply to the side windows, moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles. The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well.  Another plus especially in the spring when pollen is rampant and not washed away with constant "April Showers".

Very pleased, especially with the results of the console arm rest. Since I used to live in the sunny southwest, I would have sunblock on a lot, which caused the black console to absorb up the white sunblock within the grooves of the textured finish. I didn't notice it at first, but one day while cleaning the car, I noticed the black armrest was now half white on the driver side. I attempted to clean it with the regular Meguiar's interior cleaners, but the sunblock didn't come out entirely. After some research, came across this highly rated product, so I decided to give it a go. This product did very well. After spraying it on and letting it sit for a few seconds, wiped with a microfiber cloth and the armrest was much improved. Furthermore, since the sunblock was removed, the stickiness of the armrest was gone too. Not much effort to clean at all.

Seriously, a very good pump that I have been using for a while to pump up a slowly leaking car tire, which takes a LOT of pumping to fill, so you know it's durable.  On suggestion is to tie up the bottom of the hose so that there is not a lot of motion where the rubber meets the steel.  I've found in other pumps that that is always where the failure eventually happens.
4545	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I enjoy woodworking and fill cracks, knots and repair wood on a semi-regular basis with blackened epoxy. I've mixed epoxy by hand for years so this was a massive upgrade. These pumps substantially simplify the mundane task of mixing part A and part B, and let me spend more thinking about the application.
I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new.

8351	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This item arrived in the factory packaging only, no exterior box like you would expect with typical Amazon purchases, but it was in good shape with no missing parts.  Pay attention to the directions and don't tighten any of the bolts/nuts until you get to the end so that everything will line up properly.  Luckily I had a ratcheting 17mm crescent wrench - my 17mm sockets weren't deep enough to tighten down all of the way.  The bolts could be better sized in my opinion - the length of the longest bolts are about an inch longer than they need to be in my opinion.  Maybe some rubber boots to cover the ends of the bolts that protrude would be good or cut off the ends if you don't plan on taking it apart.

I've used the extractor once so far with good results - I extracted the amount of oil I expected. The way the unit goes together is a little disappointing: the pump just pushes onto a rubber seal on top of the reservoir, and hence also can come off while pumping. The suction tube also just pushes onto a rubber seal near the top of the reservoir - and can prove difficult to get a good seal. It took a while for me to realize the very slow extraction (and need to pump frequently) was due to a poor seal. Make sure to push the parts together very firmly and it works well.

Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball.

It can't rotate, so it kind of drags along, plus if you hold it the wrong way the cutter actually unscrews and can fall off.  I ended up just paying the extra for the titemark and removed the worthless cutter and use it as a depth stop now.  At $10 buck its a waste of money.  If they fixed the cutter so it could rotate freely and was flush to the end, it would be a good value.  One thing to watch is that the fence doesn't lock down tight, so it can loose up and slide when the cutter is following the grain of the wood.

8004	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Paid much more at a national boating supply chain but very happy with the results.  My 2004 27-foot Cruiser has black side panels.  I've never been able to remove all the oxidation until now.  I used a double sided wool buffing pad and a variable speed rotary buffer.  I wiped a fair amount of compound onto a 2' x 2' area with a hand applicator, then machine buffed at no more than 2000 rpm using medium pressure. After a few swipes back and forth, up and down, the compound started breaking down.  I then upped the buffer speed to 4000 rpm and lightly swiped back and forth until most of the compound turned to dust.  Toweled off, it left a brilliant shine and mirror finish.  I finished up with Collinite Fleet Wax.  For the first time since acquiring it in 2010, my boat looked like brand new.

4228	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I am fortunate enough to maintain two houses - one in the mid-West for the summer and a second one in the Palm Springs area for the winter. Rather than drive 1500 miles each way I have a couple of cars in each location so each set will sit idle for six months of the year which means I usually have two dead batteries when I arrive for the season. I tried a cheaper brand of trickle charger in the desert last year and it worked but I was afraid that if it burned out I would still return to dead batteries. I really like the quality of the Schumacher products having two of their multifunction battery chargers that have worked well for over 10 years. When I saw that they offered high quality trickle chargers I bought two of them to make the switch to worry free charging. The chargers are well built and heavy for their size and the build quality is typical Schumacher. The chargers are intended to be installed in the engine compartment with battery connections that are permanently connected to the charger and for power a short plug comes out of the side of the unit and is easily connected to a grounded extension cord. I really didn't want to install these under the hood even though they supply the mounting brackets and screws required but I did like the idea of the permanent connection to the battery as opposed to a clamp which could fall off in the middle of the season and leave me with a dead battery. Remembering how the chargers connected in the Power Wheels toys my sons had several years ago, I was able to find polarity keyed plug connectors in the trailer wiring section of the local auto parts store and now have a short  pigtail permanently connected to the battery and the ability to plug and unplug it into the charger when I want. Now I have the best of all worlds, the security of a solid connection to the battery and the flexibility of being able to plug and unplug the charger with ease. I like this a lot.

I used it on my pressure washer, big Billy Goat blower, Honda lawn mower used for trimming and a 48" zero turn lawn mower a SCAG Freedom. Other than the SCAG the other powered items were difficult to change the oil in and always resulted in a messy cleanup. Almost immediately I changed oil in all of the lawn equipment. The Hydro-Turf is well designed and I followed the instructions in regarding to pumping. The tubing that goes into the dip stick is easy to insert and sucks out the oil easily with no mess. Another feature I like was the transparent tank is marked with quart hashmarks so you know that the right amount oil has been extracted. After use I elevated the hose and it completely cleared its self of oil. The unit comes with a handy pouring spout that is easy to empty the container. The pump detaches for easy storage. My usage has been  limited so I have no idea of long term durability but it seems to be a  high quality well thought out product.

I can run this all night long on a 12 volt inverter plus I take it outside with me during the day when there's not a natural breeze. A little pricy, but well worth it because it's sturdy and well made of hard plastic. The only thing I don't like about it, is the legs/ feet. They come loose a lot when you swing them in and out.
1605	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've had a Club (regular) for many years. Worked fine. Just bought two of these new as an upgrade and because of their reputation. One stopped working not soon after a month of regular use. It was too late to return it to Amazon. Figured I would call the company and see what help was available. I left my name and number. No response at all. Partly my fault because I misread the warranty info on Amazon. The physical club warranty is for parts only. Pretty sure I would had had to pay for shipping to repair it. Since I never received a return call, it's just a thought. The actual warranty promoted in the description is for damage to your vehicle if it is stolen with the Club Lock in place. The registration form which comes with The Club that you have to mail (no online registration) requests all kinds of ancillary information, such as your income, auto insurance company, license plate number, and other otherwise personal info that should be kept confidential until needed, in my opinion. I forgot the time period restriction for the registration but you have to include an original receipt for the purchase - no copies. You can question the manufacturer - Winners International. I actually find it humorous to consider filing a warranty claim with them for vehicle theft. For what I paid for this item, I would at least have liked a call back from the company. Will be looking for alternatives. Hope this clarifies and helps when considering purchase.

I tested the item right away to see if I could charge a depleted battery that was still "good" so I left my lights and key turned on until the lights went so dim I could barely see it.  Then I pulled my other car BEHIND the dead car, hooked up a multimeter on both car batteries, *****turned the key to ACC on the donor car (otherwise NO CHARGING)*****, and started charging.  The circuitry actively "pushes" the juice from donor car to dead car, so it's not just an equalization between batteries.

Take off the garnish, hold it in place with bungee cords, and seal edges with dish towels.  Now it's not the fanciest get up, but it does work, provides access to the on/off speed knob, and you can flip it.  My only complaint, like many RV specific products, is the price.

This also means that you have permanently stored a spare key inside your vehicle in a place where every car thief will know to look.

  I did have one of my clamps break after using the charger successfully for a couple years. One clamp broke exactly in the same place described in other comments I read here. Mine broke after about three years of use but, in all honesty, it was my fault. I let the hood down on the clamp while it was attached to my battery and the clamp broke. Maybe a metal clamp would have held up to this abuse but I doubt I would have liked the burn mark in my hood... maybe right through, or possibly badly marking the light blue paint  from heat?

No oil has leaked out of anywhere, so as long as I mind the tip and pump lever I can store it on any surface without worry of oil drip. The pump is precise enough that I can dispense any small or large amount of oil I want with ease. The flexible spot is helpful for getting into tight spaces, but like any of that style flex shaft it does not perfectly hold the position, so guiding with your other hand is recommended. I would buy this again if I needed another type of oil to dispense.

88	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this Haynes book thinking that it would give me the specific information I need to upgrade my cars to R-134a.  I picked it because of the 2000 publication date.  BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.

4662	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have bought this brand for YEARS and been totally happy with every purchase. What they don't tell you about this little charger is that if it isn't plugged in to an AC outlet it actually DRAWS power from your battery. The eyelet connections implies you can hook it up and plug it in when you need to and leave it connected to the battery. This is not the case. Had this on my generator battery and it charged perfectly. I unplugged the ac cord and left the charger connection attached to the battery. Came back 3 days later and the battery was completely dead. Used another charger to charge it again and noticed that the red light on the original charger illuminate (it was not connected to ac at this point). When I pulled the other charger off the battery the light stayed on and began to discharge my battery again. If by "fully automatic" they mean it will automatically fully discharge your battery, then they are accurate. Very disappointed.

7491	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Generally I never give a one or two stars to items on Amazon, but in this case, one or two stars is a gift.  Yes, the item will absorb as advertised, but compared to other chammies, I am not so sure. The reason for a one star is that one cant wipe or clean up with this item; it will not go over any surface with out hanging up, twisting, etc.  I bought two of them and will return the other.

2933	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a 1-ton pickup truck and this unloader is wonderful. I have used it to haul and unload 15 tons of roofing debris, many tons of garden mulch, and all kinds of other difficult to unload materials. The unit is exceptionally well made and works as described. I have loaded it to 2000lb and other than a little effort at the handle, the unloader just slides the material from the truck. When I was unloading the many loads of roofing debris other people at the unloading site were struggling to get their loads off their trucks. I simply backed into position, dropped the tailgate, and wound up the handle. I unloaded 2000lbs of debris (in each trip) in less than a minute. I did manage to tear the unloading sheet on some nails (entirely my fault since I didn't stop unloading when I heard the rip). I went on line and ordered a new sheet and received it in a couple of days. Installing the sheet took a matter of minutes and I was back in business. I highly recommend this product.

This patch kit may suffice for a small, well-defined puncture on a smooth part of the tube, but otherwise, it's a roll of the dice.  You really can't choose what kind of flat you will get, so I can't recommend carrying this kit.

Third, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).
4361	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I would not buy this charger.  I used it for maintaining my boat batteries during winter.  When I initially plug it in and connect it to the battery everything seems fine.  However, later when checked it the red LED is flashing and my battery is completely dead.  At $100 minimum for a marine/deep cycle battery this gets really expensive fast, especially when I need to rely on my battery while on the water.  This has happened multiple times.  There is not indication on-line or in the manual what could cause this behavior.  Also, Schumacher claims it this charger is okay to leave connected while not charging.  This is clearly not true since it drained my large battery to 0 multiple times.  When not powered this charger will drain your battery.  Beware of using this charger.  It is better to just charge you battery and disconnect it than risk drawing it down to 0.

Even though it is supposed to be a "high volume" pump, it took just as many strokes to add 5 psi to the tire on my SUV as the piece of junk bike pump I had gotten from Wal-Mart prior to this one.  On my second use, the hose started leaking considerably at the base of the pump.  I used a cable tie to seal the hose to the base of the pump, and the hose burst.  Stay away from this- don't understand why it has so many positive reviews.
8571	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Attempted to use on my boat's 7.4L.  It would only extract about 1/2 quart after battling it for 20 mins.  Too late to return it.  Waste of good money.  Stuck looking at it in a box, forever.

We might run in to a gas station or eat lunch and not worry about the bikes but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR LONG TERM OR OVERNIGHT USE but then again if you bought this to use overnight I'm not sure you're being fair to the intended use of this product. Product is perfect for short term bicycle or other item needs.

Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.

(UPDATE June 2013) I recently bought a used motorhome and went through the same process as I did with trailer in this original review from 2 years ago, JUST like the trailer it brought back the shine to new. I did discover that using the machine and just the McGuires fiberglass restorer compound. The wax in kit is great stuff but I find myself going back to a wax call Protect-all RV wax I used it for many years and following up with The Protect-all wax even brought and held the luster a long time plus the wax has UV inhibitors in it so it is a complete wax for any fiberglass or car finish. Tried McGuires Flagship wax too, makes it sparkle  but it goes on heavy and comes off harder leaves a film if you don't keep changing to new towels!!!!!!!!!!! Once you get your finish back the Protect-all is all you need to keep it that way forever as long as ya do it once or twice a year. Protect-all goes on easy comes off easy leaves high long lasting shine

So anyhow the points I want to make are these. This kit is for fiberglass, not paint, and a lot of boats have a top coat of paint. Hand rubbing is an enormous chore, and if you have a larger boat, at the least you should invest in the Wen mentioned above, or better yet the Porter Cable while exercising some caution. Only if you have a deep desire to master a polisher over time, or are already an accomplished polisher do you need to think about the Makita. I could write a book on polishing techniques, and if you use the Makita on your car, with just one wrong angle on an edge you can burn the finish right down to the primer.
1434	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	EASY TO INSTALL,BUT I FOUND OUT THAT IF YOU UNPLUG IT THAT YOU HAVE TO RESET THE DISTANCE TO THE CAR,SO I WAS WONDERING IF THE POWER GOES OFF AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT, WELL, THE RED LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON UNTIL IN MY CASE , YOU WILL BE TOO CLOSE AND BAM GOES THE WALL. I THOUGHT THE BATTERIES WOULD BE A BACK-UP WHEN THE POWER GOES OFF BUT IT SAYS NOT TO LEAVE THE BATTERIES IN IF YOU PLUG IT IN. ON THE GOOD SIDE IT WORKS VERY WELL WHEN THE POWER IS ON  BILL

3745	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a small electric 4-cycle Honda generator for emergency electrical backup.  Because the generator is something that I use VERY infrequently it is essential that I remove the fluids (oil/gas) with each use.  I needed something small(for convenience of space) and reliable, as I don't want flammable liquids falling in the wrong place on an electric generator.  (Bad combination).  I also use this for my 4-cycle 150cc scooter for regular oil changes.

4618	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've got a 25-year-old Benz that over the last two years has developed an appetite for batteries.  Somewhere in my car is this little demon who couldn't be found by at least three mechanics and AAA but who within four days of inactivity will drain the battery.  The local Benz dealership said that it could take days of analysis to pinpoint the home of the demon (which could cost $125 x countless hours) or I could get a trickle charger (imagine, a Benz service specialist suggesting that!).  So I found the best one I could!  This is made to mount either directly onto the chassis of the car or onto this neat bracket that slips under the battery.  In my case because of the density of the area of the battery, neither would work.  But this charger is so small, that I was able to lodge it snugly into the cables and such so that it doesn't budge.  Too bad they don't provide a longer power cord --- I had to use a 6' extension which I cable-tied to 'stuff' out to the front bumper where I have a convenient port for attaching towing lines.  So now I plug in my car every time I come home.  If you do something similar, here's a hint:  Tie a red ribbon to the door handle or windshield or do something to remind you that the car is plugged in --- you don't want to drive off with the extension cord attached --- LOL!!!

2561	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Very disappointed. I like how it's made in the USA but after 2 days of being on my truck in San Diego it was covered in rust and the handle was corroding. I don't know what paint this batch had but it's terrible! They really need to do a better job at coating it...
UPDATE: Second use, I decided to get the oil good and hot so it would flow better. Well- about the time the oil got to the 4 or 5 liter mark - the housing sucked in. I guess the hot oil softened up the plastic housing and the vacuum was too much for the housing. I tried to blow it back out after emptying it but by then the plastic was cold and hard. Had to fill it with hot oil, let it soak, then us compressed air to return it to sort of normal shape. The instructions don't say to avoid hot oil, and it really needs to be  hot otherwise this thing is just silly slow. And back to the beginning - this tool was supposed to make oil changes easier and less messy. This time - I got oil ALL OVER THE PLACE! Plus, I had to use my air compressor to make this thing SORT OF useable again. The canister needs to be stronger and more tolerant of hot fluids or else this thing is a dud. Too bad because it's a great concept.

Basically, unless it's drizzling and you are going 10mph, the rain and your speed make the rain just slick off of your windshield.  I would say it worked solid through at least 5+ hours of rain and wipers, no sign of it wearing off or working less.
Mistook one of these for a squad car spot light comming around a bend.  It will slow traffic down.

Lately, I have found that having this equipment along with my car's repair manual has saved me over 2k because I can now diagnose my own problems (to a certain point of course) and find my own method of repairs whether it's self-repair or other businesses outside the dealer.
2531	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Product shipped on time and works as described. It replaced a similar cargo net that worked fine for about two years of regular use. It is very handy and does a good job of keeping things in place. The adjustable hooks on the straps work well.

8245	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The rear view mirror in the car has fallen off three times in the past few years (always in HOT weather), and I am tired of putting in back on. So, I bought this to stick on the windshield where the original mirror mount was. Works great, very sturdy, and gives a better rear view than the original mirror. Pretty much eliminates the blind spots. Does has a wide-angle image, and takes a bit of getting used to, but provides a safer view of what is behind your car. Plus, cleaning the inside windshield will be easier--I'll just remove this mirror to make the job go faster. No more trying to clean the smears around the permanent mirror.

5016	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I do not understand this thing at all. After soaking it in warm water and using it, it moves water around, but doesn't absorb it and certainly doesn't leave my car dry, it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car.

5769	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Another great product from Meguiar's.  I used this in conjunction with the 3-M restoration kit I bought at my local glass store.  It further refined the plastic in the headlights.
8340	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great
I docked one star though because i've found (thru multiple vehicles and uses) that my wiper blades doesn't seem to last as long after it has been applied.  I've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue.  I haven't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that isn't an issue if you use them, but it is def noticeable with other commons brands... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones, it seems to affect the life of them all.

2086	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I spent the money for a Superwinch s5000, so I wanted to spend a little more to protect it from the elements while driving. This cover does fit well, but the straps do not go under the winch. I think I will try re-mounting the winch with a flat steel spacer to provide a little bit of clearance. Should do the trick nicely.
2345	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This product works well but you will have quite the learning curve if you haven't installed one before. Their website has good information and there is an installation cd included. THIS PRODUCT ALONE WILL NOT WORK WITH CHIPPED KEYS! Works well on older model cars. Range is acceptable, will work if the car is out front or a few doors down but won't work a full city block away.
The only reason I went with 4stars instead of 5 is one key was cracked and can't be used on a key ring and there was no instructions (not a big deal but should've been included)

9454	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent tool.  It does slip a little if you are not careful, but makes it a breeze to remove the bolt.  I used a breaker bar in the hole on the tab and wedged it against the ground.  I only had a 3 inch 1/2" drive extention which gave me little room to work with.

8632	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great little tool!  I live in a building with a indoor parking spot in a common area and have little area to work on my scooter.  Oil changes are a bit challenging because of it, until now.  This thing is very simple, small enough to store and doubles as a used oil container until I feel like taking it to the auto store for recycling.  The construction of the handle is a bit chincy, but not so chincy that I feel the need to take away a star.  About 20-25 pumps and its enough to suck the quart out of my scooter.  Being a little suspicious about its ability to completely suck out the entire quart of oil, I took the plug out to check and it got 99.999% of the oil out, just a little dripped out when I took the plug out.  I will probably do a conventional oil change by removing the plug every few oil changes to make sure theres no sludge or metal in the screen.  Unlikely I'll use this for car oil changes as I have to get under and remove the oil filter anyways, but, for small engines that don't have filters or for engines with easily accessed filters it's a great tool!

2448	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I like the fact that there's no loop at one end so you can feed it through small openings to lock tools.  I mainly use it to lock two pressure washers inside truck beds.  With other locks, I could only lock the body of the machines which can easily be stolen if you just take the body apart.  Now I can feed the wire through the engine of the pressure washer!! and then through the truck rack!!
Installation: Advantage Trimax, the Master Lock is a 2 hands and a knee operation where I could close the Trimax with either a hand and knee or just 2 hands.

5557	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this thinking I would cut off one end to replace the 5 pin connection plug on my trailer and use the other end as a dust cover. Would have worked except my trailer connector has 6 wires coming out of the plug. My fault for not looking closely. I could have made it work with an additional splice but I opted for ordering the correct Wishbone Harness Connector instead. In case you, like I, didn't know what a wishbone connector is, the difference is in how the trailer is wired. My trailer has a dedicated wire to each tail light for the running lights. Some use a single wire to one of the tail lights and then a jumper wire from the one tail light to the other. In that case, you can use the Wesbar Wunside plug.
2036	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I keep this in the saddlebags and it gets near daily use!!  Quick and easy and does a great job!  Gets into tight spots and doesn't scratch the finish.

I went at it four times for a pretty long time each, maybe 15 minutes altogether and my results were very poor. I must need two steps more abrasive and then this, to remove what the more abrasive product will leave behind, because this did so little. But for my purpose,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-G2000/dp/B00P9OF04I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's G2000</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/G3000/dp/B004HCOE72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">G3000</a>&nbsp;would likely work better. Really though, unless I need it for my headlights also, I should look to another brand because these otherwise fine products are just a bit more and more expensive than what I need.
Having said all that, I installed what I could, and had a local installer finish the job. The cost of the alert and the install was $125. Yes it costs a few bucks if you are not handy and comfortable working on your cars electrical system.
Extraction is still quite slow (expect it to take maybe 20-30 minutes for a small 4-cylinder) but other tasks can be done while waiting.
6006	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does what it should, high quality and provides peace of mind! I would definetly recommend this to boat owners.  This keeps my $600 stainless sport boat prop save when trailering or when it's on the hoist out on the lake.

6370	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Love it. Bonds a lot of stuff. Only complaints: Says you have to use it up w/in 24hours of opening. I have been able to get longer times, but it is different to apply the older it gets. Also it takes at least 24 hours to dry and cure.

The pump doesn't secure to the tank so you'll have to hold it with one hand while pumping with the other.  This makes it difficult to adjust the tube to get the oil flowing.

2854	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's great to know that in a market awash with low quality import products that you can still get a US made tire gauge and at a reasonable price. I have other Milton gauges that I've had for 25+ years and they are still going strong. This particular gauge has a spring loaded return so that when you check the pressure on your water filled tires, it expels the water from the gauge otherwise it works like any other.

I use the battery in my running car to charge a deep cycle battery while camping and these seemed to transfer more energy, or maybe it is just the strong connections....either way they work. I might try going down one more gauge to see how well they work. But no complaints.

5932	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's a quality product and it works. Tried it on 2 cars and got good results both on moderate and extensive yellow haze.  This bottle will probably last for up to 20 cars.

It did make the moderately hazy 15-year old headlights on my own car look very clear again, and I can see the difference when I drive at night. If these had been the only lights I tried, I would have given PlastX 5 stars. But then I tried it on a headlight that was considerably more hazy, with a moderate pitting all over the surface, and some very hazy areas. On this light, PlastX didn't really make much of a difference.

5150	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good product for vinyl and rubber. We use it on our camper's vinyl cover.
1179	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This can does not perform well.  I blend a mixture of 60 vis nap oil and acetone for a penetrating oil formula.  The fluid leaks out of the cork washer at the flexible hose fitting.  Makes a mess.  The pump works very well.  The rigid hose works much better.
994	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	If this were advertised as a self draining oil pan, I would have rated it 5 stars!  We're not talking about a leak that is just a few drips, this thing leaks so much that it could empty itself in an hour.  I bought this at Wally World and returned it for a refund while it was still filled with oil leaking out of the small cap.  Just like everyone else has stated, it's garbage and not worth the used oil you dump in it.
9483	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	much better than buying a huge impact gun that would have been WAY overkill for just about anything that I work on regularly.
Keep in mind that in order for the compound to work it must be wet/damp, let it dry on the hull and you'll be wasting your time.
7631	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great and doesn't scratch the car, there is no better towel.
4628	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great Product.
8216	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I often travel with a slide in camper on my pickup and when at a campground, take the camper off.  That leaves me without a tailgate.  I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup.
What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.
8481	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm a pretty big DIYer, and I cant believe I didn't have one of these already.  Bought it to change the oil on my waverunner, but it will make life so much easier to change the oil in my snowblower, compressor, pressure washer, generator, etc.  Must have for every homeowners garage
2368	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When people at Lowe's told me about needing this, I thought they had lost it; however, if you have stainless steel appliances, you really do need this. Very cheap, for what they do!

5631	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm on my third one. The first one lasted so long it just got worn out. The second one was broken during a tow, rear hitch made some contact during loading. And now the third one. This is the only hitch cover light that works to my expectation. It works only as a brake light and running light. No awkard flashing in the center of my vehicle like all the other ones do (yes, even the LED ones do). This light is the only one that outputs usable visual light. All other LED variants are too dim to be effectively seen. A couple modifications I made to this light for better operation are: Tape off the light bulb socket and outer plastic of the unit with masking tape. Spray paint the interior with shiny silver metallic paint to give it more of a reflective result. Let dry and remove tape. No idea why the interior is left black, for less light reflection and output. This quick mod provides more light output. Another mod is also an easy one. Take out the 1157 bulb (27w/8w) and install a 2057 bulb (27w/6w). This will give your hitch cover more of a step up in brightness from running light to brake light for more attentive contrast. This also helps in overheating. The 1157 burns hotter with running lights on, very marginal, however it works to help reduce from the plastic melting at the top without the brakes on. The brake output is the same at 27w, it will just be slightly dimmer with runnings lights on. The bulbs are interchangeable.

2347	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	That was the first time I installed a Starter and I was very satisfied I was able to identify the wirings. Their website somehow has a compilation of color-coded wirings for every car/year. It was very helpful including the installation videos on the net. I noticed that there is a connector in my car where those little wirings seems to converge to. This connector is not connected to any. It must be for the T-harness they call it. I might have installed it easily if I have it. I have a car manual and I can read diagrams so it helped a lot in the installation. The only cons: The LED tester that came with it was defective. It only light up RED on positive hit only! So I used a VOM for the Negatives.
7054	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Item as described; So far so good; no problems with the harness even after being exposed to the elements for several days at a time. Better bargain compared to local store

9763	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I baught this air filter because the Chevrolet dealership that I am from was charging me somewhere between $20.00 to $28.00 to replace the air filter with an AC Delco one. This frustrated me so I decided to buy this filter. It says it increases horsepower and mileage, to be honest I have not noticed any major improvement in either one. This was not the reason for me purchasing this product however, I baught this from the stand point that I can clean it and reoil it and use it agian. The way I figure it pays for itself after two or three cleanings. I decided to give this a 4 star rating due to the fact when you decide to take this out and clean it you have to allow it time to air dry (which will take sometime). A piece of advice buy a regular air filter to run while this one dry's incase of an emergency or something and once the K&N is clean switch it back out put the back up back in the box and put it on a shelf in the garage for the next time you clean or as I stated earlier plan accordingly. Also this may or may not be worth noting but the filter is not quite as deep as the disposable ones. Thank you in taking the time to read my review I sure hope this helps.

I use this around my boat. Particularly on the outboard engine under the cover. It sprays on as a thin, brownish liquid smelling of coconut! When the solvent part evaporates it leaves a waxy, brown film. Not real pretty, but functional. Very effective in preventing rust. Use on levers, s/s connecting rods, fittings, bolt heads. Anything that's uncoated with rust or corrosion potential. Product remains flexible.

I wanted/needed an inverter that I could trust to run for months/years if need be without a hiccup for a reasonable price.  Past units I've owned have run VERY hot and then the fans would quit and eventually the entire inverter would stop.  Sure there are more expensive units but from what I've read from past users this Tripp-Lite PV1250FC will fit the bill and last for years.

My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.
6484	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Cant beat these things for drying off a car.  The first few uses are always hard to hold it while drying a car because it seems to want to stick to the surface of the car.

5608	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The first light that I ordered did not work at all when I received it. I put in a new bulb and it worked with the brake lights only, and not the tail lights. I  called Bully and they said it should also work when the lights come on and get brighter when you apply the brakes. I sent the light back to Amazon and another light was sent. The new light only works when the brakes are applied also. I still have the 2nd light and I do not think I could have received two defective lights in a row. It just does not work as the manufacturer claims that it should. I'm disappointed.

5326	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing works great.  I have used it a couple of times and does much better than the lambskin chamois I have had in the past.  It absorbs much more than the Lambskin and my car was spot free.  The real test was the sunroof on my car where the water tends to pool and leave water spots.  In the past I always had water spots on it.  Not anymore.  Definitely a must have for those who wash their car.  As another reviewer noted, these are at local big box stores for around the same price if you include tax.  I may pick up another for inside the house.

I use it to carry my full suspension 2001 Specialized MTB and my sons 24 inch MTB and we can get them both on without an adapter.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the top plate that holds all the bikes on the rack is one piece and all bikes must be on the rack before you can clamp them down. This is not a big problem but my friend has a much older version of this rack (about 10 years) and it had two different top plates to hold the bikes down, one for the back two bikes and another for the front two bikes. I like the old style better. It is not a deal killer and this newer design works very well, I just prefer the old version.

9448	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you have ever tried to remove the crank pulley while off a 1994 Honda Accord (I have a DX) without this or a similar special tool, you know that it is an exercise in futility. It is really difficult. Even with this tool, I had to use a 6 foot long pipe as a cheater bar, putting most of my 200 lbs on the bar to snap it loose (I would estimate it actually took over 600 ft-lbs to break it loose after 9 years of not replacing the timing belt). As other reviewers have mentioned, it does fit a little loose in the pulley, but I don't think it's a dealbreaker, or a reason to drop it a star. Once you set up your breaker bars and put a little pressure on it, it will stay in place for you to crank it off. In this way I was able to break the bolt loose by myself.

990	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this generator from Home Depot about 5 years ago.  The longest single use I got out of it was for a week with hurricane Isabelle-it paid for itself.  Other than that I probably run it 30 hours a year.  I use it to power a 1.5 hp well pump, a refrigerator and the blower on my propane hot water heater.  We can shower, flush and eat-the important things in life!  These three things max it out but get us by. It could have a better wheel/handle design-it's hard to move around.  I had to replace the carbureator (water got in and froze up-my fault) and a low oil pressure switch-which collects sludge and just needed to be cleaned.  The filler cap/gas gauge was useless and the low idle mechanism is screwy.  I added a screw-on oil filter, which it didn't come with, although later models do.  It runs like a champ.  If it meets your needs I'd buy it.  I'm presently on backorder for a 10,000 ($1800) watt, 18 hp Honda engine generator.  My suggestion to anyone buying a generator is-get the chart that comes with  generators and figure out in advance what you want to power and buy accordingly.  Good Luck!

Overall I am impressed with the workmanship and specifications for the price. Hopefully I will never need them: but if I do, and they do not live up to my expectations, I will update this review.
I also had a shop indicate initially that they were going to charge me $75-$100 to diagnose the check engine light until I told them what the code(s) were, and he immediately scratched it off and replaced it with "Verify engine codes, with a $0 charge.
When i checked the charger, no LEDs were lit. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. No change. I unplugged it, waited a few seconds, and plugged it back in. Then the red charging LED lit up.
1554	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Five stars are for the seller. Delivery reality was quick and delivery expectation was long. I love it when non-prime things show up early. The price is right for this kit as well. Yes, it looks like a mess of plastic and just a line drawing of the screw mounting would be nice, but for the car it went in, an '04 Odyssey, this is about all there is. All the parts were clearly labeled, the instructions were in the IKEA stick figure "cut off everything blacked out" vein, pretty much a no brainer. I built mine on a desk, radio, harness and all, and it dropped in like it belonged.

The mop end design is gentle on the car's finish.  Can't say anything about durability yet.  The parts seem sturdy enough.  The round knob that is used to push the water out is comfortable.

672	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I finally bought one after reading all the reviews, the product is good for moderate use not for professionals I believe, it claims to have a 4 gauge cable (flexible weldering style) it looks a little bit less than that to me but can't prove it with facts, clamps could be better they all have a different tension feel when you squeeze them (bit annoying) it comes inside a heavy duty carton with handles for storage and it's very compact for a 16 footer. Conclusion, a GOOD cosumer quality product if you are not looking and wiling to pay for the very best. I'm satisfied.

At 4 gauge, these could probably jump a semi. At 20 feet, you can easily link two cars together even if one is in a difficult spot. When life happens, you do NOT want to be stuck somewhere with cables that aren't adequate.

3638	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	used it to protect the spare tire on my trailer. good buy and quick delivery.

5812	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Delivery was fairly quick as usual with Amazon. The step is exactly as described. We bought a shell for our Dodge Ram truck bed so that my wife and I can travel and camp in the back. The shell has a nice rear door (opens vertically like an actual door) so that you can just step inside and close the door behind you (no tailgate or horizontal lift type door). The problem is that the back of the truck sits quite high and my wife had trouble stepping up to the bumper. We had previously used a plastic step stool to make this access but it was inconvenient as it always had to be stowed when traveling and was fairly large. The Bully Step definitely solves that problem. The tolerance(gap)between the step insert and the receiver varies by hitch brand I'm assuming as the little plastic wedge could not be installed exactly as per the instructions. Very little clearance in my case. I did manage to get it wedged in enough to function as intended though. Although we haven't done any real traveling since installing it, I have maybe put 100 miles on the truck just running errands etc and I can't hear any rattle or noise from the installation so the concept seems to work. The build quality looks good and there are no issues that I can see. Bear in mind that a 4 star rating from me is about the best I ever give as I reserve the top rating for something that far exceeds my expectations. My only hesitation to give it 5 stars is the fact that once installed it really isn't much lower than the bumper itself so it's still a bit difficult for my wife to make that first big step. It does extend back though which makes the footing and entry to the truck bed much more secure than trying to step on the narrow bumper itself. If it had been designed with a compound angle to position it one or two inches lower, it would have been perfect.

6500	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good product. Absorbs liquids easily. The only negative for me, the size makes it a bit cumbersome for me to use easily.
180	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's what you would expect from a Haynes manual: concise, detailed, pictures of the parts and repairs being done, etc. I've been able to keep my 2001 Frontier on the road now with over 164,000 miles on it, no serious repairs, and all the basic maintenance being done in my home garage.

8690	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice mirror.  The size is perfect to stay out of the way and the adjustable side mirrors give great range.  I am able to have it off center  so it's not in the way while cruising, but can still get the full spread of a slalom run.  The clasp is rubber on one side and plastic on the other so it won't scratch your window frame (which was very important to me).  The only small nit is that the clasp has a loose piece of plastic, so if you take it on and off you'll have to be very careful not to lose it.

Fifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).

P.S. I'm in the process of selling the car. Before I found Maguire's some guy tried to lowball me saying that the headlamps needed to be completely replaced which would cost over $500 in parts + labor costs = about $1000.  So, if he's right, I just saved myself $1000 on the value of my car. Thanks MAGUIRE!

These are definitely light duty and they feel it (super light weight).

3819	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Product came damaged, so I returned it. Quality was not what I expected and for the price not worth it.
This cord lasted only 4 uses. On the 5th use it caught on fire and burned my $90 Toro leaf blower. On the packaging there are the words "LIFETIME WARRANTY" but when I contacted Coleman Cable they said that their warranty is only good for items that didn't work at all, not for items that failed after use (sounds like an excuse). So I lost $40 on the cord and $90 on the leaf blower.

After using it for a few days, there are no streaks from the wax.  The brush is very solidly made with a wooden handle. It looks a lot more expensive than the price paid.  Highly recommended and a must have.  I will try their mini version for the dash next.
I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car.  Will try two for the car on wash number two.  Maybe that will make the job easier.

Red light comes on when my vehicle is in the exact spot where it was when I calibrated the unit, which is the whole point.  My last unit had a switch where you could select the distance where the red light came on.  Choices were 1', 2' or 3'.  This unit is much better at letting you know precisely where you want to stop.  All you have to do is mount the unit to the wall, park your vehicle exactly where you want it, turn the unit off, then turn it on.  Calibration takes a few seconds, then it's done.

8843	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this at another online vendor. I love my club. Driving an Acura TSX, the shape of the steering wheel where it convexes out due to the airbags prevents the use of most steering wheel lock devices. However, this club 1000 unique "U" shape allows it to fit over my steering wheel seamlessly. Picking up the tool, it has a fair amount of weight to it and seems to be of high quality. Even though my vehicle has standard factory OEM anti-theft alarms and locks (not aftermarket), I use this for further visual deterrent. Even though it might be overkill, you can never be too safe. Just oil the metal sliding arm with WD-40 or oil every other year or so and you should have a smooth operation. Simply use the key to unlock the device, you don't need a key when pulling the slide out to lock the device. A+ Product
1307	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this to replace the battery in my APC power supply. Arrived quickly and fit perfectly. Quality is a 5, price is a 3.

7682	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car.  The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying.  The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts.  I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle, which works very well.  I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows...then go back over it with the chamois.  It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good. You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash.  It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois.
1493	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great package with everything in it, if you want an emergency generator. Not something I'd recommend if you're putting together a solar system - but can be re-booted from the car or a set of solar panels. Convenient, neat.

4664	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've had my Schumacher SE-1-12S / 1.5 amp battery charger for several years now with no issues or complaints what-so-ever. In fact, I have several for all my vehicles, including my Motorcycle. First off, they are one of the best chargers out there. Durable and resistant to all weather conditions. Hook up is easy and with this model, you can permanantly mount it to battery, fender,or firewall. Keeps battery charged at around 13 volts. Automatic float charge when battery is full. Schumacher has several models of this type charger. I have used them all w/ the same results: Best product for the money. Recommend this model and all Schumacher battery chargers and products. 5-Stars!!!
181	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent Jeep Manual. Easy to follow instructions, diagrams, etc.
As an aside, the wrench is no longer included with the kit (it's not listed on the kit package labeling).  The tire levers are EXCELLENT, and they nest together, so I'll be keeping them.  I have a seat bag, and carry an extra tube, and have ordered a patch kit which uses glue.
8961	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A couple years ago I bought a "fancy" pump - chrome, twist-on connector, wooden handle, pressure gauge. It looks nice in the garage, but always hated screwing the connector on and off the tires. Finally gave up on it and bout this pump with the quick-flip connector. Much easier! Not as good quality, but 5X cheaper and will probably last me 10 years. Worth it! Wish it had a pressure gauge, but for the price...

Update: after almost 2 years of daily use some of the sections have started to break. It was a good run. Still a five star product and I'll probably buy another.
7351	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the same absorber for over 10 years!  I have only used it to dry my car.  I use the absorber first to get the bulk of the water off the car then finish drying the car with a microfiber towel.  I do sections of the car with my method, not the entire car at once.  I am sure I could get by with only using the absorber but I don't to take the chance of having water spots on the car.
 Now here's what I did in addition to the instructions based on some other reviews I read including one where Another reviewer said no matter what he did he couldn't get more than 2 quarts out of his engines see #2 about this issue.
I believe if you don't use it as a hammer and beat on the ice, it'll work just fine.  The one bad review I see here makes no sense to me.  If it wasn't right, send it back for credit or a replacement.  Amazon has a great system for that.  DUH!
3677	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I usually consider this kind of product as snake oil- but when I priced the cost of a new plastic window on my 1990 Miata, I thought it was worth a try even if it turned out to be a dud.

9028	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Love this air blaster. I almost wish I would have just gotten the bigger model with the two motors.
One thing I thought was funny, I opened the package and saw a piece of paper inside, asking me to "register" the Club, as if my car was stolen and I could prove the Club was defective, they would reimburse me $1800. First of all, how can you prove that? Also, if you read the fine print, the amount of paperwork they want from the police, affidavits, papers from your insurance company stating how much your car was worth and how much you were paid for the loss (what does that have to do with them?), proof of any insurance settlement, etc....it probably isn't even worth the effort. If time is money, you could easily spend weeks getting all this paperwork together, and even then they might deny you, it's their call. I would honestly love to meet one person who ever got the $1800 from them.
4613	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Took wax right off textured trim. Followed up with Meguiars M40. Looks great and has lasted through a few rains.
4020	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this for oil-changes on the Yamaha EF2000is inverter.  Works fine, it's narrow enough for that job.  The Yamaha inverter has a messy oil change procedure, but that's because of the inverter, not this funnel.

9573	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have never bought a K&N filter that was not the best of quality and this one was no different.

If you keep a fluid that as a solvent in it like some penetrating oils it will ooze from the solvent evaporating and creating pressure in the can. Or if you keep the can in unheated garage with big temp changes. Just leave a rag around it or leave it on an oil board. Every old school oilcan I have seen did this.  Not a big deal.

53	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This a great in between car wash vacuums.  I typically use a shopvac to clean my cars out but that can be a hassle as I need to get extension cords and lug the big vacuum out of the basement. Of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. I like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and I keep this in the trunk. The power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door CTS) without any problems. I have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.
4139	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My riding lawnmower plastic gas tank was leaking badly.  I tried stopping the leak with a couple of other sealers, including J-B Weld, without success.  Finally I used the Seal-All Adhesive.  It stopped the leak, saving me the cost of a new gas tank, over $75.  I highly recommend this product.
1003	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Bought for oil changes and whatnot.  Mine actually worked decent most of the time.  It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said.  My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split.  Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it.  Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website.  I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail.  I thought that was nice of them.  Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out.  Would not recommend this product.
This includes the revised instructions to wipe off with a wet towel instead of dry.

I use it often but especially when I am going on a long vacation drive.  It improves your driving safety in inclement weather and helps to keep your family and you safer. I use it on the outside of all of my windows of my vehicles.  It is good for rain, sleet and snow and even reduces the amount of bugs that will stick to your windows.  The treatment lasts for about 3 months.  It is only recommended for glass.
9928	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I was under the impression that this device was made of a soft material that would protect my car doors. It isn't and it doesn't. It's just as hard as the walls in my garage and provides no protection. If it were made of a softer material I would recommend it without hesitation. This was a complete waste of money. A rolled up towel stapled to my garage wall would work better.
it was still a bit of a task even with the true breaker bars, i actually had to put a extra piece of pipe on the 3foot breaker bar for a bit of extra torque!!! the smaller breaker bar had a sturdy heavy duty pipe (from a 3ton floor jack handle) on it to keep it locked against the frame of the engine stand.

3779	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It does it's intended job very well.
  The instructions on how to determine broadcast rates would have you wasting a lot of material.  We just had someone follow me, starting with the gate closed, then gradually opened it until we felt the width and material spread was right given the speed I wanted to run on my quad and the size of the food plot...slower for the narrower plots and faster for a wider spread on the large plots.  Since I broadcast in two directions to get good ground coverage on the food plots, we keep the initial flow rate at an estimated half of what we want to put on the plot for the initial pass, to ensure that we do get some material on the entire plot before that allotment runs out, then open the gate further on the second pass if we have more than half of the allotted material left to spread...takes a bit longer but we get better coverage in the long run.
2340	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was a little reluctant as some of the reviews said it was difficult to get support.  I went online downloaded all of the documents, and then emailed support before buying to see if they would respond.  I always received emails back within the same day or next day.  Once I ordered I found it pretty easy to install, and the tools it came with will be helpful for some.  It installed with no problems, I did ask tech support some additional questions specific to my 2001 jeep and all were answered.  This has been great and have already started using it in the morning.  I am not sure on the remote reach, as I connected to my Viper Alarm also purchased on Amazon.  This is a great simple unit, although I do not have a factory alarm or transponder key to mess with.  I saved myself close to 300 on the install!  So far thumbs up!
6545	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you have to drill a hole in your boat, trust this sealant. In my opinion there is no better product for above and below the waterline. It is a bit messy to work with so keep a roll of paper towels handy. It does exactly what it claims and once it fully cures, nothing gets past it.
9260	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This blanket is perfect for those days when the car seems to take forever to heat up!  In addition to being a nice blanket you can plug it in and it heats up pretty quickly.  It's great for if you're traveling and wind up with one of the back seats that doesn't quite get hit with the heat.  Also nice if the person controlling the heat is perpetually warmer than you are.

2667	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a big dent in my car's bumper. This did work well by getting glued to the bumper but I just couldn't pull the dented portion out. Though the dent still remains it's not because of this device, rather it's because I'm not strong enough to pull the dent out (I'm not that big!).
2492	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I read a review on another Trimax lock that said this SXT3 will fit Toyota hitches but this one did not work on my Tundra...it was close, but not long enough for me to get the lock engaged.  Trimax offers a dozen or so locks but only the SXT5 or the T5BLK have a 3.5" vs 2 3/4" span of this and only the SXT5 is available on Amazon.
167	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I am finding this book to be very useful. The book provides troubleshooting advice that I have never received from anyone in the auto repair industry. I recently took my car in to a garage because the check engine light came on. They read the trouble code from the computer, saw that it was related to the cooling system, and immediately recommended that I replace the water pump. And since I was replacing the water pump, I might as well replace the timing belt too. Total cost $2000! The book offers several no-cost/low-cost fixes to try first. This book also suggested replacing the valve core, to resolve a slow leak in a tire. I took the tire to two tire repair shops, and neither one suggested that. It might be because the valve cores cost 50 cents, whereas they could sell me another tire for a lot more. I no longer have any faith in the auto repair industry.
9269	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The cover was EXTREMELY difficult to get on. It took my husband a very long time and he is strong and mechanical. He said if he ever had to take it off to get to the spare he would just cut it off. Not worth the hassle.

Keep in mind that the scanner will likely not give you the fix, but rather in most cases point you in the right direction, you will have to research a little to resolve the issue.  Nonetheless, I could not have solved the problem without it.  Spend the money and get the tool, you will feel empowered and not so helpless when you see the service engine soon light.  The scanner's screen display menus will help you along, they are very helpful and you will likely not need to even read the manual.  It's very intuitive and no batteries required,it will get its power from the cord once you hook it up to the car's computer.
8631	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Tried this on a 2000 SAAB 9-3 and there's just no way you can get the tube far enough down to extract more than 1/2 the oil. But I'm rating this 4 stars because the product worked effectively when it could pull oil...easy to use, not too bad to clean up, easy to store away. Didn't work out for me but I can't penalize the manufacturer for my car's layout. Just beware of claims that it'll work on any and all motors.

1877	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had the larger version of the CC Duster when I had my '41 Olds which I sold along with the duster.  Had it for years and loved it.  Bought another antique car and wasted no time getting the duster again.  It's great.  The secret to satisfaction and effectiveness is to do what it recommends before using it:  Let it sit on some newspaper for two days to absorb excess paraffin (and put a small weight on the brush head forward of the handle to equalize the brush weight on the paper and change the paper every so often to ensure absorbtion) and you're good to go with no wax streaks on the car.  Works like a charm.
2227	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, at a reasonable price, with an easy interface. But I think people need to understand that this isn't a box of answers. It's a diagnostic tool. I was a professional automotive technician, I grew up working on cars, and I received a formal education in automotive technologies. The OBDII system is pretty complex, and can point you in the wrong direction. This is in no way the end-all be-all car diagnostic machine, but it's pretty dang useful to have in the tool box. For the price I paid I got exactly what I was looking for.
7781	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Easy to apply, sets to a smooth hard surface if correctly applied.


1330	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Exact replacement for the original battery.  I know several other folks mentioned that their battery appeared used and/or old, but the one I received appears brand new and its form/fit/finish is just like OEM. The only reason not to rate a 5 is that it came with only minimal charge on it - which is not a show-killer but it is unusual.
It does a great job and will blow water out of places you won't get with towel drying. I can wash my Harley and blow it off in about 35 minutes. Hope this helps!
To keep mine fresh and growth free, I've simply machine washed it (only with my microfiber to prevent lint transfer) after every single use. Making sure to store it as dry as the washer wrung it out. Sometimes I go months without using it, and it may be rock hard, but ready to go the moment I drop it in some hot water. I find it absorbs the most if I dip it and wring it in hot water before drying a car. It seems to open the pores of the PVA.
8550	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After having always changed my oil via the drain plug I was a little unsure of this gadget, but the 25 screws holding the belly pan on my car pushed me forward. I have to say I am a convert. The graduations on the side of the tank confirm  how much oil you gave pulled out of the engine. I allowed the oil to get just warm, not hot, and started the extraction process. It took about 30 minutes which is no worse than jacking up the car, crawling under, pulling the filter and drain plug and waiting for the oil to drain. This is much simpler and cleaner. The unit worked perfectly.
3068	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I bought two covers made from this material.  It does not hold up.  Both covers are completely trashed after less than 6 months on use.  Both covers were put on sitting vehicles, the damage is not from wear and tare of being put on and off.  buy a more expensive cover. It would be a good cover for inside of a garage.  NOT for outdoor use.

1751	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm a freak when comes to cars and detailing them etc- Read instructions take out of protective cover and let dry out on a piece of newspaper for 48 Hrs. before using. Works real good and have been around a long time-Good quality.
4411	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great
That said, I was very satisfied with my purchase.  I liked the heavy-duty steel-and-rubber construction.  You could probably drive a car over it and it would not break. My only complaint was that the rubber suction cup left a thin film on the metal that you were trying to pull, which was a little tough to remove.
4593	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I can dry my car with this rag and not ring it out once.  So it really does absorb.  I thought I'd never give up my chamois, but this does work better.  Can be thrown in the washer (but not dryer) for easy cleaning.  I only have one complaint.  If you store still damp in the provided container (which is the recommendation), it does have a slight musty smell when you take it out.  If this gets worse over time or with longer storage, I might change my mind about rebuying.
6289	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well, keeps the trailer from moving after disconnecting from the tow vehicle.  These are light weight, compact, and easily stored in the basement compartment
7166	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Sucks a lot of water. Works good for drying your car. Cuts the time of squeezing regular cloth as it absorbs more water. Will buy more of this in the future

5053	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are AMAZING!!!!  I have used one for about 10 years on my car.  After washing my van I dry it off with one of these and there are no water spots.  This is particularly fabulous on the windows.  I purchased more to have a 'clean' one to use on the inside of my car windows.  You do not let these dry out, if they do it is a pain to get them wet again!  THey stay moist in the container, and miraculously DO NOT mildew.  I love them.

Perhaps the clever name the manufactures gave it, do the product more justice.  The "Absorber", because that's exactly what it does!  I've been using mine for 5 years now to wash my cars and motorcycles.  It's about time I gave it the stellar review its due!  And yes, these are very popular in Japan!
1208	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this to apply Kroil penetrating oil to the upper studs of the front shock absorbers on my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander in hopes of loosening the nuts which were severely corroded onto the threaded shock studs. This pump oiler has excellent pumping action and volume dispensing of lubricant which is what I was after. It really gets the job done as moving liquids go. And it is well made with quality sweat brazing on the inner workings of the pump which are quite evident. The external handle and pump lever are strong and you can feel the force of the pump working to move the solvent or oil you are desiring to apply to whatever. This is extremely well made, offering many years of reliable service to whatever you use it for. I highly recommend!!!!

The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a "dead" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.
4417	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have installed 2 of these in two different vehicles that are infrequently driven, both just behind the grill with the cord tucked out front. They seem to be very weather resistant and work great at keeping the batteries maintained. The lights are a great quick indicator of battery condition. I will install these on every car I own that is not frequently driven.
We use the truck to haul a camper and we travel off road - like fire roads and the mud guards have held up well - still just like new as a matter of fact.
I love the fact that the entire Bone is made in the USA - that's one of the reasons I bought it.  The initial quality is very good and after several years of home use I'm still pleased with the longevity.
5300	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product for a few years and they work great. I like absorbers more than sham wows because I think they hold more water and is made of a tougher material. Be careful not to use it on really dirty or greasy areas because it is very difficult to wash it out.
They have stood up to the various demands of snow-blower operation, snow shoveling, dog-walking and snowball/snowman packing during an unusually cold winter.
3807	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does the job.
6593	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Amazing stuff.  Used it on a through fitting on my boat and countless times on my camper.  Listen up, if you don't use the whole tube,  seal the tip and put in your refrigerator.  Will extend its useful life for months.  Not supposed to hold up to UV as well as 4000UV, but I've tested it with great results after two years.  Although permanent,  it (or objects) can be removed with the careful application of heat.  A little goes a long way and a lot goes a really long way (as it it flows for days).  Very much self-leveling.
3344	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Tried it many years ago.  Hoped it would have improved.  Did half the windshield.  When driving under street lights at night in a light rain, the RAIN-x half looked foggy, and the untreated half was clearer.

8085	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great tool to have in the bed of the truck. Was looking for one of these locally but finally went to Amazon and got one. It's easier to use than some would have you believe. Jeeze, if you own a pickup you can use a ratchet bar... no?  It's quick and easy. Simply slide the bar out to reach the sides, ratchet the handle to make it tight, and then fold the handle down, or leave it up. The locking device allows the handle to fold down or to open up fully and unlock the bar.  It's not rocket science. It will keep boxes or bags by the cab or by the tailgate. I use it near the tailegate since I had to cut up my 2x8 that was used for this purpose. This is easier than the 2x8 for obvious reasons.
I am very glad we purchased it.

Sorry, I cannot recommend.
833	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit like the original
4188	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff really works to stop corrosion. Only drawback is that it comes out as a brown spray. It really coats whatever you spray and stays on.
9935	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit my 2004 Yukon very well.  I had to take the wheels off to make a good installation.
ADDENDUM (11 Jul 13): I just found on EHOW dot COM that a 3 to 1 ratio of toothpaste to baking soda will do the same job.  Wash lenses first with dish soap and afterwards with baking soda in water (rinse well after each wash).  I'll try it and let ya know!
I bought it because the reviews were good enough and I had a frozen drain plug I couldn't risk pulling this time of year. So it works. Good for emergencies or small oil capacity engines. To do regular oil changes on a car it is not a time saver.

1431	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased one of these about 8 years ago for myself and my wife.  We both loved them. So when mine went out, I decided to reorder.  The only complaint with this one, unlike it's predecessor is that it will not allow you to reset the parking distance from the wall if you need to be in close. With the prior unit, I could set it to let me come to within 6 inches of the wall.  This unit keeps going red when I get to about 1 1/2 feet.  I tried resetting it many times to no avail.  If your garage space is really tight and you need to park really close, I'd suggest looking at other products.

6692	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I read the reviews and because of them, I was a little reluctant to order this item.  That said, I let me pride for the USA and my personal desire for this product to override my concerns about whether or not it would fit (Figuring that I could tweak it if it didn't work as described). I'm glad I followed my instinct and ordered this because this worked perfect on our 2003 Ford Expedition.  The size is perfect and the product is a high quality metal with what appears to be a baked enamel paint.
3976	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	For the purposes listed, I thought this funnel would be great, and if it were $1, it would be, but it is overpriced by 500% for what it is. It is very small, and since the size information for items on amazon is hardly ever accurate, I assumed it would be 3 times the size that it is.
6045	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	OK
7893	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Folks need to understand that this is not a security device. It may keep a child from unhooking your coupler, but that is about it. That is not why I marked it down. I marked it down because the advertisement reads "This is made of solid brass." NO, IT IS NOT. Brass does not rust and this device does. This is the second item, in this order alone, that included false statements in its description. From now on, if the description does not say "made in USA" I am buying from a different web site.

752	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The motor works fine and replacement of the new motor into the existing mounting brackets worked nicely. The hardest part of the whole replacement is getting access to the old motor in the attic and removing the fan blades from the old motor. Once the old unit is removed the rest of the replacement is rather simple. Once the wiring had been connected and electrical current restored it ran just as had been hoped. The hot weather has not arrived quite yet, but I feel confident the motor will work well. This appeared to be the exact replacement of the motor than had frozen. This should work nicely for anyone needing to replace a frozen attic fan motor.
6393	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Highly recommend this sealant.  Permanent seal
6708	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best sealer for above and below grade water sealing.  Cure time was just under what was stated by the manufacturer, and that was an added bonus!  Below grade performance in salt water I have seen zero leaks even at 8ft underwater.

4300	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I am sort of on the fence. It does not seem to control the odor. We live aboard our voat, the holding tank (20 gallon) gets pumped thoroughly every week. Yet we always have odor. The hoses have been replaced and that did not help. It's a very thick, viscuous liquid, blue, resists being mixed with water a little. Sort of the consistency of honey before diluting. If I could find something that actually killed the odor I would be a happy, happy girl.

Works great on 911 Porsche with 2 12volt batteries wired parallel and one charger charges both batteries.
1279	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Over the last ten years I've used this tool to pull maybe 2000 1/8" diameter blind rivets up to 3/4" long in soft aluminum aircraft engine cooling baffles.  It is tiring on jobs that require more than a few dozen at a time, but the swivel head makes up for that in awkward, hard to reach places where major diss-assembly is the only other option.  For repetitious or heavy-duty work with easy access or Cherry-Max and Riv-nuts we use hydraulic and straight-pull manual pullers.  That said:  A rivet tail occasionally sticks in the tool and needs to be fished out:  A drop of 3-in-one or other light oil works wonders. There is a nut in the handle that needs occasional adjustment or a self-locking nut or Lock-tite.
9823	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	W0W.....This filter fits exactly like the OEM filter But will allow much better air flow to my big V8 & save me sum $$$$$ @ the same time. I recommend this unit to anyone looking for added performance & mileage. A+ "Can't beat K/N"

For example, last night I drove 150 miles in occasional light rain.  I did use my wipers once to clean the windshield after I had been following a car on damp roads (no rain for that stretch) for 10 miles and had a film of dirt on the glass.  Other than that, I had no problems, even on winding hilly two lane roads in central Missouri with lots of oncoming headlights.  And I haven't refreshed the coating on that car for a couple of months (I told you I was bad about that).
3337	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It does seem to work as promised.  I coupled this with Bosche Wipers.  The Glass treatment alone seems to be quite effective in repelling water at high speeds and having this with top of the line wipers makes it invincible for rain

8442	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This rugged, high-power battery works well in my 2003 Yamaha FX-140 Waverunner. It is more expensive than the lead-acid and AGM batteries I've used in the past, but lasts over twice as long (do the math). It requires some spacers (made from a 1 X 2 trim board) to fit the existing battery tray, but otherwise works fine. This is my second Odyssey PC625. The first one lasted 7 years. I replaced it with a new one just to be safe. I am keeping the old one as a backup because it still holds a charge.
***UPDATE*** 5/21/2016
It does take a while for all the oil to get extracted but it really beats getting under the car and creating a huge mess. Just make sure all the accessories are plugged in all the way so it gets a good seal and you should be good to go!
During the spring, winter and fall I only run it when my truck is running - Drinks stay as cool as I'd like them to be

8334	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Amazing product
The real bugaboo is that the actuators are plastic. Ordinarily, this won't be a big deal, keep them lubed and they won't wear out. Don't use pliers EVER and they won't break. Sadly, my hubs got very hot due to a braking issue, and the dang plastic pieces actually melted. The hubs went into partial engagement, with ugly grinding noises and the potential for lots of metal filings getting into my wheel bearings. Bummer.
Cons
660	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Super heavy duty, may be overkill to boost a car, but better overkill than having wimpy cables.  I really like the clamps, they seem to be very well built with copper surfaces.

925	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are well-made and manufactured in USA!!  There is not much to say about jumper cables, but some of the ones you see at automotive parts stores are pretty flimsy and the conductors look like they are significantly smaller than the gauge marked on the packages.  These 6-gauge are suitable for cars with medium size batteries such as compacts or older models.  For a new sophisticated car with lots of electronics and a big battery (BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, etc.), I suggest 4-gauge cables instead.

2369	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is perfect for cleaning up the crusty burned things that seems to appear on the glass top stove.  Cerama Bryte scraper and pad work wonders with them.  No hard scrubbing just a little scraping with the blade and the spot is gone.  Sometimes I use liquid stove top cleaner, but for quick clean ups just use the scraper and the pad.  They are safe to use on the glass cook tops and are the only things I would use to clean my stove and keep it looking like new.  I have been using scrapers on my stove the whole time I have owned it and never had a problem.  This is the only way to keep your stove looking nice, shiny and clean.

8892	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	My wife and I recently purchased two bikes that have been sitting awhile and the tires needed some air. We thought this would be a great economical pump but while pumping up the second tire the hose sprun a leak at just 35PSI! We didn't even get a full bike operational by the time this thing gave way. Luckily, Amazon refunded our money promptly. We have since shelled out a little more coin and purchased a quality unit. Spend the extra money and only buy on pump. You never know when you will need it and the cheap one fails you.

2278	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best wax on the market, I use a lot of wax. The only time I get "wow your car looks nice" is when I used turtle wax. This compound is better for older paint jobs, key hole scratch removal etc. you'll need to be a car person or own a buffer to use this, otherwise they make the same thing in liquid it's easier to apply and get off then this compound here. Either way it works.

Overall I am satisfied M10 did what it was intended to do, but for deep marring or oxidation you will need to step up to a compound like Meguiars M105 or even a full headlight restoration kit. I highly recommend the 3M headlight restoration kit (see my detailed review on this kit):&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3M-39008-Headlight-Lens-Restoration-System/dp/B001AIZ5HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3M 39008 Headlight Lens Restoration System</a>

I have some cheaper versions, which are not as strong but the ratchet is on the end so you can easily reach it, over the side of the bed and lock it in from the outside.  Other than that these are well made and ratchets tight and secure just a hassle to secure due to having to get into the bed
9239	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite gift that I bought for myself! I work at night and in the winter have to sit a few minutes to let the car warm up.

So impressed with the charger finally mounted in engine bay, hardwired and without hesitation voided my warranty.
2165	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I haven't used the warming feature, but this worked well for cooling on my cross-country road trip.  The other reviewers that recommended plugging in to pre-cool it are definitely right!  My mistake was in not getting a wall adapter when I ordered the cooler.  One reviewer said it came with one, so I didn't worry about it.  However, now I see there are some questions about that and answers show it doesn't- just the car power cord.  The day before departure, I went all over town trying to find one. (WM, Target, K-Mart, Menards, Cabelas, truck stop)  I was happy to find one at a truck stop along the interstate.  Unfortunately, that didn't work and I didn't find out until I got to the hotel late that night.

This arrangement makes stealing a car much harder for younger, less experienced, "grab and go" car thieves.  The usual method is gain entry, break off the key lock with a slide puller, then turn the internal lock mechanism with a pair of pliers.  The car is gone in 60 seconds or less.  The technique is reputedly well known to young teenagers.
4785	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is amazing, i could not believe the speed of which it dried my car and left it without smudges. I cut mine in half since it was so big and therefore was able to get help wiping my 2011 Toyota Highlander down, which is a relatively big car that wqs dried in less than 8 mins. Love this Absorber.

6746	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This stuff does work, but it is a lot of work to buff out an entire RV even with an electric buffer. I have a 2001 30' class C minnie winnie and used about 1.5 bottles of the oxidation remover. There was enough polish and wax.

1469	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I got a very small leak on a bicycle tube.  Too small to see, but could feel the air.  I followed the directions exactly, then slowly pumped up the tube.  It was flat by the next day.  I removed the patch, then repeated the repair.  This time, I used a rubber roller to firmly press the patch to the tube.  Same results - in less than 24 hours, the tube was deflated.  Do not waste your money or time with this kit.
 Another great feature is the locking collet. I had a body shop for 20 years, did a lot of high end cars, personally spent more hours on a 7" polisher than would be believable if I stated it, seriously, and  locking collet would be a dream come true. Most polishers have an allen wrench based nut in the center of them, which holds the rubber backing pad to the shaft. When it is time to change a pad, it is often frustrating, because of the center nut. All you can do to change the pad is hold on to the backing pad, and use an allen wrench. That resulted in a slipping backing pad, sliding around the spindle. To have a locking collet is an engineering dream for a polisher.

I keep this product in my car.  I have always just rolled it up after I use it and keep it in the provided tube.  Even when it goes several weeks between uses, the Absorber is still slightly damp and ready to use.  This is extremely important, as anyone that has ever tried to use a dried out chamois knows...  I had thought that keeping it in the tube would maybe make it smell or get mildew or something like that.  Not the case at all.
Overall, a great product for little money and you can avoid calling tech support if you visit the website first.

They are custom made for the application so there is absolutely NO sliding around. They fit snug! Hold melted snow and mud nicely. No worries of that leaking onto the carpet with these either. Highly recommended. Shop around. Find your application and the color you need then search for that part number here at Amazon. I did and received them within the week. Also received FREE shipping which made it that much greater.

1801	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far - so good.  This is the first time in over 60 years that I have seen the need for a car duster since I have never before lived in an area that dust is the primary thing to remove from cars.  I have used it several times on our Corvette located in Palm Desert and am very pleased that it does what it is advertised to do.

I bought it after trying several other "drying towels" for after you wash your car.  This product is by far the best.  It doesn't leave any lint or fuzzies on your freshly washed car, and it drys the car better than the other products too.  I was a  little skeptical at first because it doesn't look or feel like a traditional towel, but I'm a believer now.
567	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice pad.  Doesnt fling off, didn't matte up easy, well protected sides.  Boy does it send fluff everywhere if you go a little dry on the polish.
I'm attaching a photo of the registration form,because it's so funny. They are asking me to "register the Club", but it's obvious they are only collecting information for marketing purposes! Why do they need to know my: income, education level, age, etc?  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses. Of course, you have to "hurry and register within 5 days of purchase to be eligible!" And some states (like mine) aren't even on the list, for some reason. Why would a state refuse to allow a company to reimburse me for their product being defective? Something sounds fishy.  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses.

The other option is to stick with a single AC powered pump, but get an external 12v DC battery with a DC to AC inverter (like this one) and use it like you would with a UPS for a computer.  You can't simply use a normal UPS though as they cannot handle the current draw from a sump pump.  You also cant simply use any inverter as it only changes DC from a car battery to AC for your pump, you also need one that will charge the battery and keep it fully charged at all times.

If you're interested, I saw a tool called the "Power Breaker Bar" (there are different types and styles from different manufacturers) which essentially is a breaker bar with a pivot point on it that you hit with a heavy hammer to provide a single-impact shock to loosen the bolt.  I've seen it used in a video and it worked like a champ.  It's not a Honda specific tool, but would definitely come in handy for this application.  If you're frustrated with your Honda to the point of setting it on fire, give that Power Breaker bar tool a look.  Hope this helps.

And then then large loop that connects to the wire that's supposed to be a retainer (when not covering the plug) is also too loose.  Completely fell off a couple times in the driveway before I lost it completely.  So it fails to protect the plug from the elements, therefore fails in its purpose.

8918	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I loved this pump at first but than after 2 months of weekly use it developed a leak in the hose line. This is not acceptable. I spent $30 for a Spin Doctor pump from the bike shop and it is going on one year with no issues and it has a guage so I know how much i am putting in. This deluxe hand pump is also harder to use because the little metal feet that fold out are hard to keep from moving while pumping. I would imagine this pump would be good if you would need it just a couple times throughout the year but for sustained use it would be best to look somewhere else.

I have seen fewer deer using this and have seen deer a half mile away staring toward the car. I now have installed these on all my vehicles. Nothing can guarantee you won't hit a deer but for the cost of this unit why not install it.

That said, I used this manual to work on my Legacy wagon for years before I sold it. I gave the manual to the guy who bought the car from me. It is good for describing things that are unique to Subarus and to the Legacy in particular. It is a great time-saver when you haven't done something before on that type of car. But if you are going to be doing serious repairs on the car, get the manufacturer's service manual instead and save yourself some time and frustration.
Some battery maintainers have a built-in timer that is activated when the charge cycle completes, and only checks the battery voltage again after the timer has expired - many products use a 24 hour timer, so they maintain charge by charging the battery a maximum of 1 time per day. This will not allow the use of 12v accessories when the engine isn't running - the battery will simply drain.

8103	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use this to secure a bed frame in the back of my transit van. It works great and is easy to use.
I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new.

8179	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It can be difficult to get it lined up right and ratchet it tight without feeling like I'm about to screw up my truck bed, but it's easy enough to sort out and holds well. Having two people does make it easier/quicker. I haven't used it with anything really big or heavy yet and I don't drive like Sheriff Rosco is chasing me, but so far it does a good job keeping stuff in place. There's even a hook you can hang a bag or something onto. I'm guessing that's what it's for anyway. It ratchets and releases simply enough, but I can see how it could nick or pinch yourself if you're going too fast or something. I still have time to get injured though. It also sits nicely behind my back seat. It seems solid and well built overall, but I don't use it on a daily basis or usually need it to hold big/heavy stuff. I suspect for my use it will hold up fine... your mileage may vary.

The scanner does exactly what it says it will do. I've now used it on a Subaru, a Volkswagen and a Miata and it worked fine on all of them.  It gives the trouble code reported by the computer which turns on the MIL.  It also gives a text explanation of the code and if the code is manufacturer specific it tells you that as well.

I bought the box to store them in. I also bought the plastic stem cover but I think it's unnecessary expense since I don't take a ball off and drive around due to the type hitch I have when I am not towing. I take off the whole ball mount and leave the hitch in the receiver.

By the way do not use this kit, or any polish in the direct sunlight which can take polish residue and bake it into a hard line in no time that is a pain to remove.

6822	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I was really looking forward to getting this fan based on the reviews I read.  I am going on vacation in 2 days and want to take this along for some tent camping on the way to and back from Disney World in Florida.  I anticipated the feet not being to great since it was mentioned in the review but found two other problems right out of the box.  The 12 volt DC plug in has a problem with the spring on the tip, it just loosely moves in and drops out when you face it down.  I have seen this sort of thing before and should be able to fix it.  The other is the fan switch.  It has a springy feel to it and doesn't correspond to the numbers on the dial.  When you flip it to the next speed, it springs back a bit.  It doesn't effect the speed and all the speeds seem to work fine.  I think I just expected the workmanship to be better, certainly not befitting a sixty five dollar item.  Will update review when I get back from Disney on the 19th of June.
This crawler rolls very easily, seems to be impervious to uneven surfaces, is very comfortable and low profile.
854	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is made by the people who made the engine, so of course it works!  I guess I had forgotten that it comes with the pre filter, as I was surprised when I saw it in the package.  It's important to keep a clean air filter on any engine, and when OEM parts are affordable, all the better.

7016	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This kit really is everything you need to restore a boat or RV to like-new condition. The kit Kit includes Meguiar's heavy duty oxidation remover (M4916), boat/RV polish (M4516) and gloss enhancer, boat/RV pure wax (M5616), soft foam applicator pads - 3PK (X3070), microfiber towels - 3PK (X2020), and a "mirror glaze" apron. I used it on a 4-year old fiberglass boat as well as on a 10-year old camper. The camper took a LOT more elbow grease, so to speak, but both came out fantastic. The oxidation remover fixes moderate oxidation, scratches, stains and water spots, whereas the polish and gloss enhancer makes the surface look nearly new. Finally, the wax gives a shiny, high gloss finish while simultaneously protecting against UV rays. Typically kits like this have a few throw-away items to make it look like you're getting more value than you truly are, but in this case everything is top quality, works as advertised, and honestly is a solid value. Recommended!
5033	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For most of my life, I used real chamois, because I'd heard synthetic is bad for the paint or removes the wax. Such a fool I've been! This thing is awesome. I did my whole car in about half the time, and didn't even have to wring this out once.
4072	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Handy pack of materials for color matching and repairing gel coat chips. You need to take your time mixing for color matching.  A little color tint goes a long way.  Don't add the hardener until you have the gerl mix color that you want.

1834	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I always told myself that I would never get another black car.  The are absolutely gorgeous when clean,  but stay clean for about a day.  Any dust shows on the things.  Well,  I broke that promise to myself and bought a black car that was too nice to pass up.  The challenges to keep it clean presented themselves immediately.  Spend an afternoon washing and waxing,  the next day it would already start looking dirty.  Then came my California Car duster to the rescue!  Love this thing.  A few minutes each evening keeps all that dust off!  Easy and quick to use!  Need to use it when the car surface is cool otherwise it streaks,  but first thing in the morning or after a couple hours in the garage,  no problem.  Highly recommend this product.

Bottom line this charger (maintainer) and the resultant condition of my batteries just awesome. Starting the truck with fully charged batteries more so.  Though the cords are a bit short for easy hookup in a large vehicle not insurmountable. My mods just for my use and don't recommend. If I had a complaint or suggestion other than longer cords would be a remote for the LED status lights. As charger is mounted in engine bay the LEDs aren't telling you much with hood closed, so pointless IMO.  Maybe a volt meter?
6854	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Alright, I have a 10 month old travel trailer with a dark brown front that was starting to get "white" from the sun.  I ordered this stuff hoping to restore it to it's glory.  I used a Griot's Garage orbital powered polish/wax applicator which is better than any job you could do by hand.  I saw very little improvement and it did about the same job as a bottle of $12 marine/RV restorer I got from Wal-Mart.  This does an alright job but not worth the time/money since you have to do 3 applications.
879	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this antenna to boost my signal on my laptop, Toshiba with Windows 7. I loaded the software but immediately started having problems.

8642	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It only takes 10-15 pumps to suck out 3 quarts of oil.  The end of the tube is stiff which makes it easy to stuff down the dipstick hole.

3060	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is the second light weight cover I have used.  I use it in my garage to keep the cats from leaving footprints all over my car.  I simply pull it off hang it on a hook at the front of the car every time I drive out and come back in reverse the process by keeping my car covered always . Works great.  I wouldn't recommend it for outside in wet weather where it freezes for that cover can stick to the car and tear easily when you pull it off.  That is why I have had tears in it during the winter months coming in and put it on a wet car then it freezes .  Really well done for the money though and makes a good fit .

1886	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I had the original that was 20yrs old or so and it worked really great. Got this one and right away saw it was around 3/4 the size of my old one. To be honest,  the old one was pretty big and heavy and hard on the wrist, so I was not really concerned of the smaller size. I use this on a 1997 F350 truck, so the truck is old now, go to use it for the first time, and I get 10,000 pieces of red fibers that fall off the duster all over the truck, so I figure the truck paint is too far gone for the duster, even though the old one worked really good even after 20yrs. Next I try it on
7246	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I got this fan for my travel trailer since it would run off a 12 volt socket. 1st issue was it was all I could do to get the thing plugged in. Either my socket was undersized or the plug on the fan was oversized, it was all I could do to get the thing pushed in far enough without breaking something. When I finally got it in far enough to power the fan, imagine my surprise when the fan blade rubbed on the fan housing as it was spinning , which caused a lot of noise. I promptly returned the fan.  I gave a second star for the ease of returning an Amazon product...otherwise it would have been just one.
9181	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good
 So I run the car for 5 minutes to warm it up and get the oil so it'll flow good. I followed the instructions inserted the extraction tube all the way. Pumped 10-15 times then let the let the little tank do the work.

There are good and bad reviews on electronic Deer Alerts like the Hopkins Alert. I've used this kind of device for over 15 years, and I can say that they DO WORK. All you need to have happen is to get the animals attention. They usually stop and look. This DOES happen more often than not with the alert. Nothing for sale out there is 100%. This device has worked for me, it does make deer and other animals stop and look most of the time, and I recommend it. If it works once for you it's worth it.
4197	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well, leaves a waxy brownish protective film.
When selecting a battery to use, you can't just use any 12v car battery, it must be a deep cycle marine battery.  It doesn't need to be a top of the line gel battery, but it must at least have the words "deep cycle marine" on it.  You also need a battery with enough capacity to run your sump pump for an adequate time for it to work long enough for power to be restored in your area.  My target time was 24 hours.  Since every application is different, I don't want to recommend a battery, but instead, head over to Tripp Lite's site and read their article about selecting the correct battery for your application.  They have a handy guide on their website (Amazon does not allow links in reviews) that explains how to calculate what size battery you need.

7429	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this from a local auto parts store as I needed it for a next day job, and paid several dollars more than it's listed for here. Overall, it's a good 4 pin wiring harness with a rugged molded-on connector body that appears more solid than on the wiring harness I replaced. I used this harness as part of a lighting upgrade project, replacing the existing stock lights on my 5'x8' utility trailer with LED lighting.
1833	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have used California dusters for many years and I love them. I purchased the wooden handle version recently and wrapped it in newspaper for 48 hrs as recommended, before using for the first time. It shed so much red fabric lint or residue that it was totally unusable. I shook it vigorously outdoors and so much loose fibers came off it was actually choking me. I put on a paper mask and continued shaking until I got a blister on my hand and it was still coming off. I called Amazon and as usual they replaced it without question. The 2nd one is exactly the same with the same problem. I sent the newer one back and kept the original one thinking that eventually the shedding will end. My wife suggested putting the head in the dryer with the air no heat cycle. After 1 hr the lint filter was totally red with the material residue. 4 1hour cycles later it's still shedding though not quite as bad, but still not usable. I ended up using my 20 year old California duster on my Corvette and stuck this one in the basement for now. 20 bucks down the drain. I will try and deal with it when the old one dies if it ever does. I could not recommend this product to anyone any more.

Installation and initial calibration was quick and easy, and it worked fine for about a couple of weeks. Then it started going nuts with the lights winking in random order. After that, it started flashing red indicating it needs new batteries. So I put a fresh set of batteries in the unit, recalibrated it, and we were good to go until a couple of days ago. That's when it would have a solid yellow light that would stay on for minutes at a time. Now it flashes red, and is telling me it wants fresh batteries. No more batteries for this dud. I was planning on using the AC adapter once I got an electrical outlet installed nearby; but that is a moot point now.

If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop, the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel, need to be in good condition, and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together, and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure, you can gradually increase the speed and pressure.

2012	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is something everyone needs for their interior.  I can't stand having dust on my dashboard or console, or even the top of the steering wheel, this takes all of that out of the equation.  A quick swipe of the duster over the hard / soft surfaces of your car and it's completely dust-free.  Definitely worth every penny.  I bought 2 - one for my Mom's car and one for mine.  The price is great, you can sometimes find these in AutoZone or PepBoys but it's going to cost you almost double what Amazon is charging.  After a dusting session, just give it a vigorous shake out your window and slip it back in the case they provide, and you're good to go.

There are many reviewers who state the red fibers are left behind by the duster.

This was outdoors and I could see the fibers flying around.  If not the palm of your hand use a soft, but firm surface.

Unless you have really long arms, you can't reach the handle from outside the truck bed.

To further ensure warranty status of my charger, I had changed the really short 110v cord to a 6' cord to reach an exterior 110v receptacle beside truck without using an extension cord in the engine bay. Ive since put the factory cord back in and added a NOCO Genius GCP1 AC Port Plug to truck. Charger plugs into it, extension cord can be plugged in or out without opening hood, its mounted in wheel well.
6998	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a really nice kit.  The quality cloths, pads and bag add a lot of value to this product.  And, there's quite a bit of wax, polish and oxidation remover included.  So, depending on the surface area of gel coat you need to work on, it should last a while.  I don't know for sure, but I expect the wax would be useable on auto finishes, since it is carnauba wax.  But, you may want to ask Meguiar's before you use it for that - I tried calling their customer service number to ask and gave up on waiting to get through.  Was tempted to knock off a star for that, but I expect most people wouldn't really care about that.  My boat is small, so I might like to use the wax on a car, but I'm not yet sure if it's OK.  In any event, this is a nice kit and your gel coat surfaces should respond well to it.

3399	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I actually buy this product to use on the inside of the shower doors in my house. We have water that is so hard your don't need a glass! I clean the shower enclosure glass completely - including scraping the limestone off with a razor blade - then I apply Rain-X as directed. It really helps keep the buildup to a minimum. Each treatment lasts about 6 weeks if I squeegee the glass after each shower but sometimes there is no time and the interval is reduced.

After three months... yes only three months and installing two of these on my car. While on, driving down the road a deer ran across the road and hit me dead center. Yes my car was totaled. I thought this was great.. However, if it really did stop deer from running into your vehicle, insurance companies would offer a discount for have it.  Total waste of money.

August 6, 2012  UPDATE: I just jump started a stranded mother and daughter's Nissan Murano in the parking lot after the Coldplay concert. The Coleman cables worked as advertised.
5340	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I initially bought one of these to dry my car... and years later (with the original one still being used to dry the car) found other uses - so now I have one to dry the dog (they are awesome for this!) and to dry the shower.  I keep one in the car and after hunt training with my dog its quick to dry him.  No more bringing home soggy towels to wash/dry out and if I am away training/testing for multiple days in a row I always have a way to dry dogs quickly.  For the shower, dump the squeegee and just 1/2 of one of these.

2884	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Its a nice cover to keep the dust off your hot rod while in storage. Not very waterproof but I knew that when I ordered it.  This one fits a 63 Nova pretty good. The dimensions should fit a 55-57 Chevy but it won't. Its a little short around the edges plus it gets really tight tying to get it on. Get the next larger one for a Tri Five.

5344	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this product to replace my leather chamois. This is far superior and absorbs a lot more water. It is also more durable than the leather one. I will never go back to a leather chamois now that I have used this product.
2936	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This works, but the "easily unloads your 3000 lbs load in 30 seconds" isn't totally true when you add in needing to set up the ideal conditions needed as well the load capacity being less than you may expect. I got the 2000 lbs version when my brother ask if I'd help him get a bunch of fill dirt for his yard. It did help with emptying the truck bed more quickly, but it isn't making things as easy as if you'd added a hydraulic dump (as they may try to make you think it is).  The only real difference in this one and the 2000 is the mounting brackets, this one has steel plates with ball bearings, the 2000 was plastic.  The 2000 brackets was only 1 high max where the tarp rides and had a smooth taper up to the pipe area, this one has steel plates sticking 3 inches strait up right at the tailgate edge (which will be a "snag" for my added tarp, see below).
 3. I removed the extraction tube hung the tube up high so it would drain the oil in the line down into the tank.
Conclusion: I am very pleased and satisfied with this product!
1195	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love it!  Made in America with all metal construction.  The color even gives it a vintage look.  Taking it apart, there are no hidden cheap parts.  What's not to like?

 Please note.......... My trailer is 5 years old and though it was oxidized some but a dull shine was still apparent, I knew the gel-coat seemed still good. If your unit has been neglected for say 10 years or more it may be possible that the oxidation has gone beyond the Gel-coat finish which gives the fiberglass its shine. If so, Your really have nothing to shine back up. 3 part restorer will remove the oxidation  then the polish and wax will add oils back to finish but without the high gloss shine if the gel-coat is gone. Also the dullness may return as the oils dry out over the following weeks of months depending on fiberglass gel coat in bad condition. I would try a small section on an older unit and see if you get that desired shine before spending your efforts to restore the entire unit. If that is the case their are other polymer finishes that coat over the dead finish once you clear off dead oxidation and create a new shiny type coating that they claim will hold a nice shine back to old finish. I am sure you can see them on the net. People seem to like these products as well. I would only consider going that route if you indeed do not have a chance of restoring the gelcoat. At that point you have nothing to lose but you will have to reapply that polymer finish every year. But it seems easy as waxing the whole unit.  But at least you still have an option.

1820	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The California Car Duster is and always has been an incredible product. You will read many reviews about this leaving small surface scratches in your paint. This WILL NOT happen if used correctly. When you run this across your pain the tips of the duster should BARELY touch your paint, and I mean barely. If the threads are all scrunched up on your car because you are setting the duster on your car to remove dust YOU ARE scratching your clear coat. Its too bad so many people have thought poorly of this product simply because they didn't know how to use it. Overall this is a perfect product for removing light dust from your car from sitting in your garage or taking a drive down the road.
3935	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very Nice Cover! Fits Super+Good Price+Service! Thanks So Much!!

4565	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a replacement for an Absorber I owned for several years which I lost. It works as advertised and will not scratch the paint as long as it is used correctly.  Do not use it dry.  Wet first and then wring  it out.
1308	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Quality has gone down in recent years, I used to get between 3 and 4 years and now I have to replace every two years.
The only downside to this product is the seal; there's a little spout on the bottle top that goes up and down; you flip it up to dispense the product.  It seems pretty flimsy, and doesn't seem to seal very well when closed.  I have a feeling some of it is going to evaporate out of the bottle, and at some point some will spill out if the bottle is ever turned on its side.  Other than that, great product.

3823	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Handy funnel in the shop.  Smallish, gets into tighter places, smaller fill holes like my air compressor.
8464	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This replaces a mityvac product that quit working.  It is much easier to use and clean.  Excellent design and quality.
8202	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This (along with the cargo bag) allows us to store small items when we are out and about.  Whether it is bags of groceries or rolls of paper, or tools.

If you have the Bakflip cover and had to lower your accessory rails, you have to be selective where it attaches, but no problems there either.

1) I have a FAN-TASTIC VENT fan on my camper.  The lid broke long after the warranty expired.  I called the company and tried to purchase a new lid.  They refused and insisted on sending me a new lid free of charge.  When I saw the FAN-TASTIC VENT brand name on this fan, I had immediate brand recognition and knew it would be a fair company to deal with.
9398	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Item works as described, just make sure you have at least a 24" breaker bar and weigh at least 180 lbs to break the crank bolt loose.
1405	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I used the pad with my Porter-Cable 7424XP 6-Inch Variable-Speed Polisher and within and hour of first picking up the tool the pad had fallen apart!

Per the recommendations in the instructions, I applied the #10 polish immediately afterwards, and it looked better than new.  I was incredibly impressed with myself, and Meguiar's products.  Now I can tell fishing partners about the idiot who sprayed DEET on my fishfinder without ever mentioning who that idiot was.
Also, I have a go pro hero camera on my helmet chin and the whole helmet + camera fits in the bag with still room to spare. I wear a small helmet, but I'm confident a extra large helmet would fit in here no problem.
208	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	OK, but not always accurate descriptions.
4870	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is awesome.  Do yourself a favor and buy the brand name Absorber.  Previously bought an el cheapo knockoff and it began to stink after a year.
8264	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does a good view
5221	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	ok
Not much can be said about a product like this, but they are of good quality and have held up over time in the weather and wear and tear.  The fit is good and they never come loose from vibration, even on rough roads.  I appreciate the small tube of grease that comes with them.  I reckon they could still be less expensive than they are, but represent cheap insurance even so.

1223	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great oiler! I had always seen these things here and there and now I understand why everyone has this style of oiler. I've been using mine with WD40 standard lubricant/penetrant with no issues at all. No leaks even when I accidentally tip the can over. I really like the bendable spout. The oil comes out in a tight stream that can actually be "shot" at a decent distance if you squeeze the oil tab hard enough.
2888	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for polishing scratches out of plastic. It will take a few passes to get it done
2657	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love these gun racks.  I bought them to put on all of my hunting stands instead of my ATV.  I have a pair on each stand, one for my rifle and the other I use to hand my backpack from.
7746	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a "Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.
Put this thing on and relax a whole lot more.
5336	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is amazing!  I have had mmine for since early 2003 and it still works as well as the day I bought it.  I wash two vehicle about every 3 weeks or so during the spring to fall seasons and there is not a sign of wear on it.  Best way to dry your car money can buy!  If it accidentally gets dirty, I throw it in the wash and it comes out ready to go again.  You can't go wrong!
8095	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does the trick.
8806	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's hard to find this design--most have a small scraper.  My old one broke after 10 years and I was so happy to find this one.  And at such a good price at Amazon.
6578	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Been using these for years. They are so much better than old fashioned chamois or water blades.
5450	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It creates a step low enough for me to be able to climb into my 3500 ram truck. Not much of a difference than the bumper, but enough. What wasn't included was an adapter for the larger reciever that I have. It said it was in the description. Fortunately, I had one already.

I finally got to use my Coleman Booster Cables a few months ago when my battery died in the commuter lot. They worked like a charm.
I'm extremely disappointed to read some of the bad reviews people have left for this product, who obviously, in most cases, seem to lack general understanding of its purpose and function.
4352	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Cool trickle charger. I use it to maintain my automatic generator battery.

8317	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This mirror was okay but is already broken because the suction cup doesn't hold very well !!!  It only lasted for about a month and was hard to adjust.
2120	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works good but man does it smell this thing smells up whole garage. and it does have plastic hooks 6 of them
5951	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This really helped revive our RV siding "decals" that had been oxidizing.  It went on easily and did apply a couple of times in order to improve the look.  Wish I had started using this when I got the RV in 2007.  Certainly worked much better than wax.
7186	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works pretty well. Difficult to clean and oils off if you accidentally get them on there while drying.
In case there was any question on my warranty I also spliced in another quick connect in line with charger output/battery lead. This feeds a switch on dash so I can turn off charger while working on something (without unplugging) and/or separate charger from truck while on the road. It also isolates if not plugged in to charge. (Note:one of the reasons switch added, others mentioned drain from charger if not plugged and connected to battery but when unplugged all the LEDS go off- I measured no drain? )
One thing I wish was a little different was the unlock/lock feature. There is only one button for both functions so it simply alternates between the two. If you unlock the truck with your remote, drive around, stop and get out but lock the doors from the door panel switch the next time you use the remote it will lock the doors since the unlock command was last sent from the remote. Two separate buttons would be nice. Or make it to where one click unlocks and two quick clicks locks.

7020	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I went camping with a friend who had this fan.  I saw that it was made by FAN-TASTIC VENT and immediately knew it would be a good item to have, so I made the purchase.  Why am I so happy with this company and product?
4883	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works like a regular shammy
8758	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a good shield for the price.  Use it in conjunction with my motorcycle windshield, for extra protection. Latch that secures it to the visor doesn't appear to be the greatest.  Hopefully it won't blow back at 70 mph.
9687	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect fit.


So, I'd pass on this clock if you (a) want to mount it anywhere other than directly at eye level or (b) want a clock you can read at night.  I'd return it, but return shipping costs make it uneconomical to do that.  Too bad.
5775	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	looks great and provide extra protection to car, easy to install and/or remove, does not rust or need to clean

9663	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect fit and looks great too
5658	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was torn after reading reviews, and was thinking of the similar LED version as well but decided to give this a try.  It is 'cheap' and plastic but was only $10 and does work as intended so I am pretty happy w/ it.  It would be nice if it fit a little tighter, but w/ the way the bulb is, it wouldnt be possible as is. Compared to some of the reviewers pics, it must stick out further on some hitches than others - on my RX-350, it might stick out about 1/2"-1" past hitch.
8127	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for keeping cargo from sliding all over the bed

5991	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Stops the midnight prop thief. I recommend their outdrive locks also. It only takes 30 seconds to remove a prop and a minute 30 seconds to remove an outdrive. Definitely will help protect very expensive  to replace parts on your boat.
I should say, my headlights don't have any damage, or any other issues that is causing it to rehaze. Its on the exterior, not the interior of the lens.

6688	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought this one over the cheaper Chinese version thinking it would be more water resistant.  I Think it is the same thing!

This thing charges it so well that we went to the movies the other night and it was still daylight when we went in.  I had accidentally triggered one of my LED light bars in the rear and didn't notice it.  The light ran through multi flash pattern cycle for nearly 2 hours and when we came out my truck started right up.
7123	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It drys the car well. Does leave some water spots though.
6757	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Somewhat loud, but moves a fair amount of air for a small fan!  Good quality.
The only use that I see for this product, is if you own a Smart Car or any car that is quiet in terms of noise that they produce.  So that way while driving around parking lots, or anywhere in the City where pedestrians tend to not look, this will alert them.
3383	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Far smaller than I'd expected (yes, I should have read the description more carefully) but aside from that nothing to complain about.

7175	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I installed this into my Donzi's starboard engine and it fit right in, came with the bolts I needed and the new o rings. I will continue to use this brand for my Donzi
To the reviewers that said it took a long time, remember that a battery is like an electrical gas tank.  So when person A says it took 5 minutes and person B says it took 20 minutes, they probably didn't tell you just how drained their batteries were, or if the good vehicle was running or not (it can drastically shorten the charge time).  Just keep that in mind as you read reviews.
9937	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These seem to be really good mudflaps, especially for the price.  They look like they are factory and they fit perfectly.  I will note that you have to make sure to order the correct ones, these are for WITH factory fender flares (the plastic fender guards).  These are not no-drill, I had to drill one hole for the top screw, the other 2 screws go into the existing retainer holes with supplied u-nuts.  I prefer these kind as "no-drill" typically means "not really secure".  Install took about 10 minutes, but I have an angle drill, so I did not need to take the tires off, you may need to depending on what you have.  Definitely use all the supplied screws, it makes the flaps very secure.  As it was raining when I was done with the install, I went for a drive, and they definitely make a big difference.  Although they look long in the picture, they have good ground clearance and I'm not concerned about bottoming out on them at all.

6981	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing soaks more water than i have on my car after i wash it! Its great and it feels like its going to scratch the paint at first but make sure to use it on a wet surface or it will be too dry to easily move over paint. Does the job like it should. would recommend if you have problems drying car after washing with regular towel.
8150	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This product does not tighten up against the bed sides easily. Save your money and get the Hitchmate  cargo bar, it's much easier to use.
First, these aren't jumper cables.  And the automotive industry has moved away from jumper cables to "booster cables" with smaller wires.  The reason why is that direct connecting two separate electrical systems leaves both systems vulnerable to voltage and current spikes which cause damage to computers and electronics.  My decade-old minivan has ELEVEN computers.  Do you want to risk replacing all of those just so you can get your car started a few minutes faster?  Nope, I didn't think so.  So anyway...
1894	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is great. I had another one from a different company that broke because the handle was plastic. This is wood and it feel a lot more solid. I have a black car and this takes the dust right off. Great buy! 10 out of 10

4735	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.
2887	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm giving this product five stars, but I have to admit most of the heavy lifting on this positive review was done by Meguiar's M17 Mirror Glaze Clear Plastic Cleaner - 8 oz., which is also available on Amazon. The M17 masterfully restores dull and faded headlights, and the M10 applies afterward to protect the shine. Since I just applied the product yesterday, I cannot speak to its longevity. However, it applies and removes easily, and if I have to reapply every couple of months it will be no bother whatsoever. My headlights look fantastic! I highly recommend Meguiar's M10 and M17 products for anyone looking to rejuvenate their headlights.
Bad enough but what torques me even a little more is these units are remote and hard to get to.  So, you don't even know when they fail.  For all I know, the motor failed months ago and I have been burning up my shingles and AC units to deal with the high attic temps.  I someone offered a heavy duty motor = it would be worth the $15 bucks to be able to rely on the attic fan working.
9727	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I thought I'd give it a try after I did the math.  You know, $12 per regular filter x 4 years = $48.  Fit was perfect but my 2003 Silverado runs noticeably better!  I had seem some folks comment on this in other reviews but took the 'see it to believe it' stance.  Well, I have seen and now I believe.  I'll never buy another regular air filter again.
8842	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've owned this about 7 months at the time of this review posting and have used it to pump up bicycle tires and various balls.  It has reliably worked every time.  Based on what I paid for it, this has been a bargain.

1155	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This works well, Only design flaw is at the connection at the fitting that joins the flexible "hose" to the actual body of the oiler, If it is not on tightly and perfectly aligned it will leak. I fixed mine with some permatex, Othewise this work and does what I need it to do....fill my hard to get to transfer case with trans fluid! I am guessing transfluid leaks easer that regular oil, so it may be my application that is not working well with this oiler. I would recommend this either way...way better than others that I have purchased in the past.

There are more expensive cables and even more sever duty use cables. these are perfect for this type of vehicle in an Emergency. The cost is reasonable as well.

213	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recommend everybody purchasing a repair manual for any vehicle.  Even if you're not mechanically minded and don't intend on doing any repairs yourself, being somewhat familiar with the inner workings of your vehicle will help you to properly maintain your vehicle as well as assist a professional in properly diagnosing and repairing an issue.  This could save you some bucks down the road and potentially protect you from a crooked mechanic that wants to replace your muffler bearings or flush your blinker fluid reservoir.

I use it on small engines like lawn mowers, pressure washers, tillers, etc.  I warm up a cold engine for 2 minutes, shut off,  and then extract the oil via the oil fill port.  I do tip some units slightly towards the oil fill port and start the vacuum extraction process.  While it does not take long at all,  I can pump up the unit and walk away leaving it to extract.

9199	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have had more than one electronic deer alert. This is my first Hopkins Alert. It installs the same way other similar alerts install. I no longer install items like this because it requires positioning myself in and around my vehicle that I can't un-position myself from without help from the local medical emergency team and crane/pry bar company.
So in conclusion, my cooler needed a very minor repair. It's a 5 star product, but I will give it 4 stars for the hassle of fixing it. Most people would just have thrown it away or attempted a warranty repair with the manufacturer, so I am glad that I took the rear cover off to see that it was a very simple fix of just plugging the small fan connector back in.

Also there were no visible scratches and/or damage to the fiberglass hull on my boat. Really impressed with this product !!!  Tried a couple of other products (sprays/powders) before I tried Starbrite, but as you can imagine they were pretty useless.

1803	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I think this is my 4th or 5th one. The last 2 had plastic handles which eventually broke. The first ones just got so dirty I decided to throw them away. So I have been using these for 40 years. Love them. I had decided to try the new microfiber one with the aluminum extendable handle but found it disappointing.  I love microfiber stuff but that just didn't work properly for me.

First few days I was concerned with what seemed rather high rate of about 13.6, and that was after several hours at 14.4. But after the 3rd day rates dropped a lot.  Now when charger is first plugged in it goes to charge about 14.4 but drops fairly quickly, then goes to maintenance within a couple of hours (depending how long I had driven), generally about 12.64-12.72v.

Are there enough diagrams and/or photos of every operation?  No way.  Could they add tips/tricks to avoid the hidden hassles that arise when taking apart something kind of complex?  Definitely.  Should they have their own online forum for follow up questions by manual users?  Absolutely.  But there are other forums that pick up where the knowledge contained in this guides isn't adequate, so I'm not going to expect this rather affordable guide be everything I need.

When it gets too dirty, all you have to do is throw it in the washing machine and all the dirt gets cleaned off. Remembering to store it wet and in its' tube goes a long way toward having it ready to use.

It tells you not to touch the silver part that is hidden, while the club is closed (not on the steering wheel) but I touch it all the time when I remove it. I assume it has to do with that part being oily, but the manual does not enlighten you on that matter.

But for $10, its amazing.
3371	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Before I applied this to the windshield of my car, I noticed that the wiper blades, although new, left some streaking on the glass, and it could be a bit of a challenge to see outside especially when it rains hard and the raindrops magnify the lights of cars or the streetlights. After application, the wiper blades no longer left streaks, it became much easier to clearly see outside and the water beaded and blew away. At times, it may look like there is no rain on the glass when driving through rain at night.
5203	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Bought this to manage some mildew on the bottom of the canopy for our travel trailer and some tree sap and stains on the vinyl ends. It took off the top layer of the mildew, but left the black stains and it didn't work on the tree sap at all. I later got the black mildew stains with another cleaner. Disappointed in this product.

Perfect!
9311	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	First off I rented the very same tool from my local auto parts store. No problems getting crankshaft bolt off. I used a air impact gun to remove bolt. My impact gun is a Earthquake 1/2 inch drive sold by Harbor Freight. It has 700 ft lbs. of torque at its highest setting. When replacing the cranksahaft pulley I used this tool and a 1/2 drive torque wrench with a couple long extentions placed on top of jack stand to keep extentions level. My torque wrench goes up to 150 lbs. Torqued pulley bolt to 150lbs and then I used a breaker bar to finish torquing. Hard to tell if I have exactly 181 ft lbs but, I know it won't come off.
2472	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I used this for a set of led back-up lights mounted for a receiver. In spite of packing it with synthetic grease and using the cap the lock seized. After some Blaster soaking etc. I was able to get it unlocked but it wouldn't let go of the key. Not suitable for New England environment unless you will remove it daily.

Nothing really, just be aware it takes some time to dry out completely.  I usually let it get semi-dry by hanging, so it's still pliable, then fold and roll it.  I place it part way into the case so it sticks out abit then leave it out for a day before tucking the entire thing in the canister.  Otherwise it will take forever to dry.  I've never seen or smelled any mildew, so I think this technque is solid.  When you pull it out it will be stiff like cardboard, but a few drops of water will restore it to its useable condition(just like a real chamois!)
654	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So glad I bought these before I had a problem. Since I've bought them I've used them about 8 times usually on my wife's beach-beater (the starter was going bad -- the battery was old too), and they work great. The clamps are effective and the cables are sure. They're not too thick that it's cumbersome, but it's thick enough for the current to flow through well. Very pleased with these.

This sealant is recommended all over the place so I just ordered it without even thinking a company would make a marine sealant that took a week to cure.  We've had 80+ weather for 5 days now and my boat is stuck on the trailer waiting for this stuff to cure.  It better hold for years since it ruined my weekend.

5897	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	PlastX is a very good polisher for the final step in restoring your headlights.  I prefer to use wetsanding to get the inital haze off and then finish the headlight off with this polish followed by some good sealer such as Blue Magic Headlight Sealer.  Below are pics of a set of headlights I restored on my buddy's Toyota SUV using the PlastX polisher after some wetsanding.  They now look brand new.  Be sure to use some form of sealer or wax made for headlights after polishing to keep your lights looking new long-term.  I highly recommend this product.

Delighted with this purchase.
1501	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We have three of these running as UPS for extended long run.  They work great. With a 100AmpH deep cycle battery, it can run three servers for 5 hours.

5017	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a fantastic Synthetic Towel. I have a black car and this one towel is all I need to dry it with. Sure I have to wring it out several times, but it is well worth the extra effort. Once I am done, my car's finish is streak-free and the glass needs little if any wiping with a microfiber cloth. I do suggest wringing as much water as you can and then storing it in the tube it came in. This helps keep it moist and mildew free.

Installation is a snap.  Reading the instructions, it took me less than 10 minutes to get everything hooked up.  There are a few dip switches on the inverter/charger that you change depending on which battery you got and how often you want it to run.  The inverter/charger can be set to run as an inverter only (in case you have a separate charger), or also charge too.

734	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Label on motor stated F0510B2944 which is the exact model I replaced. Purchased with the accompanying thermostats to replace a seized motor and old thermostat (both from 2006). Removal of old motor and blade was simple after loosening 2/3 3/8" angled bracket bolts and twisting the brackets. Twisted off the old conduit and kept the two electrical connectors and ground screw. Old blade was easy to remove with Allen wrench and gloves. Measured notch created on old motor shaft to align old blade on new motor shaft. Tightened Allen screw (light torque) and reinserted assembled motor and blade into place. Aligned the three threaded bolts and tightened nylon nuts (again, light torque). Fan self-aligned with tightened nuts and spun freely. Connected wires as shown in diagram and it worked perfectly!  Will buy another as a spare. Looking forward to a cooler second story.

I just bought another one, because my other one that I have been using for over 10 years disappeared.

8859	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Yes the pump is not proffessional grade. but if you want it to pump the air in your bike tires or basketballs, then this will work fine. It is tricky to use your foot while you pump, but it only takes a minute to get used to. It pumps air into balls and bike tires. If you want it to do something else, then find an electric pump. The end of the pump where you clip it to your bike is not metal, it is plastic. A very poor design decision. My old one was metal and lasted me for years. I don't know what to expect now that it is black plastic. The picture shows it to be metal like my old one. The picture is wrong. It is black plastic, and to be honest with you, I am being super gentle with it, but it works.
7093	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great
7060	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I read many reviews before purchasing this and couldn't be happier. The system has three stages. Each takes a while to complete (of course depending on the size of your unit) but is totally worth it. I couldn't believe the results -- my travel trailer looked brand new. This is worth every penny and inspires you to do it every few years to keep up the beautiful results.
4240	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I write very few reviews on websites, but thought it appropriate to write a review on PRI-G.  I cannot speak to the other products they make, but if they work as well as PRI-G then I will use them as well.  I purchased a 16 oz. bottle nearly a year ago I guess because I had read so many positive reviews.  Well, specifically I had read that one guy could not get his lawnmower started due to old gas and possibly some gumming up of the carb.  Well, in my case I had an old generator that I use out in the back field where my horse stayed.  The generator did not get much use as is with many generators for most of us folks.  However, when I read that someone was able to get an old lawnmower started with this stuff I just had to give it a try.  I mean the last thing I have time to fiddle with is pulling apart a generator to clean the carb out.  I should also preface this review with the explanation that I had tried on and off for several months to get the generator started but to no avail.  I read the instructions that were included, as well as those which were on the bottle, and then used one of the medicine applicators that you use when your kids are sick (Hopefully my wife did not notice it missing).  After squirting a very small amount into the gas tank I placed the choke to full and pulled the starter cord about 10-15 times until I could smell gas.  I then walked back up to the house and waited an hour before heading back out to see if it had made any difference.  After arriving back I repeated the same steps as I had many times before but without a positive yield.  On the 3rd. or 4th pull she started right up with no hesitation and ran flawlessly for an hour until I shut her down.  I have since used this on another occasion to get the same generator working that I had not treated the next batch of gas, and once again she started up after waiting 15 minutes from treating the gas.  I now use this in all our engines that are not used on a regular basis and have told my co workers how impressed I was with the product.  I will agree that its a bit expensive, but if she can get an engine back running without you having to drain old gas, or work on a carb that's sat to long then for me its well worth the price.  Before you take things apart, or worse take it to a shop and pay big bucks to have someone work on something that's been sitting awhile.. try PRI-G first!

1373	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Genuine snowflake generator.  The pad shreds to bits, the pad comes unglued, the pad can not be washed, and even with gentle care will not last through an entire job.  When it works, I guess its okay, I mean for the 10-30 minutes of use two pads were turned into garbage.  Maybe its my lack of skill, but then again maybe it isn't.
9613	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These seem to be really good mudflaps, especially for the price.  They look like they are factory and they fit perfectly.  I will note that you have to make sure to order the correct ones, these are for WITH factory fender flares (the plastic fender guards).  These are not no-drill, I had to drill two holes for 2 of the 4 screws, the other 2 screws go into the existing retainer holes with supplied u-nuts.  I prefer these kind as "no-drill" typically means "not really secure".  Install took about 10 minutes, but I have an angle drill, so I did not need to take the tires off, you may need to depending on what you have.  Definitely use all the supplied screws, it makes the flaps very secure.  As it was raining when I was done with the install, I went for a drive, and they definitely make a big difference.  Although they look long in the picture, they have good ground clearance and I'm not concerned about bottoming out on them at all.

I washed my minivan the other day; and I'd say it took one swipe on a panel, squeeze dry, then a second swipe to completely dry the panel.  The Absorber is a nice, large size.  It dries my car better than old bath towels, and it left no water spots.  I'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again.

4845	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing soaks more water than i have on my car after i wash it! Its great and it feels like its going to scratch the paint at first but make sure to use it on a wet surface or it will be too dry to easily move over paint. Does the job like it should. would recommend if you have problems drying car after washing with regular towel.
5201	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying "it doesn't absorb water".. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time. Are they ringing out "air" ? Of course is absorbs the water. It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe. I use a towel after using this. That's worked well for many years. I tried a "waffle towel" and it was worse than the absorber. I tried a special auto towel, but that did not work as well either. I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use. I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower, but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint.

I keep one in the car and after hunt training with my dog its quick to dry him.  No more bringing home soggy towels to wash/dry out and if I am away training/testing for multiple days in a row I always have a way to dry dogs quickly.  For the shower, dump the squeegee and just 1/2 of one of these.

8492	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome!  Ever since lowering my 2011 GTI, I can no longer do oil changes by using ramps or jacks.  Luckily, this oil extractor makes it a breeze.  I usually do it after the oil is warm/hot so that it'll flow easier.  Stick the tube down the dipstick, and pump away.  You have to pump many times, often waiting 2-3 minutes between pumps (the vacuum created is strong enough to extract oil for a while on it's own after you pump it).  Move the tube around down the dipstick opening to make sure it's as low as it can reach.  Once it's all out, attach the other piece to the plastic container and it's easy to pour your oil back into the original container for recycling.  This makes oil changes so stupidly easy, and there is virtually no mess!
9946	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I won't give them too much flack as there are dozens of drill patterns in silverados, suburbans, sierras I'm sure, but then don't call them custom. I needed to have a drill on hand, and even then you can't really get these on easily.

It works on single cyl. 2 and 4 cycle equipment. Use needle nose pliers to loosen stuck fuel lines. Work them back and forth to loosen it. Check the compression occaisionly to detect leaking valves. A cylinder leak-down test can be VERY useful to detect leaking intake or exhaust valves and also leaking rings and head gasket. Harbor Freight has a compressor which provides plenty of air to check leakdown. It is about 22 gallon or more.

7622	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this thing as a towel after my shower... I'd leave it hanging over the shower curtain and let it dry out every day.

I It worked great until I put in the case while it was wet and left on vacation.
Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.
The head of the extraction tube MUST be tightly worked into the sphere intake access.
4674	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to save and extend the life of the battery in my pickup truck. I live just outside of a very small town,about a mile and a half. A trip to town,a couple of stop(Post Office,grocery store,gas station)and back home,and I've started the engine three or four time and only put on as many miles. Not enough engine running time to re-charge the battery. After many times of not being able to start my truck and having to use a booster charger to start the truck,I finally needed a new battery. I hope this little charger will prevent this from happening again.(I will update if it fails).My only beef is the short power cord. I needed to buy a short heavy duty extension cord so as to be able to plug it in without having to open the hood each time.

The Drive Auto Products bin is larger, and has some more storage pouches on the side which I don't use. It also has a strap which is annoying if you don't use it, but it allows you to hang it over a headrest if you want too. Also, it needs bags to be considered completely liquid tight. It comes with bags, and uses grocery bags in a pinch (and it has pinchers to hold the bag) but...
4891	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this Absorber for drying my cars. I've had it between 5-10 years, can't remember for sure. I live in the south and have four cars so it gets used a lot year-round. In fact, someone gave me another one a few years ago and I figured I'd use that when the first one wore out. It hasn't and it's not even close.  Why you you even get a leather chamois?

Once I got the hang of it I found it was easiest to get suction going with 10 or so pumps and then every 10 seconds or so give it another pump to keep it flowing at maximum. Sucked all the oil out with no problem. And unlike the my previous one, not a drop of oil was spilled because it pumps straight into the container! Definitely recommend it to anyone that is performing the occasional maintenance.

- The unit itself is super small. It's like a cute oversized 6 liter teapot. The size makes it easier to store and I believe the tiny size also makes it easier to create a vacuum if you're extracting about that much oil out of your car. The larger Mitivac took awhile b/c the volume of air is so much relative to the oil being extracted.

6968	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've had this Meguiar's fiberglass restoration kit for about a month now.  While I haven't had a chance to use it on my dad's boat yet, I did use it to successfully clean up an old car roof cargo box that I have that is made of fiberglass.  The cargo box was looking pretty dingy after years of use/abuse and was not looking too impressive on the roof of my shiny SUV.  After using this Meguiar's kit of oxidation remover, polish, and wax I am happy to report the old cargo box have been rejuvenated (clean, shiny) and once again worthy to been seen on my car.  I found the kit easy to use and instructions were easy to follow.

8220	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is easier and, with just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!

I popped the chrome off a 1/2" extension by torqueing it. Wear safety glasses. It's not necessary to put a breaker bar on the tool too, there's a reinforced place at the edge of the fender that will catch it if you put a regular 1/2" drive ratchet on it.

Update-3/15/13.  After running an ad on CL, to see if anyone was interested in the parts, I received a helpful response.  There was a local guy, Strasburg, VA, that worked on generators on the side.  He checked it out and determined that the coil was fried.  He was able to double dip (varnish insulation-I was told) a new coil and replace the "iffy" control panel, used, for $300.  So, I'm back  in business.  I thought it was a decent deal considering that a new generator, of this size, costs around $600.  I've checked the voltages (120/240) and it works fine.

However, I know from many years of other K&N filter use that you'll be hard pressed to really notice anything that isn't due to placebo effect.

1048	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I had a body shop for 20 years. Did a lot of high end cars, and spent a lot of time behind a polisher. Now I am doing woodwork and need to get the same kind of results. The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RMP polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.

1) The TopSider's pump has a locking-ring that requires a really-tight connection to the can, and pumping-action causes it to loosen-up and/or pull-off, causing vacuum-leaks.  This Hydro-Turf has a rubber one-way valve that installs on the can, so if you pull so hard on the pump that the piston comes off the pump, it's okay because the one-way valve stays on the tank, holding the vacuum.

If you camp in your van at night and have a spare battery that you use for things like this and expect you to keep you warm all night you'll wake up an hour later freezing. There is another blanket out there that doesn't have a timer for that purpose. But I keep this one in my boat for rides on chilly days when my mom gets cold. And here the timer is perfect so it doesn't accidentally get left on.

That said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.
2082	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This gets a 5 star for me.  It is small and compact.  Quality is OK.
1911	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works much better than the cheap static-based dusters that are designed to fill up and wear out so you buy more. The handle is solid, the head is firmly attached and it does a good job picking up dust and light debris between washes as long as you haven't driven in the rain. Shaking it out works fine and I have yet to have it transfer any of the "dirt" you can see on it back to the car.
I received my scanner and quickly hooked it up to my truck's computer (service engine soon light was on) and I was able to read 4 error codes.  I was experiencing a very rough idle and I hesitated taking it to the dealer or Midas (more expensive than the dealer) where they wanted $100 bucks to pull the codes and turn light off, crazy stuff I though and I hate having the "ripped off" feeling.

2636	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There are two zippers on this bag, so it gives you the option of having the zippers stored near the top of the bag or off to the side. This is a great helmet bag for the cheap price ; you get what you paid for. Even though the bag doesnt seem too durable itself, as long as it doesnt take too much contact it should last. The inside is a sort of white fluffy cotton style lining. However, if you want an extremely durable bag look somewhere else....

8564	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This extractor sure makes changing oil in my truck, or Jetta a cleaner job than it used to be. Make sure your oil is up to operating temperatures, as it will flow much faster when its hot.  The vacuum pump is a bit of a disappointment, as I feel it should be bigger to reduce the amount of pumping to keep the oil flowing.  It does work though and I'm pleased with the purchase.
The vacuum will be created in due time after say 15 to 20 pumps and oil will appear in the extraction tubing.
2807	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great for the price. Covers my Corvette easily with stretch to spare. Would probably fit on a old Cadillac.

8525	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This does exactly what it is supposed to do, suck oil out of a crankcase. Its only fault is that it is slow, an estimate is twenty minutes or so to extract four quarts.

I didn't want to pay the 200 bucks it cost for decent ramps, So I purchased 2 2x10's that are about 12 feet long i think..  I've been using these to load and unload onto my truck and a trailer I borrowed from my mom, but eventually gave back, so mostly my truck..  man, it SUCKED..  going up into the truck there is a lip at the end, from laying it on the tail gate, so basically, a drop off..  which wasn't horrible loading, but un-loading, man.. the wheels kept pushing the boards off, and also, the deck on the mower would catch on the lip of the board..  HORRIBLE...  I bought these and put them on.. and it makes everything flush on the tail gate.. after I installed them on the boards, I put them on the tail gate, pulled the mower up on the truck, and then backed it down off the truck, all by myself, without anyone holding the boards..  WORKED FANTASTIC...  why did I not buy these things sooner?!?!?!  I won't make that mistake again..  love these things, and I'm sure you will too.

9258	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are so wonderful to have in the car in the winter. After getting one of these in another color (but the same brand), I decided to pick up a second blanket for my kids to use too while traveling. Here in Minnesota it gets extremely cold and everyone is always fighting over where to have the thermostat set at. By having some of these travel electric blankets in the car, everyone can keep as warm as they want to.

3308	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is the best example I can think of, and a rare one, of a product that not only works but far exceeded my expectations. As one reviewer mentioned, it will cause wintertime ice to easily flake off. Ditto for summertime bug removal. It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars). I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+. No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear. MANY TIMES I have driven to an emergency call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility. And I find that it lasts for several weeks on a car that is not garaged. My highest recommendation. Three thumbs up! Oops - make that two thumbs up.
4653	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good product. Absorbs liquids easily. The only negative for me, the size makes it a bit cumbersome for me to use easily.

Cons (very small issues):

The backlight looks great in the photo - but in a darkened room it is glaring - VERY bright.  You absolutely MUST view it head-on when lighted (the slightest angle will completely wash out the digits), but the brightness of the light makes it uncomfortable to look at.  And when lighted, the numbers are a pale blue (not the high-contrast black numbers pictured on the product page).  You activate the backlight by pressing either of the buttons on the right side of the clock - but the light it comes on for such a brief period that your eyes don't have time to adjust to the glaring light.  I have to press the buttons two or three times to be able to glimpse the time.
5133	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this thing as a towel after my shower... I'd leave it hanging over the shower curtain and let it dry out every day. Then pull it in and get it wet right before I shut the water off. It was perfect because it got washed everyday and never had that musty smell like my cloth towels did. I It worked great until I put in the case while it was wet and left on vacation.
7739	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I had the original ABSORBER (several in fact over the years). My most recent finally wore out. The orignal versions performed very well. BUT the "NEW" version....NOT!!!! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor "new" Absorber being sold now. It performs no were near as good as the original. What a big step down in quality. Hard, Barely absorbant, Discolors easy, Tears easy...... look elsewhere......I am not sure where???, but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth (by the way, a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic)... sorry for being wordy.

5362	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've had one of these for the better part of 10 years for my car, and just recently ordered an additional Absorber to use strictly while training our new puppy. It works well for cleaning up general household messes, including the occasional accident on the carpet, without having to go through a ton of regular towels that would then need to be completely laundered and dried. This saves me a lot of time during the inevitably difficult puppy training.

4997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ABSOLUTELY amazing! I have never had anything like this before. Takes the water off my car without leaving streaks or marks. I have a Pontiac Trans Am that I show so it is washed often. On the flat surfaces of my car I just lay the Absorber out flat, grab the two corners facing me with my thumb and forefinger, then just drag it towards me leaving a streak free shine. On the sides of the car I fold it up into a rectangle and gently swipe it down the sides. Just remember to ring it out regularly while you are doing this and you get the best results. I love this product so much I came back and bought another one for the house!
2226	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The inline six cylinder engine in my 2002 GMC Envoy with 80,000 miles suddenly began to run rough and the check engine light came on.  I thought it might be a bad tank of fuel or a loose fuel cap.  The light would remain lit at slow speeds, and at highway speeds it would flash.  The problem persisted after a tank of highest quality fuel was consumed with a tight fuel cap.  I purchased an Actron AutoScanner from Amazon.com.  The scanner informed me that cylinder one was misfiring.  I knew the original spark plugs should be replaced.  Each cylinder has its own ignition coil.  The ignition coils need to be removed to install the plugs below.  Each coil is attached by only one bolt.  While removing all of the coils I marked the cylinder one coil.  I replaced all of the ordinary worn plugs with premium Bosch Platinum + 4 plugs.  I installed the coil from cylinder one on cylinder two and the other coils I installed randomly on the other five cylinders.  I started the engine and it did run better due to the new plugs.  The engine still ran rough however and the check engine light did remain lit.  The Actron AutoScanner then informed me that cylinder two was now misfiring.  Bingo!  I purchased a new ignition coil from Federated/Ficher Auto Parts for $60.  The GM dealer price fore the same part was $130.  I bolted on the new coil and my troubles were over.  The Actron AutoScanner performed excellently.  The scanner protected my small bank account from the dealership service department.  The scanner minimized the time I spent diagnosing the issue.  I stored it carefully away for the next time.
9759	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	They are molded to the contour of the vehicle but do not quite follow exactly. A heat gun on the wheel side to soften the plastic will solve that issue.
5803	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great for cleaning vinyl windows like on a jeep or boat
So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.  For anyone having other issues like red fibers all over the place, I'd recommend following the steps I did listed above, it worked great for me and as of now I have a great little duster that I paid less then 5 bucks for.  IMO, u can't beat it.
3) Maybe it's just my imagination, but wiper blade inserts don't seem to last as long when used on coated windshields.
The further you can see the better your response time to stop in case of an emergency.  I strongly recommend this product as doing a great job!
6119	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This product claims to restore plastic but after 10 minutes of scrubbing one headlight cover with it and a terry cloth (as recommended), there was hardly any noticeable difference. I do some bodybuilding so strength of pressure application is not the problem!

I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ.  The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.
904	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great price for a quality part.
2478	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I searched for a hitch lock for my Honda CR-V and wanted a Stainless Steel one.  Read where some complained about this but I felt the overwhelming positive reviews were worth it.  I did pre spray it with lube before installing as we salt our roads here heavily in the winter and this will take a fair amount of spray.  So far functions well and I love the look and safety of not having to worry as much about having my high hardware boosted.  Should keep the honest people away.

Make sure to leave it a little wet when you store it in the container that it came with. Even if the towel dries, you can just run it under water and it will go back to normal. Now my family only dries our cars with these towels, you don't have to worry about scratching your car with these synthetic towels.
Drying my car with "The Absorber" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.

Update: Tried this on a 2002 7.3 Powerstroke Ford F350. The hose is really too short for this truck. I had to put the extractor on a step ladder.

9964	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We just bought a new SUV, and it has no place for a trash can in the front. I began my search for the perfect trash can (who knew there were so many??) that would suit our needs. I found this one and am very pleased. The weighted bottom and velcro-like grips keeps it in place on the floor in the back seat area, and is big enough to hold a common plastic grocery bag as a liner. One can close the lid, but we like to keep ours open. There is a mesh pocket the length of the unit, which is handy for storing little things like sanitizing wipes. We are very happy with our purchase.

5585	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Made in the U.S.A. (at least what I got was), unlike the rest of their products which are made by slaves in china. These are decent covers to keep both the male and female connections clean. But you either need to remove them completely and put them in a clean place when connecting the trailer or you'll have to clean them out before recapping the connectors or they'll be rather useless. Thankfully the retention strap comes off and goes back on fairly easily so it's not difficult to completely remove them and put them in the glove box or some other clean place. I also recommend using an antioxidant joint compound on the connections to keep them from corroding. Electrical connections which are kept clean and free of corrosion are so much more reliable.

The downside to the Club is, at least I'm told, that a professional car thief can cut through it somehow pretty quickly and steal my car anyway.

Yeah, sure they can last longer with cleaning / re-gapping / etc. but if you've got the money and you're already in there for Spring cleaning and oil-changing ... why not. BTW, it's better to change the oil in the Fall just before stowing your rider IMHO so your rider spends the winter sitting in nice clean oil.
This model is particulary useful because it gives the text definition of the code without having to reference a table or run to the internet.
3- The sphere container which holds the vacuum and eventually the oil pumped, holds six liters! (That's 4 bottles of wine :-). That is a lot of vacuum suction to create!
Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.
Ive used the california duster for 10 years, two different ones.  It is a minimally destrcutve way for taking dust off the paint.  HOWEVER, it will increase 'microscratchung'.  Dust and particles trapped on the threads are subsequently dragged over the paint.  These leave ultrafint scratches in the surface.  (Your eyes see thses as 'swirls' or 'microswirls'- they are random scraches that, due to the otics of your eye and light source seem to arrnage in circular patterns)

1151	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I had a body shop for 20 years. Did a lot of high end cars, and spent a lot of time behind a polisher. Now I am doing woodwork and need to get the same kind of results. The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RPM polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.

Twice the size I was expecting for just $20. They look classy while holding my boat to its trailer too. Like some other people have said, they are a little too long and I will have to cut off a few inches. Doing this is no problem just as long as you burn to melt where you cut it. This keeps where you cut it from unraveling
4536	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Fram has a horrific history of manufacturing oil filters that fail. Their filters leak and do a poor job at filtering impurities.

Remember, you are sucking oil through a 3mm tube...that is very small because it had to fit in that dipstick hole. It will take time and not much pumping BUT...because the oil flows slowly through the clear tubing, you will see very little happening.

Well.. it kinda fit.. it was a little bit too small to fit in the hex space on the pulley and I couldn't get enough leverage to break the bolt loose without something slipping off.
This inverter also has a heavy transformer in it and Trip-Lite mounts the whole unit in an abs plastic case. The very weight of the unit broke all 8 corners. IF, I rebuild this thing I'll have to build a case from 1/4 inch plywood.

You will HAVE to use a peice of 18" pipe on a 1/2" breaker bar for this to work, and a jack stand for support, but worth every penny to do the timing belt in my Accord.

Update....it was just a burnt out bulb.
To be sure, the puncture was fairly extreme...it was ragged, with 2 small "tears" each about 1/16th of an inch.  Also, this was near a juncture of 2 of those raised ribs that come about during the manufacturing process.  But still, the site was well buffed, and the patch itself seemed to adhere well.
5167	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	For those of you that complain that the product get hard after first use, that is normal.  If you have not used Chamois before, you must wet the Chamois completely first then ring out the water before use.

2457	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought a four bike hitch mounted rack that came with an 8' cable lock.  With the 8' cable lock, I was unable capture every wheel and every frame, so this lock was needed.  While I was 1000 miles from home on a family vacation, the mechanism in the hitch provided cable lock broke and I was really glad I had this one. The lesson learned is any lock is better than no lock, so having a backup is a good idea.  I gave this lock four starts because it is too small of diameter to prevent any slightly motivated thief, although the same can probably be said for the hitch provided cable that is nearly twice the diameter. In combination with a second cable it provided me with a satisfactory level of comfort to take the family in to a restaurant provided I had a view of my vehicle from my table.

Used them to keep a trailer in place as I worked on it, while changing oil and to keep the wheeler from backing out of the trailer to go for a ride on it's own.

2470	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have towed with this product for approximately 10,000 miles. The protective rubber flap that helps keep dirt out of the locking mechanism fell off after a few thousand miles of use, even when the flap was there it never quite stayed shut. On one occasion the locking portion shifted on its seat. I was not able to unlock until I was able to hammer the lock back on square to the shank. The lock is extremely susceptible to dirt, grime, road salt etc. Last time I removed the lock I had to soak the lock in penetrating oil and lightly heat pin with a torch, this was the only way I could get the key to turn.

3943	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this lock for the spare tire on my trailer.  It seems like it could be broken without too much effort, but should help deter theft by being there.
just way too much.
I bought some cause I ran out and I want to keep my windshield nice and waxed for when el nino hits this winter...
1459	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I got this when I had a flat away from home and had forgotten to bring my patch kit and spare tire. I was near a Walmart and this was the only patch kit they had. I was not optimistic at all but was too stingy to buy new levers and a new tube so instead I bought this kit and re-used my punctured tube. And that actually worked extremely well. These patches are just like stickers, you simply roughen up the tube and then stick the patch on the puncture. I did not have a leak in that area of the tube again. Now I keep using this kit until I run out of patches. The levers are nothing special, if you want really nice levers get the Park tool ones in blue. But I cannot complain about the levers either, they are not broken yet. That other tool is very basic too but if you can get this set for cheap I can recommend it. And I ride my bikes a lot and have tried other patch kits.
7796	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was dubious about this, but based on the reviews I figured it was worth a shot. It's BIG, twice as big as you'd need, really, and it's made of this unpleasant-weird feeling kind of rubber-jelly-synthetic-skin material. Quite squishy. And thirsty! I read the directions, rinsed it in warm water, wrung it out, then dried my car with it. I laid the whole piece down on half the windshield, voila, DRY, no spots or streaks. It holds a remarkable quantity of water. If it held any more water, they'd sell it for emergency water storage.

4435	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works just fine. I bolted it under the hood and I pug it in during the winter. My truck always is ready to start, even though I don't use it very often.
7458	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Product is great and arrived fast
6316	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is compact in design and bright yellow in color so I will not leave it behind when leaving the campground. When ordered it came in quickly and the price was good. I now have 4 all the same.
8426	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great battery.  This puts an end to any leaky battery fluid in my jets ski.  I plan to replace all of the conventional wet, open cell batteries in my jet skis with these.  It also turned the starter at near full speed when the charge was down to 10%.  I hadn't used the ski for a couple of months and allowed the battery to slowly discharge.  It started right up.  I then checked the battery condition with the battery charger and determined the low charge status.  I was very impressed.  Good purchase.
7742	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased and used several of these over many years.  I have to admit that these are a little on the large size; however, I think they are fabulous.  I love the hooks.  I love the velcro strap to secure excess.  They feel good.

6312	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I typically use pavers I have in the yard to chock both sides of one tire when I do any work on my truck, but they aren't much higher than 1-1.5".  These are nicer to keep in my garage than to bring in a muddy paver.  Since it's yellow, it's easy to spot in my garage, and they don't slip.  I've tested them by giving my truck a little gas while these are on and they prevent me from rolling.  They look good and do their job.  I like em....
3282	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great
LET ME TELL YOU THE SHINE JUST AFTER USING THE COMPOUND IS AMAZING! IT works as its advertised. Then you follow up with the polish on a rag and wipe it off right away. Polish takes off any film left by compound and adds oils back to finish. They have a pure wax but it has no UV blockers in it so I went back to what I used and loved for years on trailer---Protect all wax. Lack of UV blockers is what oxidizes the unit.

After last year's burningman, I did have to stop on the side of the road and beat out a huge pile of dust from the filter; my car was barely able to make it over the mountain pass to get back home. After beating the dust out (it left a huge pile), the car ran perfectly again. Other than that, it's been ~50k miles since installed.

545	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This product is advertised as 4 pockets but has 3.  This makes no difference, however it's why 4 rather than 5 stars.  The item is marked 1 micron filter on each pocket though I saw no JDS marking.  The Delta filter it replaced had no Delta marking either so this may be typical.  The filter fits my Delta 50-860 perfectly.  It should fit the 50-859 also since they are the same size.  This filter appears to be better than the Delta filters but I have no way to measure this.  I'd buy this again from the same seller.
356	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I've never been very happy with haynes manuals. I should have known better. Specific repairs to systems such as the parking brake are completely missing. I miss the old chilton books that were twice as thick as these and covered anything you would need to know. I'd probably just stick to google and youtube and skip buying this book.

2893	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used this polish on the headlights and stone guards on a Porsche after buffing them with Meguiar's M17 plastic cleaner:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-M17-Mirror-Glaze-Clear-Plastic-Cleaner-8-oz/dp/B0000AXMD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's M17 Mirror Glaze Clear Plastic Cleaner - 8 oz.</a>. M10 with a PC7424 and orange LC pad really shined up the headlights and stone guards, but it just isn't strong enough to remove heavier marring, oxidation, or scratches. The very small scratches and marring on the stone guards were removed very well and the guards in particular were brought back to their original shine. Before polishing with M10 the guards had a dull luster to them that contrasted quite poorly with the highly polished paint around them. After polishing with M10 the guards blend far better with the paint around them.
3988	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The shape of the top of this funnel looks a little odd, but the first time I used it to pour oil into my car I fully understood it.  The extended portion makes a nice target for the initial pour out of a full bottle of oil.  No more "first drips" to clean up.
9495	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is one of those tools you want to have if you are doing anything involving the timing belt or crankcase. Trying other methods will end in injury or damaging of engine components. An impact wrench should never be used on engine components such as the crankcase. Using this removal tool in combination with a breaker bar will allow someone to easily and correctly remove a crankcase. The tool feels very solid and did not flex or seem to on the verge or breaking at any point during use.

2381	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.  Yes, the darn thing was a pain to install.  Did my homework first with the factory manuals for my Lumina.  Then I trained to be a contorchounist(sp?) to get under the left dash. Worked right off. 400 feet?  No way.  But, I did not route the yellow antenea wire in any special place. As long as it will start from my house to the garage. The only thing worth mentioning is I had to replace the remote transmiter recently (after six years).

4402	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My car is POS 91' Honda Accord and it has a electrical leak somewhere I think near the fan circuit.  Seeing as I paid $1100 for this car in 2008 I see no reason to drop a few hundred bucks to find and fix the issue.  Electrical gremlins are tough to trouble shoot. After getting off on a Friday and not driving the car all weekend during the winter the car didn't really start on Monday mornings. I dread going put there and finding out it was dead which was often.  So I bought this in hopes that it would keep the battery charged so that it would start.  It's an easy hook up to the battery and just shoved the box next to the battery and strung the plug out the front under the hood.  Ran an extension cord from my outside electrical box and plug the car in every night after work. Has yet to fail me.

If you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.

9513	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Removing the Honda crankshaft pulley is practically impossible without a tool like this.

Once I saw how limited the access is to the shackle, I bought a 2nd one to use as a lock on a link on a chain. These are not ultra-heavy duty locks, but I expect any potential thief would have to use a cutting torch or make alot of noise with a saw to get it off. The limited length of the exposed part of the shackle is the advantage of this lock. A very good value for the cost.

Maybe it's a peace of mind thing but so far it's nice to wake up every morning and see the truck in the driveway. Works easily, a little heavy for a little lady but certainly manageable. You do have to remember to get your steering wheel correctly positioned to use it. I'm happy with it and the navy blue matches my truck cuz that's important right?

I haven't tried towing anything with it yet, but I'm sure it will do the job just fine, and it's nice to hace the option of swapping the ball out in seconds vs. finding wrenches and wrestling with trying to get the ball off, or having two different ball mounts. I would recommend this to anyone.
8328	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The mirror is the right size for my needs - watching my rear view in a 22 foot boat. It is convex so it allows a wider view than a flat mirror would. The suction cup is large and sticks well to smooth surfaces.

The single star rating is simply due to Amazon's lack of proper handling of this material, as evidenced by the damaged cans they continue to ship even though several others have already complained about them, and the lack of hardener being included with these when they ship (they come in the case these cans were originally packaged in). My guess is that they crushed the lot and are still trying to sell them to poor unsuspecting customers. These are damaged goods. Shame on you Amazon.

So... here's the technical nitty-gritty:  Yes this thing actually "pumps" energy!  I tested this on a car with a battery reading 11.9V connected to another car with a known-good battery and charging system that was fresh off a several-hundred-mile trip and was resting around 12.8V.  Both cars' engines were off and there was no additional draws on either electrical system.  I connected the unit and once the dead car's battery was at 12.6V (proper charged voltage) the light turned green.  At this point the good car's battery had discharged a bit, down to 12.5V.  Just as a test I left the unit connected and to my surprise the good car's battery went down to 12.3V and the formerly dead car's battery was now at 12.95V!  I put a 12V 6A battery charger on the good car's battery and left everything else hooked up to further experiment. Despite putting the charger on, the good car's battery stayed stubbornly at 12.2V while the dead car's battery reached 13.0V!  So this means that the Wagan unit was moving more than 6 amps to the other battery!  At this point I disconnected the unit and just let the charger recharge the formerly good car's battery.  Both cars started right up.  I should also note that the unit got VERY hot and put out a noticeable electronics smell, so don't run this longer than you have to.  Given that it's for intermittent use and heat sinks are heavy and costly, I'm not surprised.
Also, the cap is wider than the barrel of the pen, so it is harder to tuck in a waterproof wallet with your hunting/fishing tags, so it misses on that purpose.

372	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Many years ago I used to buy repair manuals from Haynes, but at this time I was disappointed with the book. I was looking for a very simple information on spark plug replacement on my 4 cyl. 2010 Tacoma. The spark plugs are comcealed with a plastic cover, but there was no information on how to remove it. The manual also had pictures of worn spark plugs with eroded tips and instructions on gapping the tips. The spark plugs on most new Toyotas are the new type long life  iridium plugs with fine center wire and not recommended for regapping. Some of the black and white pictures in the book are very low quality with hard to see details.
9015	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love these gloves. We've had a very mild Winter here so far but on the day I received these gloves the temps didn't go above 18F. I was able to test them out while doing some work on my car (outside) and they held up great. Of course this was my first time using them but most "high quality" gloves I've owned failed within hours of using in extreme cold. They're a little bulky but as a trucker I appreciate the bulk. As with any Winter clothing you have to be producing body heat for them to work properly. Boots. coats, gloves hats...etc, if you stand around in the cold not doing anything you will get cold. What matters is how well a Winter clothing item holds in heat and lets moisture out. So if you're inactive for long periods of time I don't care what you're wearing, you're going to freeze. In my opinion these gloves use your body heat efficiently. Who knows how long they will last but I'll certainly update my review if anything unusual happens with them. My only issue (if at all) is that they take a long time to dry up after getting wet unless you place them near (not on) a heat source. I tested the Waterproof claim by sticking my hands in the bathroom sink full of water for about 20 minutes and not a drop of water got through but the outer shell took hours to dry off. So if you're going to be using these for prolonged cold/wet exposure to the elements I may be a little concerned about the gloves freezing over. Man, I hope these last!

I tried this because I had used a product called Wipe New which worked fine at first on my headlight lenses but after a couple of days, they just fogged up again and actually looked worse than before I used the Wipe New.

1770	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Honestly just terrible. comes saturated in oil and can't be used right away. It says that it won't work correctly until 2-3 uses.

When I told them I was using a Fluke certified instrument they then wanted to know the inrush current. I told them that there was little inrush current with the load being incandescent light bulbs.

6946	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Absorbs water as it says. The only issue is you can't use a true wiping action as far as a back and forth motion. It will catch on the paint and roll out of your hand because the water dries so quickly. Overall does the job as described.
Some things worthy of noting.  For a job as small as a spoiler, you need to make tiny batches of filler and spread them on quickly.  The filler will harden past any hope of applying it in roughly 2 minutes.  As long as you have some kind of a hand file, a large variety of sand paper, and you work quickly, you can cover up your messes without much trouble.  Actually, I didn't find the filler difficult at all to sand down to hand smooth, but I wasn't exactly targeting show car quality work and I was hacking on it before it was 100% cured.  If I weren't working on my daily, I'd have used more filler and taken another hour or two to do the job right.

- Many of the more common repair tasks (brakes, oil change, body work, etc.. ) are heavily coppied between the vairous Haynes manuals for different models, so often lack spesific details that would be helpfull.  You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is.
1491	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised when I tried this out finding it "pumps" power from the "source" car into the "dead" car.  I assumed that this would let the power thru from the source (which is at a higher voltage) to the dead one & slow/stop the flow of power if the voltages equalized, but it doesn't.  It continues to draw on the source to feed power into the dead one (even if it makes the source drop to under 12V while the dead one gets raised to 13+V which I saw on meters hooked up on both ends).  I also tried hooking this up to a small battery to charge it and it had it at 17V pretty quick, so it doesn't regulate the voltage (over 15V is considered overcharging most batteries, but this is intended for brief use).  Also the first time I tried it, it didn't begin charging (although I had it plugged in) until I started the good car. I'm not sure what held it back initially & triggered the change, but it's instantly started charging when I plugged it in ever since.
6622	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome fan for our RV. We do a lot of dry camping and love the 12V operation. With our solar panels we can run it as often as we need it. Moves a lot of air and is fairly quiet.

9159	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works well. Not too hot, but definitely effective. My dog wraps himself up in this in the back of my car while I'm at work (3 seasons of the year). I find the spring on the cigarette / 12v outlet to big a little bit strong (squirts out of the outlet 1/8", which it wouldn't do if the spring were weaker/shorter), but it mostly stays in the outlet. The first one broke after 3 weeks, and Amazon replaced it. The second one has given us no problems. On a future production run, they need to shorten the length of the spring inside the outlet plug.

2724	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Good for indoor use but what's the point then.  Wind constantly blows the front and back end off. They give you rope about 1/8" thick to keep the center tied down but thats it.  I'm constantly almost daily basis pulling it back down and 19' is not enough to cover a dodge charger even though Amazon says it's enough. I pulled it down one day and it ripped like paper.

9840	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is thinner than the stock air cleaner.  I put this in at the same time as I added a Dynomax cat-back exhaust system.

Junk.
7955	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is smooth and a breeze to apply. After working with bondo this putty is light years ahead.

I had no issue with any screws or threads rusting out or stripping from my LoadWarrior, which has been on my roof for like 4 years prior to buying this extension. So that worked out great, and I was a little bummed out about the possibility of having to get the extension and then not be able to set it up right away due to things stripping or rusting. But, that was not the case!
9831	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have had full intake systems on previous cars, but for this vehicle, I decided just to get this insert filter.  I fits perfectly, and seems to be of good quality.  Who knows if these are really better than the OEM version, but it's not that expensive, so you might as well throw it in.  It should last for 40,000 miles before I have to clean it.
Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.  Absolutely 5 stars.
7619	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Use to dry my car.  So far so good!
6832	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used two different types of bathroom caulk to seal up  where a shower drain meets the wall. In both cases, in a matter of weeks, the caulk peeled off and the shower started to leak again.  This stuff goes on like liquid rubber. It gets everywhere like paint.  I got a big glob on the front of my head. Don't ask how. I have a wedding to go to next week. I panicked and was going to put acetone on my head, but didn't want to look like the guy from Powder.  I googled, and binged. I found peanut butter. Luckily I don't eat chunky, and the black goo came out with enough PB and no J to feed a small family.
6837	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent fan for our motorhome, which is our full-time home.  Works well at moving air without being so large we can't store it in a cabinet.  High quality product.
2676	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Really like this helmet. It fits great. I was worried about sizing issues due to other comments, but had no issues. I wear a large helmet and ordered a large. When it arrived I put it on and it fit perfectly. Not too loose not too tight, but the perfect snugness you want from a helmet. The only complaint I have is that the visor snaps aren't that great. It's difficult sometimes to get them lined up and when you think it is snapped securely it's not, but when you do get them snapped properly it stays on just fine.
4212	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product.  I sprayed the cad plated hardware that came with a hitch kit with it about 6 months ago.  The coating has proven durable and I see no evidence of the coating separating.  The hardware still looks brand new.

5077	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	it has a very rubbery texture, which is weird, but does dry efficiently.  easy to wring out.  update:  i use this to wipe down my shower and tub, and i had to stop storing it in the tube after a couple of weeks because it got foosty and funky smelling; i washed it, and now i just wring it out and fold it up and leave it on the corner of the tub, and it seems fine so far.  i will update again if that changes.
2612	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very handy helmet bag. I personalized it with my name badge. So it is easy to find among the other bags.
6588	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works good!
8622	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	As the previous reviewer has mentioned, this device doesn't hold together really well. In my experience, this really only refers to the pump cylinder itself. The pump has a collar at the bottom that is pressed down over a rubber grommet that surrounds the neck and one-way valve at the top of the tank. That fitting is a bit loose and requires the user to use both hands to keep the pump held tight on the tank while actuating the vacuum pump. For me this wasn't an issue, as the draw tube stayed secure inside the mower engine, all by itself. But it would certainly be improved by some sort of lock or latch to keep the pump in place.
802	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Added this to a generac generator that didn't have a filter. The unit still works and it has additional protection..
7607	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Complete kit to do the water pump on my 1994 Mercruiser Alpha I Gen II outdrive.  I have no complaints using this kit vs. the factory Mercury parts I've used in the past.  Price is comparable with the Sierra being a bit cheaper depending on where you buy.  There is a leftover face gasket that's not used in my application so be aware of that.  Boat is running cool as ever!
785	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place. If you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust, this is what you need. It can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust.
3982	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this to add fuel additive in my gas tank. Works perfect!
9130	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is hard to find.  I use the wax on the aluminum table on the Shopsmith.
But remember, this is a cooler -- not a refrigerator. It uses thermoelectric cooling which is very inefficient and limited in its ability to reduce temperature. You will only be able to cool about 30-40 degrees lower than ambient temperature.
Update:
2720	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a must for any road traveler, and the price can't be beat.  The only downside is the shipping due to these being quite heavy, and they are heavy for a reason.  Large trucks generate a substantial amount of wind over 45 mph.  If you can, find a local store that sells this item (now who would sell there own merchandise in store).  While you're at it be sure to pick up a good vest and maybe a pair of gloves.  It will defintely help increase your visibility when you need these markers on the side of the road on a dark wet night.
They simply works. Read the instruction.
4109	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product!
8854	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've had one of these for probably 15 years and it's STILL a great device. I've used it on four trucks, two Miatas, three Mustangs, and even some friends' vehicles when needed. Easy to use. Sure... if they want your vehicle there's nothing you can do BUT it does what it says and is highly visible. I recommend this to friends and would definitely buy another.
I sometimes use the absorber for greasy cleaning, on those occassions, I will wash it in the washer.  It comes out perfectly fine.  I don't put it in the dryer as there is no need.

6733	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked as described. For salt water it's probably great; but for fresh water I don't think it's any better then regular household silicon sealant. Also the instructions on the tube stated the entire tube must be used in one application or else it will harden in the tube. I used a little bit and put the tube away. A few months later it was still fine.

29	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Received. Took it out of the box. Attachment pieces do not fit on the hose. So you can only put the directly on the vacuum which will not allow you to get in between your seats or in areas you need the attachment on the hose. The hose also falls out of the vacuum.

9660	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nice and solid product the only thing is you have oversized tires "over stock" they will rub when turned hard over to either side. They are molded to the contour of the vehicle but do not quite follow exactly. A heat gun on the wheel side to soften the plastic will solve that issue.
8270	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great look and quality!  Compliments the Chesapeake SS 6 gauge set I ordered.
3895	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Did not work for me!  The hole in lock was too small and would not go over the u-bolt.  Had to drill it out to size.  Once lock was installed (as per instructions) I could turn the entire lock assembly (a little hard but), and at same time, loosening the lug nut and  thereby able to remove the tire.

3200	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Although I did not buy through Amazon, my Budge B-2 car cover started to tear after only 4 years. The entire life of the cover was spent covering a car in the garage.

The cover was removed no more than 15 times over the four years it was used.

7976	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is great to have when you have multiple ball sized trailers. However, be sure to keep the pins well lubricated to prevent seizing and I would recommend to keep out of the elements when not in use.

Like the 3 adjustable speeds.
- The hose is long enough. I used to have to put the Mitvac on top of a box of Mobile 1 oil to get it high enough off the ground to make it work. I could have bought a new hose, but at $75, it should have everything I need. The HT Moto is much better in terms of this.
it works as advertised.  Visibility while driving in the rain and snow increased significantly as a result of the elements sliding off the glass surfaced.  The best way to describe the effect of rain-x and water is to compare how one would add oil to a non-stick pan.  The oil in the pan would run freely in the direction where the pan is tilted.  Water and glass surfaces treated with rain-x act similarly.  At freeway speeds, the rain would just be pushed off by the effect of the wind.  During periods of light rain, I don't even turn on the wiper blades anymore because visibility is better without the wiper blades on thanks to rain-x.  I now apply rain-x to tail-lights, front lights, fog lights, side mirrors, side windows, moon-roof.
6181	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's for my 24 foot boat trailer.
price was decent, seems to work ok, plaid seems a bit faked but still attractive; hope it will last for a while.

1637	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used their smaller duster in my vehicles for almost 20 years - yes the same one!!! I bought this to dust my floors with since the standard dust "mops" just push the dust and dirt around and will not truly pick it up. I also have very long hair which plugs up my vacuum. I removed the duster from the wooden base (slips off) and put it on my old dust mop's head even though it is about 3/4 the length and it works so well!! I did learn though that I can not place it on the floor mop-side down but must stand it upright and against something that will not absorb the wax. I have several types of flooring throughout my house and this works well on all of them.
8946	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This little guy is just what I wanted.  I have a 2001 CRV, and the clock just stopped working.  This item fit over the existing clock and looks decent. Quick fix.  The item gets 4 stars because the display would probably be hard to see in trucks where you would be sitting way above eye level.  Also, you have to push the clock for it to light up (this makes sense or the battery would die fast).. it is a little hard to do while driving :)
2897	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	purchased for 83 Chevy El Camino.  Best if used for a garage cover and not prolonged outdoor use.  Maybe if you want to cover your car while at work or something.  Thin material. Fit snug.  Covered 1/2 of the rims and tires.  i don't expect it to last more than a year in the hot hawaiian sun.
So back to my weird habit..  I bought this as an experiment for RVing and using friend's showers.  A towel is just so bulky and using this allows me to cram it into my shower bag which contains all my shower items and even shower sandals from the 99 cent store.
7629	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just thought it was unreal that after i read the instructions that you leave in the tube wet after use
3812	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Did not fit, needed a different type of lock.

1874	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These are great dusters! Just takes awhile to break them in. Lots of red lint at first but it goes away over time. I use these mainly on the interiors of my vehicles and they work well.
744	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Identical match.  Was able to pull out old and put new in from inside the attic. Quiet.
9889	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you gotta truck and you spend time outdoors, your boots are gonna get muddy at some point. These do an excellent job of keeping the dirt in the tray and protecting your carpet. Easy to take in and out for cleaning. Would definitely recommend these. Don't waste your money on cheap floor mats.
5451	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Looks good and I hope I never have its function tested  The build is sturdy and well done......
2551	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Just got this little pump and so far only have one complaint. I have this mounted on a 45 gallon aluminum tank in my truck and this rascal is loud. Granted, it's on a smaller aluminum tank so that's part of the problem, but my Dad has a GPI  (silver pump) on a larger steel tank and it's so quiet you can barely hear it over his truck rumbling. I can't say that's a fair comparison since one is a large steel tank and one is small aluminum but I do believe GPI is a quieter pump. Other than that, this pump runs like a top and does the job I need it to do.
4636	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Tested on a discharged battery and it charged it over night. Great for your boat/bike or anything that you need to charge over night for use the next day. If your looking for a charger that charges in 10 mins. this is not the one. Great product, and shipping. Thanks Amazon
...btw, the "karaoake" guy review is total nonsense--his karaoake must be something he uses in a small bathroom where he only entertains himself while he's in the shower.  Try and locate him and get the details and you'll not find him...buyer beware of paid-off testimonials.
7014	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great stuff.  I use it on my wakeboard boat and it looks like new every time.  I also use same product in a polish before I wax it.  Really brings out the colors very nicely.
1752	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've owned multiple car dusters and the California Car Duster is definitely the best.  Other dusters don't pick up nearly as much dust, so you need to go over the dusty areas multiple times.  The California Car Duster has a denser cluster of hairs, which may explain why it picks up so much dust on a single pass.

7605	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Like many people I am disappointed that the ball is only rated for 8,000 lbs.  However, I was aware of this before my purchase.  I like that the balls can swivel, but don't care for the way they change.  Sometimes you need a coin to be able to release or lock the ball, it would be nice if it were tool-free.  This is the second set that I bought, so I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
5176	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Keep all those sham wows. I have used Absorber Chamois for years, much better than natural ones or any other brands.
8965	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product and easy to use
8789	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for lubricating the zerk fittings on golf cars.  It works fine and is easy to load the grease cartridge.  I wish the extension had the swivel-type, zerk adapter so you can get into tight spots.  I used my old one...just removed it from that gun and installed it on the new one.  The extension that comes with this gun only allows straight on use.  A person may want to buy a flexible hose, or something similar, in addition to the this gun.
UPDATE- I found someone with this same book but their version does not contain the updates mine does on newer ac systems. I imagine that now only the updated versions are sold but who knows. This may be why some people have complained about the book being outdated.
807	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's a fuel filter, and you need to repace these sparringly, but if you don't you could be causing issues.

It also comes with a very elegant case, looks like glasses case!
7485	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great absorbent product. We use it in our showers and on spills around the house. It absorbs just about everything we have thrown at it and more from others that have used it. It is simple and easy to use just keep it slightly damp and it is ready to go again. Even if it dries out just get it wet and it is back to normal. Do not throw away the sleeve it comes in, you will need it as it is the best way of keeping the cloth moist while storing it.
6627	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love this little fan...
8975	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works
3926	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's a funnel with a guard for catching any liquids that might overshoot the opening. That feature is pretty helpful because it's a little small at the top, but useful for filling small bottles of cleaners using larger tubs. Priced pretty well, I'd say you can't go wrong with this little tool.
What you REALLY need, for hours of service on real-world "appliances" is a "bucket of high-Ah SLA's" (i.e. high AmpHour SealedLeadAcid batteries) and a separate power inverter (DC to AC power inverter).  This will wind up weighing 200+ pounds, and it is NOT "portable"...I repeat it is NOT portable unless you have a pet pack mule...
4148	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product really does a nice job after using the Meguiar's product to remove the oxidation.
6175	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a simple product that is constructed well and easy to use.  Cost is low.  I don't recommend forgetting the chocks are in place and pulling the trailer over them, as these lightweight units tend to squish a bit when run over, but they are a good tradeoff of cost and weight versus holding ability.  I haven't had any problem with them slipping on a variety of surfaces including blacktop, gravel, dirt, grass and cement.
3112	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I thought I was buying the type that you fill the washer fluid reservoir with, but found that this "original" formula works great as well.  You wipe it on a clean windshield, and then buff out with a dry towel.  Rain water then beads up and rolls off the windshield, which improves your ability to see while driving through a storm.  It also seems to stay "on" for a while.  I highly recommend it.
8820	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice pump for the $.

4799	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have a 33' long 5th wheel trailer that's 12' high.  After having extensively worked this unit over with 3M's fiberglass gelcoat restorer and wax, a task that took considerable effort over more than a week of chipping away at it, I was happy with the results.  That said, I live in the desert and figured a good coat of Mequire's Flagship Boat product would be beneficial if for nothing else as to add in some UV protection (this product touts that as a key attribute).  So a couple of weeks after the 3M work I applied this product to my large trailer and the results were extremely disappointing.

5325	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Been using this for 10+ years to dry cars after washing, instead of an actual sheep skin chamois.  Can be cleaned in a washing machine.  Store damp rolled up in the plastic container to prevent drying out and hardening.  Does not mildew.  I replace it every year or two.
9447	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works fine for 1/3 the cost of the Factory Tool. Unless your a Pro Honda Tech and want to prop up you ego, go for this China copy. It's gonna spend 99% of its life in your box hiding anyway. Trust me.
4246	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great charger/maintainers
9907	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this for my 2011 Yukon XL Denali, it fit perfectly.  The installation was easy, it took about 6 minutes to install, most of the time was opening and closing my car's filter case which has screws.
My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.
1916	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great way to keep the dust off your car.  When I lived in Arizona, the dust was just awful.  I lived out in the country and my car always seemed to get caked with dust minutes after I washed it.  The CA duster did an awesome job of minimizing my trips to the car wash back then.  Things here in Califas aren't as bad as Arizona, but this duster keeps my cars looking car wash clean between washes.  I highly recommend it.  Plus, it's super gentle on the paint.
7358	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked great on my snowmobile trailer.
6838	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these to affix to my dog's travel kennel for hunt tests and field trials to keep him cool and to dry him off.  I had already been through three other fans that either burned out or just didn't fit well on the kennel door.  This fan fit PERFECTLY on the kennel door using 4 ball bungees.  It has three speeds which are the perfect range for a dog, and it appears to be made very well.  One lady in my HRC club told me that she has had two of these for over 8 years and they still work great.  The power cable is just long enough to reach the outlet on my truck's dash when the fan is on my dog's kennel in the back seat of my truck.  Very happy with this!
5655	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ordered the CR-007A because it is supposed to be a tail/brake light combination.  This one has no tail light function. Initially, I was impressed with the quality for the money.  But if it doesn't work, it's no deal.

6649	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	3m 5200 adhesion.  This is the real deal, used to reglue sole on newer work boots that had separated. Works great and really holds. I previously had a shoe repair shop repair a pair of boots for me and soles came loose again in a short time. The repair I made with this adhesive has already held for months, very satisfied with product. Can be messy if not used carefully, don't apply too much as it will ooze out from soles of boots if used in that application like I did. I'm sure it will work in many others.  It does have a seven day drying time so if time is an issue they make a quick cure version, but I have no experience with that version.
8422	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great battery. Be careful not to over tighten terminal nuts (like the nitwit that was helping me did) as bolts are a brass alloy and easily stripped. Fortunately each terminal had two mounting points.

2385	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This was a simple project and the kit contains almost everything you will need to install your remote starter. It was a time consuming project so keep your afternoon clear and visit Bulldogsecurity.com and look up your vehicle's wiring chart. The chart identifies the wires on your specific model that you need to connect and whether or not you will need a security bypass module or relays. They also have pictures of key locations to help you identify where to find those wires. If I were to do this again, I would order the T-harness to speed up the installation and minimize potential damage to the vehicles wiring.

I then used it to drain the reservoirs for my boat's porta bracket hydraulic system. It worked perfect! Great idea. You may want to somehow check with the company or a mechanic to see if this product is functional for your specific application. Luckily I have many uses for it and am very happy with my purchase.
2427	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This mount is being used on the road warrior cargo cage. It is surprising these two parts lock a bike in. Bike is head in solid and will not budge. My only issue with the mount is the quick release for the fork. It can be a pain to loosen the bolt for use and was a bit of a hassle using the first few times. You can add the locks for the bike mount and if you ahve multiple systems I would recommend syncing all the locks to be the same
I like the size since I keep it in the vehicle for touch up cleaning.  Easy to store.
I  derived a wholly unknown comprehensive viewpoint thus, and finalized this knowledge by buying this unit, which was also very cheap.  It's a really neat addition to what is  truely my four-wheeled indulgence.
This is a great product for a driveway detailing auto enthusiast like myself!

So EZ even a cavemen can use it!

6537	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This little fan really puts out.  Nice to see that a 12v fan can produce this much air flow.
8276	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Use it for our Polaris Ranger 900.  It doesn't come with a rear-view mirror and I wanted one that would hold and be adjustable.  Also needed it to be removable for when the windshield comes off (if it ever does).  Has never fallen down!!  Did use the suggestion of putting some Vaseline on the suction cup before applying to windshield.  Works great!
4594	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Unlike some of the other reviews I've read I found the lights on the charger pretty easy to understand.  They have 6 lines of text right on the charger explaining them.  I use it to maintain my truck, combined with KATS engine and battery heaters so I never have to wonder if my truck will start at -40 in January in Idaho.  Good product
Love it

1906	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is very impressive. It is like a magnet for the dust. After a good cleaning and waxing this rids the car of the dust that seems to materialize out of thin air and it all looks perfect again. Only takes a few seconds.
7615	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit perfectly on my 4 cylinder 3.0 Mercruiser inboard / outboard.
2594	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I buy these over and over for all our toys, they haven't failed me yet.
If you like oil all over your garage or car, this is the best way I have found to get it there.
8180	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works really well!
and it gets pretty hot. So I rigged it with and on and off button on my dash.

8650	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	works well, but for my Chevy Express van in would not reach to the oil, also had some trouble with Honda van, and a mini cooper I had to put it on top of the engine.
9287	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It works well though it does have some " slop "
976	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I don't see a difference personally between the original and the platinum. But anyways, it works. I bought it because my old one was fouled to the point to where it wouldn't even spark. The new plug obviously didn't fix my oil problem but definitely help the motor run.
5625	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised. Great buy
2721	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I closely examined a couple of different safety triangles on the market and these appear to be of the highest quality.  They are heavy and for the most part that is a good thing (they don't fall over with big rigs etc going by) but it also adds to the shipping. The tabs that interlock the top of the triangle appear that they will hold up well. Look carefully at the shipping costs it can almost double the price even when going with the cheapest shipping method.
6384	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good stuff.

5670	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Used on a acrylic motorcycle windshield to remove a fine "hairline" scratch...didnt even come close to making it look better. Waste of time.
905	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit well. Just what I needed.
This stuff works .
Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and am excited that I finally have a safe means for storing food in my camper van.
The sound emitted, a series of chirps, is somewhat audible in the vehicle when you are driving at less than about 40 mph. You don't hear it at higher speeds so it's not annoying. Hearing it at lower speeds reminds me to shut it off when I'm coming into a town (say on a long trip). It's not super loud but people would wonder what is up with your vehicle for sure if you had it on all the time.
2629	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great helmet bag; the bag is lines with fur, big, and sturdy.
4406	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have several of these battery conditioners.  The old design used a noisy iron core transformer. The new design uses an switching regulator, and makes no noise. The new design is not as heavy as the older design.  I have had one of the older charger on the same boat battery for 7 years before someone stoled the battery.  I am glad they did not take the charger.
1378	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	factory product.  These last for years

4047	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good price for good quality plugs. Thanks!
5550	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Work well.

The pump must be held vertical on the unit for it to work. Its a press fit and will slip the seal easily if not held down.
8887	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Hope it keeps the car from being stolen.
442	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Was Great
8937	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice basic pump.  I use it for tires that require 70 - 80PSI with schreader valves and it works great.  No built in pressure guage but for the price that's OK.
9716	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say.  Removable, cleanable, put it back in and run it down the road.  Never buy another air filter again...ever.  And more air flow, especially when pulling heavy loads you can feel the difference.
4907	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Bought the balls? You must have the box. Dinged one star because the cover doesn't stay on very well.
6883	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Its an extension harness and it does what it is supposed to do. Appears to be of reasonable quality. So it is as I expected it to be.
8548	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked like a charm for changing the oil in my lawnmower. From start to finish about 15 min.
9911	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I get fewer miles per gallon...  It was a noticeable drop...  I put the OEM air filter back in after several thousand miles and obtained better MPG immediately. The "instant MPG" told the story right away and I should have changed it out right away, but there was so much hype about K&N products, I thought my onboard computer was not correct.

3145	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have used rainx for years, I love it. However, I think they are cheap rascals because the company does not put a washer under the cap to keep it from leaking all over the place. So, either buy a washer to place under the cap, place in another container or put up with the leakage and smell in your car.
What can I say?  Its a funnel.  It serves its purpose of allowing a large amount of liquid to be poured into a small opening.  The small end is able to fit into the transmission fluid dip stick location on my 2004 Ford Expedition with the 5.4 V8.  For the extra buck, I wish I had got the two pack.  If I had to give it a negative, I would say the reservoir is a little small for big jobs.
8828	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product
6374	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Classic!! Does a great job at quickly drying a vehicle.
Also comes with a plastic cover so the fabric surfaces don't pick up debris

9689	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	very good
782	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Doesn't block sound that much, but it does reduce dust.  Fits Shop Vacs.
This is truly a multi-purpose tool and at a bargain price.
5383	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's more of a shiny piece of plastic sticker than anything else. It does get the job done tho as functioning as a rear view mirror. Still would have preferred some sort of plexi or tempered glass.

9768	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fitment was perfect. Hangs lower than the Weathertechs and offers good coverage, even for 11.5" wide (285mm) tires.
5583	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great item for the price.
4039	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just received this item today. The cover is larger that I expected (4.5" W x 5" H) so it really strands out. It is metal and is very sturdy. The shiny, chrome finish looks very good. However, the part that slides into the hitch receiver is plastic and is 2 pieces. You attach these 2 pieces to the back of the cover using 4 included screws & lock washers. This seems sort of "cheesy" but it appears sturdy when assembled and my previous hitch cover was entirely plastic. It lasted a long time until another vehicle hit it. The only slight flaw is the included foam spacer (meant to ensure a snug fit) is a little thin, so the cover does not fit tight. I'll slice a thin section off the foam spacer from my old hitch cover and add it to make it snug. Overall, very happy with this hitch cover for the price.
then went to use them would not charge.
8490	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is great! Been using this to change my oil on an Audi a4, and since the oil filter of my car is on top of the engine, changing my oil now just takes me 10 mins! 2 minutes to set this up, 1 minute to change the filter, 1 minute to refill the oil and 6 minutes to enjoy a cold beer while feeling good about myself cause i just saved a lot of $$$ not going to the dealer. I also did check if this thing was getting all the oil in the engine by using this to extract everything i can and then removing the bolt from the oil pan. very minimal oil drained from the pan so that means that this thing sucked almost 5 qts of oil from my engine. After that i never doubted this thing ever again.
The other reviews are correct.  This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.  Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.  After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.
5537	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ok
Now I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have a difficult time with the rivets. I could squeeze but it took a lot of force to get the rivet to pop off. It would be 5 stars if they had a ratchet system or some other way of making it easier to squeeze. But for what it is, it's basic and easy to understand how to operate. I successfully added 14 rivets to my kayak and now have bungee deck rigging securely in place with no concern it would pop off.
These cables fit the bill. The handles also appear to be fairly durable, which is important. I have had cheaper cables have the insulation on the handles flake off. Makes for a painful jump.
4904	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	They aren't perfect but they do absorb a ton of water. I like to dry my car a panel at a time using the absorber followed by a plush microfiber or waffle weave.
3221	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works but not long if you use wipers a lot as it wipes it off after a while
3) The documentation is in one language, English.  I don't have to pick through a mess of multi-lingual text.  Nor is the documentation one of those universal language pictogram style directions.
3637	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Spare stays out all the time. Still there.
Same thing with my truck, it just feels alot better now and feels like it gets going sooner when I press the pedal (which can help in an emergency, get out of the way, situation.) Hope this helps
Although it's otherwise a nicely made tool, I went back to my trusty fixed marking gauge. I tossed this one into the box containing my ever-growing collection of tools that seemed like a good idea but didn't really work out.
4858	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't expect this to actually work this well. It's incredible. Just slide it across the surface of your car after washing and the water just disappears. It leaves no streaks, swirls, or scratches. I used to use a leaf blower to dry my car but this works so much faster, and no noise. Just wring it out and put it back in the box when done. I usually leave it out to dry for about 20 minutes before putting it up.
6421	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Keeping a houseboat cool on hot summer days can be a challenge.  Rather than run the air conditioner and burn up gas (which isn't cheap these days), we wanted a good fan that would really move the air.  This fan surprised even my extremely skeptical husband as it moves a great deal of air on all three speeds.  In fact, we are so impressed with the Endless Breeze, we have another one on the way.
3516	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Waste...
3924	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
3247	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The cover is thin enough that you can actually see details of your vehicle under it-- and if you can see through it, you'd better believe the UV rays will get through!  This is an excellent cover for longer term storage that's already protected from the sun.  Don't bet on it preventing your paint from fading in direct sunlight-- or keeping it very dry in the rain!
8935	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Unfortunately this product has made me use my least favorite expression "you get what you pay for".
9045	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	there is no heat on these blowers, after calling the company I was told the heat comes from the fan motor and would be more noticeable when the temperature is 75+ degrees outside. why would I need heat  at that time?
5417	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	2nd one I ordered, the slightest bump and it is broken. I put a new one in my boat on saturday 7/13 and I bumped it on sunday 7/14
8411	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely the best battery you can buy.  I have put these in every powersport item I own.  As long as you take care of them they last 4 years easily.
5988	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I'm giving the lock one star because the prop fell off when I started the boat. Luckily I found the prop. My son went into the water and found the prop. I followed the directions correctly and verified installation with McGard. When I spoke with Mcgard they said I installed the lock correctly. I asked them why the prop fell off. He asked me if I used never seize on the threads. I said no. I did use the special grease that the mercrusier manual said to put onto the threads on the shaft. He said you can't put grease on the threads thats what made the lock fail and the prop spin off. Not so sure I accept this answer, especially when the manual calls for greasing the shaft. I took the lock off and kept the grease on the threads and went back to using the tab washer and nut on the prop. I'll take my chances without the lock.

A++++ seller and fast shipping too.
- works better than chamois in absorbing water.
8034	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits good
7695	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I finally had a good weather week and was able to wash my truck. I was skeptical about buying these but I have to tell you, this synthetic chamois is just as good if not better than the real skin. It absorbs without leaving streaks and is durable. I can tell from the feel that these will last longer than a real skin. Highly recommended.
1516	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works good, needs better more secure mounting tabs or even a mounting plate.
437	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great
2719	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	will see after a year or two if it holds up?
1641	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works much better than I expected.
128	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I was very, very disappointed with this manual.  I bought it to change out my fule injectors.  Information is way too technical for beginners or intermediates.  Too many sections assume you have a working knowledge already.  Pass this one over for the Chilton's version which has step by step instructions with pictures.
2746	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a perfect fit for a Benz SL.  It covers from under the front bumper to under the back bumper.  The 4 wheels are also covered to about 80%.  It hugs the outline of the car similar to a custom fit except for the side mirrors.
They charged me $3.33 for it, for $1 It's ok.
7959	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've bought this product about 12 years ago on a different website and ive hauled upto 12k lbs. With this for about 100 miles several times and never had a problem.... I am purchasing another set for a gift for a friend... Trust me you shouldn't be disappointed...
7396	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked perfect to rewire my cargo trailer.
4778	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice.  As expected.

3946	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Be sure your wheel will allow this lock to go all the way on. It didn't work for the wheel I bought it for, but did work on another wheel I had, so I'm ok with that. You need enough "flat" space around the lug for the lock mechanism to fit.
Number of times car was stolen after purchase: 0

5636	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works well.
7946	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the best glazing putty I have ever used.
1522	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great. Had it for about 6 months, have gone thru several utility power (short 3 second) hits and one that lasted for an hour. AND no beeping sounds as heard from the standard UPS units. AND you just keep adding batteries for longer duration outages. Recommend AGM type batteries for use in house. I have 2 130 AH AGM Optima blue top deep cycles connected.

363	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I prefer Haynes to Chilton's, and I don't even start anything anymore without a manual.
9921	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Purchased for my garage wall to protect both the car and the wall.  Attaches with screws, is wide enough that it is pretty forgiving if you don't exactly nail the placement.  I had used a stick in place bumper earlier and they kept falling off with the temp changes in the garage.  Only complaint is that the part really is pretty basic, the cost seems high for what is basically a long piece of soft plastic.
5843	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great
452	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this bright yellow flag sticker.  It's just large enough for when a Tea Party hating person rides your bumper in traffic to see as you're flashing them "a sign"....  What else to say, it comes off the backing paper easily, it didn't run in the car wash.
3442	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have always used the other "FLITZ" polished; this works just as well.
These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber.  This was definately not it!
1822	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The best! Don't buy any other brand...the plastic handles will break and they don't work as well. Makes my car look pretty all the time, and I'm sure it helps save the paint. Just don't do it when your cat's around, it's all a game for them.
268	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a Haynes manual for every vehicle I own. These manuals go in depth from top to bottom front to back. They contain wiring diagrams, troubleshooting guides, photos, step by step instructions, etc. If you make repairs yourself or want to diagnose a problem, this manual is for you. The manuals are written based on a complete teardown of the vehicle.
I would reccomend taping off any fiberglass to prevent staining from the wheel.
9966	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When you have to have a readily available and open topped trash bin this is the one to have.  Weighted bottom keeps it upright while traveling.

3377	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great ....you do not have to use your wipers as much...water rolls right off

4771	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you're into washing your own car, you must own one of these!! This is great! I have a SUV and this by it self does the job great! No need to have multiple towels! I love this product! This would be a nice gift and for the price, it's well worth it!
1766	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have used several other dust brushes, but this leaves chemical streaks from what ever it is treated with.  The streaks were more difficult to wipe and clean than using wax.  Why purchase a dust brush that leaves more than what it is intended for?  Returning it and will go to Walmart and purchase the another one that I used to use in the past.
Otherwise they become a mess.
318	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Still wish these would come with a CD that had some sort of program to load on a computer and help better identify items.
9313	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great tool to have if you ever do any Civic crank pulleys. This is one of those tools you gotta have in the toolbox just in case!

Very clear (No wiggle in the mirror surface).  Size is larger than other blind spot mirrors I've purchased. Build quality is 'professional'.  Suction cup adhesion is strong. If I needed another one I'd buy it again.
7390	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow, these things soak up water as if it was thirsty. It's an awesome product and dried my car so much more efficiently.
I gave it two stars, because it does glue other things well.  You'll find other comments here and elsewhere about this failure to hold back gasoline.
6311	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	They work, I have even run them over a few times. Always have a set when you have a camper

6647	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent at removing the oxidation on my RV.  It left a great finish, smooth, good shine it seem to be holding up well.  I used a buffer to apply all three phases where I could , the rest done by hand.  It goes on well and comes off fairly easy.
7421	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This chamois comes in a plastic box and as soon as you open - you will find that it is wet - weird isn't it, why would someone ship you a wet towel ?  The reason is that when it gets dry, it becomes as stiff as a paper board.

5094	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These synthetic drying towels are awesome, the amount of water it's able to absorb is pure magic. These towels leave no water residue behind. Make sure to leave it a little wet when you store it in the container that it came with. Even if the towel dries, you can just run it under water and it will go back to normal. Now my family only dries our cars with these towels, you don't have to worry about scratching your car with these synthetic towels.

4622	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Either I am using it wrong or the product doesn't dry the cars as others described. I bought this based on other reviews, I used it once and my car ended up with alot of swirls. I will try again another time and see if I can get better results.

5318	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so. The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.

1336	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very comfortable and easy to use. Wheels never get jammed going forward & backward under the vehicle. Not easy to hang on the wall.  I drilled a hole in the front to attach a rope so I could pull my kids around with it, they love it too. Like a low rider wagon.
1856	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I followed the instructions and let the duster sit face down on some newspapers for 48 hours. It did leave little stains on the newspaper as expected. I then lightly "dusted" my car. The car was cool to the touch. The duster left tiny red flakes of brush all over the car. Despite how much I shook the duster, they were spreading with each use. The duster also left streaks in the finish. I was disappointed and used a soft detail cloth to clean up the mess this duster created. The duster appears and feels well made. Returned.

Buy it, apply per directions, you won't be sorry.

I've never actually put this stuff on my car and boy was I missing out. I would highly recommend getting this 7 OZ package and NOT the spray bottle. This stuff is easy to put on. Get yourself a paper towel (nothing fancy required) fold it in half, pour some of this on the corner, wipe glass of windshield. Keep in mind it obviously cannot be raining/snowing/monsooning/etc when you are putting this on. Let it dry so it creates a film, then using a fresh paper towel wipe it off. I put it on the wife's car, took in total around 12 minutes. I can now thankfully see during the rain/snow snows we always find ourselves driving through. We did find that this treatment worked significantly better and lasts way longer (months) than the spray on or the rain-x that is in the windshield washer fluid.

VW automatic transmissions use a number of electronic sensors to monitor the automatic transmission environment.  The code that Actron CP9135 autoscanner provided meant G38 transmission speed sensor had failed.  I purchased G38 sensor online for approximately $30 and installed myself.  Problem seemed immediately solved.  I have put fifteen thousand miles on transmission since.  Problem was indeed solved.  There is no doubt in my mind dealership mechanics or even certain real mechanics have more than once taken $1000 or more from frightened low information customers facing the same issue.

By the way, when MAF sensor is contaminated, it starts sending signal corresponding to a lower than actual airflow. The engine controller reacts by actually leaning the fuel mixture. This will be happening BEFORE you have any error messages. And excessively lean fuel mixture can severely damage your engine (exhaust valves/seats in particular). So decide for yourself if you want all these problems down the road. I took this thing out...

763	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Over the years I have installed an attic fan in my house and in my garage. They do make a difference. I have replaced three of these motors since 1985. They probably were good but I didn't know it. These motors are open shaded pole 42 frame motors. They have an oiler wick in the front and rear. There are no bearings. Because of the heat in your attic, the wicks dry. They need to be oiled regularly. Who wants to climb into the attic with 110 degrees in the summer heat and oil your fan motor? Then again, don't they always fail in the summer? These motors, I discovered, don't burn out, they seize on the shaft due to lack of oil, the overload protector overheats, then it turns itself off. But alas, these motors can be fixed. Here's how:

UPDATE 10/24/16:  Switch died 15 minutes into broadcasting wheat on the first of 10 food plots on recent work weekend at the camp.  Ohmed out the part and it is the El Cheapo inline switch.  Fortunately I had a spare power cord I was able to use that saved the weekend for our crew, since I was one of only two 4-wheelers and the only one designated to spread seed.  Called Buyers and the first thing I was told that since I didn't buy it directly from Amazon they would not support direct parts replacement and I had to take the part to one of their distributors an hour away to get it replaced.  WRONG ANSWER...long story short Kristin with Buyers did agree to ship another part direct (3002232) so at least I may be able to use the thing again this weekend...THANKS KRISTIN, I appreciate you...good move on the customer satisfaction side...bad initial decision not to directly support Amazon customers since I'll bet Amazon would be happy to discontinue listing your product altogether and sell just Moultrie spreaders...reviews suggest you need to look into QA on the power switch too...

8719	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is my second gun boot IV. Use both on my Ranger. Quality is good. I installed soft cases inside the boots along with the liners to ensure a snug rattle free fit. I have not tried the transport model that has a soft case but I like my setup. I treat my guns/scopes like fine china and I am comfortable using these to hold my guns.
I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough. Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.

If you are going to stick with your Lomanco motors, buy six motors and store them near your attic fan.  You change them out just about as frequently as the oil in your lawn tractor.
1203	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm using this for a 50/50 ATF and Acetone mix, and it seems to be holding up. The hose is fairly flexible. It will siphon the contents of the can if the tip is left bend down too low. All that said, it's been great.
Draining this is stupid too.. MOST oil pans are TAPERED so that when you drain it the oil goes down a little channel so MOST if not all of the oil is gone... not this.  It's just a hole that is in the side (topped with a screw cap that does NOT stay tight and also leaks)  So you are forced to move the entire container around to get that extra half cup of oil OUT of the pan and then what happens is you get dripps and leaks from the top center larger portion of the lid...
8495	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works extremely well if you warm up your engine and make sure the hose is all the way in the reservoir for thorough drainage.
7788	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is very absorbant, though you wouldn't think so from the texture!  Good price at Amazon.  Not sure what else there is to say.

6491	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I attempted to use this to repair a transducer mounting screw hole in fiberglass boat transom. The 5200 sealant is very thin it would not stay in the holes and just ran out of the small screw  hole in the transom. It will not work on a vertical surface. It is too thin and  will just run out. A complete waste of my time and money. I have to clean up the mess now and start over.
Update - after a couple years of regular use the hose failed at the point where it connects to the pump.  It is a very flimsy hose,  the weak point with this pump.  You can replace the hose although Custom Accessories (the manufacturer/seller) doesn't offer one.  So I am purchasing this hand pump again.

4414	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Blew up after charging a brand new motorcycle battery. Used once then returned. Probably got a lemon.
moves an incredible amount of air for such a low draw on a battery - if you are using it for just yourself it really helps on the 90+ day heat with high humidity in the south.

Yes, I would recommend this California Duster to anyone. I would also buy it again if I needed too!

7846	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After using chamois, microfiber cloths and everything in between, I bought the absorber.  It really works.  It is almost like a magnet that draws water to it.  I use it to dry our cars after washing and now would not use anything else.

8) This inverter has a true 120v output on the hot leg, with 0v on the neutral leg.  It can tolerate having ground and neutral tied together, as a typical household panel would.  Rare for a MSW inverter, but this one works fine in that configuration.  The attached O-scope image is between ground and hot.  Ground to neutral shows no voltage.
7354	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent supplier. Just as promised and timely. Thank you, kindly.
1918	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Every car owner should have one. When I purchased my new Audi - I drove straight to my local Walmart buy one....and it was SOLD OUT! For $10.86/ea they are always on back order. Save water and money...use this brush. After owning 5 BMWs numerous Porsches, and now my new Audi allroad Sport Crossover - this "mop" conceals the fact I am a cheapskate who is meticulous about clean rides.
The other reviews are correct.  This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.  Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.  After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.
Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.

I would wet one, wring it out, then put it on top of a wicking tshirt (which would wet as well), and then zip on a mesh textile jacket over it. As I rode the evaporation would dry the towel and the tshirt, and would cool me off. My only negative is that I have had little success cleaning these once they get dirty/stained; I just buy new ones every couple of years.

643	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Can't comment much on these since they have not yet been used (I will come back and update my review is I find any issues after first use) ... but they are built solid, nice tough big hard clamps and love having a long cable so I never have to move cars around or anything if needed. I bought these to have in my new truck since you always need cables ... but another reason is for when I tow my travel trailer and we run the batteries with no shore power they may die after a couple days ... if you are in need a quick small recharge they are the perfect length to pop my hood, run the cables to the back of the truck and hook up to the batteries that are on the tongue of my travel trailer ... running the truck for 30-45 minutes with this nice large gauge wire connected from my battery tot he trailer battery will give me a bit of a charge if ever in a pinch and I have no shore power, solar, or generator to recharge.

Then bought the original from Amazon and a world of difference. Do not settle for a cheap
UPDATE 3/15/2017- Thought I lost the pen, but found it in my car's trunk. The Fisher refill is DEFINITELY the way to go. The original ink cartridge failed a few times too many. The Fisher always works 100%
5309	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is very absorbant, though you wouldn't think so from the texture!  Good price at Amazon.  Not sure what else there is to say.
So now I not only wasted several days waiting for delivery, but I wasted my time and effort trying to install the product.  I wasted more time talking to the manufacturer who simply said it wouldn't work, but didn't want to do anything to correct the problem.  Now I have to waste more time repacking and dropping off at UPS.
1925	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?

2847	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product for diesel fuel. Excellent service.
The last thing you want to make sure you have is a sturdy platform to install these on.  Any type of car/marine battery should not rest on a cement basement floor.  At the very minimum, you want to put a piece of plywood on the floor and rest it on that.  If you are putting this on a table of shelf, keep in mind that a marine battery is pretty heavy.  This invertor/charger isn't lightweight either.  I would estimate that it weighs somewhere around 20-25 lbs by itself, so make sure you have something that can hold 50+ lbs safely.

5630	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Item works fine. Brake light turns brighter than tail light as it should. No unwanted blinking when my turn signal is on as I've seen in some other products. Why not 5 stars? For me there are two things that add up to one star because manufacturer could have included these fixes. First, the square insert module is slightly smaller that the interior of the hitch so it's a bit loose. This is good to insure a fit for small hitch differences that might occur from vehicle to vehicle. My remedy was adding duct tape little by little around the module until a snug fit was achieved. I feel that virtually everyone will need to adjust the fit to be snug. Manufacturer should have included a method for making the unit fit snugly for all purchasers. Perhaps a small role of cheap tape or whatever for a self-contained installation experience. Second, half the length of the wires from the unit to the electric socket are rainbow colored, other half is a black sheath. Those bright very visible wires appearing with the light square ruined the unfettered blacked-out appearance near the unit itself. I had to wrap the wires with black electrical tape for the desired invisible presentation. I think manufacturing with black wires or at least a black auxiliary wrap (in case those rainbow colors are simply technically necessary) should be included. Just sayin' Looks great, fits snug!
5297	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The water right off anything you use it on.  If the oceans ever start to rise from global warming we can just throw a few of these in there and we'll be good to go.  Gets very hard if you don't keep it in the container between uses.

346	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was hoping this manual would have more detailed information for repair work but it's more of an overview of everything in the car. It's still a good resource to have on hand.
2047	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've used the larger version for dusting my pickup truck and it lasted for years and years, so I decided to buy this smaller one for use on my motorcycle.  But.............I would suggest you don't use it immediately on your motorcycle as they use some kind of wax, or waxy ingredient to treat these dusters and if you use it straight out of its plastic bag it will leave streak marks on your paint.  I will use a new one first to dust items in my shop or the house, get it slightly dirty and dusty.  This keeps the duster from streaking on your bike.  I think the dirtier these things get the better job they do.  I usually just take mine outside after each use and shake the crap out of it then stick it back into its plastic bag.  I think it works great for that quick dust off prior to hitting the road and in between washes.
3725	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was riding along in my new boat, with my new fish finder, at dusk, when I was suddenly surrounded by a cloud of little white insects.  They were insanely attracted to my backlit fish finder, and crowded around the screen so much that I literally could not see the screen itself at all.  In a flash of genius, I sprayed the fish finder with bug repellent.
5251	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased my "Absorber" in 1998, and have used it several hundreds of times over the 15 years or so. I've also washed it about a dozen times in the washing machine with washing detergent, but definitely wouldn't think putting it in a dryer is a very good idea. Mostly because, you want it to stay moist/wet, always. Works as good as when I first purchased it, and the condition of the skin has not changed. Remarkable material. Mimicks a real chamois in feel and absorbency. Can't imagine another product of this type being better.
2. If your car is freshly waxed and water is beading on it, before you dry your car with the Absorber, use your hand/arm like a squeegee to quickly swipe excess water off the topsides of your car.
If you have a boat, this is the only marine adhesive sealant to use.
4260	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is going to be a major aggravation saver for one of my vehicles... It tends to sit for a month or so between uses which tends to leave it unable to start. It's quite annoying when I need the thing and wind up having to dig up the jumpers just to get it started.

1999	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good product.
7785	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp.

4975	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great, and it was much bigger than I expected.  Amazon shipped fast as always and I enjoy the spotless shine on my car now.  Would advise that this needs to be stored slightly wet and always re wet and ring it before each use.  Great product!

The only reason I've not given this product a 5-star is because of the 'pods' that house the wheels.  There have been a few times when I've been working in a very tight space with my arms up around shoulder height and the pods have been in the way.  This meant I had to contort around them, which is quite uncomfortable.  The next day I've had bruises on my shoulders because of being pressed against the pods for an hour.
I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia.

8978	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I can't really give this 5 stars, mostly because I can't say for sure if it works. It is super heavy duty, and probably just having it in my car would deter a thief. But short of having someone actually trying to steal my car I can't say with certainty.

261	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Haynes manuals are always a good choice for car enthusiasts and the DIY crowd.  For this particular edition I wish Haynes would stop combining the CRV and the civic into one book. It is highly unlikely to provide any savings to a customer and it lends itself to less helpful generic work description and potential confusion.  I also use the Chilton guide and find them often comparable or more detailed.

The anti-radiation claim is obviously based on simply moving the phone away from one's head.  The wood stand does not appear to have any electromagnetic or electrostatic shielding of any type, and if it did would likely affect the phone operation in a negative way anyway.

2613	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to hold my Star Wars X-wing helmet for professional cosplay conventions.  The bag is big enough to hold it (the ram's horn on the X-wing helmet makes it larger than most motorcycle helmets) and the inside padding should protect the paint and plastic from pressure dings.
2620	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this bag! It first perfectly in my backpack and when I get to work I just pull it out and put my helmet in it and it zips up no problem. I used to hate walking around with my helmet out at work getting questions about my bike and looks and stuff. This is a great discrete way to keep my helmet with me safe and sound.
2191	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Bought this as a back up fridge while camping and to keep stuff cool in the truck while travelling. It worked fine for 5 months then died on us: just didn't work anymore.

It takes over night to fully charge it and he puts it on early in the morning and plays with it on and off most of the day. He has a lot of fun playing with the 4 wheeler. Then he puts it on the charger for the next day. I'm sure if he rode it constantly, it would run down quicker, but I could buy another battery in that case. The price is good. I recommend buying it if you need it.

1934	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	. I had one of the original California duster's and it was awesome. Sadly in was lost in a house move. I decided to get a new one  and am so far disappointed.

7684	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Work excellent.
129	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	When purchasing a "manual" for anything the first thing that you expect is a explode drawing of parts and where the belong. I originally purchased this manual to see how to remove the fascia and chrome for a Road King so that I can fix the steering dampener grommets. The book does not even mention it. Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get. I purchased a Harley frame manual and a service manual and spent almost the same amount for two used books. So far I am not impressed with Haynes manuals and would not suggest purchasing one unless you can see it first.
301	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good general reference.

4548	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	So longevity is good on this unit as I've been using it on and off for a year plus now. It's small, charges up a car battery just fine (even from completely dead). The only thing I decided I didn't care for after the fact were the circular attachments. Originally I thought I'd just mount this somewhat permanently to a vehicle I had sitting mostly, so tried mounting these with the main battery lugs. They were a bit too large in circumference to do that, unless you just lock down one part of the disk. However, I'm sure you could rig something to work like this using a washer or something. Anyway, I ultimately did not end up using it that way, instead using it as needed, grabbing it off the shelf, looking to hook it up to a battery right quick. Well, how do you do that? In this instance, I'd prefer larger alligator clips to ease and speed of hook-up. Keep that in mind when purchasing this item.
862	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great
237	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	As with most of these manuals they cover several models so everything you want for a particular model may not be there but still a lot of good pics and helpful info. I would recommend to have on hand.
I will note: I have tried to use them to "chock" the tiny wheel that goes underneath the tongue of the camper... and there isn't enough "lip" at the tip of the angle to get under the wheel. You really need a very small wood block chock for the front wheel of the camper. However for the main tires along with 4 crank down jack stands it makes for a very solid camper once it is all set up.

Everything fit together great, i used the old screws on the bottom of the whole basket+extension, and the new ones that came with the extension on the sides where the screw the sections together for a cleaner visual look...as you cannot see the old screws on the bottom at all. Good idea.
8145	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The ratchet adjustment is a little cheap and difficult to get a tight fit.
4376	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This product is compact and nice, just make sure you check out where you are going to put it on your machine.
7919	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Got this to secure my trailer to bumper.  It works but the 3.5" length is too much.  Master Lock used to make a version that was could be slid on the barbell at different lengths.  This one doesn't and because of this a lot of the shaft is showing which would make it easier for someone to cut.  Quality is decent enough and it does work for what I need which is to keep honest folks honest.  If that's what your after this will work for you for a good price.

First, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3" to now a bit over 3.25". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).

I have never found a good substitute to the real chamois.  See the before and after pictures, and that's because my vehicle was not even that wet.

4780	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Recommended to me by a friend, I love it! Just like he told me, it is a little strange to use at first when it's new. After a few uses it seems to have gotten easier to dry with. Stop using microfiber towels to dry post car wash, this thing is amazing
8320	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Looked all around town for something like this, but couldn't find what I was looking for.  Wanted a mirror to watch my downrigger and fishing gear while I drove the boat.  this is perfect - bigger than I expected, but that's even better.  Since I'll be using it while going slow, I'm not too concerned with the suction cup letting go.  Would recommend.
6824	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It works, I used a buffing wheel to apply and removed by hand. Very hard work non the less.
The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.
a 6 month old Jeep Wrangler and I had just cleaned it, and there was very minimal dust. From what I can tell, no dust was removed, just 10,000 pieces of red fiber were scattered all over this Jeep. What a disappointment to say the least.
388	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Loved it! First time I have had a rain suit for the Shovel Head. Rained for 400 miles and the only parts that got wet were my face, hands and boots. There was no rain blown up my sleeves or down the neck. Several commented on how well they could see me.

9046	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	While not cheap in price, I can blow dry my bikes much quicker than with a towel much more efficently.
When it gets too dirty, all you have to do is throw it in the washing machine and all the dirt gets cleaned off. Remembering to store it wet and in its' tube goes a long way toward having it ready to use.
8761	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Must be made by a new manufacturer now. Bought one before and it lasted awhile. This one scratched the heck out of itself the first time visor lifted. Like someone else said, if you look at it wrong it scratches. Quality control in the garbage.
A word of advice, start spraying that crank nut with a good penetrant everyday for at least 3 days before you plan to do the job, it will make a big difference in the amount of torque required to remove it.

For the people surprised at the initial streaking left on the car - the directions specifically state that you need to set it on newspaper for a couple days to let the paper absorb the residue. (To the best of my recollection, it's been 10 years since we last read the directions.)
6806	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's what all the cool kids use and the rebels that have been around the block.  If you want to save a few bucks only to find your $50,000 boat at the bottom of a lake that's your choice.  But just put down the cheap sealant, grab the 5200 and no one will get hurt.
It's a must, to keep your shop clean of those fine dust particles
As a side note I also installed one of these in my wife's Korean Spec Hyundai Samtamo (built under licence Mitsubishi Expo. It was also easy to install and I had it in and working in about 4 hours also. I found after installing both of them that by doubling the length of wire supplied on the antenna the range of the remote starter in increased substantively.

Tonight, I gave the filter it's first cleaning. The inside of the filter looked as clean as new. However, the outside of the filter was a disaster. I used the K&N cleaning kit. After the first cleaner process, and running water through the filter (I did it in the shower), 5 minutes of running water later, and it was still a solid brown river going down the drain. And there were several dozen huge insects (bees and other things) in there, too. But the inside of the filter was clean, and the car's been running fine through all this. A winner in my book.
3973	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice all purpose funnel for th price.  The length and girth of the tube makes it ideal for most ATF jobs.  It fits nicely in the filler tube of most vehicles I have encountered so far.

5065	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a great absorbent product. We use it in our showers and on spills around the house. It absorbs just about everything we have thrown at it and more from others that have used it. It is simple and easy to use just keep it slightly damp and it is ready to go again. Even if it dries out just get it wet and it is back to normal. Do not throw away the sleeve it comes in, you will need it as it is the best way of keeping the cloth moist while storing it.

9394	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Necessary tool for removing that stubborn main crankshaft bolt in order to service the timing belt and water pump. That sucker was torqued on so hard that I didn't think this tool would work, but knowing the direction of engine rotation of my Honda Pilot and resting this tool firmly against the subframe of the car with the appropriate socket/extension (and standing clear of the wheel well!), I clicked over the engine momentarily to the sound of a loud bang (the release of the bolt's tension). This broke the bolt free on the crank and then the rest of the repair went easily. The tool is so sturdy it showed no signs of going through such a traumatic event, and no injury to my hands. Note that I tried the pry bar method but the engine kept turning, so this was my solution. I think this is a great product.
5937	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does what it says. 07 Camry headlights are nice and clean. But with any headlight cleaning product once you use it you have to keep using it.

9186	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this unit because I visit friends in the mountains in California and Oregon. It was installed to reduce or prevent an encounter with a Deer hitting my 2014 Fiat 500 L. The install is very simple but I did notice when the unit is on you can hear it so you need to wire it to a switch because driving with it on would get unnessary attention. I hope it prevents an accident with a Deer.

6780	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Does great at drying, but I follow every direction on the bottle and it smells like mildew every time I go to use it, no matter how many times I hand wash it. I've used similar products in the past & it did not stink.
8131	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Easy to use and serves the purpose.  I have an F250 and these just barely fit across the bed.  There is some flex to them because I'm asking them to cover a fairly wide expanse so I don't expect them to hold any kind of weight in place.  When I move heavier items, I take these out which is very easy to do.  They work well at holding in bags/containers/plants, etc.  I bought 2 and am pleased with my purchase.

The product worked as advertised but I wish it was packaged a little better. The two batteries I've ordered were shipped in a box with few pieces of news papers; nothing else for protection. Batteries were scratched (fortunately the plastic case did not crack) but work fine.  To me, this showed the merchants lack of care/attention to detail, and does not deserve a 5-star.

6585	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Takes FOREVER to cure, it's been on for about a week now and is still tacky.
If you are shopping for this tool, you are probably also shopping for timing belts... this is where you need to be careful. Make sure you are getting the belt with the correct number of teeth for your car's make, model, and trim level. Amazon is often wrong about what is compatible with your car until people correct them. They sent me a belt with 112 teeth for my 1994 Accord DX, but that one is only good for the EX trim level. My car needed the one with 113 teeth.
6057	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very strong and durable, tougher to sand than regular filler but that's because it's reinforced. Overall happy!
With this duster, you can keep those surfaces clean without the
6726	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	By hand or power buffer this stuff works great.  The cleaner removes dull oxidation quickly, the polish brightens it to a mirror shine and the wax seems to hold up well after a few months. It's not cheap but when you put this kind of effort into a job there is no point using anything but the best materials.  For me this is it.
3766	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This is not what I expected from Master lock. It is a cheap, thin, piece of junk. Could be easily broke off with a screw driver. If you want something that is good security, buy something different.
2189	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been running this cooler for two years.  I am a general contractor and this sits in my back seat floorboard year around.  It is still running strong, still cooling as good as it ever has.  The only complaint I have are with the lid, it doesn't seal very good and the tabs on the side (plastic numbs used for hinges) aren't strong enough.  After only a couple of months they wore out and now everytime I open the lid it tries to fall off..... no big deal though, I've gotten used to it and now I know how to open the lid so it doesn't fall off (plus it's easy to get back on if it does).
I'll wait until I see how it does for it's intended purpose. The unit is compact and well sealed, perfect for a marine environment. If it performs as I expect, I'll give it 5 stars.
120	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The Haynes manuals are good for the DIY'er who enjoys servicing their own vehicles. These manuals will cover about 90% of most peoples needs. If you are a serious at home mechanic or own a repair shop, these will not meet your needs. For that you will need to step up and pay the price ($100.00 to $300.00) for a Factory Service Manual
6984	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I tried all of these products this weekend, and was really impressed.  I started with the oxidation remover on my canoe, and my old car.  The buffing pads were looking pretty dark when I was done, and I could immediately notice a deeper shine on both things, but particularly my car.  It seems pretty mild, as it didn't buff out a couple of small scratches in the car, but it did remove some tar and bugs. I moved onto the wax, it went on easily, and was easy to buff by hand.  I didn't notice that the cloths left any scratches, they seem perfectly smooth and lint free.  I then went on the to polish for just the canoe, it went on like the wax, and again didn't leave any small scratches or residue.  Both the car and the canoe haven't looked so good in years.

Well, it worked like a champ helping to suck out approx 13 gallons of gas/diesel mix. Yes it was slow, but the hose is very small and the suction is from hand pumping so it works as fast as it can. I even used the lines on the bottle to estimate how much I removed.--When I used it later to change my oil, it worked great there too. Don't over pump, but I did have to pump more frequently after a few minutes to keep the flow. And I made sure the oil was warm before do this so it could flow easier. I've only used it once so far, but I think it will keep going. Easy instructions too.

I have referenced it a couple of times, and it helped out.  The instructions can be a bit short though, and they tend to lack some details.  Navigating the book can be really annoying.  Some instructions stop mid-way, and direct you to a different part of the book.  When looking for something specific, I have ended up flipping through the whole book looking for the directions.
If anyone has similar experiences, please post them...
8590	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this to change the oil on a Seadoo boat and Seadoo jetski. For a few years I had the small electric pumps that worked ok but you had to keep messing with it to keep it sucking. This one you just put it in the oil tube, pump and sit back. It does require a few more pumps over the time to remove all oil but it does a great job. Also the part the oil goes in makes for clean easy disposal. The electric ones don't have this so we used a bucket and the oil would splatter. Always heat up the motor you are removing the oil from first. Thins out the oil and makes it a lot easier. Second season using this with no issues. Works great.

The end caps and rubber pad feel a little cheap.
Update..  The fan does not bother my 12 v led tv.  The fan motor seems to be getting quieter with more usage.  I am running it off deep cycle batteries and solar panels now...when I first tried it l, it was powered by a battery charger which probably made the motor whine more than normal.

1) The fittings are tapered fittings and are really difficult to take off (the red spout fitting and the storage cap).
3898	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is my second purchase of this lock. The original was part of the pop-up I sold. It was perfect and worked solidly. This one looks exactly the same and I know will work flawlessly as well.

I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car.  Will try two for the car on wash number two.  Maybe that will make the job easier.

I'll open it to see what went wrong, but until then I could speculate that actually there might have been an obstruction in the pump's house that restricted the output of air, or the pump is so fragile, it cannot take the punishment of inflating tires.
This is NOT a cleaner wax, so make sure that the boat is washed,
5271	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you like Armor All type finishes this is 10 times better then any other like product. Its a more consistant finish in a sense you use less but it lasts and holds up. I use it on mats and RV roofs tough to keep looking new stuff. Dashboards looks like new now last coat a year ago still looks nice. Its not greasy but slick till it drys, like Armor all texure but you can almost polish it in a way once it drys to buff it up to a higher shine. Its a little pricy at 1st glance but your getting 16oz and it goes a long way.......I love it of course Meguiars WOULD COME OUT WITH THE BEST OF THE BEST !!!!!!!Buy it!!!!!!!!!

7673	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent chamois!  I have used many different kinds, in fact my last purchase from Amazon included this one as well as a fancy one with a waffle pattern design.  Let's just say that this outperformed that other one and I am confident in saying that this does just as good of a job as a leather one, without the process of breaking it in.  This is a great deal for the price.  Great for after washing your car or after a heavy rain.
9471	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This tool is something no Civic mechanic should be without. If you plan on replacing the timing belt...you probably will need this special tool and it was NOT too expensive like a Snap-On that charges you 10 times the actual VALUE of the tool just for the name...But if you will put it to use 1 or 2 times a year then do not waste hundreds of dollars for Snap-On...this heavy duty took will be just fine!
4326	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I bought 2 of these, one was dead out if the box and had to be replaced. It died again about 3 months later, the other lasted almost 2 years being used maybe once a month overnight to top off a gas golf cart battery. It died as well.

When it first arrived, you could see that he was super skeptical.  First he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  Then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).

9630	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The visor appeared to be great.
8175	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The bar becomes very floppy once you get it extended out enough to span a pickup bed. Also you have to choose between tightening it up so much it flexes the bed or just a little less where it's on the floor when you arrive. There are better choices out there and I found on at a Uhaul of all places. I wish I had taken a pic of the brand. It was far better designed.
8749	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This face shield has saved my mug from a few ballistic bugs already. I keep a supply of pre-moistened eyeglass lens wipes in my seat storage so that I can clean the face shield quickly without scratching it. The fact that it's not UV treated plastic means my transition eyeglasses turn into sunglasses immediately.  Now I don't have to worry about changing out my tinted version of this face shield when riding at night. It also fit perfectly onto my existing helmet. Only complaint and it'a a small one...the rattle it sometimes makes even though it's snapped down into place. I'd recommend this shield to anyone riding a motorcycle or scooter. It could mean a world of difference if that bug hits you square in the eye.
It doesn't stick down (non-adhesive), it just lays in there but that is enough to do the job. It's like the non-slip stuff you put under throw rugs.

2124	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have to say. HANDS DOWN. This is the best cargo net I have ever seen for a Motorcycle.  I have had this net since I was 18 with my first bike.  It was so old that I cannot even recall where it came from, I assume my dad must have purchased it for his own needs and I just took it for life.  I purchased other cargo nets from bike stores and ended up returning them due to the poor construction of their clips.  You could just feel that they were going to brake within months of actual use.  So one day I decided to research my perfect net and .... here i am buying an extra one in case something happens to mine.  The net is seemingly indestructible and that's just how I like it.  Hope this helps you make a choice.

927	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	They're serious when they say cables; this set consists of two separate jumper cables, one black and one red. This set seems entirely adequate for my occasional car; the cables roll into a small bundle, the clamps seem OK and the price is right. I have a better set of cables (longer, heavy gauge, better clamps) in my daily driver as I seem to find a use for them several times a year (Coleman Cable 08760 20-Feet Heavy-Duty Auto Battery Booster Cables with Parrot Jaw Clamps, 4-Gauge).

But this one is very easy to use and fast.
Overall, this is a great product and I will continue to buy them til they are no longer in production.
By regular application of wax or polymer sealants you can minimize these, but again- ANYTHING touching the paint will cause these.  (by 'anything', I mean fibers with dust particles, freshly laundered towels with miniscule hard water deposts in the thread....etc)

I bought this fan with a specific objective in mind: MEXICO. When the power goes off, this guy goes online along with a couple of LED lights for the bedroom. My new BiPAP, this fan, and the lights are going to transform hours spent in lightless moist heat into hopefully a night of rest, reading, and comfort.

2139	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this to polish stainless steel (a hard metal) rails on an old boat. It easily removed old stains and even any oxidation. For the price and ease of use, this is a sure bet. Way more convenient than polishing by hand and much more effective.

I would recommend periodically checking your vehicle during that time to make sure the suction is still going. One of the issues I've had with it before was the suction tube forming a seal on the bottom of the oil pan.

9016	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	The gloves were too small.  Quite stiff and were not near as warm as suggested.
5010	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very convenient to buy at amazon. Fram makes a great product - for an old car.
5290	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I had the original ABSORBER (several in fact over the years). My most recent finally wore out. The orignal versions performed very well. BUT the "NEW" version....NOT!!!! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor "new" Absorber being sold now. It performs no were near as good as the original. What a big step down in quality. Hard, Barely absorbant, Discolors easy, Tears easy...... look elsewhere......I am not sure where???, but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth (by the way, a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic)... sorry for being wordy.
In terms of power, Murphy's Law has kicked in since buying this as we haven't had a single power outage, so I cannot comment on how well it lasts without any power, but I did test the system by unplugging it from the wall and waiting for the sump to cycle and it worked properly.  There is a moderately loud fan that kicks on when the inverter/charger is charging the battery, but when its charged, it is completely quiet.

If you have an impact gun you should just use that, much easier and the bolt tends to break free very abruptly when using breaker bars.  If your bolt is REALLY stuck and you just can't get it off, take the car to the dealer and have them break the bolt free and put it back on, the cost will be $50ish or free depending on how generous the dealer is feeling and it will come off very easily afterwards.
9719	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great filter, since install i get better fuel response, truck runs less restricted
5233	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Did not help, still have to submerge the trailer until the boat float's off the trailer.
Tip.... For cleaning deep dirt on caulking I care-full use lac-quire thinner on a small clean rag just folded to touch the caulking only. The thinner will melt the top layer of caulk every so slightly and remove the dirt instantly. Let it dry and then follow over the area with the wax, the wax will remove the film left behind and leave you trailer caulk look like new again. This item: Meguiar's 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Cutting Pad by Meguiar's $10.29 effect the fiberglass Wont work if caulk is silicone. Try on small area out of site 1st to see results on your unit.
1273	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I did not purchase this rivet tool from Amazon.  I purchased this from Home Depot about two years ago, but I have not popped that many rivets with it.  I bought it for a specific job and that job required a total of 40 rivets, and I've only used it for that job.  I had to do some rework on the parts that came back, so when it was time to button up the chassis, I pulled out this rivet tool to fasten a total of 12 rivets.  I for 10 done and the thread on the nose stripped.  I had to buy another rivet tool to finish the job.
So until my key gets stuck, my car gets stolen....I will give it a 5 because I like it.

5030	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best product to get your glass perfectly clean with no cloth residue let like microfiber etc.

358	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Haynes manuals are always pretty good.  Yeah, there are a few things missing, and sometimes the descriptions/pictures area  little vague.  But I generally don't start a project on any of my cars without one of these manuals on hand.  Lots of videos online nowadays, but it's good to cross reference those against a good source like this before starting on anything complicated.
9653	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's almost perfect.  I don't like the CD holder type visor organizers so this one is very practical for me.  It has lots of compartments but I wish the clear pocket was wider to fit a 5"x7" picture or my car registration.
4703	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I don't see where this does anything of value!  Please water cleans just as well.  It might protect -- I don't know, but it certainly does not clean!

1785	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have only used it once so far but it seems to work just fine.
8252	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I read other reviews about the problems with the suction cup, so decided to purchase the I.Trek strong suction cup with extension option.
5645	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked great. I put one side on the truck side and the other on the trailer. It fit well over the whole connector so I shouldn't have to worry about loosing them (like the old one).
4397	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this on my 7.3 to keep the cranking battery charged up. Mounts nice and clean, does a great job, very pleased. A must have when you don't drive the truck much and want to maintain the batteries.
6230	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Light weight and works great
3902	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great tool for the price.
One additional feature I didn't know it had until it arrived was two tabs on the top of the unit so you can hang it from an RV window.  The tabs swivel too so you can face the fan blowing inward or outward.  This was a great surprise because I wasn't sure how I'd keep it right in front of the window to circulate the air.  I would definitely purchase again.
6270	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What can I say, they are a plastic wheel chock. They are lightweight and work. They are ok for a light weight camper but I will continue to use my steel ones for my heavier camper.
4777	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Still the best car wash tool I've ever used.  If my car isn't too dirty I just wet it and use this to wipe down, then I take this to the shower and power wash it out.  Easy and quick.  Works great on glass!


I can't imagine anyone not giving this product a perfect rating.

1793	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is what I have been looking for. Makes life easier
692	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Direct replacement working good so far.  The first one lasted about 7 years for me.  This was without maintaining it.  From what I've read, it is a good idea to give it 3 drops of oil at the end of every cooling season.  When installing, make sure the oiling slot is pointing upwards.
5791	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works awesome. But is expensive. Also wear some form of respirator/paint mask when using this stuff. It is super strong and breathing the files in can't be good. But it works like a charm. No more yellow staining on my white boat hull.

9996	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	love the way that this is made and has a removable weight in the bottom of it.
I also did my headlights on my truck because they were cloudy , I polished them and they also came out looking new.
Well, that didn't work at all, and now I had 2 problems.  It turns out DEET etches plastic fairly well.  The next day, the screen was, for all intents and purposes, completely unreadable in daylight, and only moderately readable at night.
I didn't have high hopes the PlastX would work since an entire kit (cheap store brand) with sanders and polishing wheels didn't work before. I knew the haze was on the outside of the lens because when I wet my finger and rubbed the lens it would clear up for a second but then haze over again quickly. I put some PlastX on a soft pad and began to rub the lens. Wow would be an understatement. I immediately saw yellow coming off onto the pad (didnt even look yellow on the lens, just looked hazy) and after just a minute or two of rubbing it in and wiping it off like car wax, the lens looked new again. Not just clean, it actually looked like a brand new $350 headlamp lens, and it didn't look like plastic anymore, it looked like glass.


7871	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Well I thought it is marine grade. Apparently it is not. Should be ok for fresh water.
5730	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great Value. These aren't easy to find. If you're looking for Tail AND brake in a hitch light, this is the one. The only reason i replace these is during the winter when I back in to an ice pile. Bully makes a great product

4595	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Purchased my 3rd one for our vehicles. These are great units that are easy to install.  Nothing like keeping your battery charged and topped off.  Great for cold climates where you do not drive your car daily.

I can't wait to use them but I don't want to be the one broken down lol ;) Will update the review one day when I use them.
2556	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good product for those who know how to use it. Not for those who struggle trying to use self-serve gas station set-ups.
Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open.

460	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It looks awesome! Colors are bright and the bear is full of detail. Actually, the bear posted on this ad isn't even close to my vinyl decal, because the bear on my vinyl decal looks real lol with full vibrant colors and great detail! Looks sick on my Prius :)
8397	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Professionally and well-built, I would recommend and will buy another
6317	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Well, they are a little smaller than I expected and the plastic seems like it may not last long. I mean if someone steps on them the wrong way it might crack or something. But I'm probably being too picky because they work fine on our horse trailer and you can clearly tell they are plastic before buying them so it's not a surprise. Much lighter than the solid rubber ones and easier to carry around than logs :-).
* My only concern is that the suction power is not strong enough.  While vacuuming inside pockets on back of front seats, I had to grab a plastic piece by hand.  Also, while accessories are handy, it is still hard to get into some places, such as between front seats and middle consul.

1903	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you like to keep your car clean, this duster is a must.  Once a day over the car and you can forget about most car washes.  Only wash the car after it gets gritty.  This purchase was to replace a 20 year old duster.  Happy to say, it's still a well made as my original.

1794	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product!
5059	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought both this Chamois and a natural one. The Absorber synthetic blows the natural one away. I have two of these, one for our everyday cars and another for our cars with show quality paint. I am also going to pick up a third to use for wheels, door jams, areas that are more contaminated on the car and may have dirt, etc. even after washing.

945	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this item to replace another just like it that I thought was worn out...the tubing would slip through the vise part of the tool instead of getting a flare, the tool just pushed the tubing out. Well, the new one came, and while looking at the instructions, I noticed it could be adjusted. I adjusted the old one, and it's working great again. An excellent product which takes the trouble out of making a good flare. One tool does it all, no more 3 piece flare kit for me. I recommend this product for anyone who needs to make flares. I'm in the HVAC business, so mine gets lots of use. Now I have a new back up tool in case the old one breaks.

3329	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The most dangerous thing most of us do every day is get in our vehicles and get on the road.  With the technology of today, I find that there are more distracted drivers than ever.  If you've never experienced a rain-x windshield, you really need to.  It makes the windshield wipers almost unnecessary, it makes your side windows appear as though they have wipers too.  The rain and snow just slides off.
2129	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this all time as with a truck, everyone calls me to haul things.  Easy to use and does an excellent job at securing loads so they don't fly out of the bed of the truck.  Just get some bungee cords to go with it and your all set.  I wouldn't use this to secure a large heavy object though, for that you would need heavy duty straps.
In the end, this is a great product for use in specific situations.  You need to practice using it once or twice to make sure it will work in your car.
2479	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Well-made hardware. The non-locking side however should be a captive nut to a threaded shaft. This way, it can be tightened and not left jiggling around needlessly.

5042	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I don't like this for drying cars.  It seemed to smear the water rather than absorb it.  It always left streaks on my newly washed car.  After "drying" with this, I'd have to go back and get rid of the water spots.  I now use Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.  Sucks up the water for a streak-free shine.  The Water Magnet can even get rid of DRIED on water spots.  It's crazy.  I'll be using that from now
  I love the way they can be pushed down out of sight when not in use so it doesn't mess up those streaming lines of my truck (haha). bUt it is less obvious for pilchers that might want to swipe them. out of sight, out of mind. Have had no problems like that though.

4082	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Got a trailer from a buddy for cheap that is on its last leg but still works fine.  The bearings, tires, on it all were shot.  I ordered a complete set of tires with rims from Amazon and also this bearing set.

4790	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just what I expected. I have had this item for over a year now and it has never given me a problem. Works every time.
4324	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Kept the battery charged on my 4wd that was parked outside all winter.  The battery was fully charged when I needed it.  Took a little thought to mount but once you find a good spot close to a battery connection (the leads are a bit short) you are good to go.  Had to run a short extension cord to an easy place to connect too.
3985	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This I use to replace the transmission fluid on my Lincoln Town car.  The tube is quite narrow and way back at the firewall.  The long skinny tip of this funnel reaches all the way back there and fits well, preventing a real mess.  Can't beat the price either.
I got the purple one as an add on for $7.50. I guess nobody wanted purple. I don't care though.
Each option has it's pros and cons.  A battery backup pump requires more up front installation, but costs less.  The con is that you are stuck with a proprietary battery backup system.  When the battery dies, you are tied to a single model.  If that model is discontinued or replacement batteries are hard to find, you might have to replace the whole system each time the battery goes out.  An inverter/charger plus car battery like this is a lot more expensive up front, but the installation is simple, and when the battery needs to be replaced, you can go to any auto parts store and pick up a new battery.
4776	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I worked in detail for many years and have used everything possible. This Absorber bears everything hands down. I still have a red one that I had purchased about 16 years ago. Not a tear, not a hole, no mold smell, nothing. I don't know how they do it. I still use that same one today. Can't tell you enough how great this thing is for drying off cars. Amazing!

2650	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I used this machine to take off  20 x 8 x 8 2 ply tires from their rims. The big issue was putting the 20 x 10 x 8  FOUR ply tires on . Taking the tires off the rims was easy. Putting the new ones on was a whole different story. . The bottom beads of the 4 ply tires was easy.  The problem was getting the top bead on the rim. I bent the threaded rod and several times I  bent the bead seater tool with the ball on the end of it. My first attempt to put a 4 ply on failed after about 90 minutes effort. Second attempt another hour failure. Third time was a charm using my forearm to hold the tire down and pulling like my life depended on it to get the top bead on the rim...lol...successful!  That was the first tire. The second time taking the 2 ply off and putting 4 ply on took about 20 minutes. The device is flimsy but I don't know if it was designed to mount 4 ply tires. it seem to work great at taking the 2 plys off.  I don't like the machine but I guarantee I'll use it again instead of throwing it away. I didn't injure any body parts during this fight with the tires !

5648	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Protects your trailer plug from water when not towing.
I used a small foam pad from a car wax kit for application and a small, slightly damp terry cloth hand towel.  I used the towel to promptly wipe off any cleaner that got on the paint, and after rubbing generous amounts of cleaner on each lens cover for five minutes, I wiped the cover dry with the towel while the cleaner was still wet, as directed on the bottle.  It can't get easier than this!  Of course, the result can only improve if you want to spend more time scrubbing, or, if you want perfection, spend the money and even more time on those other kits.
344	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Handy to have for that extra info you need for simple repairs.
1707	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like the handle and construction, I haven't had to wash it yet, does the job of getting dust off
9458	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	used this product to hold the crank shaft on my sons Honda prelude. It worked very well and we had no problems with it.
7689	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good
update: gauge is 10 psi out of calibration even my Harbor Freight was within 2 psi, leaks from the chuck stem where connects to hose from the day I got it. Wish I bought the copy of this that my friend has which is cheaper and apparently made better.
On a side note, it might be a good idea to save your original filter to drop in while you have your K&N pulled out for cleaning and oiling.
5668	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Works well. Looks nice but, the connecting wire is too short and I had to buy an extension. Also, the adapter is too long and extends out way past the hitch. The gasket that comes with it doesn't do anything because product sticks out too far.

5323	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Pros:
I took the codes back to my laptop and did a little more research using the forums that come up when you Google around.  Two codes indicated I had two malfunctioning oxygen sensors and given that my truck as almost 140K miles, it seemed logical.  I went to my local auto parts store and got a couple of downstream O2 sensors, btw I later found them to be about 20% cheaper on amazon.com, but while the problem got better when I replaced them, I still has a rough idle.  The other two codes made reference to a "lean mixture" condition and after doing more Google searches I found that I probably had a vacuum leak or a dirty MAF.  I turned out to be a broken vacuum hose that runs from the PVC valve to the top of the engine.  I replaced the hose and the car runs like new!  I erase the codes again and I have not sent the service engine soon light come on yet.
107	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Owned a Crown Victoria handed down from my grandfather.  I passed the car on to my cousin before really needing the manual.  4 stars gives the book the benefit of the doubt as I know many people who have other manuals like this for other cars.

5541	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Light is as advertised. It is a tail light and brake light. Cord could be a little longer. It is only about twelve inches long. I tried many of these type lights and to me this one worked best.

This thing is super absorbent and really finishes the frying process up really fast. You just fold it up and put it back in the nice container it comes with. We wash it every couple of months to keep it fresh.
