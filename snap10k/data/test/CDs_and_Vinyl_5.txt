Frank takes the time in this special to revisit songs that he had not doen in awhile. Among them are a rousing "The One I Love Belongs To Somebody Else", a lovly, somber rendition of "The Girl From Ipanema" with the masterful Tony Mottola on guitar), a swingin' "At Long Last Love" and a lovely reworking of "Thanks For The Memory". Count Basie stops by for wonderful versions of "Pennies From Heaven" and "The Best Is Yet To Come", and the version of "I Get A Kick Out Of You" really cooks.

I would recommend this album to any christian style rock fan as well as any modern rock fan period. This music is based off the 2000-2010 era of sound and this is that at it's finest. even if your a non christian or religious person period, you will enjoy this album as long as if you like newer type of rock music. this CD gets 5 stars by me because it is just a great hard rock album with peaceful lyrics. This album has 11 songs on it and if you listen to the whole thing it would take you about 41 minutes.

It's an awful lot to digest at once, or even in pieces, but of course if you love this band, four hours is not an inconvenience, it's a BONUS.  It's also a great insight for everyone interested in the recording process.  The second part of the disc covers the band on tour, which is a scenario covered in countless other rock documentaries.  But the first part, covering the recording of the "Black Album" offers some intriguing information into what a producer actually does, and the producer here is one of the most legendary in the business.  Bob Rock probably ranks only behind "Mutt" Lange and the late Bruce Fairbairn on the list of sucessful hard rock/metal producers.

Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years, he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album, which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy. Contains the #1 hit "Bump 'N Grind" and the urban radio favorites "Your Body's Callin'" and "It Seems Like You're Ready". There is also a brilliant remix of "Bump 'N Grind" on the single for that song, entitled the "Definition Of A Hotti Remix". This was played a lot on my local radio station, and for those of you who haven't heard it, I strongly recommend. It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion.
9229	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Aenima is a landmark album. This album is one of the highpoints of 90's rock. Building on the mostly metal sound of their first two releases, Tool with Aenima released something much more. Abounding musically in the metal-drenched progressive rock sound formerly forged by such bands as King Crimson and Fates Warning, but with their own unique, minimalist spin, this album is of an accomplished musicality that few bands in this era are capable of equalling. Lyrically, we get topics such as the philosophy/life of Bill Hicks (of whom the band were admirers), and a lot of "freedom of thought" and anti-organized religion sentiments. This is all good in my view. Here we have a band playing with fire. Also, Keenan is very good at expressing his angst, and this album proves it. The only bands who come close to Tool in the 90's at doing that are Pantera and Rage Against The Machine, but Keenan does it better. The truly venomous lyrics coupled with his whisper/scream vocals make for one hell of a punch. The music on the album is just as interesting, with notable, though sparse, guitar/bass riffs, creative drumming, and long instrumental passages and song interludes. I reccommend this album for anyone looking for something above the norm in modern music, or for anyone looking for something above the norm, period.

At the same time we have to remember that, as I said earlier, this album is just the roots of Tool, and greater things were (and hopefully are) still to come. The social commentary remains to this day in their music but looked at more from an angle of "what can I do to improve myself?" rather than just laying into corporate, religious America, which more than all my above rambling, just signifies that the band has matured over time.

5675	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Frankly, this one is for hard-core McCartney fans only.  I've been a total Beatle fanatic since their earth-shattering TV appearance in '64, but every historian or knowledgeable musician will tell you that the 'magic' music recipe they possessed was indescribable; so powerful that to this day the Beatles are THE example by which all others are measured.  But when they became solo artists everything changed.  They produced a few unforgettable songs and albums, but all told, they had become 'part of the crowd'.  One of the best examples of this was Wings At The Speed Of Sound.  If I didn't know this was McCartney I would have described it as "...fluffy drivel".  Considering that the best track is "Silly Love Songs", which is precisely what it is, tells the whole story.  Plodding through a painfully superficial album of 'product' music was hard enough, but after "Cook of the House" it was time to stop eating the candy and reach for some steak.  McCartney addicts consider anything he does a must-have, but for casual listeners there is far, far better elsewhere in the McCartney catalog.
The musicianship here is breathtaking, amazing!
Imagine a CD that combines one of America's greatest living singers with one of America's greatest living songwriters. The results, you would imagine, would be nothing short of brilliant! And, brilliant is the best way to describe the quintesential Jennifer Warnes Album, "FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT-The Songs Of Leonard Cohen". Rarely has there been a finer coupling of artists within the audio medium-Leonard Cohen's words and music seem to have been written specifically with Jennifer Warnes in mind, so perfect is the fit between writer and singer. The CD opens with a punch, with the biting powerhouse "First We Take Manhattan". From this plateau, we are soothed with the classic "Bird On A Wire", an oft-recorded tune from the 1970's, which is given new life and relevance in this interpretation. The title track, "Famous Blue Raincoat" is more confessional than pop song, executed in half-spoken, half-sung tones, and treated with the poetic reverence it so deserves. The two artists combine forces on the album's stand-out cut "Joan of Arc" and the result is nothing less than chilling. "Myself, I long for love and light/ But must it come so cruel/ Must it burn so bright" Cohen and Warnes sing in "Joan of Arc". This is as much the artistic interpretation of St. Joan's last thoughts as it is a treatise on the modern-day human condition. This magnificent combination of music and poetry not only enthralls with its beauty, but makes the listener think. Rounded out by such other works as "Song of Bernadette" and "A Singer Must Die", "FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT" starts out strong and gains momentum as it progresses. Aside from the fact that this recording is so technologically advanced that it set a new standard by which other CD's are now measured, this album is a rare and important work of two artists at the height of their powers. It is a gift from writer to singer, from singer to writer, and we, the listeners, are so much the richer.

I can listen to it all but my favorite songs are  "Stinkfist", "H." and "Aenema". When I first  got on Amazon and looked the band up, I noticed all of their CD's had a  perfect five stars, look up other "musicians" such as Kid Rock,  Limp Bizkit, the Backstreet Boys or anything on MTV, they don't have a  perfect score at all.

Santana combines moody feeling in every tune, and of course  the Number One smash hit Smooth is contagious! Get ready to rack up the  Grammy Awards this year, Carlos!  This CD is a keeper!
Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.

Tool are well-known for being atheists and not being afraid to tell people about it. What Maynard, the lead singer, often says is that Tool is not against any religion and in fact appreciates and accepts the core values of most religions; they just dislike the people who try to ruin it for everyone by becoming obsessed with religion. That is a pretty decent take for a religious person like myself to be able to listen to their albums; besides the music is damn good enough that sometimes it feels like the lyrics don't matter at all.

1768	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I've been waiting for this for a long time. The movie "Born to Boogie" which chronicles the rise of Marc Bolan to superstar status in the U.K. was never released in the US. Marc's success peaked around the time of the original 1972 movie directed by Ringo Starr, and this is a great value. Disc one contains the soundtrack of the movie with a superb earlier take of "Children of the Revolution" with Elton John on piano and Ringo playing drums. But disc two is truly the treasure featuring the full length Wembley concert (3/18/72)which has been lovingly remastered with surprisingly good sound throughout the set. The concert opens with a stunning version of "Cadillac" and concludes with a very electric version of "Summertime Blues". This is an excellent cd and helps clarify what "T.Rexstasy" was all about. Too bad that America just didn't get it. Now they can. As a T.Rex fanatic for 30 years, this is truly essential. Now, I need the DVD!!!

From that day forward, the experience seems to have "informed" his playing style. The fact that he subsequently became an artist in residence at the Cathedral (and is now the principal artist in residence) is testimony to the experience. And it has provided him with a performance and recording venue that is perfect for his horn and for the ensembles he chooses to perform there. Moreover, it is nigh impossible to separate the Cathedral from its vast acoustic space and its wonderful organ, and one might as well take advantage of these facts. Nobody does this better than Paul Winter.
8132	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Listen to the sound clips and you will see that this CD is more than just their one big hit song, "Winchester Cathedral".  Even though "A Kind of Hush" was contemporary hit, they place their 1920s stamp on it as well as the authentic period pieces and their original numbers.  They don't all sound the same but remained faithful to their concept through their history that is comprehensively collected here.  Their sense of humor is sly but affectionate for the genre.  I like to listen to this while I'm driving for a change of pace, great historical liner notes too.  No one else has tried to do this 1920s sound since, what would be the point?
I found the 9-piece segment to be my favorite with one song alone - "Pretending" - having two of the greatest solos ever by Clapton. If that song doesn't get your blood moving, nothing will. "Old Love" has some nice solo work, too,  by pianist Johnny Johnston, bassist Nathan East.. I've always enjoyed Eric's two female backup singers Katie Kisson and Tessa Niles and Kisson is really great with her solo at the end of "Wonderful Tonight."
Highly recommended.

I was in high school when the British invasion was in its prime, and these songs are part of the soundtrack of my youth. But as great as the SACD sound is, many of the tracks here are in mono. I know there were stereo versions of most of the mono tracks here, and for Abkco to deliver these tracks in mono, with no real explanation as to why, is a gross mistake. On those tracks presented here in stereo, the sound is phenomenal. I highly recommend "Sky Pilot" as perhaps the best sounding track here. I urge all labels, which actively reissue oldies on CD, to go to hybrid SACD for these albums, whether they spotlight a specific group, or compile hits from various artists.

9507	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	When it comes to Zappa, I am a dissenter. His early stuff has its place in rock history; "Hot Rats" is a minor landmark in jazz-rock fusion. After that, I find absolutely nothing to like about what he did. As satire, it's half-baked; as music, it's just a conglomeration of pop junk  (...)  that is supposed to make some kind of statement--what, exactly, pray tell, would that be? That pop music is dreck to be recycled in Zappa's lab? I don't believe I have ever needed Frank Zappa to tell me that most pop music is worthless; I knew that already. But pop music is worthless in a way that can sometimes approximate worth. Phil Spector's productions would be an example. Phil Spector believed in what he was doing; Frank Zappa did not. Zappa thought he was above popular music, a strange and lame attitude. The CD under review is often cited as one of his best efforts, merging "jazz-rock" "sophistication" with "humor." I am no geek in some comic-book shop, and I do not find "Going to Montana to find some dental floss" funny. This is sophomoric, arid music for disengaged pseuds. Zappa's libertarian "satire" is not a part of my world, and neither are his attempts at "serious" music--half-digested Varese and Stravinsky and Ives. Three minutes of Captain Beefheart is worth all of Zappa's catalog. Who was it who said that, for all Zappa knew about music, he lacked the talent to write a song as good as "Louie Louie"?

Creatively prolific and hungry to express - this is one of the definitive Bowie albums which burns an impression into your heart and reminds the world (or anyone exploring his legacy) what a wonderful artist he was, and how he didn't really give a hoot about anything except making music in a different way.  Pushing the envelope, and pushing the edge - Low works because it's fragmented and goes against convention.  Working with Brian Eno produced experimental yet fruitful results.

The night in question was in the fall of 1987, in the Coconut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.  This in itself makes the recording historic, for the hotel (most famous for being where Robert Kennedy was shot) closed soon afterwards and is now threatened with demolition.  It's an Art Deco masterpiece that has often been used in movies so you will have seen it many times without realizing it.  But back to the music...one reason it is so good is that such an amazing array of talent is willing to relegate themselves to being backing artists for the star they have come to honor.  Other reviewers have listed the stellar line up so I will just add that the great James Burton lends his guitar skills to the mix and does as much as anyone to make this an unforgettable performance.

This album was so, so different from the earlier ones.  It wasn't just Joe Walsh joining the group and adding his wild guitar playing and personna, either.  By 1976, the group was at the top of its game, and moving a little bit away from "country" rock (or "Crock" as some music critics called it back then).  You can still hear a little bit of the "country" flavor in "New Kid in Town" up until you reach the bridge part in it, and also the intro to the title track, as well as "Try and Love Again."  The rest of it is rock until you drop:)  What to make of the title track, by the way?  Some people say it was symbolic of the group members' trying to walk away from the partying, drugs, casual sex, and Satanic worship they'd dabbled in, and how even though you can stop those things, you still have the bitter memories and regrets for the rest of your life.  Others say it doesn't mean anything. . .Glenn Frey and Don Henley & Co. were just up to their usual great storytelling tricks.  It's still a fun song to listen to, as much for the great instrumentation as the story.  By the way, most people think it's Joe Walsh doing all that great guitar work that follows the last lyric, but it isn't.  It's really Don Felder, the blond-haired tall drink of water who said little and played much.  Joe's influence is heard on many of the other tracks here, such as "Victim of Love" and "Life in the Fast Lane."

The story starts off hinting at an illness as vomiting occurs, the family pet goes missing, and the children act unusually aggressive. The children become more and more aggressive until a brutal "accident" occurs, then hell breaks loose. The parents are delusional and refuse to believe the children are responsible. So, they are skeptical and refuse to defend themselves - kids will be kids, right? The parents are slowly, and violently picked off, and their corpses are usually further disfigured. However, it doesn't actually explain why the children snapped, aside from being an ambiguous illness. I really like the story of this film, it's like Children of the Corn on steroids.
It's a good vieo.
The album itself "Apocalyptic Love" is a rock fuelled funk filled adrenaline rush of old school rock and roll and it's clear from the outset that the album has one intention and that's to rock, it's an album full of great riffs such as the opening song the title track "Apocalyptic Love" with its funk driven riff that has Myles Kennedy using his full vocal range to drive the song on and features a great sing along chorus. "One Last Thrill" starts out with a scream in the background before Kennedy delivers the lyrics at 100 miles rate; it's a great piece of punk rock. It shows Kennedy has many different styles of vocals. It's also topped off by a trademark Slash solo. There's some great drumming and bass playing from Brent Fitz and Todd kerns on the song "Standing In The Sun", both Fitz and Kerns are part of slash's live band.

4661	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	The lamely deadened, 20-years-waiting comeback disc finds the once challenging, jazz-influenced rock elitists settling into a more modern lull. Steely Dan's signature lyrical humor and melodic grooves are overhauled and placed neatly into spaces that all too often feel corny and restrictive. The production is too shiny and only elaborates some horribly implemented musical ideas, particularly in the forced vocals. If the title track were a poor example of the album's feel, we would be in good shape. Sadly Two Against Nature remains one of the stiff disc's only mildly engaging (ie naturalistic) tracks amongst rare glimpses of songwriting talent. When they do strain for musically rewarding passages, it is apparent they have become bloated on their own questionable mythology, confusing the interchanging of a bunch of snazzy jazz chords with thought out transitioning..a veritable comatose caricature of what once was.

Not only do our two lads do vocals, they are also principle characters in some of the autobiographical songs such as `What Kind of Girl do you Think We Are?' The highlight of their performance comes when they do the Turtles best known hit, `Happy Together'.

There is humanity and more in " Two Against Nature". Always in search of obscure references, the disc begins with a song written as a skeleton of the old Charles Boyet film " Gaslight". " Gaslighting Abby" kicks things off with the quirky tunings we are used to, even some added sass. " What a Shame About Me" should become the official anthem for Yuppies everywhere who didn't quite fulfill their dreams. It's a great piece of music, but it's character is cloying. Perfect.

Even though there are some very good songs here (Do it for the kids, Sucker train blues, Slither, Loving the Alien, etc..), the album lacks charisma. Slash does not have a good guitar tone throughout the album. His playing is not unique anymore. It feels like he's trying to imitate exactly what he did during his years with Guns N' Roses. The riffs are not catchy enough and seem to be all over the place. Its a generic rock album. The only reason it has tasted success is because of all the star members. This album would be more on the unknown side if it wasn't for the ex members of GNR and a notorious drug addict lead singer. This is a "rock n roll" band that the music industry expects you to listen and buy. I recommend Silvertide over this.

1774	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	First aired in November of 1967, "Sinatra + Ella + Jobim" remains not only Sinatra's "finest hour" on television, but one of the great music specials of all time.
 That said, in the early 1960's there nevertheless was another form of musical sensibility that was directly tied to radical political expression- the folk revival. This entailed a search for roots and relevancy in musical expression. While not all forms of folk music lent themselves to radical politics it is hard to see the 1960's cultural rebellion without giving a nod to such figures as Dave Van Ronk, the early Bob Dylan, Utah Phillips, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and others. Whatever entertainment value these performers provided they also spoke to and prodded our political development. They did have a message and an agenda and we responded as such. That these musicians' respective agendas proved inadequate and/or short-lived does not negate their affect on the times.
Although the production can initially be labeled as "muddy", one will eventually come to understand that it plays a big role in the overall atmosphere. The best suggestion for new fans is to be patient. Music like this with a plethora of different layers takes time. Tool's "nima" is undisputedly one of the most essential albums to own and proved it could withstand the endurance of time.
In point of fact, to take offense at some of these songs is frankly pretty shallow.  I can sort of see how somebody would find the doo-wop "He's So Gay" (which actually is out to spoof gays AND really infuriate homophobes) or the pretty rude "Jewish Princess" offensive.  But who found "Disco Boy" objectionable?  "Valley Girl?"  Even "Goblin Girl", with its pretty subtle sexual innuendo (for the US) is nothing next to "Dinah-Moe Hum" or some non-Zappa songs.
It also dulls me to tears to hear about Bowie's "bravery" in releasing these albums, as if there were some commercial risk involved. While he may have been stepping off stylistic cliffs, he gave himself great, nearly infallible parachutes by including great Pop singles on each LP. ZIGGY had "Suffragete City," LOW has "Sound and Vision," and HEROES had its title tune.  They were all classic singles and, at the time, the market was still largely singles-based. Bowie may have been a challenging musician who liked to push the edges of the envelope, but he has always also been a smart businessman.

4228	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I was fortunate to get this cd for my birthday, but as a result of a shipping mistake, i had to wait three weeks in order to get my hands actually on the disc. I'm quickly making up for lost time. 40 acres is an  excellent CD; the first four tracks hooked me and i haven't been able to  stop listening to the cd ever since.  There You Go has single written all  over it, and it's immensely appealing, but Thankful, the next track, is  marvelous, a rousingly thankful song to God.  Now I pride myself on often  keeping my emotions under control, but I'm happy to admit that  "Shifing Sand" made me cry.  THe sheer beauty of the lyrics  (which describe the difficulty of the Christian walk with lines such as  "sometimes I believe all the lies/and do all the things I should  despise") and the introspective, powerful singing is highly effective.  Shawn Colvin, an excellent secular artist of a highly similar genre, has  an influence on the track after "Shifting Sand," in which the  singer contemplates his life in his hometown and his family.  Its  simplistic but moving style is highly reminiscent of Colvin's "New  Thing Now" or "Wichita Skyline."  Seeing the Colvin  influence, it's not surprisingly in the least that the band covers the  excellent Colvin song "Climb on (a back that's strong)."  They  avoid the pitfalls of most covers and make the song fresh and vibrant.  It's a true masterpiece.  The other six songs on 40 acres are just as  moving, with the group's country-tinged rock and smooth harmonizing evident  throughout.  Shawn Colvin and Jennifer Knapp fans shouldn't hesitate when  deciding to purchase this disc.  Buy it now!

Although the graphics are dated, this is still a timely story. A group of nuclear scientists build a bomb and hold the city of New Orleans hostage. They demand the dismantling of warheads and have them delivered to them for destruction in an attempt to start a worldwide movement to eliminate nuclear weapons. This is a very well written (by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz) script that deals with this situation in a very realistic manner. The network insisted on inserting graphics stating that this was a TV drama - they remembered the WAR OF THE WORLDS panic from the 1930's - although anyone familiar with TV actors of the time would have recognized most of the excellent cast. This is one of Warner Brothers archive collection, a great idea that of that studio's whereby they release little in demand films on DVD by request. It's a bare bones disc, which in a way is unfortunate - a commentary and/or interviews with the cast would have been fascinating. It's still well worth a purchase.

Needless to say, the quality of the audio and video varies widely from the crude early selections, through the fuzzy cinemas of the 1930's to the relatively acceptable quality of the later singers in the 1960's.

The last 2 tracks (not part of the live recording) seem added as an afterthought.  The radio edit of 'Don't Look Back' doesn't make sense on a live record, especially when the radio stations are probably going to play the original live version anyway.  'Should've Been the One' should've been the one they didn't record. The band would be better off avoiding this sort of juvenile pop.

9. Set Me Free-A really great guitar song but it's not one of my favorites but others make like it more. 9 of 10.
Regarding the Foo Fighters' cover version: The Foo Fighters skip the swooping guitars during the intro melody and you can hear it as dead space, causing a drop in intensity there resulting in an undesirable volume pumping effect. The Fighters copy the guitar solo note for note, what's the point? We've heard that already, and much better, so why bother? Granted I'm not that familiar with post 1989 Pearl Jam clone musical styles so I might be missing something, but to me the Fighters' guitar version of the sax intro melody is just plain wrong. The rhythm is wrong and corny, the accents are in the wrong place, and the guitar sound is so anemic when compared to the sax. Why would a band of the Fighters' stature cover a song anyway? The whole thing is just wrong.
Most of the song titles are evergreen jazz standards which you will never get tired of listening to. In fact I owned various other versions by George Shearing, Peggy Lee and later artist like Diana Krall.
Is there a greater song capturing the spirit of the 70s than Hotel California? Probably not. But what makes Hotel California (the album) so great is that the title track isn't all it has to offer. There are ballads, rockers and even an orchestral reprise. This recording covers an extraordinary amount of ground in a seemingly brief 43 minutes. But the 43 minutes translates to a mesmerizing longevity- weeks upon weeks will these songs remain in your head. Although the two songs that I can take or leave are favorites among most Eagles fans (Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love), there really aren't any dull points on the whole album. Hotel California is, and will remain a consummate, prevailing cult and commercial favorite. My personal favorites include the title track, Hotel California, the softly harmonic New Kid in Town and the touching Pretty Maids All in a Row. I recommend this to all.

If you doubt Bruce's talent, listen to numbers like Born in the USA, Darlington County, Bobby Jean, Glory Days and Dancing In the Dark. Dancing just so happens to be the best song here, followed by either Born in the USA, Glory Days or Bobby Jean. Though I don't see why Bruce was singing about glory days passing you by when he was at the height of his popularity, it's still a great song. Darlington County has a great story and an uber-catchy chorus. Born in the USA is an anthem (For 'nam vets and Bruce, that is), and Bobby Jean is a great hard-rocker. But I can't forget No Surrender and Cover Me. There are a couple okay songs here, Working on the Highway (Nice beat but fairly forgettable), Downbound Train (Great title and decent lyrics, not much else), I'm On Fire (Nice song but so quiet you can barely hear it) and I'm Goin' Down (Just plain dull). Still, it's a great album that everyone should have.
Also, while I do agree with the reviewer that stated vols 1, 2 & 4 are the best in the series....2 stars?!?!?! Come on now, disc 2 alone makes this an average of 4!
On this marvelous CD we have -11 tracks- of the most beautiful, moving holiday music and songs you'll ever have the privilege of listening to. Eight of the eleven tracks are instrumental ranging from spiritual and meditative, to classic Renaissance, to old fashioned foot stomping Celtic fun. Only three tracks are accompanied by vocals. They are tracks; 5- 'Star In The East', 10- 'Detroit, December' and the magnificent track 4- 'Christmas In The Trenches.'

I am going to forgive some of the focus issues some have noted.  After, it looks like this was shot on 16mm (as were many documentaries, given the cost of 35mm and you don't want to lug a 35mm film camera on your shoulder for 90 minutes straight.).  Still, many of the shots are great and have the look of good cinematographers rather than the more sterile look of modern digitally shot concert films.  Also, comparing something like Bowie's "Reality Tour" DVD from the 2003 tour, this film was shot with a professional cinema editor and it shows.  I know several professional filmmakers and they'll admit that the editor really makes or breaks a film.  A friend of the family, who shoots low-budget documentaries, still hires the absolute best editors she can afford.  Watching "Ziggy Stardust" leaves you with feeling that you're dealing with filmmakers who are really sensitive to the subject.  Think Jonathan Demme's "Stop Making Sense" or Michael Wadleigh's "Woodstock", or even Martin Scorcese's "Last Waltz".  Watch this as a film, not just a concert.
I've no idea why this gem is unreleased on DVD when it was quite the best-seller on VHS years ago. Try and track down a decent copy if you can. Gilmour fans will especially enjoy seeing their hero when he was relatively young, and his solos are fantastic throughout.

I hope he's working on another.
Nevertheless, the original album still doesn't impress me. I've never owned it and don't plan to buy it, but I have this concert's original two LP set, the movie and the deluxe edition of the terrific "Is There Anybody Out There?" (and waiting for this DVD to arrive, of course). Floyd purists may consider it blasphemy, but I really like Sinad O'Connor's version of "Mother" with the added vocal harmonies. The original "Mother" bores me to death. Ute Lemper's voice in "The Thin Ice" is simply beautiful. Still, David Gilmour's voice is irreplaceable on "Comfortably Numb" although I don't dislike Van Morrison's rendition. Rick DiFonzo does a great job recreating DG's style as well.
this used to be my playground

FINALLY, a version of "Baby Please Don't Go" that's actually good!  I didn't particularly care for the Ten Years After, AC/DC or Ted Nugent versions of the song (actually I've really warmed up to AC/DC's version as of late) but this version... THIS one is a keeper, thanks to it mainly being about melody and extra heavy, extended guitar soloing.  Also this version has a really memorable guitar riff to carry it along with thumping bass work.  Love the guitar riff in the middle.  It's awesome!  "You'll Know I'll Always Love You" is surreal to me.  It sounds SO refreshing and it's almost like time totally got messed up somewhere along the line, and this was *supposed* to be a huge commercial ballad across the world.  It has that sound to it.  I feel like crying during the verse melody based on the sincerity of the lead singer believably expressing the feeling of flying.  Another song that expresses similar vibes is Nazareth's "Flying".  I recommend that song too.

Oh, and let me correct an error in describing an uncollected b-side that  would make a contender for an expanded Eagles singles anthology when I  reviewed the Eagles Greatest Hits gold disc.

It doesn't get  any better than this.  I dare you to not get a chill when Bono as MacPhisto  hits those beautiful falsetto notes at the very end.

Pat  herself is firmly in the 5 star category.  The DVD is a remastering of the  original analog video, and lacks some of the sharpness and sound quality  that the last 17 years have produced.

The entire album has an urgency, groove and sleaze factor that's very reminiscent of "Appetite for Destruction" - yet without sounding dated.  The fact that Slash, Duff and Matt Sorum are G&R alumni is immediately apparent in the band's overall instrumentation, sound and production.  In fact, in many of the songs, your ears almost expect Axl's maniacal "AY-AY-AY-AY..." to come through the speakers at any second.  Weiland's melodies and vocals are also a comfortable fit for the band because they are very much in Axl territory.  As other reviewers have noted, the album only falters during the melodically weak and hook-less ballads.  This flaw inadvertently highlights Axl's genius for all things bombastic, epic and self-indulgently melodic.  It will be interesting to see if this band can follow this mostly strong debut with an equally strong sophomore effort.  In lieu of a G&R album, this is excellent work.

I waited with bated breath for that transcendent moment when life is utter zen -- The giant floating all-seeing pig spinning to "Run Like Hell".  The video shows little of that, so that culmination of audio and visual experience is rather missed.

So I like both operatic tenors and him, especially when he sings pop music, I bet the operatic tenors cant sound as good as him, or maybe just sound the same, since real operatic voice mostly does not "fully" suit pop music. I also listened several other CD's from bocelli, but I feel like this is the best one since they dun even hv one song from bocelli that it is "not my cup of tea"~ I enjoy every single songs in this CD, my favorites are:

In one song, he breaks the sequence a couple of times, and rips into a riff, stopping each time on the perfect note. the last time, he pauses, gives a sly, subtle grin into the camera then sears into an intense lesson on blues fingering.

There are a few filler tracks, but they're not bad, the only track I dislike is the closer, Looking For Angels. So overall, this album doesn't win for its talent or creativity. It simply does what all rock bands try to do successfully, and thats to create music you want to sing along with, talk about, learn to play, and keep in your car stereo.

Velvet Revolver stepped on to the scene with their single 'Slither'.  This is a great introduction to the band, it isn't their best work but it is not their worst either, if they have any bad songs that is.  Since then, they have released the ballad-esque 'Fall to Pieces' and their newest 'Sucker Train Blues', which falls into the heavy category.

'Who is that singing?' She asked. I said it was a Brazilian named Ivan Lins. She said that his voice was possibly the most expressive she had ever heard. The guitarist Lee Ritenour is on top of his game. Dave Grusin and the other musicians are in fine form.

If you only wanted to hear his songs in the original context then they do not truly understand the nature of music, So the reviewer wanting to give negative stars has TOTALLY missed the point.

As this is the only version of these works that I own, I can't compare the recording to any other rendition. But I have always loved the clarinet's richness and tone, and this music played on the extended range clarinet only adds to the instrument's magical quality. How could it not, therefore, add to the depth of the music, as well?
To Musicians and True Fans: Insight into the making of the Joshua Tree is like insight into the creation of the universe. The work, heart, and committment put into the making of this musical work of art is faithfully documented. If you play an instrument and or do some recording you'll more than appreciate what this DVD has to offer. True fans will be delighted in visiting the realm where all the magic took place. But please recognize that most audio releases have time limits...this is not a theatrical release. Albeit 60 minutes doesn't do the entire album justice, but provides insight to a majority of tracks. A documentary implies commentary and insight, articulated by all those involved in the recording process.
Disc 1 is the studio disc and it's here where producer Felix Pappalardi would become almost as important to Cream as producer George Martin was to the Beatles. His use of many stringed instruments on tracks such as "Passing The Time", "Those Were The Days", and "Pressed Rat And Warthog" added a diversity that wasn't present on their first two releases. Although the songs here aren't as catchy as on Disraeli Gears, the haunting "As You Said", the driving "Deserted Cities Of The Heart", and especially the huge hit single "White Room" are among the best tracks they ever recorded. Their blues roots are still present here on the strong tracks "Sitting On Top Of The World", "Politician", and their killer version of Albert King's "Born Under A Bad Sign." Upon listening to this disc, it's apparent that Cream were clearly becoming Jack Bruce's band as his excellent vocals and bass playing are clearly the highlight here. Ginger Baker and especially Eric Clapton's playing here is more restrained when compared to their previous albums.

Standard kicks against THE FABULOUS DORSEYS are the non-acting skill of its leads, a lack of personal detail (such as the two youngest siblings not getting a mention) and its episodic story.

'Choirgirl era- 'Spark' is picturesque, panoramic and wonderful as Tori escapes from a kidnapping vehicle, blindfolded and tied up. The ending tears your heart. 'Raspberry Swirl' is very interesting....she chases a boy through various locations ending up in a dancefloor and a food table taken over by pigs.

"sucker train blues" kicks off the album with a blues-like tempo (go figure), followed by 12 more tracks full of kick-ass rock. even the cheesy (if you want to even call them that since they're not that cheesy at all) power ballads, "fall to pieces" and "you got no right" are worth listening to, as weiland's lyrics are pure bliss. "slither" is rightfully one of the best rock songs of the year thanks to it's catchy tune and chorus. the album ends nicely with "loving the alien", a soft sweet serenade by weiland and slash's soft guitar licks.

I just can't describe it...it's too wonderful. Well anyway BUY THIS VIDEO and see how truely hard Bjork, my favorite singer of all time, works and keeps going on stage to great and AMAZING RESULTS!!
Holiday Inn, Rotten Peaches and All the Nasties represent why I only give this album four stars, rather than five. A particularly annoying tune is All the Nasties. Taking a leaf from Queen's Bohemian Rasphody (which wasn't really all that good in the first place), this has a choir backing Elton's singing. And, like Bohemian Rasphody, the choir is annoying. Coincidence? I think not. Goodbye is a decent way to close the album, and if there's one John album you should own, make it Madman Across the Water.
457	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Strange they would release this set and leave out the biggest hit she had with The Springfields. Silver Threads And Golden Needles is so associated with Dusty that no way should they have omitted it. They should have left out the awful Blossom Dearie track and included Threads and Needles instead. So what I did was re-burn the 1st disc for myself and left out the Dearie track and put in Silver Threads and Golden Needles instead. At least I don't have to listen to Dearie everytime I play the 1st Disc. Still there is no excuse for them omitting Threads and Needles.

For dedicated Zappa-fans, owning these discs is definitely a must, but for those less familiar with the FZ universe, who might be looking for great ensemble playing by a Zappa-band from this era, I suggest listening to e.g. the 1975 album "One Size Fits All" before spending money on this one; being familiar with aspects of the FZ universe will help you appreciate this recording. If you have watched and liked the newly released "Baby Snakes" DVD, you certainly should consider adding "Zappa in New York" to your collection.

I met a cellist who had played under Furtwaengler in the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He of course was a Jewish German refugee. When this man was about to emigrate, he had a conversation with Furtwaengler about the political situation. According to him, Furtwaengler said that he could not abandon his orchestra, as he regarded them as his children. One might add that Furtwaengler also had fears that the Nazis would imprison his mother if he emigrated (remember that they did in fact confiscate his passport after his resignations). Interesting that he did finally emigrate after learning that his mother had died.
I very much liked the new arrangements. In my opinion, the highlights were: Coming Back to Life, High Hopes, Comfortably Numb with Mr. Geldof, the second part of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Smile, and Je Croix Entendre Encore. And, of course, the absolutely impeccable Breakthrough.  I cannot explain it--to me, High Hopes became even more than the studio album or PULSE! That does not mean any version of that song is bad at all--in fact there is no bad version of it. I really do love the sound of the choir there and in Coming Back to Life (which takes a very cool gospel feel to it, and having sung in a similar choir myself, I really enjoyed it).That second part of SOYCD...that's just phenomenal, almost savage in the way it roars to life.
The very idea of 'the Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle' fills me with joy and excitement. It's a completely false and unhelpful biog of the life and times of the Sex Pistols; a madly entertaining and enduring late 70's pop group with coy and crass ideas about anarchy and busting open the music business and the tyrants who own it.
1308	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	To start off, this video is absolutely great. It has  s o  much energy, and the supporting band is a completely classy act of extremely talented and unique performers. I found it hard to believe this video was her first solo tour when I first watched it, because she was oozing so much confidence, and looked so experienced. Stevie's voice really slams all the notes in every song, (except "Dreams"), and it truly is a pleasure to watch all the way through. She mixes her new songs with a few older Fleetwood Mac numbers : "Sara" 'Rhiannon" "Dreams" and "Gold Dust Woman", and all of these excel past the 'Fleetwood Mac Live!" album, not that "Gold Dust Woman" was on that one, but it is still really good. The only disappointment on this video in my opinion is "Dreams", which is just truly truly awful. The rhythm is off, her tone is definitely off, and the back up singers join the chorus at the wrong pitch repeatedly. Also the upper notes have gone, which is a shame, and really puts this rendition at a disadvantage. Her new songs include : "Edge of Seventeen" "Gold and Braid", which are both EXCEPTIONALLY good, "Outside the Rain", "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around", and Tom Petty cover "I Need To Know". Her outfits are always interesting, and her dance moves are always enjoyable to watch, so as she has lots of costume changes and dances a lot, this is a damn good video all round! An ABSOLUTE must for ANY Stevie Nicks fan of ANY degree, as it marks her serious talent for performing, and shows off her wonderful songs in their brightest light. Rock On ..
If you like exceptionally-made hard-rock music with elements of piano and stings, or if you're a "Pan-Head" (like me!) this is a must buy.

If you listen to Candlelight after hearing her other albums, you can hear the awakening to beauty in this track. This is the Imogen we know and love and she becomes completely captivating and seduces you into sound. This song may remind you of the scene in Rent where candles are lit and extinguished. The song rises and falls with creative expression and intriguing lyrics. This is definitely my favorite track on this album. Come Here Boy has elements of nostalgia and awakening. Sleep is a sweet dreamy track ending this journey through Imogen's vocal range. While the album begins on an aggressive note, you are finally left with a deep sigh of the heart.

6875	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Released in May of 1971, this is Paul McCartney's second 'solo' LP, preceding his formation of the band 'Wings' for the 'Wild Life' album.  It's a one-hundred percent improvement on his mediocre self-titled 'debut' album.  Although 'Ram' did yield a number one hit for McCartney, the lush 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey', that song is far from the best song in the 'Ram' collection.  That simple fact is instructive about the high quality of the album, which is solid from start to finish.  And while wife Linda receives co-billing with McCartney on the album cover and in the song credits, and despite some endearing background vocals from her, Linda's contributions are surely overstated here, most likely as another swipe at Paul's ex-collaborator John Lennon.
I've only mentioned my personal favorites on here.  But if you have a wide range of musical tastes (if you're a Smitty fan, you have to), then you'll probably enjoy just about every song on here.
Another plus: "Lodger" lacks the meandering instrumentals that, in my opinion, weighed down "Low" and "Heroes" at times.  It's not that those instrumentals were bad...just that they sound REALLY dated nowadays, and distracted from the otherwise solid cohesiveness of those two albums.  "Lodger" wisely skips out on the instrumentals in order to make room for another batch of great songs.

If you have discovered Kansas recently, then this album is an excellent starter, and if you are a Kansas fan, then you should,like me, be very pleased with this new addition to your collection of music that touches the mind and the heart for years to come.
An almost entirely acoustic set (without all the MTV fancy media around) serves beautifully to Gilmour's purposes of setting Floyd's related songs to what will possibly become a classic.

And as far as the other post, I can't STAND Chicken John's guitar playing, especially live. Bill Weber helped to make that trademark Murder Junkies feel.

Through all the years and all the hits that this band put out, they have always struggled. Even Eric Burdon, who carried the band on after it dissinigrated in the mid sixties. I guess this is what gives this band it's charm. They may be well known, but they still live like most of us. No glory of riches for these guys.

As a live recording The Dance is amazing; the audio CD is nice but the DVD is what you want.  I remember walking through shopping malls in 1997 and all the audio stores were blasting this concert on their televisions to advertise their sound systems.  The picture quality is still amazing - my PS3 does an excellent job up-scaling the quality a bit - and the audio is just as awesome as it was back then.  I recently had to repurchase this because my old copy was damaged.  The only real difference was packaging ... my original DVD had a thick paper/cardboard (?) casing, but I'm sure that only held true for the first few pressings.  This copy came in the standard DVD jewel case.

It was shot beautifully on film, yet has the '80s editing-style of an edit every second, and sometimes blends several angles on the screen at once so that it's hard to tell what's going on.  The real crime is you can barely see the 4 cool "UFOs" that were flying around above the band during the whole show...because that would require a single, unmoving shot of the stage for maybe 10 seconds.  (To Wayne's credit, he did put in two time-lapses showing the giant lighting rigs moving around...but even those go by so fast they're easy to miss!)

Interestingly, the album opens with a textured instrumental "Speed Of Life" which emphasizes the album's focus on music, and presumably not words.  "Speed Of Life" also sounds the sense of an epilogue.  The after-story is fascinating, starting with the violent so-called "post-punk" less-than-two-minute "Breaking Glass" revealing a strutting Bowie who chooses to place such sensibilities in the mainstream.  I thought the lyric went "Don't look at the carpet; I "THREW" something awful on it. . ."  However, it goes "Don't look at the carpet; I "DREW" something awful on it...!"  The punk throws.  The artist draws.  LOW is Bowie discovering his artist, punk influenced certainly, but much more pop contemporary, and fascinated by technology and production.  Bowie was as "cutting edge" as his artist has yet been.

a great producer of original and innovative music and poetry. This album is Springsteen at his peak. It is a great mixture of optimism,
The music is a pleasant blend of the organic piano, and the gentle trip-hop beats. Several songs are piano-based, with classically trained Heap playing her own piano melodies in songs like "Candlelight," or the percussion-piano blend of "Shine." Other songs are more based in electronic beats, but don't lose that grounded edge.

By 1967, the only original member was vocalist Eric Burdon, who became the group's principal songwriter.

To see her with her friend goofing around at Coney Island circa 1994 is a delightful experience,  especially since these episodes are intercut between her lovely videos. Her  SHE'S SO UNUSUAL videos are her best. "Girls Just Wanna Have  Fun," "She-Bop," "Time After Time,"...these are  stunning. From TRUE COLORS are the nonpareil videos "True  Colors," and "What's Going On." However, "Money Changes  Everything" and "Change of Heart" are most disappointing. My  favorite song, "I Drove All Night," the sole video from A NIGHT  TO REMEMBER (it may have been the only video she made from that album). An  offbeat video that began Cyn's practice of directing her own videos,  "I Drove All Night" is the perfect complement to Cyn's  magnificent vocal stylings, and TWELVE DEADLY CYNS...AND THEN SOME (VHS)  pays the ultimate tribute to a phenomenal artist. "Time After  Time," Cyn has shown her "True Colors" and reminded us that  "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun." (And how she has.) "That's What  I Think" of my favorite vocalist.

Of course you can't actually LISTEN to this stuff....
Suddenly the seventies happened, and along came "Hotel California." The Eagles had already established that they were a high quality rock band with aspirations to a heck of a lot more, and what they did with this album (along with Fleetwood Mac's "Rumours") was to repaint the picture of Hollywood as a shiny bauble that barely hid a monster of vapid consumerism and greed, fed by drugs and ego, swarming with sharks in the shallows. To that extent, "Hotel California" not only played as an album that soundtracked a period, but defined it.



There also some Elvis songs that aren't always selected for compilations of this type (Don't, If I can dream) as well as covers of songs generally associated with other singers, but which Elvis sing superbly. These include Hawaiian wedding song, Fever, Let it be me, And I love you so, You don't have to say you love me and Unchained melody.
Keep in mind I am a guitar freak and a HUGE Gilmour fan. If you're more into the visual aspect of Pink Floyd you may not enjoy this as much. But if you love music, and love guitar, I suggest you try it out. (Now if we could just get this released on DVD!!)

I can't think of any live rock recording that comes close to matching the quality of simultaneous improvisation captured on disc 2 of Wheels of Fire. Many people think of Cream as Eric Clapton's band, but disc 2 proves it was a trio of three equally superb musicians. The 16-minute long "Spoonful" jam features a brilliant interplay of guitar (Clapton), drums (Ginger Baker), and bass (Jack Bruce) that builds to climax after climax.
Living Music Records, Inc. compiled this CD from two of Paul's performances at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York City, it was commissioned by the Dean of the Cathedral as a contemporary ecumenical mass.  A celebration of the Natural and the Spiritual together as only  Paul Winter could create it. Recordings of humpback whales, harp seals, wrens and loons weave in and out of the tapestry of music.  The vocals on the CD are the  Cathedral Choristers and the stunning solos of  Susan Osborn, whose voice needs no ornamentation to soar.
Is it a concept album? Hard to say. The band seems to have wanted to roll back the sunny, upbeat sound of traditional bluegrass and expose the sadness often underlying it. As an experiement, it's worth a listen because the group is so darn good, and the musicianship is so fine. Buy it, and feel the songs seep into your soul.
4. Secret (1994).- From too much color ve go to blac and white, I like this song very much, Madonna, a blues band and a new your 'hood is part of this video visual. 10/10
The two duets with Brother Phelps are excellent and make you wonder if the chief 'Headhunter' is still on the prowl! 'Live Forever' is absolutely a stunning piece of spirituality, with excellent picking by Eddy on the acoustic. "If I Give My Soul' is a more uptempo tune and mimics the theme of the aforementioned 'Old Chunk of Coal'.

What good fortune to work with producer Jerry Fuller and arranger/conductor Artie Butler on the majority of these songs.  Just listen to the Fuller/Butler collaborations, "Feel the Warm"(which Billy Eckstine also covered) and "Bookends", pop gems in three minutes time. I especially admired Artie Butler's very different, more rhythmic arrangement for "We've Only Just Begun" and Neil Diamond's "And the Grass Won't Pay no Mind", which has a slightly different mix (more guitars) than the vinyl version. The slowed down Bacharach-David classic from the Broadway musical Promises, Promises, "I'll Never Fall In Love Again" is just sublime. To Collectables: Why no songwriting credits on the CD? Especially when the back booklet is almost a plain, white blank. An overflow of talent, nonetheless!!

The cinematography is incredible, making great use of  black and white film to capture the haunting yet chilling image of The  Edge's  shadowy silhouette against the concert lights, which was made all  the more powerful by the Wizard of Oz appearace of color at the show's  climax at Tempe's Sun Devil Stadium.

The rest of the music videos are also exceptionally good. Even her "whacky" ones like "Human Behavior" and "I Miss You" are great, not her best, but just simply entertaining in a weird way, lol. Bjork is just awesome. She's such a tiny and petite young woman with a mind that is a world in it's own. I recommend this DVD to those who are fans of Bjork, and even to those who are just curious about Bjork and her music.

WatSoS is probably the first (and last) album that Wings was truly a full band. Of the 11 tracks, 5 of them were sung by someone other than Paul, and Denny Laine and Jimmy McCulloch also got songwriting credits on their songs. Even Linda got a number (more on THAT in a bit).

7802	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice variety of soothing sounds, with a blend of instruments and the aroma of differing musical styles, but each meant for relaxation, and stimulation.
There is a lot of controversy and speculation over the instrumental version of "Willie The Pimp" included here, as the original vinyl release fades the first half out at the end of Side One, for the listener to flip the record over and listen to the second half at the beginning of Side Two. Here, there is no second half, "Part One" fades out, per the original record, and a substantial part of a very good guitar solo is lost. Maybe a later release will include the whole piece. Let's hope. The CD has a moment of silence here, but the LP cuts from "Willie," right into "Do You Like My New Car?," also known as "The Groupie Routine." This takes the idea of "What Kind Of Girl..." to its extreme, Volman as the teenage groupie and Kaylan as the touring musician again, and it is one of the smuttiest things I've ever heard, apart from "Joe's Garage" and "Thingfish." But, to its credit, it's side-splittingly funny. Zappa got the writing credit, but anyone can see where the material came from; Flo & Eddie are two of the biggest cut-ups out there. It's crude, and downright crass, but, especially for its time, a laugh riot. Here, we get to see who the out-of-town rock star is, because when he promises to sing his hit "with a bullet," the mothers launch into a rendition of The Turtles' "Happy Together." Self-parody at its finest.

Although I still love their music, their merchantilism seems to know no boundaries [Kiss Kasket, anyone?] and has made me step away from them over the years, in favor of real muscicians.

Born In The USA, aided by that music television thing spawned seven top-ten hits, charted at number one, spent thirty six weeks in the top three, over fifty weeks in the top five, and a mind blowing eighty four weeks in the top ten ... allowing Bruce to move from small venues to arenas, and become the stuff of legend.  Oddly enough the album opens with "Born In The USA," a beefed up version of a much darker song, and more impression version that most of the world would never hear until sometime in the future.  I always wondered why that dark version hadn't showed up as a reprise on the album; it would have been so effective.  Thanks to some dear friends, I was able to hear many of the nearly one hundred tracks that were recorded over a two year period that made up this release, and contributed to several others.  Born In The USA marked a significant change in Springsteen's style, a style that for those of us who'd been following Bruce for years took in stride, because it seemed and felt so effortless.  Here, for the first time the music took center stage, over shadowing the lyrics to the point that most people [including the Republican party who wanted to use the song as an election banner] didn't understand them, and more pointedly, they didn't seem to care ... the fans were more than happy with the huge sound that shook walls and allowed them to dance the night away to blistering guitar solos.  And as good as the album was, I left the table feeling rather hungry, and bit forgotten, if not older at the time.  No doubt, the release of Born In The USA significantly challenged those who'd found Bruce at this particular moment in time, causing them to question much of his future work, not understanding that this was merely a bubble that held it's shape and then bust in the summer sun as Bruce returned to more introspective albums and ways of thinking.  Taken out of context it's easy to dismiss Born In The USA as a static achievement, remarkably locked in the 1980's ... yet viewing it within the musical continuum, Born In The USA is a wonderful achievement ... though without a doubt, and by me as well, Born In The USA is oven overlooked by those of us who'd been riding top-down on the passenger side with Bruce for all these years, because we like to feel that we know something that others don't, could see things in his music that others couldn't, and have experienced his rapture in ways that new-be's never would.  In short, I and those like me, took great satisfaction from the early cult status, we didn't want to be part of this bigger than life world experience, and I suppose, took a bit of self-rightous pride in ignoring this number one, chart topping production.
So, there's still a lot of T-Bones material for someone to pull together in another volume. Musicians that took part in these 1966/67 recordings included guitarist Don Hamilton, bass player Joe Frank Corollo and drummer Tommy Clark Reynolds who would go on to even greater fame as Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds.


Famous songs are notable by their absence although some songs here are better known than others. Drifting too far from the shore (Boone Creek) is a traditional gospel song.

My one complaint about this DVD is that it is pretty clear at least some of Peter's vocals were re-recorded in studio.  There's no breathing (PG spends about a third of the concert in motion), no mic fades, and the audio doesn't always match up with the video.  This is pretty typical of PG who apparently did the same for the VHS version, the Secret World CD and Peter Gabriel Plays Live CDs (he said as much in the "Plays Live" liner notes).  For me it is maddening.  I've seen PG live 6 times now (soon to be 7 or 8 as the Growing Up 2003 tour shapes up) and I have never heard a missed note or a crack.  Even if such a thing should show up, it's a LIVE performance, isn't it?  The perfectionist leanings that PG has are admirable, but I believe this goes to far and takes away from his live recordings.

Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part).

And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!
3270	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	What makes this film truly iconic and amazing is how it exposes what an utter joke punk rock is.  Punk and it's attendant philosphy is nothing more than a lie foisted on desperate youth who can't fit in and then make a 'movement' out of their alienation.  Of course, they end up forming their own 'gangs' and cliques, with their own codes of conduct and rules of inclusion....pathetic.  G.G. Allin bought into that crap hook, line and sinker before turning on it and going full out and taking all his nihilism to its illogical extreme.  Hated is a great chronicle of how punks inherent self-absorption and dissillusionment with just about everything, culminate into vast amounts of hopeless nothingness.  Granted, G.G. doesn't represent your typical punk or hardcore kid, and many people are divided about the guy, but he took punk's 'lifestyle' and stylized  self-destructive impulses to the hilt.  You can practically see the guy yearning for a hug, except he probably smells way too bad for anyone to get too close.  This movie is great to put on at a party and to sit back and watch everyone get grossed out at the circus sideshow.  G.G. teetered on the brink of self-parody and always crossed the line into it.  It seems that he's always 'on', kinda like a punk rock Robin Williams.  I'll admit the movie is absolutely hilarious at times, particularly when G.G.'s confronting his audiences.  The scene where he's shoving bananas up his butt  at some spoken word gig at NYU is great, especially when he starts tossing banana chunks at people.  But you gotta ask yourself, what's the point?  Yeah, it's funny but so what?  I asked myself the same thing when I saw G.G. lay down at a BBQ and had some chick urinate in his mouth, which prompted him to upchuck his hot dogs.  Yay.  And the reasons for his psycho-social behaviour?  A lousy upbringing in New England, where G.G. overheard his father talking about killing his kids, his wife and himself....whoop-dee-doo.  Seeing how G.G. dressed like a girl in high school spoke of someone so desperate for attention, but also so full of self-loathing for wanting that attention, that he turned on everyone and everything.  Of course, one day G.G. discovers punk which gives him an outlet for his erratic behaviour and a cult following that gets off on his lunacy, intellectualizing it as some sort of statement about a screwed up society.  You can tell G.G. got off on being held in such high regard, even if it was for making an a** of himself.  Why else would the guy declare, for years mind you, that he would kill himself on stage on Halloween night?  Why not do it privately and with dignity?  Why have an audience?  And who's to say that the guy wouldn't take out a couple of his fans as well?  The strange thing is that G.G. wasn't a total buffoon and he could actually write some catchy and clever tunes, especially early on in his 'career'.  You can't really tell in the tunes he does with the Murder Junkies, mostly because the sound quality in the flick ain't so great, but songs like 'Bite It, You Scum' are really fun.  And the scene with G.G. strumming an acoustic guitar and singing Warren Zevon's 'Carmelita' is revealing. Was he really maybe a softie? Of course, for anyone who knows about him, G.G. will always be remembered as the guy who used to spread his own feces all over himself, the guy who'd bash his own teeth in with his microphone, the guy who'd cut himself and assualt his audience etc. etc.  Todd Phillips does a great job of letting G.G. and his assorted hangers-on hang themselves with their own rope.  While I don't care much for punk's philosophical standpoint, the music is pretty good.  This movie is the same.  I could care less about G.G. Allin, no matter how amusing I find his self-immolation to his lifestyle choice, but this movie is really well done and ALWAYS interesting.  There's never a dull moment.  G.G.'s demise, a typical heroin overdose like the dumb rock star he is, is anticlimactic and much like his life.  A lot of bark, with only a little bite...enough to nip at your heels and annoy you, but nothing that has any REAL effect.  Enjoy this in a room full of people who can't imagine a guy like this would exist and watch their jaws drop.  Good fun.

Musically, the album is dark and given to adventurous, elaborate and spatial instrumentation - along with eerie and mysterious interludes. The opening track "Stinkfist" is a heavy and fairly straightforward rocker. Maynard James Keenan has one of the most distinctive and ethereal voices in rock today -- displaying the innocent, sad, poignant and reflective quality of Joni Mitchell one minute, then exploding into a frighteningly explosive scream the next, which can evoke Chucky, the doll (see the horror film "Child's Play", voiced by actor Brad Dourif). "Eulogy" begins with some spoon-like percussion and eerie guitar lines (which evoke King Crimson). It then turns into an explosive rocker. Maynard's vocals are particularly beautiful and impressive here. (Note: if you're new to this, don't make the mistake of thinking the percussive opening lasts forever - it doesn't). "H" showcases guitar ambience, tribal-like rhythms (from drummer Danny Carey) and explosive sections. "Useful Idiot" is the short interlude (which sounds like an ending of a scratched record) that segues into "Forty Six & Two", which is probably the most popular Tool track on this album. "Message To Harry Manback" is an interlude of an angry immigrant badmouthing the American nationality (which I find quite hilarious). "Hooker With A Penis" is pure confrontational metal at it's best. I think lyrically, this has to do with the music business (and the whole "selling-out" thing). It may have had something to do with a fan accusing Tool of doing just that. "Intermission" is a short keyboard piece (evoking that of a sports/arena anthem). It's actually a short 'keyboard' version (or opening) for the next track "Jimmy". This along with the rest of the tracks are the most "elaborate" on the disc. "Die Eier Von Satan" (German for "The Eggs Of Satan") is a recipe spoken in German. The backing music sounds almost industrial/death metal-like, containing shrieks and sadistic "slaps". "Pushit" is a heavy rocker, which shows off Danny Carey's complex, precise and intricate rhythms on the drum kit. Some of Maynard's vocals here reach ranges that weren't heard anywhere else (on this disc, or on any other Tool album). His Gaelic-ish vocals near the end (backed by a guitar/bass progression of 5th's) are truly poignant. "Cesaro Summability" sounds like guitar/amplifier feedback - fronted by baby screams. "nema" is a profane, dissonant heavy rocker, with snaky rhythms galore. Maynard James Keenan describes the city of Los Angeles - and says that it should receive an "enema" -- flushing it all away. "(-)Ions" is an eerie, dissonant and whirry interlude. I personally find this ethereal. "Third Eye" probably sums up what this album and Tool's music stands for in general -- thinking for yourself. The beginning dialogue features a sample taken from one of comedian Bill Hicks' standup routines. He says that many people denounce drugs - yet drugs have done something powerful for us - they've helped 'some' musicians provide us diehard music fans with what many of us consider "the best music of all-time" (examples: The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who - these are only a handful of 'revered' bands that have had certain members of each use drugs before). The 'third eye' is referred to as the human brain. Like the actual human 'eye', it absorbes and processes things (for benefit or detriment). When to 'open' (take in, absorb, believe) and 'close' (neglect, reject, refuse) the organ is our choice. The music on here features many instrumental and experimental twists and turns throughout it's 13-minute playing time.

6396	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	A revelation. For newcomers and fans of Elton John's music, this album and the self-titled are MUST HAVES. The 5.1 mix is so amazing that it reveals and clears up lots of sections and instrumentations. The performances are still the great landmark performances that I've loved since 1973 when my brother came back from Korea with a cassette of this album. The only piece that has changed, for me, due to the remix, is INDIAN SUNSET (just before "I take only what is mine, Lord"), because there is a part where the celli and bass sound louder than the piano, whereas they were barely audible in older mixes. It changes the song at that moment for me.

This is how I learned to appreciate this stuff, okay?
Fortunately, however, I have a copy of the CD. As my schedule requires long drives very often, I have listened to these masterpieces dozens of times within recent months. Each time I hear them, it's like meeting old friends. I discover new joys, find new meanings, and never grow tired of them.


Tell Her No (#6) 1964
Even though they do offer breaks, with stuff such as a weird threatening phone message (Message to Harry Manback), recipe for cookie (Die Eier Von Satan) and a vinyl reaching its end (Useful Idiot), the songs here are so strong that they seem kind of useless.

However, his unique writing skills were clear from the outset. Tangental, oblique, call it what you will his tack on the emotional world,and the capacity to nail a feeling to a powerful image is all here. At this point of his journey his folk background is more evident. You could picture his themes quite easily as ballads from an earlier epoch. But the concision that has marked his writing ever since is breathtaking.
There are no sync problems between the audio and video, and the reason why the band doesn't perform the middle section of Bohemian Rhapsody live is very simple - Queen never performed that part on stage. It was so complex that they always played a tape recording of it while they went offstage to change costumes and freshen up.

The biggest pro is the sound: this compilation has been mastered by Vic Anesini using DSD technology and the results are incredible: any older compilation (pre 2002) you have will not sound as good as this, period. This is also not just a compilation of Elvis ballads that made the top ten or his best known ballads, there are some obscure selections and even a previously unreleased alternate take. The value of the money is great. Almost 30 tracks in one CD.  The cons? Although the compilation is called 'Love' there are some tracks that are not about romantic Love and will probably get you out of the mood (ie "If I can dream".) The biggest cons is that some of Elvis most beautiful love songs are not inlcuded on this collection: 'Love Me' and 'Young and Beautiful'.  Not a definitive compilation by any means, but it kind of appeals to both newbies and fans.

After the solo performances, we get a real workout of both Yes classics and the recent ABWH releases. The highlights for me on the classics is Heart of the Sunrise, a very complicated track that hasn't been performed live for well over ten years. On the ABWH side, Birthright stands out with Bill's electronic tribal rythms kicking in full force. Too bad the best cut on the album, Quartet, couldn't be performed, but to do that you need 4 Steve Howes, 3 Rick Wakemans, maybe 2 Bill Brufords and about 8 Jon Andersons to do it. And yet it's called "Quartet", oh well! Too much to go over here on this concert, but take my word, it's all great.

The high point for me is the point and counter point between King and Taylor on "Up On The Roof."

He is without a doubt one of the great songwriters of our time, but he has had two things working against him:  the cloying production that plagued many singer-songwriter albums from the 70s and his rather limited vocal talents.  This album rectifies the first fault by placing him in a warm intimate concert setting which complement his songs very well.  As for his voice, I have never heard it sound better.  By this time (mid-1980s), it has become just weathered enough but not too raspy as it would later become.  The live setting of course also affords this rather personable singer to spin tales between songs about how each of them was written, and I can tell you that after hundreds of listens I still find those stories charming, particularly the one about the girl who wanted to hear a song about a "happy enchilada".

Instead of heeding to the negative reviews, I decided to view it with my own eyes because it's truly one of the best concerts ever.  But I ended up returning the DVD and purchased it on VHS with the "original" 1994 release date because the "SOUND" quality was so much better and I didn't loose ALL the artistic visual elements with the "fake" widescreen format!!!  The remastered version is not worth your money!  Peter Gabriel should care more about reproducing this masterpiece and take another stab at it because this DVD release is absolutely horrendous!  The VHS copy (even though it's mildly smokey looking) is still much better in my opinion - largely because the sound quality is dramatically better in VHS!  The remastered DVD's sound was actually more muffled and flat throughout the performance - and let's face it, music concerts are FIRST about sound!  So all together, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I recommend searching out a copy on VHS (sadly).

I wished the audience, during the first SOYCD, would've been quieter--that honestly struck me as rude, yelling out as often as they did. At one point, when the audience got loud, I saw Mr. Gilmour smile at their antics...but I'm sure it was also very frustrating. :-( So please note that, all you future concert goers...this doesn't mean to not show enthusiasm, but I think there are appropriate times for it. An example of good audience behavior would be "Breakthrough". Wild applause at the beginning, of course, which I am sure was much appreciated. Except for one yell as the music got started, they're pretty quiet during the song, which I think is the respectful thing to do.

I can *definitely* do without "Dummy Up" however.  It's basically a 6-minute story song with a quiet groove tapping along in the background while constant bickering between two characters takes place (one of which played by Frank himself) dealing with the subject of drugs and smoking.  Not much of a song to me, but I guess you're supposed to take in the clever lyrics and the overall atmosphere of the live performance.  In that respect, I really won't complain about it.

"Here We Go Again"
Now comes Wheels of Fire, which was a double album set, one studio, one live, so you get to see what this band was made of in both settings. Let's start with the studio set: many of the songs are Jack Bruce (and Pete Brown) and Ginger Baker (with Mike Taylor) originals, with a handful of covers of blues songs originally done by blues artists. We all heard "White Room" plenty of times, it's became very much an FM radio staple. It bears more than a striking resemblance to "Tales of Brave Ulysses", right down to Clapton's use of wah-wah, and similar scales. "Sittin' On Top of the World" is a cover of a blues song, by Howlin' Wolf. Even during Cream's psychedelic phase, they hadn't forgotten their blues roots. Clapton never made a secret that he was big on the blues, as that constantly showed up throughout his career, through the various bands and his solo career. Of course, some people felt the material on this album was uneven, certainly not the easiest stuff to get into, and some people felt they could live without the stuff Ginger Baker wrote. But these songs to my ears are quite good, even if a bit peculiar. One of them being "Passing the Time". Way back as a teenager (around 1989, I was not alive in the 1960s, I was born in 1972) I first heard that song and disliked it, I was put off by Ginger Baker's singing and the circus organ. But hearing this song many year later, it isn't that bad, and I really liked that intense jam that comes out of nowhere showing Jack Bruce's bass skills and Baker's drumming. The jam fads back into the more mellow state the song started. Felix Pappalardi provided some cello work as well. The Jack Bruce/Pete Brown "As You Said" might not to be everyone's liking, but I thought of it as a nice experimental psychedelic piece (the only thing missing here was sitar). Strange use of phasing, I get reminded a little of the Beatles' "I am the Walrus", but it didn't quite have the big hooks that made the Beatles song so popular and such a big hit. Baker and Taylor's "Pressed Rat and Warthog" is an interesting piece where Baker narrates about two characters forced to close a shop because they were selling "atonal apples and amplified heat" with "Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet". "Politician" might be familiar to many of you FM radio listeners, this one another one of those blues songs, but this time a Baker/Brown composition, rather than a cover of an old blues song. Baker/Taylor's "Those Were the Days" sounds very much like a traditional psychedelic Cream song, this time Jack Bruce doing vocals, so it sounds like Cream as you expect. This is probably one of the greatest songs Cream did that you don't hear on the radio. Next is a cover of Albert King's "Born Under a Bad Sign", another familiar blues song that everyone has heard on classic FM radio. "Anyone For Tennis" is sadly not on the original LP (it should have been), Clapton takes on vocals here. I really dig the use of recorder and percussion. The song originally came out as a single (its flip side being "Press Rat and Warthog"). So it's nice to see it included on the CD reissue as I really think it deserved to be on the original album. The second disc is certain to polarize many a listener. It's mainly a solo showcase for Clapton, Bruce, and Baker. You keep hearing about those live Cream improvisations. You get your chance here! You either find them mindblowing or boring. Remember that many people think the same with the Grateful Dead and their live improvisations, even if what they did was very different. First is Robert Johnson's "Crossroads". We all know this one, another radio staple. It has full band interaction. Then comes a cover of Willie Dixon's "Spoonful". If you're familiar with the studio version off Fresh Cream, you'll notice this one is considerably longer with an extended Clapton guitar solo. Bruce's "Traintime" is largely a harmonica solo (I wondered if this inspired the Blues Travelers? Of course Bruce's harmonica playing and sound was different from John Popper's). "Toad", Baker's time to show, was originally off Fresh Cream, this time the drum solo was way extended. This is where it would scare the more casual listeners off for good. But he has such a creative and imaginative approach to drumming that I wanted to listen to this drum solo. That drum solo certainly inspired the likes of Led Zeppelin, and Jethro Tull ("Dharma For One"). The studio original, I'm certain, inspired Iron Butterfly's "In-a-Gadda-da-Vida" (they also happened to share the same label: Atco).

I want to say the Ozzy osbourne live and loud concert is great because the concert is awesome. Why I say the concert is great is because it is a full frame concert which is a rare thing because the older concerts from past years supported the full screen. The old dvds support mostly full frame format and the newer dvds support anamorphic wide screen 1.78 and the wide screen is a 16:9 format. Getting back about the concert its 112 minutes long which is a duration of a concert of 1 hour and 48 minutes almost 2 hours long. It is filmed somewhere in the west coast in los angeles california or phoenix arizona. You can buy this concert also on vhs which supports the full screen format. Before I get into telling you about the concert is that  this is a 2 disc dvd which means that you have to flip the disc over to disc two or side two when the concert comes at track number 11 so the concert on the duration running time is 57:04 which is roughly 1 hour. I want to say that I enjoy the concert because its the best rock songs ever like starting with disc one or side one the songs are 1. Program start , 2. I don't want to change the world, 3. Desire, 4. Mr. Crowley, 5. I don't know, 6. Road to nowhere, 7. Flying high again, 8. Paranoid, 9. Suicide solution, 10. Goodbye to romance and 11. Shot in the dark. Starting with disc two or side two 1. No more tears, 2. Miracle man, 3. War pigs, 4. Bark at the moon, 5. Mama, I'm coming home, 6. Crazy train, 7. Black sabbath, 8. Changes, and 9. End credits I just want the amazon.com customers to buy this because they would enjoy this concert because it's heavy metal but they will enjoy something they like that they purchased down the road. When you buy this on vhs its worth the money. Just remember one thing when you buy directly from amazon.com new or used the buyer directly you will have no problems with returning it to the company. You could send it back but just remember one thing make sure you ask for the return label with the item because they want everything packaged the same way. So just make sure you have the return label and make photocopies for the return label. Vhs tapes will last you many years but they do crack, and it's hard to repair vhs tapes once they get fragile or very fragile. The dvd digital video disc lasts longer more than vhs because its lake a cd a compact disc where vhs tapes and music cassettes break very easily within time remember that. When you buy from a third party vendor you will have to file a claim with amazon so just remember that. I want to tell the amazon.com customers they could buy whatever they want. It's a choice of preference. I'm not forcing anyone to buy anything. I'm the man just going to tell the whole review like it is. That's all I wanted to say. It's suitable for all ages. Except I'm concerned about the younger generation the young kids who have to hear the profanity while they watch the concert. So remember amazon.com customers or all fans, heavy metal fans, please enjoy the concert. But it's up to the amazon.com customers to watch the concert even if it has profanity please enjoy the entire concert even if it has profanity it's up to you to make the right decision. One note when you buy from amazon.com you could get free shipping and handling when you buy $35.00 and more you qualify for free shipping and handling when you buy directly from the amazon buyer directly not from a third party seller or vendor. Even without its swearing of the bad words its still a great rock concert.

"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo (12/24)" is played on the radio frequently, and not only by rock stations, even though it could be THE greatest instrumental ever written (even though it's just over three minutes long).

A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background.  He sounds really angry and crazy on that song.  "It's Goin Down" is a lot slower.  It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting: "It's goin down" during the hook.  Throughout the album, he shows the harder side of California life!
At this time, the band was reorganizing after nearly a decade of Trevor Rabin-based music.  Their youth and their musical energy is still in top form, as is Jon Anderson's voice.
I love "Smooth", which is the song that gets them the most radio play, but the other songs are equally as great to listen to.

More surrealism and lyrics relating to food (not unlike "Call Any Vegetable" and "Duke of Prunes") with some really nice vibe work and trumpets, along with some doo-wop vocals. The overall effect is surprisingly calming ... I can't help but smile when listening. The ending is strong and pseudo-epic, but effective. I like it a lot. After some more talking, (including Jimmy Carl Black complaining about not getting paid!), we move onto some straight doo-wop, right out of "Ruben and the Jets", "The Air", is very good doo-wop and very enjoyable. Its no wonder Frank loved this type of music; I can see why when I hear his version of it! "Project X" is some excellent avant garde, before leading into some really chill-inducing music. "Cruisin' For Burgers" is weird, very surreal, and beautiful ... some of my favorite Mothers' music ever. And to think, all of this creativity and not an ounce of drugs involved. Its amazing and ends Side 3 perfectly, before moving onto Side 4... Side 4 is the subject of another Frank Zappa classic, the 18 minute jazz odyssey, "King Kong". In many ways, its as threatening and monstrous as its namesake, with a bombastic head, leading to numerous solos from within the band. Everything is covered here: there's another Underwood solo, a Don Preston electric piano solo, and something that almost sounds like an electric kazoo! The whole thing comes to a thrilling conclusion in a live performance where the band rocks out "on a flat bed diesel in the middle of a race track at a Miami Pop Festival" and comes apart at the end. It doesn't end ... it falls apart, like the great beast himself, shot from the Empire State Building, very much a way to describe the end of the mammoth double set itself.

Waylon Jennings helps out on the uptempo, soft-rock  "Heart & Soul" as well as the moody, acoustic "Oklahoma  Wind." Brother Phelps also lend a hand on the soft, acoustic  "Live Forever", and the EXTREMELY catchy "If I Give My  Soul." The latter is very reminiscent of a Fleetwood Mac rocker.  "Tramp on Your Street" & "Hottest Thing in Town" go  from slow blues to blues-rock, respectively. The slow, acoustic "When  the Fallen Angels Fly" & the rockabilly "Old Chunk of  Coal" each feature some very introspective, spiritual lyrics without  being preachy. As great as this CD is, though, it was a mere foreshadowing  of its followup, the "Unshaven:Live" CD.

He parades down through the audience to begin this concert with "Time and a Word" and it is a lovely beginning, but then through a succession of additional Anderson, Wakemen and Howe solos, it begins to feel like this will never take off. On top of that Howe has a bizarre expression on his face as though his last colonoscopy was minutes before stagetime.

Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes with one song after another, the show is like a non stop high energy carnival ride. This is a ride you definitely won't want to get off of either. Near the end of the show, Danny Elfman shouts, "This is like one Big Orgasm" and he is absolutely right on the money. Elfman puts so much energy into his performance running and dancing around the stage, I am totally amazed to see him standing at the end. The picture is clear and the sound while only in 2 channel stereo is clear and crisp. In my opinion the only thing wrong with this DVD is that the sound isn't in Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS. The bonus DVD with the special features was fun and I found it interesting to watch. I guess my only other complaint would be the exclusion of weird science in the song list, no farewell show should be without it. This DVD concert is worthy of ownership for any "Oingo Boingo" fan new or old. Overall I give it 5 stars for the concert performance and extras, but drop it down to 4 stars because of the 2.0 sound.

The appetite gets thoroughly whetted with "Rebirthing", a mix of ethereal with rock in the most delicious flavor. It's true that for a couple of songs it slows after that, but not in a way that offends. Think of it as salad and bread. It grabs you again with "Better Than Drugs" - many peoples' favorite.  Personally, I find it slightly grating and cliche', and am most likely, out of all the songs, to skip it after a sip or two. But then again, I'm not an ale drinker.

Much of the video delves into the songwriting process of the three brothers while in their studio.  It's an amazing glimpse into the genius that produces the hits.

With Waters' "house" band led by guitarists Rick DiFonzo and Snowy White, he leads the way in most of the vocals.  Still Waters summons up some interesting guest artists including some excellent vocals by Van Morrison and The Band.  In a crazy juxtaposition there is heavy metal Scorpions and Joni Mitchell.

The star (Bing Crosby, Jack Benny, Perry Como, et al) stepped into the spotlight, sang a song or told a few jokes, then performed in a sketch featuring one of the guest stars. If the guest was a musical performer, he or she would have a solo before joining the host in a duet. A few more sketches and musical numbers followed, then came the grand finale involving the entire cast. After the final commercial break, the star returned to the spotlight for a quiet farewell. The only variable was the host.
The thing I didn't like was the use of the F and S words quite a few times.  GNR was known for using excessive profanity, but STP wasn't. I'd probably recommend the clean version more, but whatever. The songs were good anyway.
For example,  the first cut, Yaleo is one of those unrelenting running jams that you can  just imagine going on for 30 minutes on the bandstand at a summer concert.  It's got that Fela Kuti kind of call and response that you can just wear  yourself out on.
What stops it from being worthy of 5 stars in my opinion?  The muddy production and the fact that it outstays its welcome by about 15 minutes.  By the time I reached the middle of the album I had grown tired of the repetitive intros to nearly every song.

The entire horn section is well-written and well-played throughout the album.

In 1986, Janet released her "Control" LP.  Each single released from the album had a video.  "What Have You Done for Me Lately" was the first.  Janet is known for her coy, reserved disposition, but in this video, Janet exhibits another side: a Janet with attitude.  This video includes choreography by Paula Abdul, and dances that would later become popular, like the Snake.  Janet's big hair and colorful clothes make this video memorable.  "Nasty", arguably Janet's signature song, is also featured on this DVD.  "Nasty" is shot in and around a movie theatre, and again features Janet providing lots of attitude.  Janet is a bit robust in "Nasty" (and most of the videos from this era), but she still dances with such vigor and energy.  In this video, Janet proclaims her distaste for nasty men by rolling her eyes and sashaying past them.  "Control" is Janet's first live performance, and she stunned.  She was a triple threat in this video: a dancer, singer and a superb performer!  Definitely worth mentioning is the incredible "The Pleasure Principle." Janet lost a substantial amount of weight, flattened her hair, and grew a bit more mature when this video was filmed.  She danced almost the entire video, alone.  Although this video is pretty simple, it had just as much impact as some of her more costly, gaudy videos.
As the title suggests, this disc includes the Zombies' debut album, Begin Here, and most of their A- & B-sides that did not appear on any album (the remainder are on disc 2).  Begin Here has been described as a "typical" album of its time, and while that's somewhat true, I believe there's more to it than that.  The album does contain a couple lukewarm covers, but those are outweighed by such gems as "I Can't Make Up My Mind," their jazzy rendition of "Summertime," "I Remember When I Loved Her," and "I Don't Want To Know," which has a 12-string guitar intro with a sound that a certain folk-rock band would popularize a year later.  As for the singles, there isn't a weak one in the bunch, though only two of them ("She's Not There" & "Tell Her No") were successful, which calls into question what the public was instead listening to at the time (well, okay, the Beatles)...even George Harrison said at the time that he couldn't understand why the Zombies weren't being more successful.

7504	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Very few -- if any -- hip-hop acts have acheived the feat of making three consistent, classic, quintessential hip-hop LP's.  The Tribe pulled it off with Midnight Marauders.  This set is a synthesis of the neo-Afrocentric  vibes of their first album, "People's Instinctive . . ." and  their sophomore classic, "Low End Theory," with harder-edged  beats to boot.
The movie explains some of the songs better, for example I didn't really care for "I Still  Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" with the gospel choir untill I saw  how they went to harlem and actually recorded in a little church. I didn't  care much for "When Love Comes To Town" till I saw how they  pulled B.B. King into it. So the movie did enhance the CD. Plus the movie  has 11 extra live songs (all the rest of The Joshua Tree live), plus an  incredible version of Bloody Sunday and others.
If I was to engage in nit-picking I would point out that tracks 13 and 14 were not, themselves, hits in the true sense of the word, Love Hurts being the B-side of Running Scared, and Shahadaroba the flip of In Dreams. This being his best while at Monument, perhaps these could have been replaced by the 1965 hits Goodnight [# 21] and (Say) You're My Girl [# 39]. Also, the liner notes by Boudleaux Bryant are rather skimpy for such an important artist.


Next up is a stirring recitation of an ominous poem.  Spleen: "When the low sky presses like a lid on my spirit heavy with pain, and all the wide horizon is curtained by a dark day, oh sad the night..."

George Martin, who produced many Beatles' albums, never used echo effects and backing female vocals as well as this version does.

On part two we have his blues jam "Traintime". Can almost imagine the train click-clacking along with this harmonica inspired number. We also have Ginger Baker's wonderous drum solo again in "Toad". Much better than the original studio recording, if you ask Metamorpho. "Spoonful" is much more precise and measured. A true joy. But, then we get to the "core" of exhileration. "Crossroads", in itself, is worth the purchase of this classic c.d. Clapton's lead transcends human boundaries (and, when listened to loud, will bounce you off the walls! Just as it has done to your beloved Seer since he listened to it many Seer moons ago!).  This, I feel, was the peak of Clapton's power. Yes.

I've always thought "Disraeli Gears" to be Cream's best album but after a few listens, I'm actually finding myself liking at least disc one at least as much if not a little better than that other classic rock jewel.  "As You Said" would not sound out of place on a Pearl Jam album and is my favourite track here just for the overall uniqueness of the sound and the whole album unsurprisingly has a very psychedelic almost Sgt Pepperesque feel about it given its 1968 release.  "Pressed Rat and Warthog" reminds me of The Police's "Be My Girl Sally" a little bit because of the monologue but I enjoyed this track a lot too.  Clapton's cover of the late great Albert King's "Born Under a Bad Sign" while not quite as good as the original is still a nice track in what is overall a great album.  I didn't enjoy the live second disc as much although I thought "Crossroads" was fantastic and worth the purchase of the whole set alone.

7906	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Despite the fact that this recording has the indelible reputation of being the worst selling album in the Warner Brothers catalog, it stands up with any of its classic contemporary recordings, and here's why.  Thompson had just departed the greatest folk rock band of all time, Fairport Convention, just one year after Sandy Denny and Ashley Hutchings.  The band just could not contain his enormous talented knack for writing original material based on traditional Scottish themes.  Take Liege and Lief's Crazy Man Michael (1969), for instance.  There's a story that continues all the way to Rumor and Sigh's 1952 Vincent Black Lightning (1991).  Henry kicks off like gangbusters with Roll Over Vaughn Williams and one never knows if it nods to Williams or Chuck Berry or both!  The listener is bombared with electric notes at a mile a minute--I wouldn't doubt he used every note on that strat of his.  Shakey Nancy brings up some of the best Celtic music in the genre, and features Sandy Denny playing some pretty piano.  The Angels Took My Racehorse Away is a hilarious take on the death of a thoroughbred with an unlikely pairing of country rock-a-billy guitar licks with John Kirkpatric's accordian working a cajun twist.  Backing vocals ably supplied by Sandy and Linda, this is one of the album's standout tracks.  The Old Changing Way is a timely piece about sharing in time of need, while The Poor Ditching Boy is a lament on an untrue lover.  Vocals are twisted with rage and sadness in his ballads and deadpanned in the lighter tracks such as Twisted.  Humor abounds here with Cold Feet and Nobody's Wedding with the traditional Maire's Wedding jig tagged on.  Shady characters such as Alice the Butcher and the wild boy chopping up the floor add all the intrigue of a Hitchcock mystery.  A woman's shape is likened to the topography of a country side village in Wheely Down.  Although this is Richard's first album proper, he handles this song cycle like a seasoned pro.  Here is an album that, to the uninitiated, is strange at first hearing, but the returning listener is rewarded with a beautiful odessey.  (Richard is a veteran of over 40 albums from 1968 to present under his own name, Fairport and two under French, Frith, Kaiser & Thompson.  He has contributed on probably hundreds of albums in addition.  One of the most under-appreciated guitar players, he has been compared to everyone from Eric Clapton to Django Reinhardt.  He comes highly recommended by the likes of Bonnie Raitt and Elvis Costello.)

From Under the Pink: Past the Mission seems to take place in Italy following a death (people wearing black, priests).  Cornflake Girl has two versions, European and American.

Had all the performances been done live, it would have been very interesting. Bolan's band at the time consisted of Herbie Flowers on bass, Tony Newman of drums, Dino Dines on keyboards, and the excellent Miller Anderson on guitar. It was the tightest version of T.

Producer Stanley Kramer directed the somewhat offbeat big budgeted spectacular THE PRIDE AND THE PASSION with Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and Sophia Loren. Set during the Peninsular War and where Napoleon's armies overrun Spain, a enormous cannon is recovered by Spanish fighters (led by Sinatra) and with the assistance of a British officer (Grant) and is pulled hundreds of miles to breach the walls of a city held by French forces.

Setting the violin aside, she created an entire technique and approach to the instrument that was wholly unique.  She showed that it was truly possible for it to be something other than a sound effect machine for Hollywood.  By performing the classical repertoire upon it, she showed what was truly possible with this magical instrument.

But for what the members of Velvet Revolver excel at, "Contraband" has few equals. "Headspace" and "Big Machine" make glam rock relevant in the new century, as well as having fab solos. "Slither" is the kind of Heavy Metal that Audioslave promised but never delivered. "Loving The Alien" even cops to Bowie. I really hope that the elements that comprise Velvet Revolver can hold their stability long enough to make a second album that ups the quality of the lyrics and can also resist the temptation to play the compromise card.
I'm not a fan of "Life in the Fast Lane". It's an alright song, though. The songs on the album that weren't as popular as the ones I mention above are actually better. Seriously!  "The Last Resort" is possibly the prettiest song I've ever heard the band do. Still, "Victim of Love" is my favorite song. I really like the riffs, vocals, and lyrics.

Nancy's vocals are tops and her performance commendable (she was  nominated for a Golden Globe) as she sings and swings through such classics  as "Sugar Town," "Up, Up and Away," "Some Velvet  Morning," "Jackson" (both with Lee Hazlewood), "What'd  I Say" (with Sammy Davis, Jr.) and "Things" (with Dean  Martin).

All of this set the scene for the growing numbers of bands who turned to the blues particularly electric blues. The roles of John Mayall and Alexis Korner as conduits in this process is inestimable. Mayall in particular nurtured a number of young blues guitarists who later went on to achieve artistic and commercial success one of whom was Eric Clapton.
How they can sing so well as alcoholics. It is amazing.

They've messed with a few different sounds over the years, from near-pop to hard rock, but this, their first release, is 100% pure southern-fried-stompin' good. Not only are they one of the best Christian bands in circulation; they're one of the best southern-rock bands I've ever heard. There isn't a song on this album I'd dare to skip. Not only that; as with all of their other songs, there's enlightenment and storytelling savoir-faire from start to finish. There's a lesson in each song, as Mac Powell waxes poetic about the lengths one would go to for pure love ('Just To Be with You') and the crucifixion (from one of the thieves' point of view...very stirring) ('Who Is This Man'). Third Day also takes a jab at secular music (namely, the Black Crowes) on 'Black Bird', one of my personal faves. They even take it up a notch and sprinkle the song with titles from early Black Crowes tunes. Clev-ver! The true southern-fried grit is in their straight-up praise songs; it always has been. The last track is the best example, with easy lyrics to pick up and sing along with, and it's one of the most memorable on any of their albums (mostly because of the happily jingling instruments in the background).

Band 11: Maria Callas & Tito Gobbi -1964 (4:45) - Duet and "Vissi d'arte". Callas and Gobbi are inimitable. Stunningly intense performance, with her usual problems in upper range. One hears such singing, and what can one say but "Callas"?
This is a 2011 EMI package.  Unfortunately I think Amazon just puts all reviews for "City to City" on one page regardless of edition or bonus features, which is a pity.  Plus their system makes it hard to find different editions readily.  To find this edition just search the upc, and see that the pictured art says '2 CD Collector's Edition'.  Clearly the one to get if you're in the market for this great album.  Also check out "Can I Have My Money Back" for more Rafferty excellence, albeit in earlier form (26 tracks early Rafferty + Humblebums - a personal favorite).

But as I said I'm not the normal Zappa fan. After hearing these two albums, I've thirsted to listen their like from Zappa - but always been disappointed - a few of his other albums that I bought - We're only in it for the money, Hot Rats, Shiek Yerbouti - I've not listened to them again after the initial playing. Some have told me that these actually are the quintessential Zappa albums and not Apostrophe/Overnite Sensation which are just Zappa's experimentations with Pop - maybe - but for me these two will always remain among the best albums I've heard.
2836	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I caught this concert on TV a few years back when it first was on. I enjoyed The Mac's music for years, but never saw them perform. I was floored. The whole show was magical, I felt entranced. THIS is true musicianship. Even after all the years, all the semi-private bickering that is so legendary with Fleetwood Mac, they all seem so happy to be there on that stage together performing all their old hits together again. Of course onstage, the chemistry between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks takes center stage, and when one or the other is singing a song you know is directed a the other, you can almost see the sparks fly. I gained a whole new appreciation for Lindsey Buckingham as a musician after seeing this show. What a guitar player! It's obvious Stevie Nicks has lost alot of her vocal range over the years, but she has lost none of her on-stage magic. What presence. Christine McVie still sings like a songbird, and brings her own unique presence to the stage. The absolute highlight of the entire show is the performance of "Silver Springs". This song clearly shows the attraction-push of the Buckingham-Nicks collaboration. The performance is amazing. The overall sound and picture quality is exceptional. This has to be one of the best concert DVDs I've ever seen. Please add this to your list of must-have music discs, you will NOT be disappointed.

With producer extrodinaire Nick Lowe again manning the board, Mr. Costello spewed forth venomous songs based around his recent divorce.  "I Hope You're Happy Now" sums up the overall tone of the album.  "Tokyo Storm Warning" is a blistering extended jam, while "Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?" is a frenetically paced rocker that harkened back to the band's late 70's sound.  "I Want You" is a song that conveys Mr. Costello's longing for his lost relationship. Despite the overall angry tone, the album closes with "Next Time Round" which shows a more wizened man that will learn from his mistakes.
It's incredible that so many huge hits and incredible singles could have been on one album. Looking back twenty years later, at least five or six of these songs still receive constant radio rotation and are remembered as classic rock singles. But "Born in the USA" is more than just a rock n' roll monster, it's an inspired take on American life and the way people live. This album is simply a must have for anyone.

The title track, mistakenly taken by many Americans as a sign of patriotism, was in actuality a song about an American who gets shipped to fight the "yellow man" against his will. "I'm on Fire" sounds like it belongs more on his older albums than on this one, with it's more midwestern sound. The guitar licks are perfect. "Cover Me", "Dancing in the Dark", and "Glory Days" are fun rock songs that are easy to dance to. "My Hometown" is an introspective number one hit about the past, present and future.

7404	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Midnight Marauders is the followup to A Tribe Called Quest's hip-hop masterpiece The Low End Theory. Rather than playing it safe and making another mostly upbeat release, Midnight Marauders takes the act in a darker direction with more emphasis on bass lines and jazz horns. Q-Tip and Phife Dawg continue to trade lines flawlessly on the excellent tracks "Electric Relaxation", "Steve Biko (Stir It Up)", and "Award Tour." Deep funky bass lines are upfront with the rhymes on "Sucka Nigga", "Keep It Rollin'", and "Oh My God" which features Busta Rhymes. Although "Oh My God" doesn't hit as hard as "Scenario", their previous collaboration with Busta, it's still a strong track. Even when the duo decides to go solo as Phife and Q-Tip do on the brooding "8 Million Stories" and "Midnight" respectively, the results are just as impressive. Other great tracks include "Clap Your Hands", "Lyrics To Go", and "God Lives Through." Their raps continue to be among the best in the genre. I mean who else, except maybe the Beastie Boys, could include people from completely different walks of life such as Mr. Belvedere, Robert DeNiro, Vinny Testaverde, and Rollo Lawson in their rhymes? Although there is extensive sampling used throughout, it's from mostly obscure tracks that only a die-hard old school R&B fan would pick up on. This is a refreshing change from other popular rappers at the time, most notably rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, where all you have to do is pick up a best of Parliament album to see where they got their ideas. All told, while this isn't an all out classic like The Low End Theory, it's still a great album that should be a part of every hip-hop fan's collection. Highly recommended.

What's amazing is that it gets even better the more you listen to it!  Da Le (the opening track) is my favorite.  Talk  about classic Santana.

At the time this disc came out, I'm not really sure you could have compared it to anything else going on.  While the band NOW wears its King Crimson influence on its sleeve, back when Opiate and Undertow ruled the world... I think you hear more of Henry Rollins' angry social awareness (maybe just a little more cynical than Rollins) and Jimmy Plant more than anything else on this disc, but Zeppelin was never this angry at anything in their lives.


Ram is just plain fun, a kind of fun we don't get in music rarely anymore.  It rocks from the get-go with Too Many People.  Three Legs has a hidden sexual agenda that is so simple it'll plum evade you.  Ram On and Dear Boy provide a pretty and, some would say, insightful nature to Paul and Linda.  Uncle Albert is well, it's just about Paul's best song ever recorded.  It is so Beatles you can't help but believe it would have been on the next Beatle album as an opener or closer.  Smile Away is just plain rock-on fun, silly lyrics and all, with one terrific blues riff.  Heart Of The Country is so homey it's almost southern comfort.  Monkberry Moon Delight was as shady as we got in high school and college in those days, yeah, we'd hide anywhere we could to suck on some Monkberry sticks.  This song hearkens back even now to good old rollicking, carefree days of stash, trash, and pure hash.  Eat At Home and Long Haired Lady were the songs that caused giggles and laughs, they were so humorously sexy it was pathetic, and we loved them all up.  They were the musical equivalents of Mel Brooks movie lines ("What Knockers!  Oh, Thank you Doctor!")  You couldn't help but laugh at THIS kind of innuendo.  Some might call this album "dated" because of this kind of stuff, but if you just abandon all pretenses, and aim at having a good time with your music, and want to not have to think too hard (see Dylan, Modern Times if you want to spend the next 5 years trying to figure out "what does it mean?") about your music, this is the album for you.  Ram On reprises before the end song/suite, and as it fades out look for an impromptu early take on Big Barn Bed (which would show up on Red Rose Speedway) before Back Seat Of My Car gives us the usual McCartney Finale, strings horns and all.  It's another heavily orchestrated but lyrically spot-on McCartney sub-classic, and a perfect ending to the album (unless you purchase the McCartney Collector Series version CD which bonuses the record with the hit single Another Day and it's B-side Oh Woman Oh Why, definitely worth having if you do not have one of the Wings "best" albums, even though they are not technically "Wings" since they were recorded during the Ram sessions and should be credited as Paul & Linda McCartney).

The production quality on this album isn't bad, since all the vocals, guitars, bass, and drums come in rather clear.  However, like with all music, good sound quality can't save lousy music.

Now, if you've never heard of any of Hicks' material, you're probably saying to yourself, "Isn't that what ALL of the comedians talk about?  He sounds exactly the same."  WRONG!  It's all about his approach.  He talks about these issues, but he tackles them in a very smart and clever way.  He's subtle...and yet he can turn vicious at the same time.  He uses strong language, but it fits with his style and material.

824	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Before I start my review let me address a few issues - one other reviewer noted that the CD has copy protection and he was unable to copy tracks to his MP3 player, so he returned the CD. First of all, this is a pretty dishonest reason to return a working CD to a store. Second of all, if you weren't in such a rush to download it to MP3 you would have noticed that the CD has an autostart program that, once loaded, lets you rip the tracks as read-only to your hard drive - you can then copy these tracks to your MP3 player. First thing I did after bringing the CD home was pop it in my computer, rip the tracks to the hard drive, plug in my MP3 player and transfer them. They show up on the MP3 player (my Rio Nitrus) with all details - album, band, artist, and the music transfer is identical to the CD's quality.
Love the message on the screen at the end of Papa Don't Preach (SAFE SEX)...and the wild dress she wears, complete with fuzzy dice and a small baby doll attached, in the Dress You Up/Material Girl/Like a Virgin medley.  Also liked the gun sound effects in White Heat.
In fact, Godowsky was rather faithful to Chopin's originals in most cases. However, his re-workings often involve a thicking of the textures, the addition of intricate and often amusing counter-points, inversion of figurations, and a re-distribution of the melodic strands between the hands. In particular, those Studies written for the left hand alone (numbering 22 in all) can be regarded as landmarks for keyboard composition for a single hand, and listeners will be amazed by the sonorities and possibilities that can be achieved by one hand alone. One has to hear to believe!
The only song on this album I'd say is promising is "Third Eye."  In fact, I'd say that for the most part, it shows that when pressed, Tool's rhythm section can come up with dynamic, interesting music (especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes).  However, it gets ruined with Maynard's lousy vocalwork, especially when he screams out "Prying open my third eye!!".

Such is the case for this recording of Gustav Mahler's 'Das Lied von der Erde' with the superlative Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.  He draws some of the most beautiful playing from this ensemble heard on recordings.  Electing to use the original thought of Mahler in employing the contralto voice with the tenor voice, Boulez has wisely chosen Violeta Urmana who in 2001 was a true contralto/mezzo, and the brightly ardent tenor Michael Schade.  Both singers understand the poetry and can deliver the texts with all of the range of emotions Mahler explored.
I agree that the superstars here help make this show as good as it is by supporting Roy as part of the backing band instead of trying to steal the spotlight away from him.  It is cool to see Springsteen step outside of his usual style in this show and adapt himself to Orbison's sound with his solid rockabilly guitar licks and great backing vocals. Bruce once said that he always wanted to sing like Roy Orbison in his early days, and his harmony singing in this show sounds a lot like Roy!

6. The ENTIRETY of "Victim of Love." On the runoff track of the original pressing of the album, the careful eye could find this message: "V.O.L. is five-piece live," meaning there were no studio overdubs. The performance of the song was spot-on and crackled with energy.

Zappa had the idea of a ten album set of leftover material from this early and innovative version of the Mothers, but he backed down (that would have probably been too much, and probably would have included too much stuff not worth hearing if that was the case). At this point, guitarist Lowell George and bassist Roy Estrada had hopped ship with Little Feat, while Bunk Gardner and Jimmy Carl Black formed Geronimo Black. Zappa released a solo album, Hot Rats, highly rated by many who weren't too keen on his twisted sense of humor (as it only had one vocal track, courtesy of Captain Beefheart), as it emphasized his guitar playing.
The biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.
Judging by the sales of the record (a quarter million upon release in June I heard), it seems a _lot_ of people have been waiting for something like this to come around. Maybe, just maybe, this will spark more interest in the hard rock influence of the '80s/early '90s...before grunge took over and destroyed it. Highly, highly recommended - just remember when you're listening that first impressions aren't always permanent ones!

"Son of Orange County" has a wonderful (though VERY dated) vocal melody.  It's the kind of vocals that you'd *only* hear from a song created in the early 70's.  The music scene was beginning to change rapidly soon after this album was recorded/released.  I personally love it to pieces.  Of course Zappa's probably mocking that particular style here, but either way, it's memorable.  GREAT guitar solo too.  Haven't said THAT a whole lot during this review, but *this* guitar solo definitely blows me to pieces.

The only song I remembered was "She's got that vibe" from this album, but the rest of the songs sound very "Teddy Riley & Guy" sounding.  By no means does this mean a bad thing-I am a huge fan of Guy too.  It just means that R. Kelly's true talent & sound had not come into play yet.  It's a good start to a performer that would really shine through the '90s and be a trend setter in the world of R&B music.
Back to Hotel California. I think "The Last Resort" is a great closer, but Henley almost ruins it by getting preachy in the final verse. I said almost. It's still a great song, even though you know it was written by a smug millionaire rock star (sorry Don, at least I didn't call you a hypocrite or a - gasp - liberal, and actually "smug" may be unfair).
Also, the song "Take it Back" which was left off of the PULSE album is included on the PULSE film.

5152	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Okay, so I'm fan of Petra's -maybe not the stuff from the 70's or early 80's but I did seek this album out. "On Fire" was released in 1988 -and man, let me tell ya: it rocks!
This edition of "Ram" (named after Paul's psuedonym, "Ramon") contains four excellent tracks, "Too Many People," "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey," "Heart of the Country," and the aforementioned bonus track "Another Day," and one absolute classic track, "Back Seat of my Car" which was also released as a single in the UK.  ("Back Seat" was the last track on the original album in an era when artists often placed the very best album track last.)  All of the aforementioned tracks also appear on Paul's 2001 greatest hits collection Wingspan.
So, is it any good?  Absolutely.  I actually have a degree in American Studies, believe it or not.  This is a work that nails the American 20th century in all of its complexity and absurdity.  I think it's at least the equal of many of the finest novels of the period and in many ways their superior.  It's amusing, poignant, and in some ways tragic, and it's packed with some of the most intricate wordplay ever devised with your mind in mind.
2. "Fever" (9/10)
1478	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	the quality is superb and sound is great this is by far the best out there

It became a Grammy winning sensation which can be enjoyed by all ages and from all walks of life.
This recording influenced me to go on and discover the HMR's in more detail - both their great early 60's "1&2", as well as their more recent "Too Much Fun" and "I Make a Wish for a Potato" - but it actually is more a mix of non-HMR artists Fredericks/Clamtones (5/13 songs), Hurley (4/13) and 3 songs being a collaboration of them all (only one HMR's Stampfel penned song here -"Country Bump", although he adds his vocal and/or fiddle mark to six songs in all). Anyways, the main point is this isn't really a HMR album (Steve Weber isn't even on it!) - but it is full of that kind of "acid folk" sensibility (mostly expressed through Stampfel's scratchy fiddling and squawking vocals, as well as Hurley's and Fredericks' laid back, back porch playful informality).

Bottom Line: Grab this now. If you want to become an Eagles fan, by all means, start here.
I have returned to say more about this recording.  David seems very loose and ready to play.  Seeing the special items in the DVD such as him and his backup singers in the studio/boat Astoria going over vocal arrangements and seeing his deft gentle hand in instructing them is really an added treat that was totally unexpected... most extras are cold and boring or just plain stupid, but this addition to the mix was fantastic.
The standout tracks on this joint include "Oh my  God," "Electric Relaxation" and "Sucka  N***a."
Great to have  them back!
Flexibility and diversity are present as he brings the belting down to a whisper to blend in with Jobim's soft bossa-ballads as well as bossa nova treatments of Cole Porter's "I Concentrate On You" and Berlin's "Change Partners". Ten minutes of magic here.

It has taken me this long to really listen to the whole CD, and step back and take an objective look at the tracks.  The thing is, I quickly fell in love with 4 or 5 of the songs.  Every time I listened to the CD I became bored with the other songs, skipped ahead to my favorites, and just never seemed to get around to listening (really listening) to the others.

Band 13: Kirsten Flagstad - 1938 (3:15) - A segment from the movie "The Big Broadcast". Introduced by Bob Hope. Another glorious vocal performance in a bizarre setting. The setting appears to be a cocktail lounge or club; an audience (obvious Hollywood extras) is seated at tables in white dinner jackets and evening gowns. There is a smallish (for Wagner) orchestra sawing away. The curtain opens on the very round, 43 year old Flagstad, in full valkyrie regalia, standing on a paper-mach rock, waving a short spear around while trying not to fall off the rock. But, you are not likely to ever hear "Hojotoho" sung better - or by a richer, more beautiful voice.
9831	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Growing tired of phony California, deadened personal problems and cocaine addiction, David Bowie left for Europe in 1977. His first album after relocating to Berlin, Low, breaths with frustration like no other record in rock's vernacular. Bowie realized the overrating of words to express grief and lets the fluid, mutated synthpop vent. He certainly chooses the right cohort for the project. Sonic experimenter extraordinaire, Brian Eno acts as keyboardist and general co-creator of Low. Eno adds his mark of gorgeous, multi-dimensional, electronic glazing to Bowie's project. The first side of Low consists of short, simple, cryptic pop songs, themed around depression and dysfunction. Through a series of one and a half to three minute disheartened pop songs, Bowie gets the point across very clearly and very radiantly that he has been tattered out of breath. The side ends in a truly extraordinary manner. The solemn sound erupts spontaneously into an urgent decree on the raucous "Be My Wife," which is followed by "A New Career in a New Town," an amazing harmonica-led rain-on-your-face-at-the-end-of-a-hard-day instrumental. Low's second side features four Eno-ish, expansive instrumentals. Their cold, murky and mechanized sound is enhanced in multitudes by Bowie's shrilling, therapeutic chants. Bowie was a different man in 1977, a thirty year old who had been building his own life long enough to become entangled in it. As always, the music reflects his growth. Low is an album that echoes Bowie's frame of mind more brilliantly than any of his others.

Track 9: (3:24) A rather quiet tune. Mostly strings and flute, but this track too grows into a very lovely, meaningful tune.
As a bass player, I have always admired Bruce Thomas, and if you listen to the mix on "Get Happy" you'll notice that Nick Lowe was equally impressed. This is one bottom-heavy recording and I don't think it's just for drive or to fill out an otherwise lean quartet sound. Nearly every song relies heavily on the hooks and counterpoint found in Bruce's parts. Considering E.C.'s liner notes explaining how they went about arranging and recording songs, I get the impression everybody pretty much wrote their own part most of the time. It's obvious, then, that Elvis owes much to Bruce and the others.

1819	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The film it self is interesting and not very well done to normal standards, but who said David Bowie was normal anyways. He is quite odd and his music is a breakthrough in rock and roll music, because he has his own unique style that inspired many, including Roxy Music, Talking Heads, Alice Cooper, Elton John, Nine Inch Nails and even Marylin Manson and much more. This live concert is pure rock and roll and it rocks the house all night long, I was more in it for the music after I knew what I was in for. Its also great for background music while doing other things, like any other live concert video is for, because even I can't sit there watching the crowd flicker for over an hour like watching a good movie, so I just sit back and enjoy the music, because thats what its all about, the music! David Bowie rocks live and the Spiders were spectacular. This was their last performance together and it is very moving to watch the end and the crowds reaction when he says this is their last show. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars might have left, but Bowie still remains till this day. Great concert dvd from a even more great artist!!

Of the extras  the 'El Pea' version of "Late November" is superb - but the Ernest Tubb cover with its rollicking countrified brass baffles the ear even now. Far better is "Losing Game"  a guitar and horns rocker that would have livened up the duller parts of the album. And her "...it's too fast..." intro to the alternate "Next Time Around" precedes a genuinely interesting alternate version...sans strings - it amplifies the lovely Acoustic guitar and is a Bonus Track actually worth of the moniker.

3356	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Well....despite some of the other reviewers' less than positive "reviews," I'd much - MUCH rather own and enjoy a DVD of THIS incarnation of the Bros than that one with the Molly Hatchet-reject and that kid.  There is it:  DEAL with it.  "Dangerous" Dan Toler kicked Dickey's [...] onto a MUCH higher plane of guitar-virtuosity than any of the other..."children" who had the temerity to fill his shoes in any subsequent Bros lineups.  And true, the absolutely-irreplaceable Jaimoe was not with the Bros this time out, but the two musicians the Bros had aboard - David "Frankie" Toler, Dangerous Dan's brother, did as well as any other drummer could've, considering whose place he was taking, and (must run in the family genes), regardless, he's a damn FINE drummer.  And the other keyboardist, Nashvilleian Mike Lawler, for my money, displayed chops infinitely superior to his "predecessor," that guy who's currently pulling all the goofy faces while "playing keyboards" for the Stones. No, true, this is not the quality of musicianship that the Duane and Berry offered, but I don't think either of them would have objected.  All the songs hereon are played respectfully, but my favorite moments are 1) the "unplugged" motel room jam, where Dickey "hambones" while Lawler - Lawler, now! - plays acoustic guitar; 2) the Gregg-Dickey-Dan "Melissa" jam, where my allegation that Dangerous Dan absolutely drove Dickey, almost as as (gasp!) Duane did!; 3!!!) Gregg's breathtakingly transendant acoustic guitar solo version of "Come And Go Blues," which, for MY money, is preferable to the "Brothers & Sisters" version, but then, they're two separate entities; and, 4) electric again, when Dickey does that "wee-wee-diddly-diddly/STOP" riff before the Bros crank into "One Way Out."  Yes, again, despite all the nay-sayers' "reviews," this is a fine, fine glimpse at the Bros before general ennui did then in again in the mid-eighties (but then, the Stones almost ground to a halt right about then, too...damn "new wave...")  This DVD is most definitely worth seeking out on the 'bay or elsewhere.  OH, and btw, the then Bros' bassist, David "Rook" Goldflies more than adequately fulfilled his role - just listen to the dynamics he displayed on "Whippin' Post!" - but a much, MUCH "younger woman" of my "close acquaintance" assures me that "Oh, he'd've had NO trouble pulling groupies," either...

Summary: If you're a Pink Floyd purist, there's a big chance you will be disappointed at the songs' renditions, but if your main interest is a really impressive show with great performers on stage, get this now. There's nothing bigger than this.

"Littie House I Used To Live In" is a long suite that starts with panio improvosations before diving into a full-fledged MOI workout that contains rock and avant-gaurde elements. At eighteen minutes, forget the sandwich; this is a banquit in itself.
Red Money is actually Bowie's version of the song Sister Midnight originally released by Iggy Pop, along with Bowie's later super-hit China Girl which they both wrote and produced.  Kind of a weak track, it just sort of sits at the end of the album, with little of the general feel of Lodger.  It's a great song, but to me feels rather out of place.

I only bring this up because *SO* many people have been complaining that they couldn't copy tracks here. Instead of exiting the autolaunch program when it pops up, try reading first! It's that simple.
The rest of the video has some rewarding moments, however. The Who deliver an inspired version of their mini-opera, "A Quick One", which is the major highlight of this video. Lennon's "Yer Blues" with Clapton is also notable, until it segues into Yoko's howling.
Literally.

The CD is well orchestrated, engineered, and arranged so that waves of music rise and fall like the tide. You can hear the waves breaking onto the shore, gulls calling in the foggy air, and the rich timbers of brass, wind, and strings fill the room.
The Encore section is where they show you what they're made of. Original band member Don Preston joins the current band onstage for a blistering "Lonesome Electric Turkey," a workout on the moog synthesizer with the band just tearing it up in the background. They shape this into "Peaches En Regalia" from Zappa's "Hot Rats" record, and they play it well. The disc closes with "Tears Began To Fall," and there's a side of me that believes there is a slower, quieter version of this out there, somewhere. It's that kind of song, but the band has fun with it through the fade out.

Now, I must admit that I'm a Waters fan.  I was a fan of Gilmour until Floyd broke up.  Then I kind of lost all my respect for him as a person (he thinks Pink Floyd was rubbish!) and I can't stand his solo material (as well as Division Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason), but I do consider him one of the greatest guitarists of all time and "Comfortably Numb" didn't just suffer from Van Morrison's performance, but from the lack of David Gilmour.  What I would have loved to see him play off of Snowy White.  And only David can sing that chorus correctly.

If you have a player that will play it back, the HDAD version of this disc is definitely the way to go. No, it isn't a 5.1 mix, it's stereo, but the increase in sound quality is noticeable -- Townshend's acoustic guitars sound crisper, for one thing. Unfortunately, audiophiles have snapped up all the copies available, so you'd have to buy from a third-party seller, but if you can get a used one for $50 or $60, my opinion is it's still money well-spent.
I do indeed like "Two Against Nature."  I  give it my "thumbs up;"  I congradulate its makers; I see that  like their songs, Steely Dan can reinvent itself with style;  and keep in  mind, this is 2000, not 1977.  Yes, it is Almost Gothic in a natural  way...and I like it like that!

Cd mastering was coming into it's own around the time of this release and this album is no exception. It gives GRP a forum to show off its ability to remaster its back catalog and a glimpse of future releases. "The Collection" was actually a series done to anthologize GRP artists. Other entries in this series includes Dave Grusin, The Yellowjackets, and New York Voices.
Her design of the stages is her imagination come alive, and through that, she gives a lot of herself to her audience.  I know she did to me.  Next stop, the moon, La Luna, that is.
I know R. Kelly has made some bad personal decisions in recent years, but that does not change the fact that Born Into the 90's is a great album.  I might also add that you won't find any sexually explicit lyrics on this breakout album of 1992.  I don't think these eleven tracks have lost much of anything over the years, but admittedly I'm not really up to date on the current hip hop scene.  On a trivial note, I must mention the fact that the liner notes of this album feature the tiniest printed lyrics I have ever seen; they are there, but I don't see how anyone could possibly ever read them without the aid of a powerful microscope.
This is tight, taunt, latin funk--and I empahsize the word funk. By the time Cymande emerged in 1972, Santana was already into long fussion jams. This music is nothing like that. Some of the solos are long, but only when they fit. Cymande sets a tight, funky groove that always has a compelling rhythmic edge, and mine it for all it is worth. There is absolutely no fat on this music. The playing is excellent. A lot of little insertions happen in these ecconomical little grooves, and you hear more each time you play the album.


"I'm Crying" (1964).  This is lively music, taken at the quick pace by the band.  Burdon's raw blues voice is distinct and powerful. The recurring line:

"You're the Biggest Thing Since Powdered Milk" opens with a quality drum solo for a couple minutes until a sludgy guitar riff comes in.  It's pretty catchy too.  I like how the lead singer almost cries on a couple occasions, or at least it sounds that way based on his hoarse tender voice and the lyrics about being hurt by a woman.  Really groovy verse melody and catchy guitar solo.  What the?  Then the band has to show how innovative they are with that bouncy bass line, a trademark of 80's metal.  Then the pace speeds up with a new verse melody.  I really feel a connection with the lead singers bluesy style during lines such as "What kind of a woman will ruin my soul, what kind of woman would take me whole".  A slight Robert Plant resemblance in the "Woman!!" chant at the end.  Seriously I think Budgie's downright *awesome*.

During that first experience, my world stopped; I was in suspended animation, so enthralled I was by this gorgeous and talented creature. After learning more about her -- that she is in fact a world renowned crossover theatrical performer -- I felt like the last to know. But, as they say, better late than never, and I cannot convey the emotion Sarah elicits with her stellar vocals and ethereal presence. Since that first accidental viewing, I've been under her spell; I have become a slave to that voice, that face, those beguiling facial expressions. It's no wonder she is referred to as "The Angel of Music": everything about her performance conjures the image of some diaphanous being whose spiritual energies are all but spent maintaining a bridge between heaven and earth.

A must for any who has seen them live or owned the CD / VHS.  I missed the concert so this is the next best thing - but play it on a big screen, the bigger the better.
As good as the individual Eagles are as lead vocalists, they seem to be even better as background singers. In fact, when I think of the "classic" Eagles vocal sound, I think of their background harmonies, whether it's Meisner's soaring high-harmony or Henley and Frey's vocal blend, which seems to take on a separate voice all its own (for a great example of this on a non-Eagles track, listen to Dan Fogelberg's "Someone's Been Telling You Stories").
And that weird sound you keep hearing?  That's what changing the channels sounded like before there were remotes.

- regarding the DVD vs. blu-ray debate, I bought the DVD after reading more than one comment that the Blu-ray is not high-def, just upscaled to 16:9 aspect, thereby losing video content and resolution.  Also, the BD audio is not much improved over the DVD, if at all (both DTS?).
5276	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Let me begin by saying that I am not a huge fan of rap.  However, Twista  is BY FAR my favorite rapper.  When I first heard the song  "Emotions" in my friends car, I said "Holy Sh! t that guy can  rap."  I immediately bought the cd, and was not disappointed in the  least.  Every, that is EVERY song is excellent.  My favorites include  "Death Before Dishonor", "Unsolved Mysteries", and the  "Emotions" remix.  Not only are these some of the tightest tracks  musically, but Twista is without comparison the best rapper I've ever  heard.  He can sing, talk, rap, and yell faster than anyone else, and still  enunciate clearly.  And he varies his vocals.  If you like rap at all, you  must own this album.
I also do not think that LagWagon sounds terribly similar to NOFX. I own just about every NOFX album made, and none of the songs on this CD sound a bit like anything from NOFX. LagWagon has a very unique sound, and this album is a perfect example of what exactly it is. You won't stop listening to it once you get it; it never gets old. Just buy it.

I digitally captured my VHS for eternity when the tape was still pristine, with amazing results. Lucky -for those who are unfamiliar to him- is one of those reggae underdogs you either love or hate.

9482	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Elvis has long admitted to being a Beatles fan, of course (going as far as calling them the greatest band ever in Rolling Stone). And this is the closest he got to embracing the Fab Four's occasional dipping into "classical rock" (that is, rock influenced by classical music - I'm not trying to invent a new phrase for "classic rock"). The result is an odd, but mostly satisfying effort. I say "mostly" because sometimes he goes totally overboard in places, making You Little Fool, Town Cryer, Pidgin English and ...And Every Home sound treacly, overloading them with harpsichord, strings, Baroque piano, flutes, clarinets, bassoons, lutes, hautboys, kazoos...

Because it has the feel of a post-Beatles collection of Beatles songs, I don't find this version of Ram with "Another Day" and "Oh Woman, Oh Why" added as bonus tracks in any way distracting.

Get a single disc player quickly. Then buy the House Of Yes dvd again and enjoy this most awesome Live YES DVD, The best one so far. It holds a special place for me because I was there and am seen in several video captures of the audience, as well as my rowdy cheers, which is really cool. Sorry to those of you who don't like the sound of audience excitement on cd's and dvd's, but it's a LIVE show for crying out loud, and i must say i do like to hear the excitement of enthusiastic fans on Live discs. Anyway that aside, The Concert Club they performed in is beautiful as Jon Anderson states in the show and has that Renaissance style theater feel. It is One of the coolest concert venues in Las Vegas. The camera work is great and The 5.1 surround sound mix is completely awesome. A must have for all YES fans. And I think many others agree as well. Again, For those of you having problems with the disc, Buy a new DVD player. Mine plays perfectly fine and It's the second one i've bought, because my first copy, which i bought the day it was released back in 2000 was stolen by some ungrateful thief. Just buy it there is nothing wrong with the discs and enjoy the awesome concert that is The House Of YES. Now if we can get YES to make a Live dvd of the entire "DRAMA" cd, that would be a most excellent treat, even though Jon Anderson doesn't sing on that album, it would be nice to hear his interpretation of those most excellent YES tunes that we never get to hear Live.

'Time after time' a remake of an 80's tune by ? is just fabulous.  At first I thought 'you gotta be kidding me'.  But after hearing it a few times I was hooked.  Delivered with so much feeling and power it's incredible.  Infectious beats and oh so smooth.
The Last Night: Slightly lighter and slower than Rebirthing, but much in the same vain. Female vocals are a little more dominant on this one, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
The familiarity and quality of the song selections depends on how closely one has followed the band.  I'd say they hit most of the winners here, touched on a few obscurities to the delight of the more hardcore ..... I'd say they could have gotten away with more of the latter: this being their final bow-out, a three tape set would not have been too long.  Overall, this collection is a flawless legacy to an American musical treasure, another one of those that will endure and be rediscovered again and again, because REAL music, regardless of genre trappings, is TIMELESS.  The fact that this concert was filmed as opposed to merely taped does it proper honor, and the overall production ranks with works like "The Last Waltz" and "Stop Making Sense".  "Farewell" is a concert, a documentary, a shared event, a transcendent video treasure.

9534	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	(This review is based upon the  original 2-track album.) Of the three avante-gard albums  that John and Yoko issued from '68-'69, this final one is by far the best one. I'm not saying it's GOOD, mind  you, but it's at least BETTER. Here I can at least get what they are going for. 'John and Yoko' is an endless 20-something minute piece in which the couple  apparently try to recite each  other's first names in every possible emotional context. You know, anger, sadness, lust,  happiness, etc. Thats what I take from it anyway. And although it is interminable, there is art here in a very bizarre fashion. Besides being pretty funny, it's not offensive in the proper sense of the word. So...it's...OK. 'Amsterdam' basically consists of snippets of interviews. Yoko may seem to get too much time, but it hardly matters, as John's  pronouncements don't seem  particularly profound either. I mean, there's not much to be  learned, especially today, from putting a bag over yourself. So even when the couple says  something that could possibly be taken offensively, it all comes back to bagism and the bed-in to put it all into perspective; ie, there wasn't any. Not really. But it is interesting to hear, at least once or twice. Very much a document of John's life at the time.  So where does this album lead us? I haven't the foggiest idea. But I can listen to it and get a kick out of it, which is far more than  I can say for "Two Virgins" or "Life With The Lions". So, I'd say this wretched thing is the  best of the trio.  For Lennon/Beatles fanatics only. Yeah yeah yeah, I am one.

The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock.  Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This  smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity.  If the phrase, "So bad it's good," is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy.  (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)

1075	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Listening to Shatner's new CD "Has Been" made me go back and re-appraise "Transformed Man." Unlike "Has Been", this CD is totally over-the-top, and borderline maniacal. I have loved Shatner's singing for all the wrong reasons ever since I first heard him on the "Golden Throats" CD. Here we get to savor those tracks "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" and "Mr. Tambourine Man" (I particularly love the last screamed line of "Mr. Tambourine Man"), but I think the best part of this CD are the Shakespeare monologues and especially the bizarre and brazenly hammy "Spleen" in which Bill rants about various issues confronting his "bent skull" at sidesplitting length.
" Almost Gothic" and " Negative Girl" are both studies in how to become obsessed with obsession. Each portrait is of a female who is bewitching and dangerous. " Cousin Dupree" is so much fun it practically jumps off the disc. This one swings with a withering take on southern mores. " West of Hollywood" contains an extended instrumental exit, but the musicianship makes it welcome.

3493	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	With the help of artists like Everlast, Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas of  Matchbox 20, and Sting, Carlos Santana rises to the top once again.  This  time he is reaching out to a bigger audience.  The First single, with  Everlast, Put Your Lights On, is a mixture of a typical Everlast ballad,  added in with some extra guitar punch.  The song title is decidedly  gigglesome, but with all seriousness it still stands.  Carlos is leaping  into the humungous world of modern rock with a breezy style, and one weird  sasparillo.  He proves that Tejano-latin music and Bueno Como Va weren't  his only stops on the musical train ride.  He lets big name artists sing  away, while he stuns the world yet again with his amazing guitar skills.  Carlos has an itch that he wants you to rub for him and it's a big one all  right.  The second single, Smooth with Rob Thomas is somewhere close to a  funky-love song that invites the crowd in a diner to get their groove on as  they please on the many blique table top surfaces, as a happy couple keeps  the marriage alive and kicking via champagne and a lot of lovemaking.  "You've got the kind of loving that can be so smooth.  Give me your heart  make it real or else forget about it."  On track 6 with Lauryn Hill, the  boundary is set but then broken once more only to find the neighborhood  bully back for another round of vodka and a good round of whooping up on  the small folk.  Carlos does not let his guitar playing or the funky beats  overpower the gleaming vocals that shine up like a new penny.  He  synchronizes everything in such a manner, that it would be hard to call  this album a "fluke."  Even the faintest of rock fans will enjoy the  mandible duets that insert themselves in this Grammy award machine.  Now  the question that surfaces is, is Santana trying to save rock music or is  he just inserting another new style into his wave of complexity and  dexterity?  I don't think that question will be answered soon enough for  anyone to care.  The only thing you'll have to worry about is driving  safely under the influence of such "supernatural" beats as these.

Right away, the sound quality becomes an obvious issue. It's got a low fidelity, like it was recorded on cheap equipment, and it probably was. It opens with a reworked "Little House I used To Live In," but the melody isn't recognizable until about halfway into it. No disrespect to this phase of the band, but the original release is far superior. This segues into "The Mud Shark." A simple vamp with Zappa telling a story of Don Preston's meeting with the members of another band, The Vanilla Fudge, and what was done with some mud sharks that were caught while fishing from a window in the Edgewater Inn.
9913	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	At the time, that is in 1977, rumors started circulating about Frank Zappa having had recorded a four record set on the magnitude and scope of `Uncle  Meat' to be released on his own newly formed record label, Zappa Records.  The rumors were true and you probably know that because of a contractual  snafu with Warner Brothers/Reprise he lost the rights to the material in a  lawsuit.  The material from that album, which was to have been called  'Lather', was repackaged by WBR into the four albums; Live in New York,  Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt, and  Orchestral Favorites.  There exists some  promo test pressings of the original Lather which sell for exorbitant  amounts at record collector conventions and so I was glad that the record  was finally released on CD.  Even with four bonus tracks though, this  is still not the complete Lather album.  Disk one has the original lp  sides one, two, and three, intact.  Disk two has sides four, five and six  and it starts with the intact side four, however on the rest of the CD the  track order becomes jumbled, and a 3:07 version of Baby Snakes  from the  original side six was, for some reason, dropped from this release! (a 1:50  version appears on the Sheik Yerbouti album).  The liner notes make no  mention of this fact.  Nor do the notes tell us if the final track on the  original Lather album's side seven, "One More Time for the World" is the  same as the track that was put in that position on the CD, "The Ocean is  the Ultimate Solution"  In fact, the notes seem to be written by someone  who isn't that familiar with Zappa.  For example, for the track 3 disk 2,  Big Leg Emma ("I'm in a big dilemma about my big leg Emma...she used to knock  me out until her face broke out) is a number Frank played on stage long  before their first record, but the notes say, "A song that celebrates as it  ridicules...  The fickle finger of fate is pointing firmly at the guys on  this one..."  say what?  The four bonus tracks kind of compensate for  this sloppy package.  The first one is Frank introducing the Lather album  on the radio and talking over the first track, Re-gyptian Strut.  The  second bonus track, `The Leather Goods' is typical Zappa guitar solo that  breaks into Led Zeppelin's `Whole Lotta Love' at the end.  `Revenge of the  Knick Knack People' could easily have fit on the Lumpy Gravy album.  It  opens with a demented voice asking, "hey, you got an upset stomach? I'll  give you a Pepto-Dismal"  and continues with munchkin giggles and rolling,  tapping percussion.  `Time is Money' is a slightly different version than  the one on the `Sleep Dirt' album.

Eventually the song was so overplayed I had no interest in "Supernatural" at all, until...
5153	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I've always loved the music of James Taylor and I've always loved the music of Carole King. What is incredible about this CD is that they take the music from both of them and put it on one album and they sing it together. There is also a DVD, but I don't like to watch concerts on DVD because of them. I work out quite a bit because it decreases your risk of cold sores and this is my new favorite workout CD. It gets me excited everytime Carole King hears the earth move under her feet or James Taylor sings about Fire and Rain. I too have seen fire and rain, so I can relate to the depth of his music. If you had fire and rain at the same time you couldn't really have fire because the rain would put it out. My dad used to smoke a pipe, but he wouldn't smoke it out in the rain because whenever he did, the pipe would go out. He'd get all mad and blame it on Panama before drinking another beer, but that kind of display made me what I am today. What am I? I AM fire and rain that makes the earth move under your feet. That's why my friends call me earthquake. I would get this CD if you want to either smoke a pipe, work out or build a fire. It's good for all of those things. I think my waffle is ready now, so I'm audi 5000!
13. Rhythm Trax-House Party Style: Another track with Jazzy Jeff tearing it up. Quality turntablism throughout.
By 1998 Mitchell's voice had become smokier (due in large part to smoking), so it's breathier than in younger days, and it breaks a little in the high range.  The musicality is intact.  She's joined by some fine jazz-leaning musicians/friends, including former husband Larry Klein on bass, Mark Isham on trumpet, Brian Blade on drums, and Greg Leisz on pedal steel.  She plays electric guitar.  It's a friendly atmosphere; when she once forgets the words, she asks the audience, and someone shouts them so she can continue.  She dances, she jokes, she banters.  She shows some skill as a mimic and storyteller, doing her take on Bob Dylan during "Big Yellow Taxi" and, in a longish story, doing an older woman she encountered in a resort when she had thought she was by herself.  It's fun because of the way she tells it.

From her third album, Joga is kind of a downer, not enough Bjork in there, but Bachelorette and Hunter are superb, especially Hunter, with Bjork unleashing her inner animal. I was blown away the first time I saw it.  The main draw from this period, though is All is Full of Love. Someone I know says its disturbing, because underneath our skin we are just bones, not too different from the half-assembled robots in the video.
I've mentioned the extra features a couple of times.  The back stage commentary by Tommy Shaw was fun and enjoyable.  So was Todd's video, except for the mentioned scene.  There is the title track of Styx's then new album, "Brave New World".
9460	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	I have everything available on cd by Yoko Ono. Her music stimulates me intellectually and emotionally like no other current recording artist. I had searched for the B-sides "Who Has Seen The Wind" and "Listen, The Snow Is Falling" for years. Was greatly disappointed when they were not included on the extensive "OnoBox". So for me, "Wedding Album" is worth the price for these two Ono songs, which contain some of her most interesting lyrics. "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking For Her Hand In The Snow)" is a thought provoking title but never one of my favorite Ono songs. Track One "John & Yoko 22:41" is interesting and relevant because it's John and Yoko. The bantering back and forth by calling out their names goes from a lighthearted to an almost desperate tone. It's very long. I listen to this maybe once a year. But glad to have it in my collection, and a must in my Lennon/Ono collection. Track Two "Amsterdam 24:54" can be painfully long at times. Again, it's John and Yoko (and she does test your patience) with an interesting interview. Is this album music? art? politics? a John and Yoko "event" as they did before and better than anyone else? More importantly for me it's a significant piece to a puzzle that I enjoy piecing together. Lennon and Ono are an intellectual and creative force I enjoy submitting myself to.

Great songwriting, fantastic hooks, and just a musician who had so much talent it was only a matter of time before he ended up releasing a solo album.  I recommend this album to Who fans, and fans of 70's rock.

The first five songs particularly show a wonderful range of styles and compositions ranging from the solid pop of "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon" to the heavily orchestrated "Madman Across the Water" and "Indian Sunset".  While the lyrics were occasionally murky and often misquoted, there was a lot of power in the piano and the backing arrangements were incredible.  The still maturing voice of Elton was new and different at the time, and appealed to a broad array of audiences trying to find stability after the psychedelic and turbulent 60s.

5350	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	My Terminator film score collection has always had a gigantic missing piece and that was the soundtrack from the first film.  It has always been an elusive score to track down and the previous ones that were released always had negative comments about being incomplete or not sequenced correctly etc.  The original score has been out of print for over 20 years so when I stumbled upon this remastered version being released, I was a little skeptical over how the work would be treated and thrown out to us.  I think it was back in July (2015) when Milan Records released a remastered version of the Robocop score:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Robocop/dp/B00V862H0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Robocop</a>&nbsp;and I was always curious as to why Milan was being so gracious to release this for fans.  After just now doing some digging around, it appears that this, and a few other releases, are part of a new collection from Milan records called the "Nicolas Winding Refn Presents Series".  Who is Nicolas Winding Refn?  He is a Danish film director who just loves vinyl records.  He decided to partner with Milan records to produce high end vinyl records of movie scores.  Fortunately, Milan has also released CD versions of these remasters but I must admit, the vinyl copies of these releases are where all the goodies are.  Colorful vinyl discs, cool artwork, and wonderful packaging really make these very "high end" looking indeed.  I prefer to own CDs and haven't purchased a brand new vinyl record since I was a kid, but these releases really have me wanting to pick one up just because they are so awesome looking.

The supplements are nothing spectacular. There is an insubstantial "Making Of" featurette, which is good for a one-off viewing. There is also a nice promo for Gabriel's ":Growing Up" tour, where he goes into detail about the setup of his new concerts, including the giant hamster bubble that anyone who has seen his recent concerts loves. My favorite supplement, though I don't know why, is the time-lapse of a concert in Berlin, Germany. Over the course if a minute, we see the stages being set up in an empty arena, the full concert, and everything being dismantled, packed up, and shipped out. It is a lot of fun.
Wrecking Ball  (2012)  *****  Solid Springsteen, Irish feelin' songs and religious undertones.  Great tunes in, "We Take Care Of Our Own", "Easy Money", "American Land", "We Are Alive", very Johnny Cash, "Shackled And Drawn", "Death To My Hometown", "This Depression", "Jack Of All Trades", the title track, "Land Of Hope And Dreams"  and "Rocky Road".
Turn it up and enjoy!
And that's the issue with this album: it's a total foray into Adult Contemporary/Easy Listening territory. This was Paul in his mellow, sedate, smooth moves zone. The audio equivalent to a gentle laxative. The stylistic variety of "Venus and Mars" is gone, the epic songwriting of "Band on the Run" is nowhere to be found. This album has one vibe and one vibe only, and that's pure unadulterated Yacht Rock.
Bocelli has the most pleasing male voice I have ever heard and even though I don't understand Italian, just listening to him is pure pleasure. The concert setting, in a town square in Tuscany, is reminiscent of Yanni's Acropolis concert, with multi-colored lights used on the background buildings. It's very appealing, and the more I watch this the more impressed I am with the camera-work. That also includes a couple of videos interspersed during the concert and a portrait of Andrea's town and of his immediate family.
6912	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	How can one be so critical of this work?  There are some great melodies,  great instrumental work, and mostly decent songwriting.  Paul even gets  bluesy ("3 Legs", "Smile Away") and sings with gusto  (think "Helter Skelter" or "I'm Down" for a Beatles  reference).  Sure, some of the lyrics tend to drift into the type of  cloying inanities that Paul would later be (rightly) accused of butchering  his solo work, but "Ram" has too many great moments to be  dismissed as shallow or irrelevant.
There is a relaxed feel all through this, even in the fast-paced, intricate arrangements, and it is obvious the whole band is having a lot of fun on stage. And despite a slight raciness in some of the material, Zappa keeps it all clean; a "PG" rating at worst. Too bad it wasn't aired on television, as intended. There is such mundane material in spots, who would have thought you could write a nice, jazzy  ballad about turkey poop on your windshield ("Village Of The Sun"), and actually have it work? And, of course, cheap monster movies have a fan base all their own, including Zappa and The Mothers' salute with "Cheepnis." Despite the obvious overdubbing, this is an incredible piece of live music. It's no wonder he had a "NO DRUGS IN THE BAND" rule. Uppers could help, but you really need to be on top of your game to pull this stuff off. Take the first part of "Bee-Bop Tango," for instance. Frank Zappa tells the audience, just before the band starts, "This is a HARD one to play." Just listen to it, the band probably played it every night for the whole 73-74 tour, maybe not, but, as rendered here, it's one of the most difficult pieces in contemporary music. And, I have no doubt, this version has it's own ambience.

If you haven't heard these songs on the Classic Rock radio station that you listen to, it is time to find another station. This could be the best album of all time.  Yes, Michael Jackson, look out.

Recommended to any hiphop fans, especially westcoast, if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever.  He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do, but he does it creatively, if you can't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up, very good album 4.5 stars, another case for half stars at Amazon.

But that's not why you need to buy this CD.  You need it because it is IMPOSSIBLE to maintain a bad mood when this CD is playing.  You need this to listen to as a stress reducer on those tough days.  You need this because it is chilhood in a disc.

One warning, such as it is. If you have an complete memory of this album, the new detail and space will be disconcerting at first. There is some much new to hear, and different balance, that I can see some long time lovers of this set being disappointed. But that has been true of certain other remasters in the past, so be forewarned.
2. Youe Got To Die For The Government  6/5
1024	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	These are the complete original recordings of the singles, not remakes. The sound quality is excellent. It includes the extended versions of "House of the Rising Sun" and both parts of "Sky Pilot" (the original single was divided over two sides into parts one and two).  The early singles are the better part of the collection, a good series of Brill Building-written tunes that were tailored to Burden's gruff, angry vocal style ("It's My Life" is a particular favorite). The later '60s tunes haven't aged as well, with their dated sounds (electric sitar, flanged drums), but they are enjoyable in a camp way, and are catchy. Eric's big hit single with War, "Spill the Wine," rounds out the set.
I won't go as far to say that his work with Jazzy Jeff is something I absolutely cherish and revere, but one should recognize that they made big contributions to hiphop and stood strong as an example of hiphop's diversity. People could get into their stuff if they found the rest of hiphop hard-to-stomach. I love the show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"(in which they both starred), which not only exceeded and outlasted expectations, but became a classic and brought hiphop and urban culture to the forefront on American television. It's still shown on TV constantly today, eight years after the last episode. The show had something for everyone, like I said, an enduring American classic.
226	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	For a television production (originally), I think this came out pretty good.  Despite the comments of others, I found the sound quality to be excellent.  Myron Grombacher's pounding drums and his ants-in-the-pants antics are a highlight, as is Neil Giraldo's precision guitar playing - especially the subtle nuances he throws in to round out the band's sound.  Bassist Roger Capp is virtually ignored in this video, while keyboard player Charlie Giordano gets maybe too much time.  Then there is Pat, who looks to be 19 here instead of the 29 that she is, and seems a little bit uncomfortable on stage.  But she and the band put together a solid show, and in the middle of the set string together Looking for a Stranger, I Want Out, and We Live For Love in a powerful rock medley.  The scenes of Pat dancing in front of the drum set alone or with husband Giraldo are a treat.  The audience is literally in the dark, so there is little interaction with them we can see, but camera shots from the stage let us in on how it must look to a performer to sing out to an invisible crowd.  Five stars to counter those naysayers who can't just turn up the volume and enjoy a good show!
[2:51] The Warmth of the Sun
"Brothers in Arms" - This is an impeccably crafted and suitably somber video. It is incredibly well conceptualized and executed, particularly the "machine gun to guitar" edit introducing Mark's solo. It is the best Dire Straits video, hands down.

4209	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This DVD rates 5 stars on the exceptionally quality of Sinatra's performance and the historical value of preserving this masterful career highlight. One might have hoped, though, that some more attention could have been made to restoring some fading of the print. The sets remain beautiful but a bit muted. The sound, though mono, is terrific. Another quibble : although Sinatra fans will be familiar with all the details, there could have been more to the packaging, such as original recording and air dates, some text that puts this program into the context of Sinatra's career, anything. All one gets is a list of song titles. This performer deserves better.
I think this is probably my favorite of the various efforts by Mannheim Steamroller - a perfect expression of their crossover styling of ancient and modern music.  Don Sears, Jackson Berkey, Eric Hansen, Chip Davis (and a vast cast of supporting musicians) manage the kind of creativity that makes the album both easy to listen to and memorable at the same time.

Enjoy.
My favorite thing about this though is that this is the only footage of Brian Jones performing live with the Stones that I have ever seen. ( I have always thought he was the coolest Stone, probably because we don't have to see him rocking out in a pair of Depends, but that's another story.)  Anyway, it's been well documented that Jones' contributions to the band in his last days were slim to none, but  I always wanted to believe that was his slide work on 'No Expectations.'  This video confirms just that-we get to see him tearing it up in living color on a sweet Gibson Firebird.  Sadly, that's about all he does here-and yes, he does look god -awful.  I'm not just talking about his threads either, the man looks physically ill.  Imagine if he did make it to age 60-SCARY.
Two Against Nature is a nice glass  of wine.  It's smooth and assuring, but then it intoxicates you when you  least expect it.  The production emphasizes jazz and soul, and is  efficiently paced.  I really like the title track and negative girl, but  the jewel is almost gothic, which captures the enigma that is woman as well  as any song I've heard in recent memory.
4339	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Madonna knows how to make a video.  Her collaborations and performances in each little gem has been one of the strongest aspects of her amazing career.  Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to make a DVD.  For a woman who's made a career out of being unpredictable and pioneering, her efforts in showcasing her work in the DVD format have been surprsiginly ho-hum.  Where are the extras?  Where's a behind the scenes look at the making of any of these groundbreaking clips?  And why are clips missing?  Why not include "Deeper and Deeper", "This Used To be My Playground" and "You'll See"?  And where is "I Want You"  and "I'll Remember"?  I had read that "Erotica" was left off the collection to avoid a Parental Advisory sticker plastered across the packaging.  I hope this isn't true.  Could the woman who released the "Sex" book really be all that concerned about such a warning?  I'm sure there are countless reasons for such glaring omissions.  It is said that Madonna hand-picked the videos that she's most proud of for this release.  And, without a doubt, they are all great videos.  But with expectations so high for both Madonna and the DVD format, why not give a little extra?  I've given this collection five stars for the content alone...but as far as DVDs go, this one not only could be better but should be better.
I wanna say to my Brothers and my Sisters...keep the faith!

While this was not their first recording it was the one that hooked me in.  While in San Fran, there they were.  While in Seattle, there they were.  It was kinda bizarre.

6004	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The year 1974 was a banner one for these guys for it was this 20-track double album that brought them back as chart-toppers and awarded them legions of new fans, myself included. To this day, this stands as their reigning compilation. Song-wise this is more consistent in quality and in conceptualized execution than 2003's more crisp-sounding "Sounds of Summer". Brian Wilson's sophisticated vocal arrangements are pop music pleasure throughout. Yeah, they sang great stuff of beach life. "Surfer Girl" and "Warmth of the Sun" rule. But they remembered the inlanders too with a few of their greatest like "Fun, Fun, Fun", "I Get Around" and "Shut Down". Also essential is noting that, even in their early years, they couldn't be pigeonholed as one-dimensional. "In My Room" and "Girl Don't Tell Me" show a subtext of poignancy. Their music wouldn't remain this innocent for long, and when it wasn't, the public didn't want to know.
I loved and love The Beatles; Paul's, John's and George's contributions in composition were excellent and they set a new standard! There is very little to disagree in terms of what their contributions entailed....George went on to make amazing albums that reflected in melody, rhythm and style the efforts of his Beatles' days. John made beautiful and reflective albums that were not necessary the direction that The Beatles were going after the innovative and grand gestures of Sgt. Peppers but clearly the direction he wanted. In his stab at Paul for Paul's obvious influence on Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour, he is saying you (Paul) wanted parades and grand-standing, I (John) wanted to just make good music...he is not hiding he's feelings behind closed doors about how he felt with the direction The Beatles were taking and how that affected him in his song 'How Do You Sleep?' from the Imagine album. John was still young and I am an older man who sees that as immaturity and that's okay..I love you John and I love your music and own all your albums but for those out there who are Beatles' fans and feel John has some good points to make, must reflect on a few things; first, Paul McCartney's first album and especially on RAM is the beatle that took The Beatles to new heights; This album I am reviewing is a fusion of rock, funk, jazz and has beautiful melodic musings. Though John may not appreciate these efforts, Paul proves to be an exceptional musician who creates progressive music and the one whose input on The Beatles during and after Sgt. Peppers changed music forever!!! While John continued the search for his own soul, Paul let his soul and talent soar with music bursting in creative energy!!! This album tells The Beatles story!!
Cream also had a big impact on power trios to come in their wake. For example, the James Gang, their debut album, Yer' Album (1969) sounds to me like an American version of Cream. Check out Joe Walsh and his extended guitar improvisations, plus Tom Kriss' heavily fuzzed bass (he only appeared on that album) and similar bass playing. Mountain would not exist were it not for Cream, especially became Felix Pappalardi was a member of that group (and Leslie West's vocals often reminds me of Jack Bruce). I'd like to mention the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but they were Cream's contemporaries, and equally influential. Cream also influenced plenty of non-power trios too, including Jethro Tull, where the British press hailed them as "The next Cream". Mick Abrahams' guitar work was inspired by Clapton. Clive Bunker gave an extended drum solo with "Dharma For One". The more bluesy explorations were not unlike Cream's. And they also did a cover of "Cat's Squirrel" (of course we knew what happened to Tull afterwards: Abrahams left, Martin Barre came in, and Ian Anderson moved the band towards progressive rock, which certainly hardly hurt the band any).

What I love so much about the Sugarloaf LP is the long instrumental improvisations and unorthodox song structures.  The organ playing on Bach Doors Man/Chest Fever definitely rocks, and has an incredibly catchy hook.  Having heard the original Chest Fever, the Sugarloaf twist is much more powerful, more entertaining, and contains drumming closer to r&b /funk than that of rock, yet it keeps a rock feel the entire time.  In fact the jamming on this track is much better than the modern day jam bands which are starting to gain popularity.  The only bad thing about this LP is that it was obviously not very well produced (but better than the velvet undergound).  And they aren't the best singers either.
So although you might have some songs there on other collections, it is for above mentioned points alone worth it to always have an ACE copy as well.

"My Hometown" concludes and summarizes the album in its entirity.  Bruce incorporates both nostalgia and broken dreams.  It also exemplifies the "History repeating itself" theme because it talks about what happened to him is happening to his kid.  It is a thoughtful and truly wonderful conclusion to one of the best albums from the 80's.  Desperation is also another theme you sense in these songs such as "Cover Me", "I'm On Fire", "Dancing in the Dark", and "Downbound Train".

Her "no-holds-barred" set features the savvy production talents of high-profile rap svengalis Sean "Puffy" Combs and Jermaine Dupri and lesser known hip-hop boardmen such as Stevie J, Nashiem, Prestige and Cornbread. Thematically, the platter also covers rough-and-tough street themes that are presented with stark candor.
Otherwise, it's a fine package.  David Gilmour's playing is the reason I picked this up, and I wasn't disappointed.  His soaring solos and remarkable tone and phrasing are a feast for fret-grinding aficionados like myself.  He is joined by a large group of musicians, of which one of the sidemen is guitarist Tim Renwick, an excellent player who has toured and traded leads with Eric Clapton.
Maybe I'm too picky.  Maybe I'm overly critical.  Maybe I am too quick to over-classify.  What I AM certain of, is that you should NOT buy this album if you are expecting anything remotely "progressive" from it.  If it smells, sounds, tastes and looks like tired, old nu-metal, then...

Furtwngler, although he had decided to remain in Germany, was certainly no Nazi [...] He had a private telephone line to me which was not connected via the exchange [...] Before going to bed, he used to chat with me over telephone. Sometimes I told him amusing stories to cheer him up, sometimes we talked about politics. One of the main threats the Nazis used against Furtwngler and myself later on was the assertion that they had recorded all these conversations. I should not have thought that it was possible ! Was there enough shellac ? If the Nazis really did this, their ears must certainly have burnt, and it was not surprising that Furtwngler was put eventually put on their black list, let alone myself.[21]

Let me get back to the album review.  If this album had been released in the early 90's it may have been a masterpiece but now it is just plain embarrassing.  The Gunners have a penchant for writing cool metal riffs but this is 2004 and I don't think the world cares about cool metal riffs.  They are good enough to pull off the heavy metal rollicking and the album does sound tight musically but this album just doesn't get my foot tapping.  However, I can't lay all the blame on them because with a dynamic vocalist and catchy choruses this load of garbage could have actually amounted to something.

Specifically he wanted to leave LA because (as he noted at the time) he "knew nothing but bad people,and was doing nothing but bad stuff"-likely referencing his burgeoning cocaine habit. Perhaps he was also looking to escape his Thin White Duke persona and a likely taken-out-of-context "interest" in fascism and controversy over an (apparently) Nazi-like salute while travelling in Berin. Moving to Switzerland,he wanted to escape the David Bowie circus of multiple personas,dramatized stage shows and drug use-in order to concentrate on himself as a musician. There he met up with former Roxy Music co-founder Brian Eno. Eno was seeking an artist to collaborate with and produce. David Bowie needed a producer and a collaborator to help him realize his new musical vision. And this album was the first fruit of their musically collaborative passion.

Saraceno formed the group using some of the best session musicians around, such as Carole Kaye and Tommy Tedesco (who also formed part of another famed studio group known as The Wrecking Crew) as well as Tom Scott and, in 1964/65, released three albums titled Boss Drag (LRP-3346/LST-7346), Boss Drag At The Beach (LRP-3363/LST-7363) and Doin' The Jerk (LRP-3404/LST-7404).
While the style isn't as intriguing as (especially) People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm or The Low End Theory, it's more darker sound is welcome.  The first three albums offer something different for each listen.  Quest proves that they can create a mood with the music, which is what all hip-hop albums should offer regarding (The Low End Theory's mood to me represents the need to just bring it no-nonsense.  Some have more than others, but it's got to have something, even if it's just to dance).
Buying the CD version of "The Wedding Album" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.

I love every single song on this collection and "Too Many People" remains a favorite of mine to this very day.

The beauty of Special Bulletin was the fact that the movie was designed to play exactly as if it were an actual live news event - complete with technical problems, reports from correspondents in Charleston and Washington, D.C., announcements from political leaders, etc.  Watching it again now, I have to laugh about it because it's obviously low budget and some of the acting really wasn't all that good.

Sammy Davis Jr. is in perfect form, backed by world-famous drummer Buddy Rich and his orchestra live in Las Vegas.  This was Sammy's natural environment, and he put on what is perhaps the show of his life that night.  World-class entertainers from all over the Vegas strip packed themselves into the Sands lounge in the middle of the night, after all of the main shows were over, and reveled in a jam session the likes of which may never be seen again.  After Sammy's hip introduction, he bores right into Come Back to Me at fever pitch and never slows down until the show is over.  It is unbelievable to see that this CD is not readily available, but a couple of these recordings can be found on Sammy's two Greatest Hits albums, the incredibly enjoyable The Birth of the Blues and Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone (which really showcases the talent of Buddy Rich on drums).  Although this live version of Come Back to Me is the best I've ever heard, the studio recording can be found elsewhere.  I've lost count of how many versions of What Kind of Fool Am I? are available, as Sammy never seemed to sing this song the same way twice, but this live recording features one of the better ones.
9) Leave Me
About 20 years ago, Rhino Records had a 9 CD collection of the The British Invasion which included many one-hit-wonders and cool obscurities. If you are one to have that collection, I am certain that you are the envy of many. I was too stupid to realize that I should have kept it.
1769	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This superb 2-disc release joins a short list of music DVD's (2003's exhaustive, Jimmy Page-helmed "Led Zeppelin" concert anthology and the beautifully restored "The Kids Are Alright" deluxe edition) that truly demonstrate the full potential of digital audio/video technology, with respectful consideration of both the artists and thier fans. One of the legendary "lost" rock 'n' roll films of the 70's, the Ringo Starr produced "Born To Boogie" was long assumed to have been a lost cause for any kind of revival. This crystalline audio/visual peek at a unique period of Rock history is akin to capturing lightning in a bottle; because the "Age Of Bolan" only lasted for about 12 months in reality, from the release of the seminal glam rock classic "Electric Warrior" to the recording of its followup "The Slider". Indeed, Marc Bolan is at his absolute peak in this footage-a strutting, charismatic, physically beautiful androgynous Rock God in every sense of the word. The original film itself only runs 65 minutes, basically a concert movie with studio footage and a couple tongue-in-cheek vignettes tossed in. A definite highlight is the studio session footage featuring Elton John on piano and Ringo Starr on drums (!).  Think about that for a second-Elton John and an ex-Beatle as your BACKUP band-that should put any doubts to rest that Marc Bolan was just a pretty face-he obviously commanded (much-deserved) respect as a musician. One caveat-the running time of the set totals about 5 1/2 hours, but you do get quite a bit of redundancy on the concert footage. The 2 one-hour sets that the original film was culled from are offered each in thier entirety, so you will notice the same 20 or so performances repeated throughout. But that is a minor quibble, as this footage does represent the only existing, intact documentation of an entire T. Rex concert (allegedly). A must-have!
JACK OF SPEED: Like all Steely Dan songs this one carries any number of interpretations. I like to think of it as a guy who's hooked on speed and as a result his friends have lost track of him. But it could just as well be about anything else. A great song.

Of course, once I had enough loose change I bought the album and promptly proceeded to play the first side about five times as often as I flipped it over and played side two; having the CD means I tend to listen to the whole thing all the way through.  I would argue that "Tiny Dancer," "Levon," "Razor Face," and "Madman Across the Water" equals the best side of any Elton John record.

"Nobody's Wedding" might come off as a little too cute for it's own good but haunting lines like "why is the wild boy chopping up the floor" come to the rescue. "The Poor Ditching Boy" ranks as one of Thompson's most underrated ballads. Thompson's skill really comes to fore on this one, preceeding later gems like "Beeswing" and "1952 Vincent Black Lightning" by 20 years.
Combining the tallents of the likes of George Duke and Ansely Dunbar, and numerous other musicians to make an enormous jazz orchestra, Mr. Zappa composed many professional and creative pieces to tell the story of a strange man (who I assume goes by the name of Arwetus).

They show their musical genius as always with different musical influences.  They especially shine with the delightfully catchy "Cousin Dupree".  Ironically, their diversity has become one of their trademarks.  A trademark you don't get tired of.  However, the songs on this CD as well as "Everything Must Go", are more subtle than their songs of the 70's and take a few listens to appreciate.  So don't judge this one until you've heard it at least a few times.  Then listen some more.

He has managed to update his sound to appeal to a younger generation of listeners, while still staying true enough to his roots not to alienate  his loyal fan base.  While the "modern" production values of the  album may not be my cup of tea, there are enough guest stars and fiery  playing by Carlos to keep things musically interesting.

6027	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Procol Harum's first album sans organist Matthew Fisher, Home is the dividing line between the two camps of Procol devotees: Those who gave up on the band after Fisher left, and those who thought the band was better off without him. On Home, Fisher's sublime, cathedral-like organ passages are replaced by stark, whittled-down arrangements (there are no Salty Dog string sections here) dominated by Robin Trower's bluesy guitar and Gary Brooker's gruff voice and pounding grand piano. New bassist/organist Chris Coppings attempts to emulate Fisher's organ on cuts like Piggy Pig Pig, but lacks Fisher's presence. Titles like Dead Man's Dream and About To Die showcase Brooker and lyricist Keith Reid in a particularly dark state of mind. Still, the epic Whaling Stories more than compensates and is alone worth the price of admission.
I love this DVD because it shows behind the scenes in the making of the GD's weirdest, trippiest album, & also one of their most commercial--in a good way--albums. The difference is, even non-Deadheads and non-freaky counter-culture types can love American Beauty, but Anthem for the Sun... now that's an acid test! I still consider side 1 a masterpiece, even if I don't listen to it that much.
The CD comes with a useful booklet that contains all pertinent song and album information as well as an interesting history of the band and all of its ups and downs. If you are looking for a "greatest hits" album, and at a fair price, this is the one to get!

But Stevie's playing and singing are so powerful, so intense, so thoroughly engaging, that the limitations of the recording are irrelevant. He drips with sweat playing, and I practically drip with sweat watching him. The fireworks of "Texas Flood", and the subtle stylings and fabulous fretwork of "Lenny" bookend the range of the performance. The first time through, for most of the show I wondered why Stevie was slinging such a beat up old guitar when a rack of shiny new ones hung on the back wall. When he got around to his instrument-abusing rendition of Hendrix's "Third Stone From The Sun", the reason became self-evident. While "Third Stone" is literally a show stopper, I find it the least interesting performance on the disc, which only goes to show how great the rest of it is.

And that sexy bella-donna dancing she did during the title track. A "classical" girl isn't supposed to go around dancing and dressing sexy. And "Nessun Dorma," which doesn't sound like she's singing it live. At least the orchestra doesn't drown her out there. Look, I know Sarah is a versatile girl, but WHY does she have to wear that microphone thingy on her head and dance across the stage? It all reminds me of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync concerts I've seen in which they do nothing but sing and parade across the stage just to put on a "show." You don't see Phil Collins doing that, he plays instruments during HIS concerts. So do Billy Joel and other "real" artists. Even Andrea Bocelli standsstill during HIS concerts, and at least HE puts on a show. Sorry for raining on your parade, I've spent SO much money on Sarah's stuff, it's unreal. I WISH Bocelli would get more tour dates for the 2001 Spring Tour than the very few he has. :(

Weber's documentary is hard to watch as well - Baker's life was a hard one, filled with pain and sorrow, for which he turned to heroin.  It's heartbreaking to witness someone hurting so much - but his music is without question of the timeless variety, and something to be treasured.
Despite all the oddness, every one of these songs has some kind of melody in it, and this album definitely grows on you - "Red Sails" has become one of my favorite songs EVER. The hit "DJ" is actually one of my least favorite songs on here, because I find it to be too repetitive. No other song on the album even approaches "too repetitive" for me, so maybe the preceding songs just spoil me before I get to it. The opener "Fantastic Voyage", on the other hand, is a definite standout, and a great fake-out. It's by far the most "normal" song on the album, with some of Bowie's best vocals to date (VIBRATO), great lyrics, and a serious yet laid-back feel. That song and "Boys Keep Swinging", one of the more popular songs from the album, have almost identical chord sequences, but they're very different and distinctive, which is certainly helped by the fact that they're seven songs apart or so.
Under The Knife, is also similar to the Audio Visions period.

This DVD is the best musical DVD I own.  I think the music is incredible.  It sounds and looks great.  However in agreement with all reviewers, the interviews need to be segregated or a feature needs to allow straight through music.  I own several videos like this; although this is the BEST in Integrated Drivel, because you can easily click to the start of the next song. (The Integrated Drivel is tacked onto the end of each track.)  I am baffled why the producers of all videos don't segregate the "once is more than enough " stuff from the "I want to watch it every day" music.  But still love it, otherwise a 5 Star.
Tool is the most overrated band of the 90s and 00s!

Anyhow, if the script for Escape From Hell was re-written and polished, and the special effects were updated, this could be a very compelling stance to take in getting people to understand how serious this whole thing about what happens after you die. Most people tend to take this life for granted. They expect to get up every morning. But keep in mind this is not a guarantee, nor has it ever been. We are, each of us, at any given moment, only ONE heartbeat away from death. Don't forget that.
Missing are a few favorites, most notably "Will Somebody Come and Play" which is by no doubt  available elsewhere.
The two featured analog synthesizer sounds are way cool. The synth during the verse sounds like falling leaves or water. The bass synth sound that counterpoints the vocal during the chorous, again, is inventive: an interesting, unusual sound, delightful instrumental melodic counterpoint to the vocal, a melodic sound in this region of the bass territory is also unusual in pop. You usually have the bass drum and the bass guitar in the bass region and that's about it. This synth sound and melody is something like a `cello line, lending an orchestral feel while still using pop instruments.
Self is a cross between Beck and Stereolab, and if you are a fan of either, then pick up Subliminal Plastic Motives. In this album, the band does a great job weaving various musical styles in various songs, all held together with strings of bubbles and spaciness.

 The first song off the perch was to become Budgie's standard bearer, "Breadfan". It opened with Tony Bourge's rocking guitar, then the bass and drums come thundering in with the fuzzy crunch of twelve thousand banging heads. Add to this Burke Shelley's very high pitched, quintessential 70's metal singing (reminiscent of Geddy Lee of Rush but much sharper) and this heavy metal bird takes flight.

The song "Hotel California", probably the best and most memorable song by the Eagles, has so many levels of meaning and interpretation, it can't be pigeon-holed into being labeled this or that. The singer tells a strange story about when he was driving one night down the "dark desert highway", either along Highway 5 between San Francisco and Los Angeles, or the other similar highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas on Highway 15. Although the cover is the Beverly Hills Hotel in the Los Angeles area, the song describes a California-Spanish style hotel, one of which resides in a small truck-stop town about 100 miles southeast of San Francisco. Wherever the song takes place, it's in the Middle of Nowhere, California. Tired from his journey, the storyteller decides to stay at a very strange hotel where there appear to be no lights. He hears the ringing of a bell, like a church. A woman appears at the doorway and leads him in via the light of a candle. There are people whispering and dancing in an open courtyard, some "dance to remember" while others "dance to forget". The woman seems like she has some hold over them who appear to be mostly males. At one point he orders wine, and in the most famous line from the song, the "Captain" says they haven't had the "spirit" here since 1969. Then there is a reference to a great feast, which seems like a cult-like sacrifice, before our narrator is running for the door. Many interpretations of the song have been offered by different people, and the Eagles are reluctant to spell it out what it all means, which is the true mark of a great piece of musical literature. Some have suggested that the entire experience is a California cult while others have proposed that the Hotel represents the decadence and materialism of California, particularly Hollywood, the Entertainment Industry, the money, and all the trappings that go with it, including those who get imprisoned by its superficial glamour. Even after many listenings over several decades, I always hear something new in this song, or imagine something I hadn't before. Some of the other songs from the album deal with similar themes of entrapment and decadence, such as "Life in the Fast Lane". A true masterpiece of 1970's rock, not to be missed if you're unfamiliar with it.

10- Takin' It To The Streets
Although Mary O'Brien had been an ordinary-looking young woman, Dusty Springfield was an astonishing vision, sporting a blonde bouffant, light make-up, and heavy eye-liner--a look that became known as "Panda Eyes."  Her gowns sparkled; her gestures were broadly melodramatic; her life as it unfolded was a riot of scandal that included alcohol, drugs, and whispers of lesbianism.  She rode the rocket of fame throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, self-destructed more than once in the 1970s and 1980s, and made a stunning return to the public eye in the 1987.  She died of breast cancer in 1999.

She is beautiful, she is sexy, she is very talented and she is an outstanding "once in a lifetime" entertainer. She's an Inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I especially love her early songs.

There is much to be thankful fore here.  CONTRABAND is not a pale imitation of past glories-it is indeed several steps forward.  Every member throws his weight and energy to dispel the ghosts of the past and roar down the streets in real flesh and blood.  Even if this doesn't give Axel Rose a kick in the ass to get down to business, we've been given a no nonsense rock album that is a chilling call to battle in the face music scene that is populated with far too many phony street warriors.  Many will not heed the call because they are not worthy.

591	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	BORN IN THE U.S.A. is the most slickly produced album of Springteen's career, a direct reaction to the backlash he got from critics over the sparse, haunting NEBRASKA, Bruce's brilliant, bare-bones acoustic masterpiece.  Don't be fooled, however, by the huge production and slick pop arrangements; BORN IN THE U.S.A. finds Bruce at his most political, writing scathing recession-fueled indictments of the then-current Republican regime.  Several songs deal with social issues, most notably poverty, unemployment, racial tension and the death of Main Street, USA and small town America.  The remaining songs deal with lost love, growing older and loneliness.  Two songs in particular, "No Surrender" and "Bobby Jean," deal with the departure of Bruce's best friend, Little Steven, who would leave the E Street Band after recording this album.  Despite the bombastic superstar production and arrangements, BORN IN THE U.S.A. is one of Springsteen's most personal and poingnant albums, and deserves a place of honor in the collection of any Springsteen fan or serious music lover.
No one knew that Keith would eventually semi-fry his brain and then leave us far too soon.  No one knew that the short, fragile, golden age of authentic, people-driven rock was about to end.  If Murray Lerner had been able to know all of these things, I'm sure he would have given us the complete set, in order, without a single note left out.  And while we're dreaming, we'd have a DVD bonus feature of film from a camera pointed directly and unerringly at Keith for the whole length of the concert.  Drummers everywhere would give a pint of blood for that one.

A lot of KISS fans have moaned about the dearth of concert footage in this video, but KISS likes to play it close to the vest with that.  We're STILL waiting for ALIVE 4, which I doubt will EVER get released.  But maybe someday, when the Gene and Paul are old(er) and gray(er), we'll see ALIVE 4 hit the streets with a long-form concert video, which by that time will be a nostalgia piece.
"Hey Jupiter" is one of the more haunting ones, as Tori is singing in a burning room.  A little girl leads her outside, down the burning hallway, and inside a car to safety.  This is the Dakota version played in the video.
Enjoy the music and the masterfully done videos. It's worth the cash you spent, and more it's ENTERTAINMENT.
I didn't need to hear anything first, just the line-up alone was cool. And seeing the band live in Philly before hearing the entire album confirmed this album would not be a bust, and this band is the REAL DEAL (Which is a breath of fresh air considering The Strokes and The Darkness claim to be the return of rock, and they suck... BOY do they suck).
These talented people come along once in a lifetime.

Their specialty is working with chant, monophonic and polyphonic music, and working with medieval texts. According to one source, 'The group takes its name from an anonymous music theorist of the late 13th century, Anonymous IV, who is the principal source on the two famous composers of the Notre Dame school, Lonin and Protin.'
THE best ever, by anybody EVER...period. I agree that "Stop Making Sense" gets the silver medal; quite possibly "Back To Front" the bronze.

Although I had probably heard Woody's `This Land is Your Land' at some earlier point I actually learned about his music secondhand from early Bob Dylan covers of his work.  While his influence has had its ebbs and flows since that time each succeeding generation  of folk singers still seems to be drawn to his simple, honest tunes about the outlaws, outcasts and the forgotten people that made this country, for good or evil what it is today.  Since Woody did not have a particularly good voice nor was he an exceptional guitar player the message delivered by his songs is his real legacy.
Matt's sweet(!) tenor Soaring multipart harmonies contrasts with Acidic guitar leads from Quine & Lloyd, very much the way Neil Young made Crosby, Still and Nash less sweet in 1968. Rough but melodic Power Pop Rockers alternating with Achingly beautiful, romantic ballads with a country rock flavor. Other songs include a song with a quite straightforward request for a girlfriend. A song about Matt's girlfriend's funeral and wanting to pull her back from the grave. A tongue in cheek song about Matt's love for a biblical comic book character. A song where Matt questions if a beautiful, sexy but dumb former girlfriend (who probably dumped him) can, actually, produce speech. Astounding: Hit after hit after hit - you must go more than 10 tracks into the album before you find one that's less captivating. Full of melodic hooks that grab you and hold tight.
Really I feel like I am being dismissive of the other performances, because they were literally ALL great.
"The World Is Stone," a track NOT included on the CD version of DEADLY CYNS is worth the price of admission alone here.  But actually all the videos in this package are at least interesting, and many of the latter ones are full fledged works of art.  Lauper touches all the bases here--from good fun to good art.

I was  disappointed in the same way I was with her prior video collection, that  some videos were omitted from the compilation. If she was able to add a  live performance of "Vogue," on the "Immaculate  Collection" compilation, she could have added more to this collection.  Videos such as "You'll See," "Erotica," "Justify  My Love," and "This Use to Be My Playground," which were  released during the 1990's have been totally omitted, which is a complete  shame. However, the video that I was looking forward in seeing, "I  Want You," was also ommitted. This video, which was based on the short  theatrical piece "La Voix Humaine," revolves around a woman  awaiting for a call from her lover who has left her. In what I consider a  very powerful (and long) video, Madonna portrays a woman exhausted by the  long wait. Filmed in black & white, this is one of her most moving  videos.

But the band was always as famous for its interpersonal explosions as for the music it produced, and throughout the 1980s repeated conflicts effectively destroyed the band's creative balance.  By 1997 the golden line up of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks had not toured or recorded together in a decade, so there were naysayers aplenty when a reunion was announced.  But shortly before the reunion concert, a reporter asked Stevie Nicks why she--a great star and headliner in her own right--would bother with it, once more reduce herself to the level of just one in a group.  Nicks's response was surprising: when I perform solo, it's just me.  When I perform with Fleetwood Mac, THAT is big time rock and roll.  And when Fleetwood Mac reunited and strode out onto the stage for this concert film, Nick's words were phrophetic.  It was, and it is, big time rock and roll.

It is important that we continue to support albums like The Asch Recordings so it can become part of us and who we are.  God forbid this music is ever forgotten.  Woody Guthrie is no different than William Shakespeare and you will love any of the Asch Recordings...they are totally original and excellent.
The star here is Scott Weiland as he almost bares his soul in each and every song, especially in the songs "Falling To Pieces", "You Got No Right", and "Loving the Alien".
The sets and clothes were all designed by Gianni Versace and he seems to work without being overbearing.  The camera shots are fairly typical, but the sound is crisp and clear.  There is also a great 50 minute documentary, in which, you meet the entire band, backup singers, tour managers, lighting coordinators and, of course, Gianni Versace.  Also included is a making of documentary of "The One" video, with the video included.  It is well worth the time and trip.

This is a cd of half orchestration from an actual orchestra, and half orchestration from a synclavier... but the highlight for me is an orchestration from a synclavier called Girl in the magnesium dress.  quite an accomplishment.

NO disrespect to Boulez but his renditions of FZ work needs a lot of help.. the work is great, but as another reviewer noted, Boulez didn't do it justice.  Boulez might not 'get it'
6915	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	As the years pass, this album just sounds fresher and fresher, much like the early Bealtes albums.  The production has a subtly that none of the Wings albums can touch, and McCartney's tunefulness is still working  overtime.  Sure, most of the lyrics are lightweight, and this was released  at a time when we still all thought the Beatles were prophets, but this is  just a fun album, lyrically and musically.  If one lays down expectations  and just takes this album for what it is, it is one great listen,  particularly under good headphones. Also very worthwhile to seek out the  import; it has by far the best sound quality.
This is one of my all-time favorite albums - right up there with Fiona Apple's 'When the Pawn' and Bjork's 'Post. Stunning, creatively dazzling. Heres hoping Imogen someday comes back to make a second album.

Tool fans are quick to insult the average human being for disliking their favorite band by dismissing them as ignorant twits. No, it's just the music is so dull I'm sure over exposure is enough to make anyone brain dead for a little while. My brain cells came out waving a white flag about half way through. I had to listen to skinny puppy to perk them back up again. In a way, tool fans remind me of born again Christians, as in you're either a blind follower or a total waste of space. It's like a cult. Perhaps that's the appeal. Does being a tool fan make you better then other people? If you think so then you are a sad, sad person. Perhaps you think my tiny brain just can't grasp the fact that tool are the best band in the world and that Maynard James Keenan (sounds like an Indian dish) is a god. Personally I think he's laughing his wig off at all of you. But anyway you can't be swayed. To the curious buyer, I'd listen to the samples and look up some of the lyrics before you start believing all the hype. By the way I just want to say the `secretary' from Boston is a plagiarizer. (...)Oh and one more thing. If Maynard James Keenan moved to Spain and (under Spanish law) married Pilar Gmez Daz, her name would remain Pilar Gmez Daz. If they had a daughter christened Mercedes, she will be called Mercedes James Gmez. If she got married to Juan Garca Martnez she would keep her original name but her son, Pedro, would be called Perdro Garca James. You see where this could go! Having such a long winded name is a danger to Spanish society!

The reason for the four-star rating was I was hoping that the remastering of this two-disc vinyl album would have had the stereo versions of the songs and not mono, otherwise no complaints.  After spending too many years listening to subpar MP3 files I had forgotten how good music sounded from analog sources like tape and vinyl records.  After seeing the recent resurgence in vinyl record sales and audio tape I decided to get back into the audiophile scene and bought a used reel-to-reel TEAC A-6300 tape deck on Craigslist last year and a new AudioTechnica turntable and cartridge this year on Amazon.  Man, you just can't compare the quality of analog recordings to MP3 compressed lossy audio!  I think I've bought more record albums in the last year than I did in any single year of my youth!

The whole album is full of that cool hard arena rock feel that i've loved for years. I seriously think this cd should be heard by christian and secular rock fans. This is a classic album to me.

Rafferty  shows himself to be a first rate songwriter, composing such fine gems as  "Stealin' Time," "The Ark" and the masterful  "Whatever's Written in Your Heart," which features him and his  backup singers crooning with little backing instrumentation.  Overall, this  is one of the best rock albums from the late 1970s.

Picture Perfect is comparable to Cry For Love -- upbeat and a great message.

It is above all a very entertaining event.  Most of the songs are there, some that aren't on the album, and it is fun to watch.  Unlike some concerts, this is a very visual one.  You want to watch, not merely listen.  A "making-of" documentary would've been nice, but this is from the relatively early days of concert videos.  It holds up after many viewings.  I've seen Paul Simon in concert, and while it was enjoyable, the Graceland concert had a lot more energy, was much more dynamic.  This, plus the S&G Central Park concert make the perfect overview of Paul's artistic output.

  I was fortunate to see the Diamond Dogs Tour in New Haven way back when.  It was the strange time of Glam.  Mascara was a real commodity.  Have you ever seen an audience that looked like raccoons? I have. But.getting back to Bowie-- he was just the best on that tour.  Like a Broadway show the scenery kept changing, he was doing pantomime.  One minute he's in a trenchcoat on some dark alley singing "When you rock 'n' Roll with Me", and the next he's a prizefighter in a boxing ring, gloves cuffed around the microphone, singing "Rebel, Rebel." It was art as experience and the music is no different.  So while it may not always be what you like- admit that it does the job well.  It gets you to react-use your energy-feel that you're alive! Sorry.....it can't make you happy.  Only you can do that job. But if you are happy it can make you happier.  This wasn't what you wanted to hear? Too bad. Go join the ever-circling skeletal family then and leave me alone. I can't please everyone and wouldn't even if I could! Hmmmmmmm.... now I know how David Bowie feels!

In that regard you get The Temptation (NOT the 1960s/1970s Motown group, but the original Temptations, a One-Hit Wonder white doo-wop quartet from Flushing, New York), The Dubs, Little Anthony & The Imperials, Tommy Facenda, Gene Vincent, Little Joe (Cook), another One-Hit Wonder and lead of The Thrillers, The Lafayettes, Sal Mineo, Barbara Lynn, The Rocky Fellers, and Billy And Lillie.

4752	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Without a doubt the first highlight of the Year 2000.  These sounds have very delightful jazz flavorings and some catch hooks which sink in after a few listens.  This recording rocks a little more than Gaucho, which seems  more appropriate as background as background music.  Two Against Nature and  Cousin Dupree display some high energy while maintaining some slick jazz  colorings.  The fade out solo on West Of Hollywood is quite ellaborate as  well. Even slower tunes like Janie's Runaway work well with some stedy bass  playing. Overall, this recording shows that the stylings of Steely Dan  still fit in quite nicely in the new millenium.
The pace picks up again with "Those Nights" (which has a sort of pop-punkish sound to it, but that's a great thing in this case) and "Falling Inside The Black." I'd go so far as to label "Say Goodbye" as the "obligatory ballad" of the album, but this is by no means a bad thing as Skillet pull it off better than most bands playing today. After that comes another hard-hitter in "Whispers In The Dark," (GREAT soloing by Kasica on this song!) followed up by the closing and most lyrically powerful track on the CD, "Looking For Angels." Incidentally, if you ever get the chance to check out the video for that song, do so. If it doesn't move you or make you cry, you seriously have no soul. It's a rather interesting song in that John does most of the verses in spoken word but sings explosively in the chorus.

Note to people who are especially sensitive to swearing: there are a couple of moments in this show where there is some minor use of bad language.
As for the story, you have this group of five terrorists (led by two former defense scientists) who take over a tugboat in Charleston harbor, engage in a firefight with the Coast Guard, take two Guardsmen as well as a journalist and his cameraman hostage, and demand a live network feed.  In an effort to get the hostages released, the RBS network gives them what they want, at which time they demand that all trigger devices on nuclear weapons housed in the Charleston area be brought to them for destruction.  This act of unilateral disarmament, they argue, will surely inspire the Soviets to follow their lead.  If their demands are not met, they then announce, they will detonate their own nuclear device right there in Charleston.  Government spokesmen cast doubts upon the truth of the threat early on, but the tension soon ratchets up as more and more evidence comes to light indicating that this terrorist threat could very well be frighteningly real.
The fan pack is so worth the expensive price. Filled with new interviews as well as reviews on all the Blondie catalogue as well as reviews on all the Debbie solo work. Loads of cool photos too. The guys get an A++++ on delivering such an incredible package.

If you can figure out exactly what the lyrics mean, well good for you! Steely Dan has always intrigued us with a layer of mist between what the words really mean and what we interpret them to mean. But that's the fun of it! The music is a masterful blend of great rock lines and terrific jazz underpinnings and riffs. These guys are just plain incredible! 'Gaslighting Abby' is my personal favorite, but 'What a Shame About Me', 'Almost Gothic', Jack Of Speed', 'Two Against Nature', 'Cousin Dupree', 'Janie Runaway' and all the other tunes are well worth listening to over and over again.

The only things I don't like about this DVD is that John had some much better (and longer) concerts on this tour.  They say that the Creedence songs are so simple that anybody can play them, but the band John plays with sounds nothing like the real Creedence.

I'll try to be level headed about this. If you are reading this, you are looking for guidance, so for those who have resisted buying any AKUS until NOW... Shame on you! But OK, if that be the case, you're best bet for a high saturation of OUTSTANDING ballads is "New Favorite" which has some good B-grass also, or "Forget About It" But this is void of any B-grass whatsoever, (how'd that happen?). For the most balanced album with STRONG Ballads AND B-grass, "So Long So Wrong" is your good first choice. If you prefer the older works of AKUS (lots of B-grass) but can't decide which to buy, your best bet is "Now That I've Found You" without question. Unless you have a specific song title in mind, "Lonely Runs Both Ways" may not be your best first purchase. Stellar performances on ALL titles are to be found without question. Myself? I heard AKUS the first time in 1992. I was awe-struck, and remain so with each release from Alison or AKUS. When god shines, HE SHINES. One day I hope a CD of all of Alisons singles from movie sound-tracks etc... will be released. I own every Alison "album" released so far, other than the occasional wayward single. I can say the same for Dan & Rons works also. Jerry!... lol, Dude, nobody has enough money or time to buy everything YOU've put your personal touch too. However, I can nearly always detect your sound & style, sight unseen whenever I hear it, ". Alison & the group are beyond mere descriptive phrases.

The opening song ("The Velvet Rope") is directed, choreographed, and presented just perfectly, and made me proud to have loved Janet Jackson since the 'Good Times' and 'Fame' days.  Janet actually directed the show from the stage, she's the greatest.  One thing missing from the VHS version is the first guy brought to the stage during 'Rope Burn'.  I loved how she dismissed him.  Her and Tina's choreography on this album was flawless too.
Catch My Fall is erotically charged, as is Flesh for Fantasy.  Blue Highway has a folksy, gritty feel to it. Eyes without a Face is Billy Idol's highest charting song, made so by women who found it very romantic and sexually charged.  Daytime Drama is a really great song that makes you "move" and feel what he's saying.  Do not stand in the Shadows is a lesser played song with great feeling and soul stirring melody.

Other songs like "Push1t" and "Eulogy" are examples of trying-too-hard-yet-flat progressive-rock with the occasional "heavy" moments on this album, and when I'm not chuckling at Maynard's attempts to come off as a deep thinker, I'm usually wallowing in boredom over how bloodless most of them feel.
Chances are that you will have a rush of happiness when you will undergo the experience of listening to the whole album in case you understand it. And it is not animal or plant happiness; it is human happiness. Enjoy.
"Parents Just Don't Understand" - This is the Single Version that was released on 7" vinyl and cassette single.  It shortens the instrumental section between the 2nd and 3rd verse and fades a little earlier than the LP.
The When Johnny Comes Marching Home overture is an absolutely brilliant series of variations on the famous civil war song of the same name (sometimes known, especially to kids, as "The Ants Come Marching Home"). Harris uses the full range and virtuosity of the symphony orchestra to create a thrilling and memorable orchestral version of this hummable tune (probably one of the most hummable ever composed). Morton Gould's "American Salute" also employs the same tune but his orchestration and variations pale in comparison to Harris's. Only Michael Kamen succeeded in creating a brilliant orchestral variation on this tune in one of his film scores, but Harris's version is even better. I find myself listening to this one track repeatedly. The CD is worth its full price just for this track alone. It goes without saying that Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony play both Harris works to utter perfection. This partnership is one of the best of all American orchestras and Schwarz is possibly the greatest living champion of American classical music.

The true essence of patriotism, a term too often used for less-than-honorable ends by certain political operatives throughout history, is very evident in both Copland's and Harris' works.  Harris is represented by the intensely proud two-part work "American Creed", and his 1935 overture "When Johnny Comes Marching Home", based on the famous World War I song.  It is also evident in Copland's rarely heard "Canticle Of Freedom", which here is sung by the Seattle Symphony Chorale.

Lindsay, who was lead vocalist for The Raiders, had other chart entries in 1971 with the songs Are You Old Enough, Problem Child and Been Too Long On The Road but they're ommitted here. Fortunately the amazing Jimmy Webb song First Hymn From Grand Terrace, although not a hit, makes up for that. Lindsay's solo work was in the tradition of the pop vocalist unlike the sound of the Raiders which was harder edged. The song Arizona is a spectacular demonstration of his vocal skills, a true pop classic with its moody buildup, magnificent melody and soaring vocals. The other tracks are accomplished interpretations of sixties and seventies classics, like I'll Never Fall In Love Again, We've Only Just Begun, Bookends, Come Saturday Morning, Kristofferson's Sunday Morning Coming Down and Denver's Leaving On a Jet Plane. If you love obscure but unique talents from the late sixties and early seventies, you'll also appreciate the music of Lee Michaels, R. Dean Taylor and Michael Nesmith, all brilliant artists from the same era whose work has now been reissued on CD. And of course, also investigate the work of Paul Revere & The Raiders, an underrated band with a memorable sound who had great hits from the middle sixties up to 1971 when they reached number two on the Billboard Hot Hundred with John D. Loudermilk's Indian Reservation. Lindsay's work with The Raiders provides a completely different perspective on his musical abilities.

6523	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	...it seems ridiculous that an album of this stature -- an album so important to the development of contemporary bluegrass -- should still be on the market in such an inferior CD edition. I suppose it's indicative of Rounder's continuing disrespect for its own historic catalog that this disk features mastering and transfers that are nearly 20 years old, minimal liner notes, and no period photos or bonus material (and bonus material, both live and studio, DOES exist).


The real reason to get this is the superior transfer and mastering of the album while the two "raw" tracks are interesting the over all sound of the album has been improved. We gete an excellent 24 page booklet filled with rare photos, posters and comments from the band.
Indeed, much of Paul's work after the Fabs imploded is hard to take. But the fact is the strength of the Beatles was collective in nature, and each member served as a counter balance to the massive egos (not necessarily a bad thing) involved. And each member's solo work suffered the same inconsistent quality that plagued Paul.


8611	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Diamond Dogs was Bowie's first misstep since becoming famous, but his aura was so powerful that most people hadn't noticed. As far as the media was concerned, the photo of Bowie as a post-apocalyptic half man/half dog mutant provided more than enough fodder for their copy. The album's hit single "Rebel Rebel" helped to disguise the paucity of continuity on this album, but the fact remains that Diamond Dogs catches Bowie at a fairly uncertain moment in his career. Fed up with Ziggy Stardust, but unable to entirely throw that persona off, Bowie dabbles in various modifications of his image with this album. Unfortunately, none are anywhere near as convincing as his previous incarnations. The main reason this happens is simply because the material is lacking. Bowie was certainly an artist who was capable of pushing his image before his material, but he was always imaginative as a songwriter, too, so the material always seemed to come from some rarefied place.

Much of the concert material comes from the band's two albums that are most likely to outlast them by a long stretch: Wish You Were Here and the epoch-making Dark Side of the Moon. DSOM is in fact played in its entirety during the second half of the concert. The extraordinary artist Storm Thorgerson, who created all of the band's album art, contributes video and animation, in collaboration with the Floyd's producer and light man, Marc Brickman. The film is shown on the "pupil" of the eye-shaped stage, on a circular drop screen bordered, as is the proscenium, by strobes, lasers, and box spots. If, like me, you've had the misfortune of never seeing a Floyd concert in person, then this is likely to be your closest experience of their often breathtaking symphony of music, poetry, film, and light.

A word about the audio quality that has been addressed by several other reviewers.  While I would agree that it is not the very best I have experienced on my system, I found that the DTS track was far superior to the AC3 2-channel digital mix.  This is likely because the 2 channel mix was not LPCM and I noticed this right off when comparing the relative file sizes....the LPCM track would have been much larger and contained more information, hence improving the recording quality dramatically and therefore, likely, some of the less-than-pleased and deservedly so commentaries about audio quality. I normally just skip the DTS track, go directly to the LPCM track and play back in 5-channel stereo (thanks to a tip from Bob Carver) but when I did this with the AC3 track, I noticed just what some of the other reviews were talking about....a fairly empty, flat and truncated sound that did not do the performance justice.  So, I would highly recommend setting your systems so that you are sure to be getting the DTS track!

 At risk of playing favorites, Paul Winter and Paul Halley do some of their best work in "Return to Gaia."

And the several tracks that feature Susan Osborn showcase a wonderful and totally unique gospel voice that leads one to ask, "How do we get to hear more of Ms. Osborn?"

That the Nazis treasured Beethoven and used the Ninth Symphony, with its history of celebrating freedom of the spirit, as one of their signature pieces, created such anguish in me that it was hard to watch and listen.  And to see one of the most gifted and imaginative conductors of all time, Wilhelm Furtwangler, shaking hands with Josef Goebbels at a concert in honor of Hitler's birthday, made me want to cry.

While I agree Tool's music is quite hard to decipher on first listen, the diversity in each song is astonishing. Each piece is defined by thick threads of colours and inventive instrumentation. The weird sounds and eerie percussion in the intro of "Eulogy" suggest a somewhat droney track, but with the arrival of a big bass motif and processed vocals, the tone escalates to impossible heights, resolving with a richly melodic chorus and dense guitar theme blanketing the almost incomprehensible spoken rants atop weird effects and clear bass lines. Maynard's singing is more versatile than both Opiate and Undertow combined. He goes from fragile low registers to tortured screaming on "H." in order to match the flow of the song. This song has an amazing intro with awesome drumming and there is a killer guitar line in the middle where the same note is repeated over and over until it becomes addictive. This dreamy aura is then replaced as the band pick up pace and aggression towards the end.

As a teeny bopper in the early 70's, this was the first album I ever schlepped to the store and put down my own money to own.  It was pretty low risk - I'd heard at least four of the songs on the radio - AM, I think! - and they all were terrific.  I don't remember how much records were going for at the time, but I knew I was getting a bargain at any price.  This was the first music that I ever felt was MINE.
The best part of this album is perhaps that there is much more than "Slither" for you to explore, yes "Slither" is a great track and definately one of the best in the album, as Slash's guitars screams continisouly. But songs like "Fall To Pieces" and "You Got No Right" touch the softer side of the band, like Axl did in the case of "November Rain" with GNR. "You Got No Right" starts of with a great acoustic sound, and quickly shifts to a bluish guitar, that only Slash is known for. The album's opening song "Sucker Train Blues" sets the mood for the rest of the album, each song has a similarity of style to it, but at the same time each track is great in its unique style, "Loving the Alien" is exactely what I wa snot expecting from a hard rock band, but in definately one of the best songs in the album.

9786	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Okay, I don't get this one. How is this considered a total classic and the pinnacle of Bowie's career? Why is the extended  techno instrumental that wastes all of side 2 considered to be such a genius work of absolute mastery when really it's just a mix of lousy soundtrack-like material (i.e. "Subterraneans" and "Art Decade") and amateurish screwing around with a synthesizer (i.e. "A New Career in a New Town" and "Warzawa")? God, Bowie, you used to be great. Then you went all "artsy" on us. And Brian Eno (hey, that looks like "emo"! And it's "one" spelled backwards!) was kind of far away from his peaks with U2 and Talking Heads. It's like he said, "Okay, I've got a bunch of quirky synth loops, let's head to Berlin and make an album side out of it!" and Bowie was like, "Dude, I wanted to go there to kick my drug habits, so sign me up!" That's probably not even remotely how it happened, but I'm an aspiring novelist and we aspiring novelists like to embellish a lot. Anyway, there's precisely one superb song here, and it's not the annoying yet catchy hit "Sound + Vision". No, it's "Always Crashing in the Same Car", which actually does do something with the album's art-school weirdness. But it's one of the three normal songs that actually does anything (the others are "Sound + Vision" and "Breaking Glass"). Clearly, the good songs form a distinct minority. Because who needs "Be My Wife" or "What in the World"? Not me, that's for sure. Okay, maybe Bowie's rabid cult of purely obsessed fans (of which I am not part of - he's good, but not that good) do. But I think the three good songs should've been plucked out, placed with the first side (read: the "Good Side") of Heroes, and mixed with stuff from Lodger, which I haven't heard but expect is in the same vein. None of this sound collage crapola. Leave that to groups like the Talking Heads, who can actually pull that stuff off. So this is far from Bowie's best album - I'd recommend Hunky Dory, Aladdin Sane, Ziggy Stardust or Station to Station over it.

Band 12: Fyodor Chaliapin - 1933 (2:41) - A short, acted segment from the silent movie "The Maid of Pskov" (1917), followed by the 60 year old Chaliapin singing the "Chanson du duc" from Ibert's "Don Quichotte". The presence and acting are very fine. The voice is accurate, penetrating, thin and hard. The music is incredibly boring.

5207	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Long one of my favorite musicians, I think this is one of his best. Taj brings a zest to music that is hard to rival, not to mention his enduring career as an "out of the mainstream" musician. His cds can be bought so cheaply it's one of the true bargains out there if you enjoy his blend of blues genres. "Senor Blues" was issued in 1997.  On this album he brings some 60s flavor with a few tunes such as "Think", "Things Are Gettin' Crazy Up In Here", "Mr. Pitiful", and bit of country-style blues such as "Mind Your Own Business" featuring his trademark National Steel Guitar work. The title track "Senor Blues" is a cool smooth jazzy Horace Silver tune. I particularly like "21st Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man". As always Taj brings outstanding musicians to the studio always bringing a well-crafted product full of enthusiasm. I saw Taj perform live 2 years ago at 69 years of age and it was unbelievable how much energy he brought to the stage. He absolutely rocked the house.
Also, for drummers, "Toad" is a remarkable drum solo.  Ginger Baker tells a story with his drums, and it's amazing to listen to.  He uses double bass drums and incorporates them into the solo along with his playing in such a musical way that it's a true pleasure to listen to it.  In todays world of two bass drum players and double pedal players there are a lot of people playing a lot of technical wowie-zowie licks, but Ginger has them all beat on rhythms, taste, and creativity.
Love it or hate it, you surely can't ignore it. This CD gets my highest possible endorsement for audio cheese.

The movie had potential to be funnier than it was but wound up being far more disjointed than it should have been... it seemed like they were trying to do a "Hard Days Night" type of film. Another obstacle they faced was that Johnny Rotten wanted nothing to do with this film, and is only seen in the concert footage and interviews. The US tour footage was great to watch, they really should have released the Dallas and San Fran footage in its entirety here.
During several interviews conducted around the record's release, Ms. James was very critical of the finished product that was originally conceived as a Country project but in her telling, wound up as an abortive, unfocused collection of everything - and nothing. Well, with all due respect to the artist, she couldn't be more wrong. Love's Been Tough On Me is a tough, searing and unapologetic Blues-Rock manifesto that is as far away from Nashville as Somalia is from Rodeo Drive.

This CD is not only well mastered, mixed, and with great fidelity, but has some absolutely fantastic playing by four harp legends all on one CD. Unlike most CD's featuring soloists, the backup band on this CD is not horribly boring (see Riding With The King), in fact, it's actually very good and listening to this CD is just great fun from start to finish. Buy a copy, stick it in your car, and crank it!
The guitar sound on at least one of the songs, I think psychobobia, sound a bit like the guitars sounded on their 'Volume 4' album. As far as the singing goes, there's still just a tiny bit of that 'Tony Martin imitating Dio' even on this record. At least a tiny bit? After listening to their last album with Dio, Dehumanizer, Tony Martin does a better Dio than Dio. That's just a small part of his singing act so there's not much reason to complain. Tony Martin does really strain or hype-up his voice, in a cliche heavy metal style, something that Ozzy and Dio don't do so much. It works well/OK on some of the emotional songs on this record.
An added bonus about this collection is the fact that all the videos are in chronological order which makes it that more special and a great synopsis of her career.

This is an excellent (and economical) 2-DVD set. Disc 1 is Marley live at the Rainbow (London) in June 1977. A MUST for Bob fans. Check out his dancing throughout and spinning like a top onstange during "Exodus" and his prophet-like stance through much of the proceedings. Mostly tunes from "Exodus" and "Natty Dread." Powerful.
Sadly thrown on at the end is the terribly  politically correct, "We Are All Earthlings" which sounds more  like a propaganda song than the more tasteful (and effective) song about  discrimination, "Bein' Green."

This concert from 1981 featured a set list superior to Live At The Bowl and Live At Wembley and performed better, Roger still sang Im In Love With My Car even 5 years after they added it to the set. Unlike both Lives there was no additional musicians on this concert (onstage anyway) even though they were occasionally cropping up at concerts beggining in December 1979 when Queen first included Crazy Little Thing Called Love in thier set, additionally Freddie Mercuries bisexual lifestyle and smoking were in thier infancy (these would compromise Freddies showmanship, voice and gradually weaken his health by august 1986 and therefore force Queen to permanantly stop touring).

2930	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Styx, the most Mythical and musical rock band of all time put  on one of the greatest rock concerts of all time! This concert is a killer from start to finish. I got 'goose bumps'throughout the  set by the Melodious/Harmonious  voices of masters Tommy Shaw and Dennis de Young, these guys rocked the Chicago (home) crowd to classic Styx songs as Crystal Ball,Come Sail Away,Renegade,Blue Collar Man,Lady,Boat on the River and many more of their hits. The musicianship is a 10..Tommy and J.Y ripped through the crowd with precision 'Styx' solos tommy's acoustic performances on 'crystal ball' and fooling yourself is so heart warming he even played the  'mandolin' on  the breathtaking 'Boat on the river'!De Young trademark 'dreamy' keyboard was refreshing as ever, so was his showmanship. J.Y even rocked the frenzied 'Paradise' crowd to his  Miss America and Snowblind,Todd's drumming would have made the late John Panazzo really proud as it  really got emotional when the band paid tribute to him (John) as De young sang 'Show me the Way'.
Mostly though, this is an unpretentious, even low budget, DVD - no quality audio options, or fancy camera work, and even the concert has minimal stage lights/effects (there is a mirror ball and projected images of microscopic pond life though...). But the performance is great and the video work is adequate to show them doing it. For me, the highlight is seeing the teaser 3 minute glimpse of "Starship Trooper" during the closing credits. For the dedicated YES fan this is a 5 star must, especially if you weren't around for this era (focuses mostly on Fragile and Close to the Edge). For those more casually interested in the music, it's more like 3 star, and I recommend just spending your money on the remastered albums from the early 70's.

Without the extra tracks this sounds superb, as it was  intended to sound.

Over the years, a lot of nonsense has been written about Dusty, and within the alternative community, she has taken on the stature of a poster queen Diva. This kind of camp worship does her a disservice, because if we listen to her carefully, it is clear that she is, from first to last, a singer. Not an entertainer, composer or artiste; nor a role model, glamour queen or political refugee; but a singer. Her dedication to the perfection of her craft was legendary and bordered on the obsessive. She may have recorded hundreds of songs, but she respected each of them as an individual friend; accorded each the delivery and uniqueness that she felt the song deserved. Not for Dusty the over-ripe sentimentality of Barbara Streisand, the cynical egocentricity of Diana Ross, or the overpowered caterwauling of Celine Dion. For Dusty, the song always came first. The singer's job was to showcase the song, not the other way around: to find just the right tone and just the right shading to do each and every song perfect justice. If she found fame and adulation in doing it well, that was just a very special and fortuitous fringe benefit.

The hightlight of this DVD is the five-song medley with Robert Goulet that is so charged with chemistry and excitement, they literally shoot sparks through the TV screen. Wow!! What can be said about these two together? There was definite magic in the air when these songs were sung. One wonders what Sid Luft must have thought about the Goulet duet, because wow, the two of them evoked such loving passion for each other, perhaps staged, perhaps not, that was the equivalent of undeniable lovemaking right there on TV for all the world to see. THE SPARKS FLY, especially with Judy's "Through the Years" as the crescendo and "Love is a Lovely Thing" culminating in a carefree romp! I can watch this one over and over again and say with confidence it is the most outstanding duet I've ever seen. Judy is magic with Goulet, sheer magic, and Goulet rises to the occasion with each and every moment. You must, must, must check this one out. Don't be mislead by other reviewers on this DVD. The Goulet duet is fantastic, unbelievable, breathtaking, sensual, erotic, evocative, powerful and, like Judy herself, unforgettable.

 In "Ram On", he sings to himself "give your heart to somebody soon"("Ram on" is a punning reference to his old stage name of Paul Ramone in Hamburg); while in "3 Legs", he throws a couple of digs to his old bandmates("Your dog's got three legs, but it can't run/My dog's got one leg, and it has fun", or something or other), same with "Dear Boy"; the two big singles that accompanied this album in its original release, "Uncle Albert/Admrial Halsey" and "Another Day", are included on this disc, the latter as a bonus track alongside the unfocused "Oh Woman, Oh Why"; "Heart Of The Country" is very pretty and shows off Paul's newfound domestic bliss, while "Back Seat Of My Car" is rightly described as the most understated song of Paul's career.

If she imagined it would look something like Bowie's eventual Midnight Special 1973 appearance with some of the most terrifying stage costumes and makeup in recorded history, one can hardly blame her.

The flowing sound of some of the best songs ever in the history of rockn' roll. "Todays'" Pink Floyd has style, so presise and talented -and in my opinion (in this show) better than ever! Thank God Roger Waters left, we'd never had experienced this progress had he still dominated the band. I am a big fan of the Pink Floyd-albums he "headed" (or had a major influence on that is, and without doubt), but after "The Wall" and "The Final Cut" -well, enough was enough. The way he has critized David Gilmour, accusing him for never coming up with any workable ideas during their "creative relationship" -he has even called Phil Collins a disaster as an artist. Roger Waters, who are you to talk? I must admit Collins' resent albums are a bit uninspiring, but he is at least a far better musician than you'll ever be. In Floyd Waters was a consept-builder, David Gilmour was (and is) his voice and together with Richard Wright put the sound to Waters ideas (Mason too of course). And what a sound! What would "Wish you were here" have been without Wrights' tangents? Imagine the sound-picture then. And the title track itself without Gimours' voice and guitar? I usually don't give a damn about people hating post-Water-Floyd, but do not even dare to call David Gilmour a session-player. That was then, in the late 60's! An "ok back-up singer"? Oh yeah, you know what you are talking about, don't you??

9355	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The Roxy Mothers lineup, also appearing on "One Size Fits All", is one of the best bands ever assembled. Brilliant, seasoned musicians playing sophisticated, intelligent and vastly enjoyable music. A plus is that Zappa's attitude is personable and had yet to begin its descent into non-stop vicious disparagement of anything around him.
Don't believe some of the reviews you may see (AllMusic's review, for example). This is just as good (albeit much less accessible) as "Ziggy" and "Aladdin"..
Finally, in order to compare this CD with similar products (which is the best way to evaluate anything), I must say that Davis' album with Basie "Our Shining Hour" pales in comparisson with Davis' and Rich's "The Sounds of 66"
"Village of the Sun" is really the first song that actually wins me over.  The previous three didn't do a whole lot in that particular department.  The motown-inspired vocal melody concerning the subject of turkey farming is unique to say the least, and it's a very *good* melody too.  It sounds too sincere to be funny to me, however.
[4:49] Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey
The studio disc is very good.  Personally, I'm sick of people rambling on about "White Room" like it's a masterpiece or something.  It's a good song, but hardly their best.  "Sittin' On Top Of The World" and "Born Under A Bad Sign" are excellent blues songs with Clapton providing some superb licks.  "Passing The Time" and "As You Said" are forgotten masterpieces that Cream fans never seem to mention (they also never mention "Rollin' And Tumblin'" from the debut album, which is hands down their greatest studio song ever).  Both of these songs have a wonderful, haunting atmosphere that I just can't describe.  The warm, Christmas-ey feel on "Passing The Time" is particulary enthralling, with Jack Bruce giving his best, most emotional vocal performance ever.
"Get A Little" is highly representative of Zappa's late-sixties guitar style. With a bit of wah-wah pedal & some jazzy drumming, it's highly reminiscent of Hot Rats. "The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue" quotes from the jazz great, as well as proving how technically proficient and soulful this lineup of Mothers were. It's really one of the great Zappa parody/tributes.

1983	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Wow, what a spectacle.  That's all I could think of after my first Zoo TV viewing.  This is a great concert video, Popmart, 5 years later, is an overall better video.  The band sounds pretty good on this video, but not great.  And when it comes to U2, you've got to have standards, they are great, and they need criticism to stay great.  The highlights include "Pride" with an excerpt from Martin Luther King dropped in the center, very tastefully.  "The Fly" is probably U2's greatest concert song concept performance, ever, though sonically, it's just ok.  The band pulls out all the stops.  Gotta love Edge's belly dancer wife during "Mysterious Ways."  Also, gotta love Bono in his alter-ego Macphisto form.  I can't think of a better guise to perform such songs "Lemon" and "Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car" from 1993's dynamically creative "ZOOROPA," which reminds me I'm glad "Stay" is performed differently than those songs, because it is a different type of song for the ZOOROPA album and I'm glad it was treated accordingly.  One let down, I would've like to have seen a live version of "Acrobat" from 1991's "Achtung Baby," instead of perhaps "Zoo Station," or "Can't help falling in love."  Since It's a fantastic song and I've never seen U2 perform it live, I have to assume it's to challenging a studio song to attempt to pull off live.  Which is a shame since it's such a thrill to see songs like "Lemon" and "Discotheque" (Popmart), because you know you'll never see those songs performed again live outside the period they come from, in U2's history.  This was a groundbreaking tour, and you have appreciate the sheer balls it took U2 to bring this kinda tour up, change their style, music, image, and maintain their insane popularity, because they never drift from their message.  Love and chaos.

As for the production of this DVD it is the best. Sound wise the music is clear. You hear every thump of the conga drum and pluck on the bass guitar. It did at a few times seem like it was a little hard to hear Jerry Garcia singing but that would be more attributed to the microphone that was set up for him to use and not from the production of the DVD. Picture wise is pretty good but not crystal clear. Considering however they had to use videotape that was at least 25 years old to release it on DVD it is not bad. And before anyone says anything about that I am aware there were points during the production of this DVD where they purposely play with the picture creating a kind of psychedelic image on the screen. I am talking about those points where they weren't creating these images where it picture quality is not totally clear. It doesn't take away from the concert itself. there are bonus features to the disc including bonus songs there were not included during the main portion of the concert.

While this album may not be quite as transcendent as `The Who Live at Leeds', it is richly textured with just about every flavor of bizarre performance popularized by Zappa and the Mothers up to that point. The final selling point is that I wish I had seen this performance rather than the rote exercize I saw in Baltimore.

2163	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is a great Black Sabbath album and the best of the Tony Martin era. Cross Purposes is loaded with monster riffs, great vocals, memorable melodies and flawless production. Alongside 1992's Dehumanizer, this release proves that Butler and Iommi should never be apart as writing partners. Tony Martin drops most of his power metal, vibrato vocals and sticks to a heavy blues style, which shines through out the record. Geezer's contribution lyrically and musically is evident and manages to bring out the best of Iommi and Martin. From beginning to end, this album does not disappoint; highlights include I Witness, Dying for Love and Evil Eye. Sadly, this line up was short-lived. Butler and Iommi were at each other throats and eventually went their separate ways.

4677	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Most people said that Steely Dan's reunion tours of the early 90s were some of the most "unlikely" musical events of the decade. So naturally, when "Two Against Nature" was released in 2000, fans and critics were elated with both glee and anxiety; it was their first studio release in twenty years, but after those twenty years, perhaps the odds were not looking kindly on Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Becker said "I think the audience for Limp Bizkit is probably not going to be interested." Fagen added "Compare the names Steely Dan and Limp Bizkit, you have the answer right there." But a break in the Top Ten and four Grammys proved everyone wrong; "Two Against Nature" won Album of the Year, fortunately beating Eminem for the honor, a feat that's not bad for your first album of new material in twenty years.
Third Eye is also an incredible number and showcases the bands ability to write long songs without boring you. The song begins with an excerpt from a late comedian that the band admired telling a joke about how drugs have brought us some of the greatest music.  Some have said that Lateralus is a better album but I just don't agree.  Aenima has such raw emotion and so many great songs that there is no way that is inferior to Lateralus. I don't think Tool is for everybody but if you want more than just your average mainstream hard rock then you won't be disappointed.

With some of the old school sensuality, such as a Marvin Gaye or Teddy Pendergrass mixed with todays upbeat tempos R. Kelly's 12 Play is a unique blend of senuality and soul. Other great tracks on this album include, Your Body's Callin, Summer Bunnies, Sadie, and the title cut 12 Play. It's my favorite R. Kelly album and probably my favorite album of all time.

 Recorded on November 16th, 1964 in London, England, the DVD features the mother/daughter duo of Judy and Liza and shows not only are they two of the greatest singers, but it shows the love they have for one another. Liza was only 18 when this was filmed, but she performs like a complete pro, while Judy shows she still has the pipes and the presence. Liza looks amazing with the black hair parted at the side, and I have to say I really like seeing her pre-"Cabaret" look. However, you can tell Judy has aged. She was only in her early forties, but obviously having her variety show on CBS cancelled just eight months before really took its toll on her. Nevertheless, she proves she's still the entertainer everyone loves. I love her wittiness and banter with Liza and the audience, and she especially loves it when the fans help her sing "Over the Rainbow". Watch Liza's expression as she watches her mother perform this song. There is absolute love in her eyes for her beloved "Mama".

Very rare interview promotional clips where the shinning moments of this DVD I honestly can not remember any Depeche Mode videos (VHS) or DVD containing this much interview footage (which is the short film listings) outside of Depeche Mode 101. The best interview was indeed the Gambaccini/Anton interview for the "Songs of Faith and Devotion" album with the surprising interruption from the "Mystery Women". The video collection was interestingly missing a few videos but the videos that is featured was converted to digital nicely and the quality was stellar. This is a great collection but don't expect everything counting when looking for every little bit film concerning the music media. This would have received 4.5 stars (if possible).

This show, recorded at the El Macambo in Toronto at the very beginning of his career, is a gem. Yes, he's nervous and trying hard to prove himself, but there's no denying greatness when you see it. This show reminds me of the very first time I saw him in NYC with a friend of mine. We both play guitar and know a lot about music. We were impressed at his technical abilities for the first 5 minutes; then we thought he was just showing off and trying too hard to impersonate for the next 5; then our mouths were left hanging open for the rest of the show. We had never seen anyone play like that with our own eyes. It was like my unfulfilled dream of seeing Jimi Hendrix live. This show is very much like that first concert. Everyone in the audience knew that they were witnessing someone who will be regarded as truly great and original. This show is a must have for any SRV fan. I would also highly recommend this one as well, which showcases the beginning and end of his career, providing a stark contrast of his development as a musician:

This is easily one of the top 5 CDs I own (of around 1000).  If I didn't like it, I wouldn't have now bought it 6 separate times (due to being stolen, scratched badly, etc.) since it came out.  It's everything a great rock CD should be.  It's one of a few CDs (all of Tool's plus some others) that I can listen to all the way through.

9680	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Frank Zappa during his late 60's/early 70's instrumental period is quite the special talent.
Those who suggest this disc is musical propaganda are correct. Kris Parker's general message here is that the police are not to be trusted, the educational system is failing to pass on the achievements of black Americans of the past and of African culture, and that sometimes a black man's only friend is his firearm. He uses an intense vocal delivery while musically smooth rhythms take some of the edge off the bitter pill. Reggae flavors turn up often, being most pronounced (ironically enough) on "Hip Hop Rules". The group also make time for a nod to the beat box sound in "Breath Control".

The record (literally) stands as irrefutable proof that Mel Torme was one of the truly phenomenal singers and musicians (not to mention authors), perhaps the closest male equivalent to Ella Fitzgerald, the first Lady of Song.  His voice may not "cut" with the expressive depth of Sinatra's, but he compensates with an agility bordering on the superhuman.  His elocution at any speed reminds me of prime-time Danny Kaye, but unlike Danny, Mel could swing.  And when he sang a ballad he was closer to the purity and joy of Ella than the tragic pathos of Sinatra, both equally legitimate approaches and satisfying outcomes. "Scatting," I would agree with Miles and Mingus, is over-rated, but if it's scatting you like, there has never been a male singer as proficient as Mel.  Moreover, like a few other polymath musicians (Lionel Hampton comes readily to mind), Mel was a proficient drummer.
The key element here was probably the inclusion of Guitarist Joe Walsh, whose guitar playing provided the kick behind "Life In The Fast Lane" and the slink in the album's title track. Along with "New Kid In Town," these hit singles made listeners around the world take note of the seamy underside of the American Dream that had slowly disintegrated in the post-Watergate years, when disco-fueled cocaine cowboys would sell you "paradise" in little boxes as they laughed up their corporate sleeves.

Being [..]back then I did not really absorb the lyrics till years later, what I loved then and still love today was the production, the way Tribe infused an unforgettable blend of Rap, Funk and Jazz. The short intro "Midnight Marauders Tour Guide" echoes in my head years later, which is followed up the upbeat "Steve Biko" (Stir It Up). "Award Tour" is simply outstanding; love the beat, chorus, and lyrics to this cut. The beats get darker and the topics more substantial on cuts like "8 Million Stories", "Suck N****" and "Midnight". Then Tribe flips it back to more laidback tracks starting with the party cut "We Can Get Down", which is followed by the excellent "Electric Relaxation" a track that has Tribe talking to the ladies backed by an addictive beat.  The Tribe continued to shine on "Oh My God", the smooth "The Chase Pt 2" and "Lyrics to Go". The closing track "God Lives Through" finishes the album off on a high note. Reflective, fun and intelligent lyricism matched with Ali Shaheed Muhammad's out of this world production make "Midnight Marauders" an album I recommend for every collection.

2367	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Some people began to rediscover Cyndi Lauper with the release of her "standards" album AT LAST almost two years ago.  Predictably, if you look at reviews posted for that CD, you'll find any number of "Who-knew-she-was-so-good?" commentaries.  Well, the answer is that many of us knew all the time and supported her throughout her career, even in the darker days when eveyone and his rock critic brother was eager to write her off as an 80s novelty act.
The wry, innocent and often whimsical nature makes it fodder for elitists (some turned their nose to his homespun efforts), but when heard from today, "Ram" has a nice spare sound that benefits Paul over some of his messier and over-produced creations in the coming years with Wings. Witness "Ram On," which should be an immediate throwaway with its simple melody and repeated lyrical couple, but in a modern view, has a quiet beauty that's difficult to ignore. For the next thirty years until "Chaos and Creation," this would remain arguably Paul's best solo album, and even though the man never did create a masterpiece single-handedly, that honor shouldn't be ignored.

3513	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is a great comeback and my album of the year candidate. The reason? Variety. It's hard to imagine a more diverse musical melting pot; there are even songs in two languages! Supernatural has long and short songs, instrumentals, a wide range of vocalists and percussion styles, and in what comes as no surprise, a wealth of great guitar. Besides the two radio anthems (the chant-along "Smooth" and the hauntingly beautiful "Put Your Lights On"), the standout tracks include "Love of My Life," which, despite featuring Dave Matthews, whom I normally dislike, is one of the better tracks due to a long guitar solo. Also, there is the magical moment where Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton trade licks on "The Calling." No matter what kind of music you like, there is probably something for you here.

The entire setlist for this particular concert can be viewed on the Sugar Mountain web site.  Looking over that list, there are a few numbers I sure would have liked to hear in an acoustic mode, such as 'Powderfinger' and 'Southern Pacific', but I'm sure Neil would tell me to buy a ticket.  There is really only one classic tune resurrected from the complete concert, that being the pump organ (yes, pump organ) rendition of 'Long May You Run'.  While I suspect there has never been a poor rendition of this wonderful song about Neil's Hearst, this version is my least favorite.  The solo acoustic version from 'Unplugged' and of course the original Stills-Young Band recording outdo this performance, but it's still a pleasure to hear. 'Harvest Moon' is included, although the studio track and the 'Red Rocks' video version are superior.  A rare recording of 'Philadelphia' from the 1994 movie soundtrack is offered as well.

I think for the band (who could not get a major label deal for this cd) the Future Publishing company was a good choice to start. They sell and make the Classic Rock magazine/cd that you can find in some US book stores. The package comes in a HUGE cardboard package- with Debbie's face front and center. It also has the cd in the middle of the cover in a plastic case. Once you open the package you get a double sided poster and 6 buttons from some EMI 45 singles of the past and 4 postcards. The magazine is the best part of the package- well non cd part. It had interviews with Debbie, Chris and Clem and shorter ones with Leigh, Matt and newest Blondie member Tommy. Also short interviews with the producers and the creater of the cover art. Plus an overview of the albums and collection of hits and videos and photos. It is a very well thought out and produced special fan pack indeed.

Altough it is not as regarded as some of the other albums from the period, it is just as great (or maybe better) the the other albums Elton John produced at that early time.
1750	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Marc Bolan certainly had his ups and downs as far as popularity goes.  He went through a lot of changes in his music and at times, apparently began to believe the hype a little too much.  Having said that, I have to say that I was and still am a big T.Rex fan.  I picked up the CD to see if it was worth spending the money to buy the DVD.  After listening to the CD once or twice I knew I had to get the DVD. When I got the opportunity to pick up a copy of it and see him perform live for the first time, I jumped at it.  I picked up my first T.Rex (and Tyrannosaurus Rex) albums in the early 70s.  He never quite hit it as big here in the states as he did in England.  Then he was gone. Almost 40 years later, I have the opportunity to see him I never had then.  Watching him perform live in concert really shows how much he loved what he was doing. Watching him perform reminded me of such greats as Angus Young and Chuck Berry.  I suspect he influenced the former and was influenced by the latter. Rarely have I seen a performer who seemed to be having as much fun.  The actual movie gets a bit strange at times, but the version of "Tutti Frutti" rocks with a very young Elton John ripping the keyboards.  For me, the two recorded concerts are the gems of this 2 DVD set, with the extras such as the interview with the drummer (the only surviving member) and the story of the restorations with Marc's son being icing on the cake.
13. Loving the Alien-5/5-A lot of people could say that the Revolver ends with a wimper rather than a bang, as this is a slow song. I love it. It's a return to songs like "Creep" and "Wonderful" where Weiland shows a lot of feeling through his voice.
Very good album overall. The only two Springsteen albums I like better are "Nebraska" and "Born to Run" (and I've heard them all)

"Madman Across the Water" was the cusp of the quest that would be fully realized on Elton's next album, "Honky Chateau". However, while seeking his sound, Elton managed to demonstrate an incredible potential that was broadly manifested on this album.
Some of the clips may seem dated now ("I Want Your Sex", anyone?), but most hold up incredibly well.  "Kissing a Fool" is the best of the "Faith" era tracks, and one of the finest songs George has written - maybe his best.  And the video presents it beautifully.  "Freedom '90" might be the best video he ever made in which he did not appear, but it's fantastic all the same, with the supermodels of the period filling in.

But if you answer "no"  to the above and you like the union of truly gifted musicians, to form to  create an entity more powerful than any of the individual members. The  choice is simple: Tool is your band. Aenima is your album.
"Yessongs" opens up with (a somewhat slower version than the studio version of) "I've Seen All Good People."  It's a good start to the concert, featuring the skills of all of the members.  Jon Anderson's unique voice, although not captured as well here as on any of their albums, comes through as well as the sound quality will allow.  Chris Squire's bass work and vocals show why he was an integral part of the group.  Wakeman has a few good moments, but mostly is hidden behind his huge sequined cape.  The show really belongs to Steve Howe and his incredible guitar work.  Especially during the first half of the concert, Howe is the primary focus.  Here we see one of the most talented and overlooked guitarists of the 1970's.  Most of the music itself is very good, except for the "Wives of Henry VIII" which is all Wakeman.  Part of what made Yes great was the uniqueness of their sound, the feeling that they were playing music from another world.  The sounds were great, but they were ahead of where the video/audio technology was at that time.  In the year 2001, we are used to well-produced video, great effects, and digital audio.  Unfortunately, none of these elements are present in "Yessongs."  I would really like to find out if the band was filmed in their later years with a better video/audio set-up.  Until then, the best way to experience Yes is to put on one of their CD's, sit back, and close your eyes...

He made me a deal, and I sure did pretend we were walking home.  Who else but Bowie would have woven together the apocalypse, 1984, messianism, and homo-eroticism?  Living in Gay Lib New York, much of "Candidate" sounded like a song about cruising and dish and drugs on or near Christopher Street leading down to the river where you could jump if you really thought "boys, boys, is a cheap thing."
Other great songs on this album include the club tune "Love House" and one of her few, non-dance pop songs, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now." Both songs round the top four songs on this album, and the other songs are good, but less memorable than these.

Actually, this is a great little chiller because it had a few ingredients other horror films seem to lack these days: real suspense, eerie soundtrack, and a really good sense of tension.  Quite enjoyable for the thriller-lover.  recommended. (and a good excuse to skip the next famly function or join planned parenthood).

Things get a little weird and less Christmas-y at this point, as Liza and Tracy show Judy the new song and dance number they have been working on - Steam Heat doesn't really scream Christmas.  Finally, we get Judy to ourselves again singing Little Drops of Rain while all the kids are putting the final touches on the Christmas tree.  No sooner is she finished than guest Jack Jones arrives singing Wouldn't It Be Loverly, after which he sings, at Judy's request, Lollipops and Roses.  Lorna then climbs up on Jack's lap and does a wonderful version of Santa Claus Is Coming to Town; once she gets started, she really lets the sound pour out of her, making this my favorite part of the entire show.  After Liza sings Alice Blue Gown, she, Jack, and Judy launch into a medley of Jingle Bells, Sleigh Ride, It Happened in Sun Valley, and Winter Wonderland.  Judy pretty much lets Liza and Jack sing It Happened in Sun Valley, but she delivers a beautiful solo of Winter Wonderland.

Well, if there's going to a single disc of Bowie's greatest hits, this would probably be it for me.  This is available only as an import and is the best place to get "John I'm Only Dancing," which was added as a bonus track on one of Bowie's Ryko reissue albums--I think it was Ziggy Stardust.  Also included here is "Fame 90," which is perfect if you don't want to buy the Pretty Woman soundtrack.

Now I have it and it is great,that is if you can get pass the horrible 80's clothing and hair. The song selection is great,the musicians are in top form and Jeff Berlin. What more could you ask for. For the people wondering what the plus in the title is for, I have an answer for you. It means they play ABWH songs in addition to Yes music. I am very happy with this purchase.
BTW ... the DVD includes 22 cuts while the CD version of this concert only has 17 songs and totally exclude five  SUPER tracks
6891	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album, like any of the immediate post-Beatle solo albums, is a must have for Beatle completists; it's much meatier than Paul's first solo offering, "McCartney", which relied heavily on instrumentals and leftovers from the Beatle days; here, Paul understands the fact that he's on his own, and looks forward to his own sterling career as a solo performer.
Yes, I know. Ashley Hutchings also left, but at least per musicianship Dave Pegg blew the socks off of Hutchings on the bass. Also, one can hear on the first two Steeleye Span albums where Hutchings was going. Super, "Trad. Arr. by". Really to the point of being almost academic, or didactic (?) in nature.
8990	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Tool is definitely different than ANY other band out there.  Love this album for it's pure kick ass style.  This is probably the hardest album from the band.  I saw Tool live in Hawaii back in 2002 at relatively small venue.  I was just getting into Tool at the time and I have picked up every album since I saw them live.  If you ever get a chance to check out a concert.....go!
I had to change this review because I had spoke of this album as being bad and overrated. I was wrong.  When I first heard this album, I hated it and immediately got into bad moods.  I tried listening to it again to see if I'd like it and wow, I found many great songs: (Stinkfist, Eulogy, H, and Aenima.) ....but I still felt in a bad mood after listening to it.  After a thousand more listens, I finally found the genius in the album.  And wow, I was amazed, and finally liked ALL the other songs: 46 & 2, Hooker, jimmy, Pushit, (Yes, I know the appropriate name.) Third Eye, and even Dier Eir Von.
Perhaps the most memorable moments of the concert come from Nicks with her performances of "Landslide" and "Sliver Springs"--the latter's inclusion a personal victory, for she had long battled with Buckingham in an effort to place it on a Fleetwood Mac album and release it as a single.  But although Nicks' star quality tends to dominate the proceedings, both Buckingham and Christine McVie equal her every inch of the way.  Buckingham offers incredible guitar solos, particularly on "So Afraid," "Go Insane," and "Big Love;" watching his hands pluck the guitar is simply poetry in motion.  And Christine McVie, famous for the cool detachment of her full-throated vocals, offers stunning performances of her best Fleetwood Mac numbers, including "Over My Head," "Say That You Love Me," and "You Make Loving Fun."  John McVie, as usual, fades quitely into the background to perform his miracles on bass guitar, but Mick Fleetwood is flashy and showy and devilishly fun on the drums--and together they create the backbone that gives the soloists support.

Tools music is great, how and why anyone would compare them to a awful noisy band like the deftones is beyond me.
Still, this set does, to a huge degree, encompass the massive musical reach of Zappa, and taken piece by piece will provide revlelations about many corners of his approach.
gotta buy this one, if not youve got to see it to know what a rock concert can be like! and its even better in surround sound!
9387	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite album by Tool.  It features some of the best guitar  riffs ever written, dirty but intelligent lyrics, and fat, chunky bass  lines.  Maynard James Keenen, the lead singer, has an incredible voice.  I  especially like his singing in "Stinkfist", in which he makes  cool vocal melodies.  If you're into melodic metal, you should check this  out.
There are no extras, this being an early DVD, but there is an option to enable on-screen lyrics which is a nice touch if you're like me and want to know what exactly is being sung.
These three players were the core of The Elektric Band. Guitarists Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios joined them on various tracks. The first thing I focussed on was Dave Weckl's drumming. I'd never heard anything like that before; especially the way he combined electronic percussion with his acoustic kit playing. And of course his amazing drumming abilities!

Who's That Girl
I am an Axl Rose fan in a huge way.  But my main concern isn't because of that fact.  I just think that Miles has a sound too close to Axl's.  Velvet Revolver worked so well because Scott Weiland had such a different sound and there never was a reason to compare the two.  But with Miles I hear enough similarity that I can't help but compare.  And it doesn't go in his favor...  It isn't his fault and I don't hold it against him.  But I don't think he's a good fit for Slash on a continuing basis.  It reminds me of Coverdale/Page.  There's nothing wrong with David Coverdale.  The man can rock.  But he is just too similar to Robert Plant for Jimmie Page to be playing with him and it only lasted one album.  I think the same applies here as well.

The video would have been enhanced with the old regimental band, or any of the current bands of the Royal Armored Corps that were still around in 1998 when this was made.  Still, it is a nice production with some great scenic views of Scotland.  The pipes & drums have combined tourism with tradition here and it is a winning combination.  Interesting to add that the CD released under this title has some slight differences in the music chosen.  More 6/8 marches are used in the video for the marching I guess.
"Rainy Seasons" is ample evidence that Cale's post-Velvet career has outlasted those of his bandmates, even Lou Reed. Cale has always maintained his avant gardist sensibility while Lou Reed, for better or worse, has stuck with his original black leather, NYC street hustler image that marked his Velvet Underground years. Cale's back catalog is a wealth of undiscovered treasures. What is most striking about this live performance is the passion and immediacy Cale brings to all of his classics. It's a revelation that Cale's music is better suited to this accoustic format, because his strikingly original classically influenced piano is not drowned out in a wall of guitar noise. In performances with a band, Cale generally sticks with a guitar, which he doesn't play with nearly as much conviction as piano. Cale's expressive voice simply works better with a piano.

So I was shocked to hear my family's reaction:  "Wow, that food was so spicy!  I could hardly eat it!  My eyes and nose were running!"  My family are adventurous types and not whiners, their systems were just not prepared to deal with any level of those spices.
 Then Jerry came along they became much more slick. Don't get me wrong I love just about everything they do. This one has that raw touch to it. Little Liza Jane is outstanding. I miss Adam Steffey he is in Dan's band now. They were a working Touring band now there are side projects that take away from what they once had. I saw this version of the band on the Boardwalk in Ocean City NJ for I think 18 bucks. Now this April they are in AC NJ and the prices are over 100 bucks.

But the transfers are very poor.  Where TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY is concerned, unless you happen to be among the fortunate few who has the original videotape release, you are pretty much out of luck; at present there is no such thing as a good DVD release, and this particular version is no better or worse than the other releases available.  On the other hand, there are considerably better transfers of SUDDENLY and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM out there--and while these are not the worst transfers I've seen, they are far, far from the best, and the transfer of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM is particularly dire.
This concert was great.
8597	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	What a great artist David Bowie was in the 70's he took so many chances - that would seem almost like rock and roll suicide - but somehow he always was on top of the game and way ahead of his contemporaries. 'Diamond dogs' would be his strangest and darkest albums looking to the future like Ziggy but in a way that does not glorify it like the starman did - this is not a pretty future.. There are many great moments on this album - but it is more of a whole than it is pieces - it all fits together. This is one of my new favorites.

Okay, producers, this is great - now how about Lili Marlene?!!!
Good job!!!
After viewing the DVD and trying the techniques once, you will see that it instantly works, and you will feel empowered.  It is very cool to be able to take your baby from a fit of rage to absolute peace and tranquility in seconds.  It is simple and effective.

Twenty dollars is probably the cheapest insurance you will ever buy to keep your baby happy.  Or you can continue to walk around your house, rocking your baby singing at three a clock in the morning, you decide.
 After a few peaceful tracks of basically underscore, 'Field of Dreams' comes with it's wonderful accoustic guitar solo, very beautiful. 'The Library' is where the rock groove returns on sounding more etherial on synth flute-like sounds.

The first disc is basically a slightly re-worked version of the original DVD. The main menu, while it is nothing terribly fancy, is still an improvement over the menu on the original issue of the disc. This menu has the logo from the cover as the background image, and you are given four choices: Play, Video Selection, Interview with Depeche Mode, and Short Film. The Video Selection menu has the electronic Depeche Mode logo in what kind of resembles a spaceship hangar. The video selection is broken up into three groups of videos to choose from (the groups contain seven videos each). The other options on the menu take you directly to what is labeled on them. If you use the Video Selection menu, the disc will play the video you choose, and then continue playing the remaining videos in sequence.

Profound, joyful and powerful in its expression, the emotion inspired by Paul's work can sometimes be hard to put to words. #2, Kyrie, is one of my favorite pieces, opening with the mournful sounds of the humpback whales.  #4, Mystery, beautifully showcases the voice of Susan Osborne in all its power and majesty.  #10 Stained-Glass Morning is an absolutely stunning combination of  Eugene Friesen on cello with the sounds of birds making this short piece feel as though it takes place under the trees in a forest.  But every selection is wondrous-and each selection is a work of art to be reflected on.

The problem for The Eagles was that one song pretty much defined this album, and the group.  Try listening to this album without "Hotel California", and you will find some decent, well-played songs.  Many of the lyrics are very inspired, and this would have been a hit-making album.  Add back "Hotel California", and you have an album that becomes a musical icon for a group and a generation.  I love this song (like nearly everyone else that likes The Eagles), but this album is more than one song.  As an album, it is one of my favorite Eagle albums.

Tool are not the worst band to ever pretend to be meaningful. The A Perfect Circle album proved, if nothing else, that Maynard can sing when he feels like it, and rare parts of "Aenima" are alright simply by virtue of not being atonal. Apparently, this band means a great deal to many people, and really, that's just great, as far as I'm concerned. We all have our own ways of getting through life. But when people start claiming that Tool is some sort of incredibly deep intellectual "experience," the time comes to take them aside and argue the point with them.

The first thing I did when I opened the package was to read the 64 page booklet inside. The quality of the booklet, the research, and the writing provides the context needed to understand the Zombie story. After that I listened to all four discs. The quality of the mastering is first rate throughout. Overall, if you only know the Zombies by their three singles, take the leap and buy this box set. You will not be disappointed. Instead, you will be enlightened at how broad their talents were, how convincing they were at both R&B and Pop, and how the Oddessey & Oracle material was way beyond their time.

This is a must-have for anyone interested in Hip Hop. Now, to the content, which some find controversial.  KRS delivers hard rhymes on the ills of the modem industrial food system, the modern education system, the dangers of chasing money and status, and, very interestingly, the complicated life of the black so-called middle/professional class.  Great album for the music as well as the lyrics.

2165	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In 1994, Ozzy, Dio, Terry Gillam were all past tense. Tony Martin was at the helm of Black Sabbath along with original bandmates Iommi and Geezer Butler... sharing the credits in writing. 10 total tracks clocking in at approximately 47 minutes (liner notes complete with lyrics). Newcomer Bob Rondinelli is downright amazing on the drums. This is a slick and polished hard rock album. It definitely has a majestic/gothic feel to it with the storied lyrics and keyboards in the background. The 2 opening songs "I Witness" and "Cross Of Thorns" are diamonds in the rough as far as hidden metal gems. "Cross Purposes" sounds in the same vein as "Headless Cross", "Eternol Idol", and "TYR"... but it's a stronger album song for song. Tony Martin resembles two of my all-time favorite singers... John Sykes (lead vocals/guitars with Blue Murder), and the dwarf Ronnie James Dio. Even better, you can probably find this on the bargain rack with the other Tony Martin Sabbath albums mentioned above. Fans of Sabbath, Dio and Blue Murder rejoice. Truly an underrated hard rock gem (5 stars).
It's odd, this is a band that sometimes plays badly on purpose, and it sounds RIGHT. Proper technique can sometimes be a detrimint, and "Uncle Meat" proves this. It takes a little concentrated listening, but once you enter, you probably won't want to leave.

Maybe just knowing it's really Devo is what makes it fun.

Geezer stuck around with Black Sabbath and made the most of the  opportunity to meet Tony Martin, and the effect blew me away the first time  I listened to this album.  From the first crushing chords of "I  Witness" to the melodic and beautiful "Dying for Love" to  the grim "Evil Eye," the '94 release grabs you in a hammerlock  and never lets go.  What we have here is a strong album from start to  finish, with the only letdown being "Virtual Death."  If you ask  me, it sounds an awful lot like a corny ripoff of Type O Negative, with  none of the wry humor or societal bashing included.

6793	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I've only listened to this disc once since receiving it.  My first Elektric Band CD I bought in 1988: _Eye of the Beholder_.  By then Chick had a more or less permanent lineup until after _Beneath the Mask_.  I think the addition of Frank Gambale after the CD in question made a huge difference for the better in the band's career.  In my opinion, the best disc by this version of the Elektric Band is _Inside Out_, released I believe in 1990.  The tightness of the band at that point is what is suggested by the pinball game on the cover: machine-like, which to some will be offensive, but to others will be something superhuman and awesome.  I'm a bass player, and it's nice to hear where Patitucci got his start; but if you want to hear him realizing his own vision, I suggest especially his first two solo albums (_Patitucci_ and _On the Corner_).  His experiments with world music also merit attention.  The first two Patitucci albums happened before he moved from the Smith-Jackson Contrabass to the Yamaha stuff.  If nothing else, the first Elektric Band album is a good place to hear a bit of that Ken Smith bass - though I was disappointed that some tracks seemed to lack bass guitar entirely.  On the whole, a lot of tight bebop riffs and stuff, but I'd move on to _Eye of the Beholder_ and _Inside Out_ if I were you.

Narrated and hosted by daughter Lorna Luft and featuring interviews with Sid Luft, Tony Bennett, Melissa Manchester, Liza Minnelli and Mort Lindsey amongst others, it provides a fine illustration of Garland's career after she left MGM in the early 1950s as a "washed-up" 27-year-old.

7994	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Fotheringay" was the album Sandy Denny released after she left Fairport Convention, when that group decided to explore traditional English music more and Denny wanted to continue writing songs (the title comes from one of the first songs she wrote for Fairport).  On this 1970 album Denny wrote four of the tracks, with "The Sea" and "Winter Winds" being the best of the quartet.  There are also covers of songs by Bob Dylan ("Too Much of Nothing"), Gordon Lightfoot ("The Way I Feel"), and David Cousins ("Two Last Weeks in Summer") of the Strawbs, with whom Denny had recorded an earlier album.  Ironically, the best track on the album ends up being the traditional song, "Banks of the Nile," a Napoleonic Wars-era story-song ballad, and very much in the style of "A Sailor's Life" and "Tam Linn" that Denny did with Fairport.  In addition to Denny on Guitar and Piano, the group consisted of Trevor Lucas and Jerry Donahue on guitars, Pat Donaldson on bass, and Gerry Conway on drums, with everybody joining in on the vocals.  The one serious complaint about the album would be the vocals by Lucas, which does not compliment Denny's sublime vocals, even when he is singing his own song, "The Ballad of Ned Kelly" (and even though the pair married shortly after this album was produced).  But the album ends on a strong note, with Denny's expressive vocals on "Two Weeks Last Summer" and "Gypsy Davey," and serves as a potent reminder that she was the pre-eminent British folk singer of her generation.  "Fotheringay" is not quiet as good as "Unhalfbricking" and "Liege & Lief," but its best moments match any on those classic Fairport Convention albums.  Together, they make a nice Sandy Denny folk-rock group trilogy.

The angel of death coming for someone, telling him, "It's time we should be going" is what "Look Back In Anger" is about.  The galloping rhythm guitar and drums continue throughout the song, and a worthy guitar solo in the middle.  The best of the three singles and probably the best song on the album.
A deeply beautiful and heart wrenching thing to watch. Words fail. Simply jaw dropping.
9780	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Out of left field is generally what comes to mind when I think about `Low', Bowie's electronic masterpiece released in January 1977. The album is wondrous and strange much like the man himself and it very much seems before its time. The sound production with loud thunderous drums, shimmering guitars and avant-garde synthesizers is probably the best of its era. That being said, `Low' is a very difficult record to enjoy and demands patience, especially if you are a conventional rock fan, like me. The "proper" songs are all decent with "Sound and Vision" and "Be My Wife" being the best though the former is anything but a "normal" pop song! "Wife" like many of the songs contains snippets of autobiography such as David recalling his descent into drug addiction and depression which almost drove him into insanity. 'Low' served as his catharsis as he found himself working with a new collaborator (Brian Eno) and two old ones (Tony Visconti and Iggy Pop) in a new city, Berlin, though much of the album was recorded in his old studio in France (`Pin-Ups').  Much has been discussed of the LP's bizarre all instrumental second side, led by the haunting "Warszawa".  Though dismissed as too weird at the time of its release, `Low' became highly regarded for its influence on the `80's post-punk and new wave acts and his since grown immensely in status. I would prefer Ziggy or Aladdin, but hey, I appreciate the man's genius and that was found in abundance as David Bowie kicked off what became known as his `Berlin' period, with a weird little record called `Low'.

I think it's the quiet of it and the charm of some of the cuts.  Warnes voice is so clear and haunting in its ability.  When I need to feel quiet and calm this is the one I go to.  "Lights of Lousianne" is as close to an adult lullaby as one could hope to hear, and it often brings tears to my eyes.  So, if you're looking for music that is good to listen to as you drift to sleep, or you just need to take a break from the tumult of the day, I'd recommend this one to you.  It might not be the most earth moving music you've heard, but it sure does calm you down.  Always a good thing for most of us!

As the title suggests, the majority of the material she sings comes from her most recent CD, "Eden".  Sarah's  gorgeous costumes, the red curtain draping over the stage, the candles set  around the orchestra and the dancers all help to create a surrealistic  atmosphere.  This video is a must for a Sarah Brightman fan.  The only  reason I didn't reward it five stars is that it seems in some of the  selections that she is lip synching, which takes away from the experience  very much.  Still, it's a treat to watch and hear.

Contents-wise, I've always thought this was a terrific record. Sure, it's not "anthemic" in the way Townshend's songs typically became when he recorded them with the Who. This album displays a lighter touch, which is probably understandable, since Townshend on his own recorded most of the parts ... and he did not play bass as fluidly as John Entwistle, or drums with the maniacal abandon of Keith Moon.

I have to be honest and admit that I only brought it to see David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick's performance...Martha Reeves and Mary Wells were okay, but as I said, they were not the reason for my purchasing this. And why was Curtis Womack there, just because he was Mary's boyfriend at the time? His appearance simply was not necessary. In contrast to everyone's dressy attire, Curtis came on stage looking like he was prepared to clean out the garage or something. Mary did well enough to handle the songs by herself. Martha's voice sounded a bit odd to me during her performance - kind of shrill - not the voice that I loved so much on "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave", "My Baby Loves Me" and "Jimmy Mack". She can still sing, granted - but her performance is one of the reasons why I always skip past it to get to Eddie and David.

Her best register is mezzo, and she generally sings low-tessitura parts in which she can be very  effective.  Yet, her voice is not low enough (plus it is too feminine) in  order to sing male roles convincingly.  Unfortunately also, she has quite a  bit of vibrato in her upper register where her voice can spread  uncomfortably when pushed.  Nevertheless, the sheer beauty of her timbre  compensates for the occasional technical flaw.  I enjoyed this disc, but I  most cherish Lorraine Hunt's performances as Medee and Phaedra in two  stunning recordings with Les Arts Florissants.

  If you are thinking of buying the Blizzard of Oz cd , Sharon and Ozzy decided to be greedy again and cut out the band members other than Randy and re-record the parts in order to not have to pay these guys who made Ozzy famous again . These 2 are super greedy. I went to Ozzfest a few years ago to see Iron Maiden and their stupid daughter Kelly Osborne and her friends had been throwing stuff at Iron Maiden while they played due to the fact that people said Maiden was better than Ozzy on that tour. Maiden left the tour and I did not get to see them. This dvd is typical Sharon Osborne greed .
This album doesn't have as much juvenile overtone as the 'PolyGram' c.d. does.

The style of the doors ranges from Baroque to modern pop rock with plenty of variety in between.  Each of the doors is intended to express an emotion, or so the liner notes explain.  I found it a very enjoyable essay, but the emotional content is more intellectual in nature than visceral.

The performance took place on their newly designed stage and the lighting effects were captured well.  The camera spends equal time on all the members of the group and there is significant audience interaction.  Audio and video are above average for a live performance.  If you like hard rock and metal this DVD is essential.  It captures one of the most creative, enduring, and significant bands of our times.

You Got No Right-10/10: Probably the slowest song on the album, it has Weiland's heartbroken vocals that are perfectly followed up by the soulful instruments.

But as with the other volumes in this series, it's the joy  of getting to hear infrequently anthologized gems like Little Caesar's  "Those Oldies But Goodies," the Dubs' "This Could Be  Magic" and Billie & Lillie's "Lucky Ladybug"; as well as  the more familiar hits like Dion's "Drip Drop," Buddy Knox's  "Party Doll," and Little Anthony & the Imperials' "Tears  on My Pillow."

I'm not saying that this is a bad album.  It's actually pretty good - but not nearly as great as their later stuff.  So, if you aren't familiar with Tool I would suggest you start with "Undertow" or "Aenima" or "Lateralus."  IMHO, those are more likely to more smoothly introduce you to the unique and intricate music of this incredibly talented band.  You'll probably buy this album later on, to complete your collection.

Containing tracks from 5-6 of his original albums, it is the perfect collection for anyone wanting to get introduced to Yanni. It includes the 'Live at Acropolis' concert track 'Aria', and recorded versions of a few others, but still has enough additional tracks to make it worth a purchase for someone who already owns 'Live at Acropolis' (which was the case with me). For the album, my picks are 'In the morning light', 'One man's dream', 'Once upon a time', 'Quiet man' and 'The end of August'. The later tracks on the album especially represent the softer Yanni music (as mentioned in Amazon.com review also). Overall, this is a collector's album for all Yanni fans.

To have them in great soundig remastered true stereo instead of the "electronically rechanneled for stereo" is the icing on the cake. I don't have a SACD player but got to listen to it ona friends. As incredible as the stero mix is the SACD is amazing. The definition is almost scary. Of course all this would mean nothing of the songs didn't hold up but there isn't a bad one in the bunch. I've even aquired an admiration for Spill The Wine, which I disliked when it was originally released. Highly recomended! To hear equal remastering of lighter material check out the good Herman's Hermits comp that came out at the same time.

I remember being puzzled when Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign asked to use the title track "Born in the U.S.A." in 1984. I think everyone was puzzled. The song is about a disillusioned Vietnam vet. Springsteen declined the offer. "Downbound Train" covers the familiar territory of lost love but is particularly affecting. The smoldering sexuality and intense longing of "I'm on Fire" alone is worth the price of the album. "No Surrender" looks back on the energy and intensity of youth with an irresistible dance beat. "Bobby Jean" is classic Springsteen fare, a lament of a relationship lost to time and big decisions. "I'm Goin' Down" is bummed out over lost passion. "Glory Days" captures the spirit of getting older by articulating -and perhaps mocking- nostalgia for youth. "Dancin' In the Dark" bemoans life's drudgery and longs to start that fire and get into the action again. 12 songs. 48 minutes of music. "Born in the U.S.A." isn't among Springsteen's best albums, and the juxtaposition of styles is awkward. It's his "mass appeal" album. In that, it succeeded spectacularly, introducing the Gen X to one of America's great songsmiths. Lyrics are included in the cover art booklet.

The resulting product was the best sounding record of Smith's career to that point. And, thanks to his partnership with Wayne Kirkpatrick, it had the lyrical muscle to back it up.
Sucker Train Blues-10/10: Starts off with a crazy guitar riff behind a police siren that perfectly sets the stage for the album, you're in for a crazy ride! Weiland's vocals immediately take center-stage, and he shows us he can still sing with the best of them! Great chorus that really enhances the song, plus as a treat you get great drumming from Sorum and a crazy solo from Slash!

Classic Albums takes you a behind the scences look at one of jimi hendrix's most succesful albums. The story is told in rare archival film footage, music, and from a diary kept by a hendrix employee. Their are many great interviews from the members themself Mitch Mitchell, and Noel Redding as well as keyboard virtuoso Steve Windwood. I think the best part of the film is Eddie Kramer who engineered the electric ladyland sessions. This film is loaded with fascinating footage of Jimi Hendrix in the studio. I think from one perspective we can all appreciate how great Electric Ladyland really was.
The album is also interspersed with brief comments from them both, remarking on the music and their careers both together and separately.

7919	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	These two works are perhaps the most recorded of all clarinet music.  Amidst the competition, what makes the Shifrin version stand out?  First of all, Shifrin's choice of the historically correct bassett clarinet (look  carefully at the CD cover and you'll see Shifrin holding two  clarinets...the slightly longer one is the bassett clarinet) distinquishes  this recording from many others.  The use of the bassett clarinet (which is  actually the instrument for which Mozart wrote the concerto) allows the  pieces to be performed "the correct way" (shorter than the  bassett clarinet, the modern clarinet can no longer play the lowest notes  in the concerto; these unplayable notes are usually moved up an octave for  performances).  However, the mere use of a "historically correct"  instrument does not make this CD special (after all, the use of period  instruments is quite popular these days...Sabine Meyer and Anthony Pay have  both recorded the Mozart clarinet concerto using the bassett clarinet).  Rather, Shifrin's warm and smooth tone is what makes this CD a must-buy.  Some may consider his tone to be velvety but weak, but I find it to be  highly appropriate in the Mozart setting (instead of a more brilliant tone  that many clarinetists are striving for nowadays).  Shifrin's playing style  is quite conservative (though he does sport a slight vibrato); no radical  interpretations should be expected here.  This is a great CD for students,  professional players, and music lovers alike.  While Robert Marcellus's  famed recording of the concerto with the Cleveland Orchestra may never be  surpassed, David Shifrin comes very, very near.  In any case, Marcellus has  not recorded the clarinet quintet (either that, or this recording is really  hard to find).  All the more to purchase the Shifrin CD!
The first five songs particularly show a wonderful range of styles and compositions ranging from the solid pop of "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon" to the heavily orchestrated "Madman Across the Water" and "Indian Sunset." The lyrics were occasionally murky and often misquoted.  Yet, there was a lot of power in the piano and the backing arrangements were incredible. The still maturing voice of Elton was new and different at the time, and appealed to a broad array of audiences trying to find stability after the psychedelic and turbulent 60s.

This edition of "Smash" is based on the "rougher" of the two mixes available, the same one that showed up on the old, Repertoire CD. My promo copy of the disc doesn't have a mastering credit, but whomever was responsible did unfortunately boost the levels somewhat. It isn't too bad, but the original Repertoire disc does sound a bit better thanks to its lower level of compression.
 Bowie also sounds plenty of sexy on 1984, easily a standout track on the album with its disco-esque beat and Bowie's sensuous vocals (toward the end, it sounds a little like Mister B is having an erotic crescendo!)

On later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.

5911	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album best sums up the greatest contribution of the Beach Boys to rock music.  Many people will argue that Pet Sounds is their greatest work.  However, this album is a soundtrack to the fun-in-the-sun portion of the  sixties.  Even today, this music best portrays beaches like Santa Cruz and  Pismo, where a good time is inevitable.  The harmonies on "The Warmth  of The Sun" really do reflect the warmth of the sun, that can only be  felt on a beach.  "In My Room" and "Don't Worry Baby"  are classics in their own right, destined to be part of the classical music  of this century.  "Surfer Girl" is to Brian Wilson, as  "Yesterday" is to Paul McCartney.  The music might be considered  simplistic, but simplicity is deceptive, so don't underestimate this album.  The  songs...the harmonies...all reflections of Brian Wilson's artistry at  its peak. Absolutely essential...

"Goodbye" is a requiem for the album. It seems to express Taupin's ambivalence about his profession, celebrating his status as the man who shares his soul ("And if you want a drink just squeeze my hand and wine will flow into the land, and feed my lambs") while fearing our attention will quickly stray ("Just turn back a page, I'll waste away, I'll waste away..") It's a touch melodramatic in context of the rest of the album and probably would've served better as a coda to his concept album about the songwriting process (Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy).

I must admit I have not heard very many other period-instrument recordings of these works, and therefore cannot compare it with, say, the Wallfisch recording.  I had the pleasure of attending a masterclass given by Wallfisch, and found her to be an excellent Baroque violinist, musician, and teacher.  I am sure her CD will be wonderful.  However, the Manze/Podger recording certainly beats any of the modern-style interpretations I have heard.

4964	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have nearly every CD created by Anne Murray.  Her earliest recordings are not nearly as good.  But she changed bands and added some effects and the rest of her songs are absolutely beautiful.  Her contralto voice is mellow and sensuous.  "What a Wonderful World" is a 2-CD collection of beautiful inspirational music.  This is not of a church choir style.  She sings alone or duet with a background trio perhaps and the songs are a great mix of slow relaxing hymns to upbeat spirituals to lift any spirit on a personal dreary day.  The young may not enjoy her as much as the older more mature person, because the young would not recognize the songs.

3. "Hamlet/It Was a Very Good Year" (Ervin Drake, Don Ralke) - 7:45
Passing the time - a pretty, mellow track for bookends, which works well as a lullaby kind of song (The Red Hot Chili Pepper's song "Porcelain" is also a song that works well as a lullaby, but not as a pop/rock song). The middle part of this song is more hard rock, with slapping drums and a driving rhythm with the bass guitar. Also features a glassy percussion effect and the vocal melody sounds familiar...perhaps from the Sesame St childrens' tv show, for the song "Inchworm".
And finally, the ending.  I admit that I wish they had done "Outside the Wall" first, but I love "The Tide is Turning" and I'm glad it was performed here.  I also truly believe that Waters should perform "The Tide is Turning" at Barack Obama's Inauguration because it would fit perfectly.
S.T. BLUES - the music is very GnR.  Thank God we don't have to suffer through Axel's scorched throat!  The chorus reminds you of an STP song.  So right away, the listener is introduced to the players.
As a spotlight review said, this version Amazon sells has only the movie. Ok, it's worth your money, but you can get a better version paying almost the same. The extras in the other edition, the one I own, are the amazing videoclips Let's Go All The Way (from Bizzar) and Tilt A Whirl (from Bizaar) and the hilarious commentary by Violent J, Rude Boy and Alex.

2408	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Personally, I can take or leave most of the first disc of this Pink Floyd concert DVD. The performance on disc two of the entire "Dark Side Of The Moon" album makes this DVD worth the asking price. It is an improvement on the original classic album and even better than when I witnessed the original four members of Pink Floyd perform it on the "Darkside" tour in 1973. To call this performance stellar would be an understatement. All the backup musicians along with Gilmour, Wright and Mason create an amazing lushness that deepens the dynamics of the original. Two drummers, two guitarists, two keyboards, three female vocalists, extended instrumentals and new rythymic grooves working their way into the familiar songs from this great, yet overplayed album. It becomes new and refreshing. "Dark Side Of The Moon" is a mood album that should be listened to in its entirety; not individual cuts mixed in with the other garbage on commercial radio - not even individual songs mixed in with Pink Floyd's other hits as I witnessed on the "Delicate Sound Of Thunder" Tour. This "Dark Side" performance on Pulse is something to behold. I've watched it five times. I've always believed that "Dark Side Of The Moon" was Pink Floyd's greatest accomplishment. There are three ways to enjoy it; the original album, the 5.1 surround-sound remaster of the original album and the ultimate experience of watching Pink Floyd and company on this DVD with 5.1 surround-sound.
2666	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Having just seen this mess of a performance on Trio, I'm glad I didn't purchase the dvd. If you watch carefully, you can see from Jimi's facial expressions that he is not happy with his performance or the band's or both. The band sounds unrehearsed, the playing is sloppy, vocals are missing. Jimi does try his best to salvage things with some interesting solos but that as brilliant as it was, can't save things. Some songs in very raw form- Machine Gun, are trying to listen to. Yet on the other hand, 'Red house' is quite good. Sound quality is nothing to brag about, sounds like an old 8-track transfer-raw. I wonder if Jimi would have approved of this release, based on the way he takes his guitar off at the end of the show and slams it down on the stage, I think not. The serious fan will pass this one up. Hopefully, the Hendrix estate will choose future releases(both audio and dvd)more carefully.

The majestic and introspective "Warszawa," (pronounced vaar-shaava) could almost be a substitute soundtrack for the silent film Metropolis.  It evokes the sight of one beholding the vista of a futuristic city.  What were his thoughts when he created this lovely piece? Was it the ruins of post-War Poland or the industrial wasteland of the Communist years?  Or perhaps it was a mirror of Bowie's own inner self.
It's hard to describe why I like the songs on Beyond Belief, especially to someone who's not a Christian. The music is catchy, arena-rock in presentation, guitar-driven, melodic and emotional all on its own. It's truly upbeat and driving music, very well produced and played. But the lyrics take on a whole new meaning when you understand the spiritual insights behind them. To the Christian, these songs are spiritual kicks in the [rear] to dig deeper into the Christian life.
I like this CD and I'm happy to see the Velvet Revolver members rocking again, and apparently drug-free.  Weiland, Slash, and Duff have each almost been killed by their addictions, so it's great to see them alive, successful, and trying to stay clean.

For those of us still keeping score, the on going feud with John here on vinyl (or as now is the case, digital memory).  The first track "Too Many People" is his public letter to John blaming him for the break-up.  "Dear Boy" extends the letter less sharply; "Smile Away" chides him for his alleged body odor; and "Long Haired Lady" takes the refrain of "Well, Well, Well" from Lennon's 'Plastic Ono Band,' a song expressing sexual angst, and counters it with Linda singing sourly, "Do you love me like you ought to do?/Or is this the only thing you want me for?" after Paul mildly crescendos and parodies the refrain.

They sound more like Gary Puckett & The Union Gap because they were produced by the Union Gap's producer. But I like both so I like this. It has all the solo hits of Mark Lindsay I remember, especially the title tracks of each album. I seem to recall "Silver Bird" being used in a motorcycle commercial around 1973. There are about 5 tracks on the CD that weren't listed in the description here whe I ordered it, like the medley of the Beatles "Long & Winding Road" & "Yesterday" that were apparently too slow for Stars On 45's Beatles Medley disco tune of 1981. Those 2 songs actually sound pretty good together. There are also tunes from Jim Webb & Neil Diamond, though the packaging gives no songwriter credits to each song. But I like the Collectables label. They keep most of their products in print for years, unlike Collector's Choice, which seems to take stuff out of print in the blink of a eye.

Bowie's palette is so broad on Lodger that it overwhelms. It is hard to fathom what sort of imagination could conjure the stream of consciousness reverie of "African Night Flight" as well as the dream-state playfulness of "Red Sails", only to accurately capture the mental state of a frustrated wife-beater with "Repetition" and reflections on mortality suggested by the beautiful "Fantastic Voyage." Throw in a Turkish-inspired melody ("Yassassin") and what might be one of his hardest-rocking songs ever ("Look Back in Anger") and you've got a full-blown masterpiece. This point is only driven home by the fact that it sounds just as futuristic/contemporary today as it did in 1979. If Bowie is a genius, then the evidence lies herein.  A+  Tom Ryan

This album is a labor of love on the part of everyone concerned. But, aside from Pete hisself, credit must go next to Paul Winter, who, over a span of more than 30 years, was an acquaintance first, then a fast friend, and, with the release of this album, collaborator, creative director and executive producer.
'Maria Maria' and 'Smooth' are the unavoidable  smash hits from this album that I'm sure everybody and their momma has  heard. But even for someone like me who doesn't listen to the radio at all,  there is plenty to love in the other tracks. I like that kind of stealth  quality that gets pop listeners into my kinds of grooves.
And to let you know: I saw this concert on tour, and it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, concert I've ever seen. So, I have nothing against the music or the visuals or the band. I am a total Pink Floyd nut. I am only nailing this DVD because of the limpid, heinous sound.
Like many artists of his generation, his popularity waned, but he recorded some albums in the 70s and 80s.  Shortly before his death 1995, Curless recorded this disc.  Curless suffered from health problems throughout his life, but his voice was still strong.  The songs are emotional and reflective.  As he sings, "I'm just an old cowboy, living in changing times."  This is country music the way it was and should be.

While the material is not new, the presentation is, these two gunslingers faced off in Paris back around 1981, during a European tour, Buddy Guy with his smokin' Chicago guitar, and Junior Wells rippin' up the place with his legendary harmonica, both sharing lead vocals, and both harmonizing with each other and their instruments.  All of the fifteen tracks found here are pure southern roots blues, delivered with conviction, in the manner necessary for pure blues to be heard ... acoustically.

I have heard their music on the radio, but had never been to a concert until last Christmas. If you ever get the chance to do so, it is definitely worth whatever you have to pay for your ticket. If not, at least try out an album. They play fantastic arrangements of the usual Christmas songs and carols as well as some their writers have come up with. Definitely worth hearing at least once!
I feel that given Lennon's wicked sense of humor,that these three records are probably more of a put-on to all the Beatlemanics,art critics,music industry boffos,etc.
Tool's goal is to let their art speak for them, and Aenima does just that. Maynards lyrics and delivery are powerful enough to move and vague enough to allow the listener to create their own interpretation. Guitar/bass/drums/vocals blend and function together as one instrument.

In fact, it produced 7 hit singles which also received heavy airplay on MTV. This all contributed to Bruce's transformation from rock outsider to pop culture icon - almost to the point of parody. But Bruce, through his integrity and authenticity, managed to hold on to his true identity and continue to make great music.

I don't know if people were calling this album a sellout of sorts back in 1976, or perhaps people loved the two biggest hits so much that nobody noticed anything was a bit off with this one.
But my favorite song on this album is the last track "Strange Way to Save A World".  It is subtitled Joseph's Song and it is guaranteed to touch your heart!  So many times we hear about Christmas from Mary's viewpoint (in songs such as Mary Did You Know, Breath of Heaven, etc).

Regardless of what they did later, "Opiate" is a crunchy hard rocker.

Their music is hard to describe, blending many genres, providing unexpected twists and turns, evoking diverse emotions (often simultaneously), with all of this always conveyed via superb musicianship and sound quality which is beyond just about anything else out there.  They strike me as artists who are genuinely unique and interesting people, have a clear artistic vision, and have a virtuosic and perfectionistic ability to make their vision a reality both on albums and, as we experience here, via this live DVD.

Falling out of love with Classic Rock sometime in the late 70's, I didn't listen to it much again until recently. Hearing it now, I enjoy "side" 2 much better than side 1, which puts me firmly in the minority of most Eagles fans. This may be due to my overexposure to the radio hits on side 1, but also because I love the Joe Walsh and Randy Meisner songs on side 2. They provide a nice break from Don Henley's singing, which is great but tends to produce "listener fatigue" when he handles too many of the lead vocals (and lest you think I'm not a Henley fan, "The Boys Of Summer" is one of my all-time favorite songs, period).

Although it's already dated eleven years, evidenced by the inclusion of Patrick Moraz as a band member (who left the group in '89/'90), it is a great repository of high-quality vintage performances, home movie footage, and 1990 interviews with the four band members.  Also, this is the only place to find the MTV-style music videos for "Your Wildest Dreams," "I Know You're Out There Somewhere," "No More Lies," and the 1989-remake of "Question."  This is the closest that the band will come, I believe, to releasing a music video anthology as well as a documentary.  A nice companion piece to the Royal Albert Hall live DVD...now let's just hope this means that the classic and essential "A Night at Red Rocks" concert will find its way onto the digital format.

Keenan sums this music up in one line: "Stepping through my shadow, coming out the other side."  The album is dark, oppressive, challenging.  Accept the challenge, though, and you will find your perception of the world changed in ways that cannot be undone.
If you don't have this album yet or are new to the band and already like their newer stuff I would recommend purchasing this. That is if you desire to hear the roots of the band known as Tool.

"Pretty Maids All In A Row" is somewhat reminiscent of Joe Walsh's work on his first (and best) solo album, 1973's Barnstorm. "Pretty Maids," like most of Barnstorm, is a nice deviation from Walsh's more well-known guitar rave-ups. It was written with Barnstorm-mate Joe Vitale, and has a dreamy, richly-textured production, utilizing piano (Walsh) and synthesizer (Walsh & Glenn Frey). It also has some nice percussion work from Henley and, as usual, heavenly background harmonies.
There is a good vibe on this concert, the TV panel in the background is quite effective as it takes you down memory lane showing you their clips from various decades! The trio are all dressed in black, false setto or ordinary singing tone, they are hear in this vibrant concert still going strong after all these years! This 3 people deserve a gold medal for singing these songs so and keeping their fans and new generations of fans! Writings songs for such famous movies like Grease and Saturday Night Fever! They should be so proud of what they have acheived throughout their lifetime. Excellent song choice, great harmonies and good covers chosen!
Anyway, I think this is a nice release, and once they get into the actual portion of the show that features Deep Purple, it's fantastic.

CD3 - The rare mono version of the album, originally released only to U.S. radio stations as a promotional album (Capitol/Apple MAS-3375).  Unlike most mono promo LPs of the day, which were simply folded down from the stereo mix, Paul went ahead and prepared genuine mono mixes.  No radical differences from the stereo version, except that the guitar parts are more up-front.  This CD is exclusive to the Deluxe Edition, although a separate mono vinyl LP is available.

Pink Floyd outstanding performance and music selections will certainly make history. One point however stands beyond my comprehension: why there is no DVD version available so far for such a great show like this??? Hard to believe it and hard to accept it!
Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.
When I first heard Budgie (1976) I kind of didn't know what to think. It was a different sound but yet showcased a talent not seen then or now if you want to go there. The amount of talent in the three artists is immense.
As a novice to this music genre like me becomes more familiar with these beautiful songs, the better they sound and quickly become favorites. Bocelli has three guests during the concert: one of which has become quite famous in her own right since this appearance: Sarah Brightman. Also joining the famous Italian tenor with a few duets are Nuccia Focile (a little too soprano-ish for me) and Zucchero, who reminded me (with a better voice) of Joe Cocker. One of the videos is also a duet, with Bocelli and Marta Sanchez, a pretty woman with a nice voice. The scenery in that video is really nice, too.
Just buy it, Enjoy it, "Don't worry it's truly worth it "!!
9695	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This was the first Zappa/Mothers of Invention album I ever bought, way back in 1969. I literally learned how to play lead guitar by playing along with this album, which I still have. It exposed me to the possibilities of "rock" music that goes far beyond what I was into at the time (Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, Cream, Blind Faith, etc.). It opened up my ears and my mind  to all the musical possibilities, including a twisted sense of humor, often lacking during much of the late Sixties music scene (think Doors and Jefferson Airplane - deadly serious bands).
P.S: Take your time with the records. They're not suppose to be catchy but rather an infinite trip opposing tedium and commercial mediocrity.
Band 10: Rosa Ponselle - 1936 (6:02) - A very memorable segment from some MGM screen tests, where the 39 year old Ponselle does an outstanding job with the "Chanson Bohme" and the "Habaera" from Carmen.

01. Nightmare On my Street: Along with "Parents Just Don't Understand", this was one of the blazing singles that so-called gangsta posturing "fans" passed off as novelty fluff. It was easy to dismiss the two tracks when you see the cheesy videos from 1988. Regardless, this is a straight banger and opens the album brilliantly. It showcases this duo at their best with memorable production and storytelling inspired by the 1984 film "A Nightmare on Elm Street". You may notice that the CD version of this song is a radio edit, clocking in at 5:00. My cassette & vinyl versions run 6:20, but I barely notice a difference.
  3. Amazing Grace
All in all, this is a memorably great  album. It'll last.

My own personal complaint (though not all that huge) is the ironic lack of structure in an overly structured effort.  Each of the 99 trillion notes here are often placed in a well planned out fashion, but some songs as a whole do have the "jazz syndrome", i.e. they go on for quite awhile, and one gets lost as to where they are in the song unless one is tuned in to the musical "conversation", which often requires much effort.  That's a side effect of the otherwise noble attempt to combine the freedom of jazz into an almost song-like format.  The only thing that helps you stay with it is either a) having the audio actually memorized in your head (which I do since I've listened to this 8 million times) or b) like with the purpose of jazz, staying with the "communication" of the soloist.  It's just that that is very hard to do with the music of Chick Corea, as his brain is on another planet.  Sometimes it's also very difficult to stay with the rhythms of genius drummer Dave Weckl.  Thus, I probably give this an aesthetic rating of 4 stars, though since that is just my inferior brain talking, there's no reason to call this anything less than a 5 star accomplishment.

6240	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	From the very moment I saw him perform with Joe Cocker during the Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour I knew I had found an absolute gem.  To this day, when I listen to "A Song For You" I understand and know the essence of this man who is a fine and consummate musician, brilliant writer and thrilling performer.  Leon Russell has been underrated throughout much of his career but thank God he has been given the recognition he fully deserves from his peers in the world of music. In 2011 he was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  This man has worked with everyone from Gary Lewis & The Playboys to Phil Spector to The Rolling Stones to Herb Alpert to Elton John and on and on and on. There is no artist worth a tinker's damn who wouldn't give his or her eye teeth to work with him and on this debut album we find the likes of Bill Wyman, Steve Winwood, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Delaney & Bonnie, George Harrison, Joe Cocker and Charlie Watts! Russell's trademark "Tulsa" sound is a fusion of Rock 'N Roll, Gospel, Blues, Country and Pop and he has played all of it as one of the best "session men" in the business.  This one is MY personal favorite of his albums and I always look forward to anything he is involved with.

It just gives the listing of the contents of the DVD with the ability to hear the Vespertine vids in 5.1(which is awsome by the way). I would have liked to see the little duck floating along the screen as it does on her website,or some other kind of animation. A bit of music here would have also helped. "Frosti" would have sounded nice here. The sound is very good,if not excellent. All of her videos are nothing short of classics. If you are a Bjork fan or not, you will enjoy this DVD.

To my mind, Procol Harum is a band that resides in the upper echelon of popular music from the late 60's through the 70's.  They always had a symphonic classical air that permeated through their music although they were equally capable of gentle folk embellishments as well of rock. Incredibly unique and amazingly talented, each album offered more and more incredible lyrics married to scenic moods of composition. We owe this mainly to Gary Brooker (the primary vocalist, piano player, composer) and Keith Reid (lyricist extraordinaire). Secure within their own genre, they are just as formidable as any other famous pop-rock team from this era.

So that song formed the backdrop for fumbling, awkward Peter Paul Markin over in Adamsville, Massachusetts near the beach as he tried to figure out girls, figure them out in a hurry, figure them out in a very hurry since he had a date down at that very beach coming up in about two hours and after having dolled himself up enough (hair brushed, underarms coated, breathe freshened and re-freshened) he was fretting, fretting whether  his arranged date (arranged by his corner boy Frankie Larkin, as usual) with Susie Murphy would product any sparks. Or another time, speaking of sparks, when he, riding "shotgun" in Frankie's big old 1959 Dodge as they pulled, girl-less, into the Adventure Car-Hop Drive-In, looking to finish the busted evening out with burgers and shakes (and maybe a free look at Lannie, the hot new car-hop) and he spied her (name a secret , a secret unto death, just in case her descendants see this) a couple of cars over with her girls, boy-less, and she looked over and gave him the greatest come hither look of his uneventful young life. Or better yet, when he was at the freshman mixer, kind of new in town, kind of low man on the totem pole of the school etched- in- stone pecking order, he was feeling kind of blue (and, as usual, girl-less, school dance girl-less) holding up his end of a wallflower wall with head down, Luscious Lucy Lane (that is what she was called by one and all, including her parents) came over and ordered, ordered if you can believe this, him to dance that last dance school dance with her.

Guest stars of Jack Jones and Mel Torme spotlight the various numbers that inhabit this 50 minute special of song and dance. Jack's number with Judy and Liza is priceless, even though it was clearly evident he was looking at cue cards constantly. Mel's rendition of his song with Judy  "The Christmas Song", is quite touching, with Judy making a small error in the lyrics and Mel playfully pointing it out. Great television!
9641	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Frank Zappa was not known for his serious nature.  He was very good at pointing out the silliness and stupidity of just about anything that could be conceived.  If there was one thing (besides family) that he took seriously, it was music, and he really did not take most of that too seriously, either.  His rock compositions were big jokes as far as he was concerned.  The only reason that it was as complex and involved as it was came from nothing less than the force of his genius.  At the beginning of Yellow Shark, he off-handedly asks to audience to "get serious" (before asking them to put panties on one side of the stage), and one gets the impression that he is at least a little serious.  Lord knows, if Frank is serious about it, maybe we should be, too.

10. Overflowing  (7) Another Radio friendly track
'Ram' rose to number two on the album charts in mid-1971, and remained in the Top 100 for 37 weeks, a testament to its quality despite the widespread panning it received in critical reviews.  It's really a shame that McCartney has had to endure so much undeserved criticism over the years for what his music isn't, rather than having his work appreciated for what it is.  Being a Beatle certainly had a down-side.  But be advised that 'Ram' is as much an unheralded masterpiece as any production associated with a Beatle could be, a disc sure not to collect much dust on whatever shelf it may grace.  Paul once remarked that he couldn't understand how anyone could listen to this disc and not enjoy it, and I wholeheartedly agree.  It's a five star effort.

This album gives you a taste of solid R&B. Silky ballads like the two aforementioned tracks are accompanied by songs like "Come Closer" and "Keep It Right There" as well as the two best tracks, "Thoughts Of You" and "All Is Not Gone". Not one song here is fast-forwardable.

I thought Stevie's band played very well they looked sharp especially the lead guitar player and main drummer and backup singers sounded great.  The highlight of the show in my opinion was "Stand Back".  I liked seeing Stevie play the Tom Petty cover of "I Need to Know" I thought she did a good job.  I thought the drum solo was interesting and the fact that she thanked her fans at the end of the show instead of during the show showed a lot of class. Stevie seems like a very good person and I would buy a ticket to a show if she came through my town.

PS: Regarding the people who talk about the inability to copy songs from this CD, I'll conclude by saying GET A TAPE RECORDER.  Yeah, it's old school , but it's also much easier to use, no viruses, no hidden programs, and a heckuva lot cheaper than an Ipod.


As an example, there is my favourite track - track 8 ('Gifts of Forgiveness').

I have the Eagles CD "Hell Freezes Over" and the version of the song "Hotel California" on this CD is not even close to the album I am reviewing now.  The song is done live on "Hell Freezes Over" and it does not have the original quality sound.  I would recommend this CD over the "Hell Freezes Over" CD.  Just a tidbit if you are looking for the original "Hotel California" song.

The sound quality is excellent except for the over dubbing of crowd applause that is more than occaisionally annoying. The only other flaw is the poor quality stage lighting makes a complete mess of the color production. The Possums Jones boys led by the ever faithfull to GJ, Ron Gaddis is tighter than ever on this one. I notice Mel Tillis' lead guitarist helping out here and a fiddle player from N.C. that is without question the finest that I have ever seen. Combined with the finest players in the land and the finest C&W ballad singer in the land, this is Country at its best. I will share many enjoyable hours with my friends enjoying this one.

Despite some incredibly cheesy moments, I had a lot of fun and laughter watching this DVD and will again in the future. My copy was purchased from an amazon partner. The packaging said it was region 3 (this was not mentioned by the seller), but it played just fine on my US player. The package also listed a number of songs that were not on the DVD. These and all other songs are listed in the order that you would hear them if you had purchased the CD version. However, what is actually on the DVD is much different.

9439	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have the exact same feelings as some previous posts.  Tool should not be classified as a rock band.  They should be classified as an orchestra.  The song writing in this album, I feel is bordering on (and i'm a violinist)  the Mozart level.  The way that they weave and twist the guitar melodies,  drum beats, amazing vocals, and underlying bass rhythm is beyond me.  Each  song is a masterpiece, a journey.  That's not all, the album as a whole,  feels like one large, well, opera.  Each song is perfectly placed, the  intermission fill material just adds to the experience.  This cd was  designed to be listened all of the way through, no shorter.  The listener  is taken on a journey as they flow through the truly original songs.  And  nothing is repetitive.  Everything is in sync (no, not 'nsync).  All I can  say is that if you want to hear what a really true metal band sounds like,  a band with amazing talent, a band that has the song writing capabilities  with the likes of Led Zepplin, Lennon, and Metallica, all in one, then  Aenima is a must buy for you.
3. Roger Waters made a mistake in choosing Van Morrison to sing "Comfortably Numb."  Van is a classic singer, no doubt, but he just doesn't have the right type of voice to sing "Comfortably Numb."  If David Gilmour couldn't have been there to sing it, they should have used someone with a soft, mellow voice that could have sung the song the way it was MEANT to be sung.  By the way, is there anyone out there that can tell me who the two main guitarists were?  One guy was kinda skinny and had black shoulder length hair and played most of the guitar parts. The other guitarist played a Les Paul, mostly.  Thanks.  JonM11100@aol.com

The one segment that sticks in my mind is the one with Jussie ("The Juice" :o) Bjorling and Renata Tebaldi singing the last part of the first act of "La Boheme" in its ENTIRETY.  Bjorling and Tebaldi do a lot of "smiling" which I find very ingratiating in a positive sense--though some may find it "over-acting". Another "good one" is the segment about Magda Olivero---I never knew much about this Diva who had her Metropolitan Opera Debut at age 65!  But, even at that age you can tell that she was "one of the greats".  Rosa Ponselle does a beautiful aria...and Fritz Wunderlich.....I've heard him sing many times on CD but it is a totally new and beautiful experience to watch him sing with his total personality coming forth to you across the years!  Some of the segments I found "boring" (for me)...but that's what the fastforward button is for!  If the price is too high you could get it "free" from netflix.  boland7214@aol

She crafted some of the best songs of the decade, and was also an amazing live performer. "Ciao Italia (Live From italy)" is proof of Madonna's concert talents. Madonna is truly on fire on this show, whether she's performing an upbeat number like "Lucky Star" or crooning a ballad like "Live To Tell" or just welcoming the audience, Madonna holds the crowd in the palm of her hand and never lets go. This is a great live dvd and one I recommend.

3.  Now, Ozzy however has great music, and has worked with some fascinationg guitarists, bassists and Drummers, but this great music with his vocals that do not fit, just doesnt cut it.  I admit Ozzy is a pretty good songwriter when it comes to lyrics, however only his musicians right the music. It should be obvious he knows nothing about writing music or keys, offkey vocals, cant play any instrument, almost ready to fall over on stage. Even when he was with the legendary sabbath, the man who started it all? Please, Dio has been doing music before Ozzy was even born.  I admit Tony and Geezer along with Bill rocked, Ozzy was just an old school mate who sung badly with them, but they liked it.  So the Sabbath players are maybe what started it, but not ozzy, he was just lucky to be able to sing with them.  So this review will be hated and everything, but at least I have proof about this, yet im respecting his music minus vocals, thats why it gets 2 stars.  Ozzy lovers at least know this man is immature as well as incredible silly, yet worked with great musicians.  Thats all.
The performances are great and I was very impressed with Guy Pratt, the bass player, for his fenomenal interpretation in all PF songs, being the "run like hell" performance his summit.

One of the main reasons for a live concert is to experience the communications between those on stage, and those in the audience. My reason for renting was to see if the DVD release was as enjoyable as it had been when originally broadcast before I made my purchase; the music, the vocals, and quality of recording was spot on, but it seemed the entire DVD offered not much more than live recordings of their greatest hits.

'Contraband' is just another example of members from other bands merging together...and working.

1976 started out pleasant enough. After a December 75 vacation in Hawaii where Paul wrote a bunch of songs (including "Silly Love Songs"), Wings hit the studio in January for the WatSoS sessions (in which the entire album was recorded in one shot. Including a studio version of "Soily" that has yet to surface.) Two months later the album dropped to... to, well, some pretty poor reviews. Paul seemed to be creatively bereft this time around. The album seemed to lack the hooks, catchy melodies, spontaneity, pretty much all of the energy of the previous albums.
I was introduced by this classic (made in 1987, shortly before Orbison's death) on PBS, and since then I've had to have it.  The DVD audio extra disc does not work for me, but the first disc clocks in at just over an hour and a half.  This DVD is going to have many repeat viewings!

9599	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This could be a five star album, except that most people clearly cannot grasp it.  Yes, it is experimental to the extreme, but it is art nonetheless and certainly required more thought than most anything that you may hear on mainstream radio today.  "Cambridge 1969," the first track, is a live recording from an art festival (exactly as the title says), and is surprisingly listenable, considering that it consists of guitar feedback courtesy of Lennon, accompanying Ono's screams.  Note that one seems to be following the other; it is not random.  Some of the other tracks sung (not screamed) by Yoko are quite personal, and actually very touching.  Beyond the experimental nature of some of the tracks, one must wonder if a large part of the antipathy toward this work is that it is extraordinarily personal to a discomforting extent.
Though G 'n R and STP were aggressive-sounding groups, I'm not sure either band ever made albums this loud and excitable, especially STP.  And just as G 'n R and STP broke ground during the course of their storied careers, this huge-sounding record sets a new course for rock music in 2004. Fans of big rock-and-roll should embrace "Contraband," since the history of these band members doesn't exactly translate to stability and contentment within their surroudings.  Believe the hype you're hearing, and check out "Contraband" by Velvet Revolver.

On the other hand, David and Eddie, who were clearly the main attraction on this bill due to a resurgence in their careers during 1987, were HOT! They performed only a few of their solo hits (Eddie only sang "Keep On Truckin'" while David did "My Whole World Ended" and "Statue of a Fool" which is one of the better performances on the video), plus the hits they had with the Temptations ("Get Ready", "My Girl", "Just My Imagination", "Ain't Too Proud To Beg" to name a few). Plus, you can see the warmth and camaraderie that existed between these two while they thrilled the audience. David's vocals...damn, what more can I say about him, except that he was one of the finest singers that Motown ever produced. Eddie, ever the fashion plate, was sharp and still maintained his boyish good looks. His dancing was impeccable, and he even sings in his too often unused natural tenor (which I think he should have done more during his career, because it was so gorgeous). You have to check out Eddie on "(I Know) I'm Losing You". Even though it's a David lead, Eddie steps up to the plate in the background and delivers a home run! His natural tenor will absolutely floor you! His falsetto, unfortunately, was not as strong as it used to be, but he still managed to recreate some of that old magic. Even though both he and David had long left the Temptations behind, it was evident that that they had only left the group physically...not spiritually. They simply do what they do - entertain you with class, grace and style - qualities that will probably never be seen in the music industry again.

Since losing their regimantal band in 1994, the pipes & drums have been soldiering on without them.  It was hoped that perhaps they might have continued a little of that great music with the band of the Dragoon Guards but this didn't happen.  With their demise now as well it does not seem that the combined sound of band and pipes well be the same as it was in the golden years of the Scots DGs music history.

"Try And Love Again". Randy Meisner's last recording with the guys before he left, having already severed ties with Bernie Leadon by then. Which is unfortunate considering their huge success with "Take It To The Limit" with Meisner singing. It's a nice song that he left them with..
6581	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	In 1987 Alison was only 15, and some of the songs on this CD are kind of "honky-tonky".  In "Song For Life" the lyric begins "I don't drink as much as I used to...." and it's a little incongruous putting the words together with the 15 year-old voice.  Her vocal tone was a little twangy and nasal-sounding, almost strident as she belted out some of these tunes, and I wonder if she was influenced maybe a little by some of the Nashville Big-Hair bunch like Reba.
If you've never heard TOOL before (I can't image you haven't), start with this one. Then LATERALUS, their second best. 10,000 DAYS was good, but not great, I think all the fillers pissed me off on that CD. So please experience this band.

Column B is where you have singers doing songs they never performed on Broadway.  After all, Liza Minelli is never going to play Mama Rose in "Gypsy," so this is here only chance to do "Some People," and since she refuses to slow down during the performance you can understand why.  But then Linda Eder comes out and sings "Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)" and we forget about Liza.  In this column I would also put the show's Andrew Lloyd Webber medley, where Marin Mazzie & Judy Kuhn do "Love Changes Everything" ("Aspects of Love"), "Unexpected Song" ("Song and Dance") and "I Don't Know How to Love Him" ("Jesus Christ Superstar").  Finally, I have to put in the song that proves I do not know everything about Broadway musicals, because I do not know if Dorothy Loudon did "Ballroom" on Broadway, but from the way the crowd reacts when she comes out during the opening piano notes of "Fifty Percent," by guess would be that she did.  It does not really matter because in a show like this there should be a song you have never heard before that you want to hear again, although it is really Loudon's performance that impresses here.  Yes, it is rather sad that Julie Andrews introduces and closes "The Leading Ladies" without ever singing a single note, but that is a minor disappointment in a night of performances that certainly comes out ahead when you balance the scales at the end of the evening.

I attended  the Eden performance by Sarah Brightman in 1999 in Minneapolis. Sarah Brightman is truly an amazing talent. over the years she has performed in the shadow of her role in the Phantom Of The Opera. Now shes broken out on her own. The results are rather unconventional by some peoples standards,but to see her perform is incredible. she has perfect tone quality and excellent vocal range. eden was theatrical but not madonna llike. shes not out to change the music industry but to present a different approach. the only problem with the eden performance was the length. it was too short. the eden dvd is wonderful but still doesnt capture the live performance. i am not a fan of opera but sarah brightman through her arrangements and brilliant excution of vocal talent make it very listenable as well as entertaining.. maybe she was born in the wrong era but it shouldnt take away from her brilliance. ihighly recommend this dvd as well as the La Luna dvd.

I must say that, for me, THIS is the epitome of Yanni's career. In one release, he was able to obliterate any doubt that it is possible to master a piano's voice in one's own right; being three-hundred years old and dead is no longer a prerequisite, nor is simply being able to mimic long-dead heroes (all due respect to concert pianist and such; though I DO challenge you create something all your own...) Yanni reminds us that the human mind was not merely designed to look back in awe in what we as a people HAVE done. The human mind is greater now than ever; we can STILL CREATE; we can still dream. Live TODAY, and make the classics for TOMORROW.

My favorites include the catchy Sound & Vision with its poetic lyrics and brilliant guitar hook and of course the atmospheric Breaking Glass which inspired Nick Lowe's "I Love The Sound Of Breaking Glass" on his Pure Pop For Now People album. The short pop pieces are strangely addictive in their robotic minimalism, while the long instrumentals are quite evocative but they would probably appeal more to lovers of classical music than your average Bowie fan. (Those who like Gorecki's "Three Sorrowful Songs" would love them). On Low, Bowie took synth music in two very different directions. This was a groundbreaking album for its time and remains a remarkable listening experience although I definitely prefer the first part.

And "Hotel California", both the title and the album may be the only other. I don't know if I can muster more titles from a decade which saw the rise of idiotic disco music and forever lowered everyone's standards. While most people were dancing to brainless and generic synthesizer music in the late 1970's while wearing open-collared polyester suits, much like today, a few truly dedicated artists were creating music to challenge the listener.

In its day it was dismissed as fluff (despite its moments of apparent Beatles breakup bitterness), but it is hard not to enjoy the album with hindsight. "Too Many People," the album's opener, is one of my favorite McCartney tracks of all time, combining acoustic and electric guitars in an excellent back-and-forth of restrained and wild moods. "Dear Boy" features a great McCartney melody, and "Uncle Albert" (the "hands across the water" song) is an inspired mix of orchestra, Beatlish whimsy, and different movements - almost like a precursor to Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody." "Heart of the Country" is a piece of down-home country fun, while "Eat at Home" is a classic rocker (featuring very good harmonies from Linda) and "Long Haired Lady" makes a laudable stab at "Hey Jude" grandeur. "Back Seat of My Car" rather sums up the album's mood, with its defiantly unconventional vocal performance (there are many on this album), moments of lushness, and rocking edge. "Ram" remains one of McCartney's most exciting efforts.

holiday in berlin actually has some words to it that were sung later on by Flo & Eddie during their period in Zappa's band (1970-71) but you won't hear the lyrical version on any main zappa albums. you'll have to go to the official bootleg set "beat the boots" to hear it. it's okay but not as powerful as the instrumental version heard here.

Band 1: Enrico Caruso (2:38) - a number of very short silent movie and newsreel segments, shown over a background of a 1907 recording of "Vesti la giubba".

I waited to buy this album because the VR stuff, while good, never jumped out at me, it was missing something...BUT here it is! The song Anastasia is getting good rotation on Sirius Octane, and I was instantly hooked - because its the best guitar work Slash has done since GnR. As is this whole album. While Myles voice can a bit too high pitched at times - Slash makes up for it. Great guitar work all over this album and the band is a perfect compliment.

Early use of the moog synthesizer throughout the 60s and 70s as seen in recording studio footage of Brian Wilson.  Harmonies and the music beat out the stale east coast 60s groups, such as the 4 seasons' simple ditties. Not all the songs are great. But unlike the giants of the composers of the 1930s, like cole porter, gershwin and harold arlin, they performed sang and played their own.

Velvet Tear is piano over strings.  A lush and romantic performance that suits its title.  There's a bit of a touch of music to it, but one doesn't mind.  It brings up all those classic romantic images of Victorian parlours and staring at the rain.

One cannot fathom the significance of this amazing disc when juxtaposed against the present world of boring commercial acts. This was my first acquaintance to the phenomenon that is Tool, and I recommend to the newbies this particular album as an introduction as well.
13. Loving the Alien - another underrated instant classic. This is by far one of the best songs of the decade so far (that's right!) and a great change of pace for VR. It's sort of refreshing to find it as the last track of the CD - it implies a few thing. First it lets us know these guys can do more than just hard rock, and second of all it becomes a sort of cliff-hanger - on VR's second album will we hear more hard rock or maybe a bit more like this? This is the equivalent of Gn'R's "Patience" or "November Rain" - it's a huge change of pace and shows they can be more than loud and "ugly" (not that that's necessarily a bad thing! But you know what I mean).

8775	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have owned this CD for a couple of months now.  I hadn't really heard anything about 'Tool' until I was reading a review of Alice in Chains/Dirt and they made the comparison of that album and this one.  My very next action was to get to Ebay and bid on this.  It has been one of my very best choices so far!  I want to agree with "cflynn" about Christians and this music.  I would like to add that the emotions shared by Tool on this album are shared by ALL of us at one time or another.  There is no reason to fear this music (unfortunately many many Christians live their lives out of a fear motivation, which is very sad), this is different from anything else in my music collection, and it gets WAY more than its share of playing time.  My taste in music is probably as diverse as anyone on here (check out the HUGE differences in the music that I've already reviewed), and I can enthusiastically recommend this CD to any true lover of music.  Beware that this may become addictive to some!  Get it, listen with an open mind, and enjoy!!!
Philadelphia lawyer was written by Woody Guthrie but became one of Rose's trademark songs. Rose recorded it several times in her long career, but this version with the brothers is the first.
Keith Moon is featured on the song: Eternal Youth. Heaven and Hell is in slow motion compared to The Who s' version, i like this one better because it has a very spaced out feel.

In a way Heartbeats Accelerating is about the exquisite contrast between the excitement of the title cut and the anguish of I Eat Dinner - both songs that are, at the core about love that is somewhere else, but one talks about anticipation and other about loss and regret.  The McGarrigle's use this tension brilliantly right through to the final chorus of St. James Hospital.  Love blooms and proceeds inevitably to some final injury.

9483	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	When I first discovered this album I was in high school in '82. I bought the LP and started to feel ill, so I went home, grabbed my headphones, put the needle on the record and laid down on the couch. As the first side progressed, my temperature rose as I settled into what later became mono. I quickly became delirious and began to hover in a hallucinatory state as the music filled me. Who knows if I was still awake when the first side ended, but apparently I got up and flipped the record at some point. The perspectives in the music were distorted and mixed up. Drums were obviously being played loudly, but were buried in the mix as if they were screaming in vain to be heard. Voices whispered, crooned, howled, laughed and threatened. Hammond organs melted into harpsichords. The bass player sounded like he was either tuning up throughout the whole album or he was just kidding around. Acoustic guitars sounded impossibly swollen, as if they were trying to make the needle jump out of the groove. The lyrics were evocative of everything and nothing but in my fevered mind made perfect sense. Afraid that words would fail him, the writer used them all up as quickly as he could. I listened to this album over and over when I was in bed for weeks, trying in vain to grasp it's scope. Staring at the lyric sheet didn't help as the lyrics were all smashed together with no gaps in a single block of typewritten text as if were some sort of ransom note. The whole album sounded like the inside of someone's head with thoughts spilling every which way, some resolved, most unresolved. When I was well, I revisited the album, sure that I had imagined the whole thing. I hadn't. It remains one of my favorite E.C. albums and one of my all time favorites. Always compelling and a true one of a kind. Elvis and the Attractions all sound like they're at their wits' end, racing against madness that is hot on their trails, expressing the race in a musical language all their own. Masterpiece, for sure. (I personally prefer the Ryco version with bonus tracks on one disc, as the bonus tracks provide relief in the form of a somewhat light-hearted postscript to the intensities preceding.)

Had it all been done?No-this was very very different. With this album Elvis achieved something that was not only thought next to impossible,with some strong exceptions but that would help influence the world of Brit-pop for decades. He was able to integrate the concept of psychedelic effects into songs that were not only very strong but under 5 minutes. The last four songs on thealbum  (as well as the percussive opener "Beyond Belief"),"Pidgin English","You Little Fool" and especially "Town Cryer" give you lot's of strings,leslie amp echoes here and there-the works. But in the hand of new producer Geoff Emmerick it's not very clished;you never know what's coming next. On the other hand there are some moments where other styles tried on earlier albums really come into great focus."Shabby Doll" is a great song;very soulful and very funky,especially the bassline at the end. If the previous album had Elvis Costello's singing was going too in new directions this really takes the cake! Up and down,from song to song he is leaping into this...really very sexy high alto. I wouldn't call it falsetto as it seems very natural."Almost Blue" is....just beautiful. It's the title of his very last album but this torchy jazz ballad is definately one of his unsung classics. Same goes for the soulful "Human Hands"."The Long Honeymoon","Kid About It","Little Savage"....well many of things songs are able to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative. So sure it's forgotton and I'd bet some people give this a good review simply for that purpose:that just because an album is obscure then it's gotta be good. Well that is never entirely true but this is a very strong exception to the rule,as well as being the best place to find the groun zero where post-punk pop met up with....well where the music's gone pretty much today in a lot of ways.

Only one song ("I'm the Slime") even relatively meets his reputation. The rest of the album consists of trashy, unamusing novelty songs ("Dinah-Moe Hum" "Dirty Love") or tracks too senseless to even warrant that modest title ("Fifty-Fifty" "Montana"). The guitar-playing is sublime, laid-back and funky. Unlike the songwriting, it is acceptable, but nothing any two-bit hack, leftover from the psychedelic movement could not do. Did I buy the wrong album? Is Mr. Zappa really that overrated?

On Aenima, Tool continues to explore the depths of the human mind and soul, touching on themes such as pain, frustration, guilt, and social decay. As with every Tool album, the band puts forth thought-provoking lyrical messages in their songs, rendering them more powerful through creative musical passages and compositional ideas. Even though former bassist Paul D'Amour is now replaced by Justin Chancellor, the bass parts on this album do not lack a single thing. On the contrary, Chancellor's bass, along with Danny Carey's precise drum work, is still central to the songs, as Adam Jones mostly builds his guitars around his ferocious rhythms. Starting with "Stinkfist", the album opener, the bass sound is ever-present, deep and growling throughout its five-minute course, amidst crackling effects, cool percussion, and effect-laden guitar sounds all of which serve to highlight vocalist Maynard Keenan's light verse/heavy chorus dynamics.
Last summer I was doing some spring cleaning (yeah I was late), when I came across the video (still in its shrinkwrap) and decided, what the heck, and put it on as background while I continued cleaning.  What I was not prepared for was the heartfelt performances, full of life and energy, and superbly on key and tempo.  Buckingham's performance especially made me stop and take notice.  I guess I had forgotten how talented he truly was.  Needless to say, I didn't stray from the TV, and "The Dance" wasn't used as background.  I sat down, turned it up, and enjoyed it thoroughly.

Unfortunately, this album is often forgotten when people talk about Bowie's fantastic 70's. The album has two halves (sides), the first one is so-so, and most of the songs are annoying, although "Red Sails" is growing on me.  Then something wonderful happens.  One a row, we get "DJ", "Look back in anger", "Boys Keep Swinging", and "Reptetion", all stellar tracks displaying Bowie at his best!  I particularly like "Boys Keep Swinging", one of my all time Bowie favorites, and the dark, cynical "Repetition" gets better every time you listen to it.

I've heard that Collide and Alien Youth are among some of their better work, so perhaps I will start there.

While track 2 (South  America, 1936) was relatively mediocre compared to the others (and it was  an unreleased track), the remainder of the unreleased material fully  compensated for this. I especially enjoyed the Basket Game, with an  unforgettable little tune, and the additional length of The Desert Chase,  which I would say is my favorite of the entire soundtrack. I prefer  fast-paced music, and this is filled accordingly. However, it's not without  variation, as you'll find in Marion's Theme, The German Sub/Nazi Hideout  (unreleased), and several others. The bottom line is : this score  unquestionably contributed to John Williams' success, as it is an  incredibly addictive soundtrack.
5540	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Gerry Rafferty put it all together on City to City. Stylistically, this album is all over the place and every song is a winner. The best known track is the classic "Baker Street", one of the most enduring songs of the '70s with perhaps the most memorable saxophone line in pop music and a strong melody and lyric that take you in immediately. "Right Down the Line" is a mid-tempo love song that is nearly as enduring and would also be a huge hit. The third single, "Home and Dry", would be a lesser hit but is just as impressive and memorable as "Right Down the Line". The album tracks are all top notch whether it's the Celtic sounds of "The Ark", the slow ballad "Stealin' Time", the rollicking pop of "Mattie's Rag", or the honky tonking title track. "Island" has a laid back feel with more sax to add to the mood while the closing "Waiting For The Day" is a joyous rocker. And as great all of the tracks are, and "Baker Street" certainly deserves its classic status, the best song is "Whatever's Written In Your Heart", a fantastic piano ballad with a heartfelt lyric and excellent harmonies. In my opinion, if this was released as a single, this could have took this album and Rafferty to another level. All told, City to City shows the pop craftsman, Gerry Rafferty, at his peak and is a must own if you love the music of the 1970's.

-The music itself: The Police were one of the most innovative and popular bands in the late 70's and early 80's. In the video section you have a series of songs more satisfying than their greatest hits compilation. From the early influences of punk and reggae to the mellowed pop-rock songs in their last album "Synchronicity," they marked one of the greatest moments. In addition, with Sting in all his talent, he could not disappoint. The Dolby 5.1 sound format makes the songs a little different from those on the CDs so that you are able to listen to the instruments playing and the vocal more clearly.
This collection of songs are all  from his '73 tour (backed by what is generally accepted as his finest band  ever), hand-picked and set in order by Frank himself to sound like ONE show  - astounding!

I'd be in sixth grade after school listening to keith  murray w/ a dictionary at my side. Keith is easily one of the best in the  rap game, and it is a shame that he has to spend time in the pen.

This cd is for me,one of the best rock/blues "Live" albums ever released! Stevie Ray Vaughan was his most important disciple,and it's clearly along all of this marvellous cd. An incendiary,set of powerful good music at "Live"way!!! This album is really one of my favorites!!!
7054	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Jonathan Richman has picked up on two elements of the Velvet Underground that most of their followers missed. The first is the core of sweetness in songs like "I'll be Your Mirror", "Lisa Says" or "Rock and Roll". There's a similar spirit of innocence and joy in Jonathan's songs, and not a scrap of cheap irony in a song like "I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar", for example.
not the same old songs over again, but many rare and still excellent tracks!
Weasels is even better.  Not only is it riskier and edgier, in its own weird way it's warm and nostalgic in a manner that eluded Zappa in his more calculated efforts.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for Ray Collins singing the original OH NO.  But even the  more bee czar stage bits betray the sense of familial humor that abounded in this dysfunctional bunch.

I haven't seen that correlation made before (a little more research might prove me wrong), but it seems very obvious to me.  So my commenting here is just to tell fans of the Firesign Theatre that they should check out the Mr. Show dvd's and that the Mr. Show fans oughtta check out the Firesign Theatre's albums.  Great stuff, in either direction, and Don't Crush That Dwarf has always been my favorite.  (First season of Mr. Show was my favorite of that series, in return...)

"Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs--and what's wrong with that?"
The actual song is pretty good too.  Zappa sings obnoxiously about eating hot dogs, but it's creative enough that it's worth hearing.  It's not as pointless as it initally sounds, let's put it that way.  It grows on you over time.
4434	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I just don't get it. Some reviewers rate this DVD based on all of the performances from all of the performers. That would be like judging a Muhammad Ali fight based on the undercard. Who cares? It is extra gravy. Ruffin, one of the best vocalists and entertainers ever, becomes the center of attention as soon as he, well, walks on center stage. He singlehandedly makes this a 5-Star review. I bought this DVD solely to see him and Eddie Kendricks perform. With a DVD, you can skip the preliminaries--as I suggest you do--and go straight to the chase. Ruffin, Motown's greatest act, was the Temptations. Make no bones about it. Though they would have been a good group without him, they became untouchable with him. Ruffin's solo career, because Motown did not properly promote it, did not live up to its billing. His work was as good, but it simply was not promoted as it should have been. The music from his post-Temptations days remains, arguably, the least appreciated music there is. I had the privilege of seeing him perform twice. Once, just before he left the Tempts. A second time, while he was performing with Eddie Kendricks in a show similar to this. Both times he was simply electrifying. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. This goes to my major gripe regarding this DVD: Poor camera work. The director must have gotten a whiff of some wacky weed for he misses ALL of Ruffin's splits and most of his dancing. Instead, entirely too much time is devoted to the splendid dance moves of the background singers (who are EXCELLENT, but Ruffin should have been showcased more. What a shame. Nevertheless, if you want to know what REAL soul is, check this DVD out. If you're not tapping your feet throughout, especially on the grand finale, "I Know I'm Losing You," have someone check your pulse.
Gees sound came out in force and nearly melted my ears with their incredible music spanning multiple decades. A great show that can be
Musically the album is a joy from start to finish. It has a sound similar to what I would expect, but without being Guns n Roses 2. Slash and the boys have done a wonderful job of creating a fresh sound with interesting hooks, while Scott Weiland voice and lyrics bring the same freshness and delightful approach. They've definitely laid down a benchmark for Axl to have to reach high to atain with the long awaited Chinese Democracy.

7375	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Have always loved Billy Ocean's music.  It had been a few years and I thought I'd really enjoy it and I love this cd - classic Billy Ocean at his best!!
Nevertheless, is another nice addition to a hard rock - AC/DC collection.
Ocean's last big hit was "Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car", another catchy dance anthem and another soundtrack song, from the Corey Feldman vehicle (no pun intended) Licence To Drive.  Some eye-rolling suggestive car-talk involves, "touch my bumper" and "let me take your wheel" but this was big enough to reach #1.  Also from Tear Down These Walls is "The Colour of Love," another attempt at a hit ballad, which doesn't have the same effect as "Suddenly" or "There'll Be Sad Songs."

8976	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album changed my taste in music. I gradually started listening to it more and more. Soon I was hooked like a crack fiend(The CD Being the crack-rock, and my CD player the Pipe). With every listen I found something new that drew me in more. It was like a journey from beginning to end. After months of listening I gradually started listening less, and less. Enough of anything can get old. Now and then I still pop in this CD in and remember how truly great of a record it is. I think about how long ago it was released(1996) and it blows my mind how relevent it still is and how this album is just a classic. No matter how much my taste in music has changed to bands like opeth, killswitch engage(Alive or just....),  Chimaira... I just don't get sick of it or lose any appreciation for the amount of talent, time, and creativity put into this great realease by TOOL.

Edutainment is just that -- educational entertainment.  There isn't a beat that KRS One can't get busy on and he entertains the masses with knowledge instead of dreams of material prosperity.  Hip hop heads all around the world (myself included) recognize him as one of the illest to ever stand in front of a microphone.  The production is on point, so what more could you ask for?

2450	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	My Dad picked this up and brought it home for the family to watch. He's in his late 70's but has been a Floyd fan for years. Overall, I really enjoyed this DVD. The light show and Video show are amazing. Gilmour is fantastic. I think his vocals and guitar on this sound better than on the studio versions. "Shine on..." almost brought tears to my eyes. The only critique I would offer is that towards the end of disk ONE, it all started sounding the same to me; tempos do not vary much and it all seems to drag on a bit too long... We skipped the end of this disk and put on disk two. Disk TWO is my favourite perhaps because I am more familiar with this material. I've never seen Floyd in concert but I imagine this is as about as good as it gets with out actually being there. I would recommend this to anyone who is or has been a Pink Floyd fan. Well worth the price of admission.

"New Kid In Town". Glenn Frey's only lead vocal on the whole thing, but still proved to be a big hit for the band. Has the "Peaceful Easy Feeling", "Lyin Eyes" vibe to it, a song about hitting the big time.

10. You Got No Right: 3. The song is good for a while.  The solo is good, but the song just gets annoying after a while.  I want it to end, and it doesn't.  Not for 5 1/2 minutes, anyway.
As to the merits of this remaster, (I'm referring to the 1993 remaster import from Holland), it's good. It's not a huge improvement on the American version but it does have two bonus tracks one of which isn't available anywhere else. "Oh Woman Oh Why" is a minor McCartney rock gem worth investigating for hardcore Beatles/McCartney fans. The other bonus track the A side of the same single "Another Day" is available elsehwere. The definitive version is still the Gold disc mastered by Steve Hoffmann for the DCC release.
The rest of the CD is excellent as well, especially the title track, "Razorface" and the overplayed and now somewhat irritating "Tiny Dancer", which still takes me back over 30 years when I hear it. The best thing for this song as far as I'm concerned is that I harly ever listen to FM radio any longer, so when I put the CD on, TD sounds fresh again. "Indian Sunset" is another tension filled, occasionally haunting song, with a deeper message than the pop styling of the music might suggest. The last few songs tend to not do much for me, although I do like "All the Nasties", with that one and only Elton John piano line. This is a classic album from an artist who would go on to have every bit as great an influence on pop, rock and British Invasion music as anyone ever has.
Ketchup! Katsup!  Soup and puree,
The suite "Sweet Thing / Candidate" is another highlight on the album.
5925	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	A double album???? How audacious!!!! It was just a few years earlier that groups such as the Beatles were making an album into a thematic whole rather than a collection of hits. Now, here comes Cream, whose very name proclaims they are the best musicians (i.e., the cream) of the British music scene, recording just their third album, and they have the nerve to release it as a double!! What nerve! But, what a great album!! After 30+ years, most of this amazing music still holds up today. What's even more amazing is that many listeners at the time were awed by the "symphonic tracks" (i.e., those with violas and cellos), such as "Passing the Time" or "As You Said", but these have not stood the test of time as well as the "simpler" blues tracks such as "Politician" or "Born Under a Bad Sign". "White Room", of course, is the ultimate marriage of the symphonic (violas and tympani) and the blues (Eric's great guitar figures). Speaking of Mr. Clapton, some people need to be reminded that Cream was a group of three equal virtuosos and not just his backing band. (According to Chris Welch in his fine book simply entitled Cream, the brass at Atlantic Records thought the same thing; that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were Eric's backups just like the Bluesbreakers were to John Mayall.) On the live disc, the two "backups" were given a chance to strut their stuff, with Bruce turning in an outstanding "Traintime" and Baker with his drum opus "Toad". (Because of "Toad", concertgoers everywhere were treated to endless, ponderous drum solos by musicians not nearly as talented as Mr Baker.) The amazing "Crossroads" is still a radio staple today (the song is actually a medley of two Robert Johnson songs, "Crossroad Blues" and "Traveling Riverside Blues"). "Sitting on Top of the World" would make Howlin Wolf proud, while "Deserted Cities of the Heart" impresses with it's time and tempo changes (and, on Live Cream II, proves a surprisingly powerful live piece.) In all, a fabulous effort, influencing guitar players and seminal rock musicians for generations to come. Waste no time in letting Wheels roll into your collection at once!!!
I'm a Pink Floyd fan; there's no doubt about that. And, I love this concert.
When it comes to Black Sabbath, Tony Martin is the best singer, and this is their best album.

4216	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I wish they'd release a DVD of the clips from his shows in the 1950s from the 1950-1952, 1957-1958 and 1958-1960 shows, some of which were used as part of a live concert in recent years. I think "Vintage Sinatra" has been shown on PBS but not released on DVD, and I don't remember how much narration was in that one.
Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.

If you don't have this one, get it already!
Anyway, while David Gilmour is a GREAT guitarist, singer and overall musician (not in vain the best songs from "The Wall" are co-written by him), Roger Waters was the band's real genius. I still remember picking the original "Wall" 2 LP set at the record store and looking at the credits in the gatefold sleeve: "Waters" was elsewhere. I will never understand why Roger looks so enthusiastic at the Live 8 reunion and David looks annoyed. The opposite would make more sense to me since Roger lost his rights over the Pink Floyd name (and that gig wasn't meant to bring him back).

8456	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I'm working my way backward in time in discovering the rich musical legacy of father and son Billy Joe and Eddie Shaver. I started with 2000's The Earth Rolls On, another 5-star recording, but this one, from 1993, is even a little better.  This kind of music carries on the authentic legacy of rock 'n roll and western swing in a way that contemporary pop and country music absolutely do not.  The musical licks are sharp, the vocals full-throated (with some help from Waylon Jennings) and the words always heartfelt and often funny.  Very rarely does an artist deliver six tunes in a row as powerful as Tracks 1-6 here. One of my favorites is #3, Georgia on a Fast Train ("Got a good Christian raisin' and a 8th grade education, ain't no need y'all a treatin' me this way"). Eddie's guitar licks come so fast that Billy Joe has to caution him, "Aw, slow down, Eddie" (or is it "throw down"?). I also especially like #5, If I Give My Soul, an autobiographical account in which Billy Joe wonders if he can save his marriage by giving his soul to Jesus.  (In reality, he did both.)  Track 7, KAND Corsicana, Texas, is a novelty item, a seemingly authentic 1944 radio announcement of the beginning of the D-Day invasion followed by a quick prayer for our troops, and right into Track 8, Good Ol' USA. I first listened to this CD as anti-US demonstrations were sweeping the world, and our troops were preparing for another invasion, and the cumulative weight of this music made me want it to be heard and understood by all our enemies who haven't got a clue what this country is about. Naive, maybe, but this CD is a piece of bedrock American culture that can make us all proud.  Billy Joe, you are a national treasure.

There's a lot of humour in these songs, perhaps not Lennonesque enough to have prevented John from wincing here and there, but they're amusing to this `John, Paul, George & Ringo' fan. By the way, if you have some rudimentary music-editing software, it's worth UNfading the fadeout on `Monkberry Moon Delight', so as to hear at full volume Paul's hilarious outro vocal histrionics. This one's of a piece with the Beatles' `You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)'. `Uncle Albert', with its dozen or so themes, is like a mini-version of the Abbey Road medley.  `Smile Away' is a goofy rocker that Linda's harmony vocals keep from turning into a `Why Don't We Do It in the Road?' shout-fest. Once again, great

Considering how difficult it is to obtain a copy of this CD these days (its now officially out-of-print), I was truly thrilled and couldn't wait to hear Imogen's music. Usually, when I listen to a musician's music based on their reviews at Amazon, I tend to be disappointed - both Fisher and Julia Darling have disappointed me as they seem like Lilith Fair rejects, yet they were given undue praise.

But wait!  Then we have the live disc!  This features Clapton at his absolute best.  Everyone knows that he jams his heart out on "Crossroads", giving new fire and passion to Robert Johnson's blues chestnut.  But even better is the monstrous 17-minute version of "Spoonful", in which Eric plays perhaps the greatest solo of his life.  I kid you not.  He slowly, carefully builds up the tension until it approaches the 12-minute mark (about 11:50), when he brings it to a grand climax, delivering a frightening tidal wave of notes that just twists your insides in a knot.  It's like an orgasm - slowly building the tension until...WHAM!...that Heavenly climax just seems to come out of nowhere.  It's amazing.  If you ask me, the album is worth having just for that solo alone.

Five stars for excellent audio quality and a very fine ensemble performance by Dan and musicians. I have a gripe with the unnecessarily quick-change camera work and weird angles that distract from just looking at the screen and enjoying the sounds.  However, the main attraction remains the audio, and it's easy enough to focus on that once you get used to it.
6668	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The title track was one the Eagles' all-time best,undoubtedly. On the cover,we see the band in a hotel lobby with many other guests. Other hits include NEW KID IN TOWN,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE and VICTIM OF LOVE. Eventually,Glenn Frey and Don Henley,the band's drummer would pursue solo careers of their own. Frey and Henley are the Lennon and McCartney of the Eagles. Frey takes the lead on NKIT. Henley takes the lead on the title track,LITFL,WASTED TIME,VOL and THE LAST RESORT. The other songs are good. There's also an instrumental and classical reprise of WT which is 1 minute and 22 seconds in length. Some tracks were recorded live for the 1994 reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER.
Let me not forget, "The Wind"...a beautiful song I've heard somewhere before, I think by a country singer. Nonetheless, it's great with CeCe's vocals as well. If you're tired of the contemporary gospel artists who try too hard to appeal to the younger demographic, pick up this cd, you won't be disappointed.
Until reaching #1 with "Mony Mony," "Eyes Without A Face" became Idol's highest charting song, reaching #4 on the pop charts and #5 on the album rock charts.  The slow airy synths and pulsing bass, claps in this ballad, backup vocals by Idol's girlfriend, Perri Lister, who also did the makeup on Idol's first album, and Stevens grinding guitar during the sudden ferocious rock section midsong provided yet another hit for Idol.  The album closer "The Dead Next Door," has a quieter ambient synth sound that kind of belongs with "Eyes"
14. "Beautiful Stranger"  I'd never own, or ever sit through another "Austin Powers" movie, but it's nice to own something with Austin Powers in it.  Madonna continues to show, even in her forties, that she is still quite a sexy girl.  Too bad I couldn't get a short cameo of Elizabeth Hurley, but I guess she was in the previous Austin Powers film.
The rest of the album is Duck-free, and still sounds fresh.  Apart from the Respighi, every song on this album is familiar, almost too familiar.  When I saw the song list (and before I heard the album), I groaned---do we really need another "The Christmas Song", another "Silent Night"?  But David Grisman and his fine sidepeople scrape away the layers of dreary tedious dutiful tradition and treat each song as a new adventure in musical puckishness.  Listen to "Silent Night"----it's actually insouciant!!  Bouncy!!  How is this possible?  But he does it.  A guy plays throat tromnet---playing his mouth like a trumpet---and it will make you grin like a jack-o-lantern when you hear it.

6052	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	If you're expecting Larry Carlton, the jazz guitarist you will be unhappy  with this one.  This is all blues, and as a blues CD it probably deserves  to be rated a 3 star CD, but I felt "had" when I popped this one  in the player so I dropped it to a 2 star.  This shouldn't have been  labeled "by Larry Carlton, featuring Terry McMillan" it should  have included some inference to Blues and a stronger influence of Terry  McMillan.  You will get plenty of harmonica and a whole lot of slowhand  guitar which may be right for some.  Carlton should be applauded for taking  the risk, but for me, this didn't cut the mustard.

6057	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have no hesitation in recommending this recording for lovers of the '70 experiments in rock/soul/jazz/fusion. The Crusaders formed their sound together when they were barely in their twenties, and by the time they recorded this wonderful stew of funk etudes, they were as one mind. Though the music may be "simple" (groove and uncomplicated melodies are the order of the day), that does not mean it lacks passion or excellence. This is some of happiest music I've ever heard; I loved it 30 years ago, I love it still.
I know that an "audiophile rock recording" is an oxymoron, but there was a time when you could expect any DCC / AF CD to sound better than its original counterpart. Not anymore. I guess someone's hearing has gone to the toilet, because things aren't what they used to be. Definitely not recommended.

If you want to hear the fusion side of Corea's work in the 80s, this is a good choice. Recommended.
Then she teamed up with SAW and did "Samatha Fox" (hits: Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now, I Surrender, Naughty Girls), a great album, then "I Wanna Have Some Fun" which is already more in that urban dance from the US that was becoming popular in the late late 80s, (hits: I Wanna Have Some Fun, Love House -very good-, I Only Wanna Be With You). Then she kinda went off to the US and did "Just One Night" which is really a more r&b album, very us-influenced and I never got into it much. After many collections she has done an album she recorded in her own studio, called "21st Century Fox" in like 1997, repackaged a couple of years later as "Watching Me, Watching You". This last one is a bit eurodiscotrash, as the songs sound not very professional, you can hear they are not big-budget stuff, but yet it's a very good album and if you like Sammy you have to get it. Late October 2005 sees the Canadian-only release (apparently) of her new album "Angel With An Attitude" and I can't wait to see what it sounds like.
The fact that Elvis, who had been considered kind of a runty, quirky annoyance by a lot of critics since his sophomore LP was released, could put together this album--and the accompaning tour, which was closer to the TAMI Show than the typical punk rockers he was so often compared to--is, to me, one of the miracles of the age.

If I were made to keep just one, and only one, Paul McCartney album, it would be this one.  Why you ask?  Ask away!

Flowers In The Dirt is hailed as the greatest Paul album, complete with artistic style and "deep, meaningful" songwriting.  I second that emotion.  So why Ram?
Shatner's vocal theatrics are a mockery of the acting profession - enough to make a person laugh themselves into a hernia or lose whatever they ate during the last 18 hours - except that the joke is on him. He actually thinks he is amazing even the angels with his talent. But no. His rendition of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" probably earned him a 600 year stint in that part of purgatory reserved for airport lounge singers.

Roxy and Elsewhere restored much needed faith.  I had seen some of this material played live in concert, heard something about a PBS special he was working on, forked out my hard-earned neo-teenage cash for a double live album, and was dancing on the ceiling from the first listening.  I'd never heard such a great live recording, and the energy from the performance brought a much-needed element missing from the bottom-heavy, too-clean production of the two previous albums.

As another reviewer has noted, it is simply not possible to overstate the utter beauty and power of Sandy Denny's voice.

While that is quite true, reviewers should also check out the preceding album "One of those nights" which is on equal par. Listening to Hotel California nearly 30 years on, the album still holds up extremely well. I may be the only person who never really liked the title track, but you cannot argue that it is a well-crafted song. However, to me, the real gems lie in the excellent album tracks. Forgot the quite dull "New Kid in town" which suffered from radio overkill (I  fast-forward this track), go straight to "Wasted Time". This particular track to me is the album's highlight. Simply beautiful, and gives me goosebumps every time. Don Henley on vocals makes this song so special. Other highlights include the stunning "Pretty Maids all in a row" with its wonderful fade-in. One of Joe Walsh's very best songs, alongside "Life's been good". The album finishes on a fine note with the epic "The last resort". This track has many layers, and is acclaimed for this structure. Add Don Henley's great voice, and you have one classic song.

I actually got see them live while visiting Austin, Texas (stood next to Mark Sandman without even knowing it before the show...).  What a show.  A two-string bass, a saxophone and some drums jam beyond belief.  Considering I was living in Seattle at the peak of the whole grunge thing, this was a pleasant relief.  It was cool before the whole strung out, heroin chic, swingers thing became mainstream.  There's a swagger to this music and a moodiness that belongs in smoke-infested dives.

First of all, no comedian would be able to talk about taking mushrooms in such an open, non-pretentious way (or without 'going for the gag').
This cd, his own trio, does that risky thing of approaching those hoary old chestnuts with respect but not reverence, with wit but not self-indulgence. Some new twists, new spins, some surprising ideas, but never abandoning the essential melody lines. Still, there is nothing boring here; at no time does Broadbent lapse into the predictable--this might serve as background music, but to listen to it as such is to miss some of the quicksilver turns, the elegant musings. Broadbent's look at John Lewis' wonderful "Django" is a case in point. Lewis is well served, but Broadbent has a few things to say too. The result is some sweet shadings of Lewis' marvelous melody.

Unlike alot of other bands, however, Antigone Rising seem to have the chops to put over this live effort, which is their most commercially accessible recording to date. While several tracks off "From the Ground Up" can be found on the 2003 release "Traveling Circus", the gritty studio album funded entirely by donations from the band's own fans, the production is much better on this newer offering. The band's singing and playing seems enhanced by the energy from the audience, a vibrant sound that was lacking from "Circus".

1985's "Queen of the Blues" anticipated a trend, if you will, featuring numerous guest stars.

Well "Hotel California" is beautifully transferred to CD, I don't know if it was remasterred but the sound quality is awesome.  You can hear every drum, guitar, background vocals, ascent and descent in the tittle track and that goes for the rest of the CD.  Then ofcourse the music is stellar, not every song is a stand out like "Hotel California" but pretty darn close.  This album defines a generation, an era, a style of music, maybe American music as we know it.

For some reason, the brilliance that shows the path to the remaining Tool releases never seems to be mentioned whenever Tool is mentioned in the press.  Instead, the press seems to focus more on Undertow, Aenima, and Lateralus, which are more accepted amongst fans and casual listeners alike.  While it is more primative than what Tool has evolved into today, it's the striking delivery of these songs that make them heavy, expressive, scary, and intense for for the listener.  Bottom Line:  This was a progressive and psychadelic experience that was grouped into the modern rock movement at the time, much like many of their predecesors before them.

From my own research: If your baby is colicky stop feeding him/her apple juice. My mother claimed that I had colic as a baby because she was eating apples with the skin on. I've read online that eating apples can be a problem if you are breastfeeding. Spicy foods and dairy products may also be culprits. If your baby is not calmed by methods you see on this DVD then look up colic online and find out what you might be eating that could cause your child to experience abdominal pain from gas.

Guns `N' Roses greatness and weakness was in no small part fellow Hoosier Axel Rose.  Prodigal child from a Pentecostal family (Catholics frequently complain about how oppressive their upbringing was.  But Catholics are freakin' liberals compared to Pentecostals), Axel ran from the restrictions of his youth and any sense of self-discipline in the normal sense.  Rose indulged in any excess that appealed, often was late for concerts, and fought anyone and everyone.  The rest of Guns `N' Roses ran a close second to Axel-although most of their excesses involved alcohol and assorted chemicals.  The band imploded.  Axel took his ball and glove along with the band's name and has been promising a new Guns `N' Roses album called CHINESE DEMOCRACY for several years.  (Said to be on the verge of release numerous times, many do not think the album in fact exists.)

What this collection is most valuable for, however, is the live performances.  Before buying this, I was under the impression that the performances were all lip-synced (the album version plays as it shows the band performing "live").  That turned out to not be the case, save for two performances at the beginning.  You get to hear Badfinger's biggest hits played live in footage taken from TV shows: "Come & Get It," "No Matter What," and "Baby Blue," as well as a rocked-up version of "Suitcase" where Pete Ham's lead & slide guitar sound awesome.

"Veni, Veni" has a completely unique, yet not so unique format about it.  Choral work seems to be one of Davis's specialities, (probably because he used to sing in a choir) and it certainly shows in this piece.  Since FA V was released, choral music seemed to find its way into Davis's compositions and arrangements with ease.  I think the reason most people like this piece so much is that seems to wrap up (no pun intended) everything about Christmas.  The same is true with "Still, Still, Still." These pieces just have a feeling about them that represents this wonderful season.

Though released in the late 1990s, I Megaphone feels like the missing link between the early '90s grunge movement and the late '90s Lilith Fair era.  It's odd to hear Imogen backed by a grungy guitar and drums, but even odder to adjust to the emotional tone of these early songs, which are frequently jaded and angry, more akin to Tori Amos meets Fiona Apple in some ways than to the Imogen Heap we've all come to know.  This is not to say that the album feels ingenuine.  Imogen's distinctive voice always sets her apart from the pack, and the songs can, at times, be quite unusual and distinct, especially in their use of synthesizers (early experimentations that pave the way for the more mature "Speak For Yourself" album).  It just may not be the polished Imogen sound you're used to.

So unless they edited the songs there was no chance of a single from this album.

It was a normal gig, and it was only by chance that there were cameras recording it. But thank god that there were cameras rolling, because if there weren't, music fans everywhere would be deprived of this piece of history. The band plays with basically no pause whatsoever between songs. There is just no weak point at all, and every song is filled with adrenaline and emotional playing from Stevie. The two songs that stand the tallest surely are "Texas Flood," a blues EPIC- and do I mean epic-one of the greatest recordings of the electric guitar ever put to tape, and "Lenny," a slow instrumental where Stevie just goes all out; you can really see that his heart is completely in it. Also definitely worth noting are "So Excited" and Stevie's awesome cover of "Voodoo Child (Slight Return.)"

Her performance is complemented throughout with a theatrical visual style, as you'd expect from someone with roots in musical theater. In "Captain Nemo," a sheer curtain suggests an underwater world, from behind which Sarah emerges wearing a lavender dress, marking a sudden shift from a red-and-black color scheme (like the EDEN album cover) to a less-somber pastel theme. As the song changes to "La Mer," she steps back behind the curtain, where she and two dancers take to the air via cables to create the illusion of swimming underwater. She also performs a few of the songs she made famous as Christine in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, demonstrating her range and power, as she does at other times in the concert, such as in the more classically flavored pieces "Nella Fantasia," "Anytime, Anywhere," and "Nessun Dorma." She also reaches up and out in "Only an Ocean Away" -- a piece with an electric pulse to it, very strong and modern -- going from sweet songstress in one verse to soaring diva in the next.

This is an album that I don't feel compelled to ramble about or list track ratings because I feel so strongly that this is a must-own album. The only way to describe this is pushing the boundaries in hard rock/metal music while still managing to maintain an accessibility that bridges gaps.

The song selection is very good and the playing is top notch.  Supported by an exceptionally talented band this CD is a joy to listen to.  Familiar songs stand alongside new compositions with the common thread of feeling.  From the upbeat to the mid-tempo to the slow songs the band pulls everyone off without a hitch.
Enjoy!

The 1st side of the album was VERY strong. Each song was unique, and well written, most especially "Ram On', Smile Away", "Too Many People" and "Uncle Albert". (Rumor has it that "Smile Away" was a jab at John Lennon-note the back cover with 2 beetles doing something to each other)
Finally, the DVD contains "Studies in Synchronicity," which is an interesting video short featuring musical bits from the Synchronicity album, and a discography.  This collection was easily one of the best DVD/musical investments I've made in a long time.  In my opinion, nothing in the collection is filler and anyone who enjoys this band should purchase it.
The DVD also comes with a fold-up poster and mini booklet. It's a nice package for fans. I still claim that David Bowie's best LP is "The Rise & Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" of 1972. He hit his peak early on, but the surprising thing is how he managed to maintain a vibrant, and always fascinating creative impulse for many years afterwards. Whereas most artists would have disappeared after Ziggy's pinnacle, Bowie quickly kept us thinking, and rethinking the whole while.
6565	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album is a true Grisman classic.  Who else could put together such a distinct Christmas album?  WHAT CHILD IS THIS is done in the old english style with mandolin accompanied by a band of minstrels playing recorders.  SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN is done bluegrass style with virtuoso Bela Fleck on banjo.  Respighi's ANCIENT AIRES AND DANCES is a beautiful rendering of this classical composition done with mandonlin, mandola, and mandocello.  THE CHRISTMAS SONG is a soft, jazzy, acoustic version of Mel Torme's classic.  GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN is done as an acoustic jazz tune in 6/8 time.  WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS offers a touch of comic relief with Grisman's mandolin accompanying a Donald Duck impersonator.  WHITE CHRISTMAS presents jazz guitar virtuoso Martin Taylor and John Stafford on tenor sax.  THE FLOWER CAROL is another old english style number done with an accompanying hurdy-gurdy, crumhorns, and recorders.  WINTER WONDERLAND is done in a swing style reminiscent of the Hot Club Quintet with Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli.  SILENT NIGHT is done in a bossa nova (?) style with accompnying vocal percussion and vocal trumpet.  AULD LANG SYNE also presents Bela Fleck on banjo with a slower beginning tempo which kicks into bluegrass overdrive upon the key modulation.

worst KANSAS song of all time, it also contains STEVE WALSH's
See! Wasn't that simple?! It's not worth endlessly complaining about and returning CDs to stores (!) just because of MediaMax (which is now being included on many CDs as protection).
If you liked those tracks rated 'The Good', and you are not familiar with Santana's earlier work, then check out 'Abraxas', 'Santana III' (in my opinion, their finest album), 'Caravanserai', and 'Borboletta'; after these, the band moved closer to jazz fusion.

But I'm so tired of my Pink Floyd CDs, and this great DVD allows both myself and Floyd to age gracefully. These versions are actually fresh to hear and to see. And the biggest treat for me was when David brought fellow Pink Floyd member Richard Wright up on the stage to sing a beautiful version of his song Breakthrough from his Broken China CD of 1996. So far as I know this is Rick's only performance of his solo work. Too bad! But at least we have this one song to cherish. And also along for the show: Floyd saxophonist Dick Parry. It's just Gilmour and Parry opening the show with a spare but beautiful Shine On You Crazy Diamond. It's a wonderfully intimate show, beautifully filmed and recorded. Every Floyd fan should have this.

There is no need to spend $200 on this - it is now available through the YES website in a remastered edition that is sonically brilliant. there are some early mistakes with the camerawork, but about 20 minutes in, all is fine and it becomes quite a show. I caught this tour with Tony Levin, Bruford's Crim rhythm partner. Levin fell ill during the tour, so Bruford recruited Jeff Berlin and that is who is featured on the DVD. The sympatico among Bruford, Berlin and Wakeman are the reason to purchase this DVD. They are absolutely on target with each other, and I would argue that Berlin transforms the Chris Squier parts on a number of Yes chestnuts so radically that it feels like you are hearing these gems for the first time.
The wall being built up eventually builds to its destruction and the moment that still makes the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. "TEAR DOWN THE WALL!!!" All humanity rejoices...
I guess there's one irksome part of the review that I should include, and that's the "If you like X, then you'll love this album" portion of the review. Fans of Morton Feldman; Krautrock; Fly Pan Am and other stuff from the Constellation record label; Ssab Songs; Naked City, Painkiller, John Zorn; and other musical stock that is a great deal removed from the popular consciousness. And that's where I wanted to get to in this review, and that's the use of the album as a study of Avant-Garde gone wrong. There is a huge problem with Yoko Ono and all the other artists that I mentioned and it's the same problem with another type of album that is graded on something other than musical merit: the concept album. For these artists, it seems that their careers had their genesis in the concept album, except they never went back to making standard music. Well the problem with concept albums and indeed the whole Avant-Garde movement at times is this: there's only so much noodling and experimentation the general public will tolerate before they just want you to sit down and back it all up with something that proves your general abilities. What the Avant-Garde seems to forget is that while Avant-Garde artists like Picasso and Piet Mondian did mostly experimental abstract pieces, they had the ability to compose wonderful traditional pieces but they chose not to. That is the key. There is a sense of free-will there that seems to be absent with artists like Yoko and her ilk. Could she create a traditionally great album if she wanted to? Perhaps not. If you can appreciate some random musical screwing-around as mindless background music while you do something equally mindless like writing emails or something like that, then this is really great. It then develops this odd charm that might keep you coming back whenever your music level of tolerance is high. Of course since so many people hate this album, the likelihood of you being able to get this "played once" used for six or seven bucks on Amazon is very good and then if you still don't like it you won't feel so foolish as if you had paid 14 or something. Best Wishes!

Zappa gave his socio-political-lambasting-musical-theatre-of-the-absurd-dog-and-three-legged-pony-show a well-earned rest and concentrated on doing what he did best, arranging.  In Hot Rats he did this in the rock idiom, in GW the emphasis is on jazz/funk horns and tight orchestration.

This here is Bowie in his glam freakish deca-dance period, so you can imagine that the music sounds just like that, weird but glamorous. The only flaw I find is that the notes for "Sweet thing" are a little bit overstretched but thats not really an issue because it still makes a great song. Buy this and once you put it in your player make sure you have the volume down for the part after the intro, because it will blast your ears.
Highly recommended.

"Almost Gothic" is so good its  almost hypnotic in the smooth relaxing delivery as only Donald Fagen can  sing it.  "What a shame about me" is a unique song as the lyrics  are as enticing as the music.  "Negative Girl" shows an even  deeper jazzier side that was prevalent in the Fagen solo albums. My  favorite release on the album as most of the fans who have written reviews  on this CD has to be "Jack Of Speed" as Steely Dan gets really,  really FUNKY!  Also, "West of Hollywood" brings back some of the  classic Steely Dan flavor on a new track.  THERE IS NOT ONE BAD SONG ON  THIS CD!  THIS CD IS UP THERE WITH "AJA"!  This is a MUST  HAVE for all Steely Dan fans.  You will not be disappointed.

  This album was Bowie's first after retiring Ziggy Stardust, but he still retained the famous red hair for the album, probably to help sales along..? Originally meant to be an opera to "1984" Bowie was denied the rights to the novel, and so reworked it to avoid copyright infringement. Still, this album is very operetic in style, the tracks often times flowing together. And it still retains the incredibly dark feel of the classic novel. This is definately one of Bowie's darker, if not darkest, album.
If you keep that in mind, you'd realize that the show was TERRIFIC, maybe the best world tour ever done by a female  singer back then.

It was produced from footage from 1973.  It's not Paul McCartney or U2, but it is of sufficient quality for an enjoyable experiance.  It's not fuzzy or materially lacking in any way.  The video is quite clear and gives an accurate reproduction of a Yes concert from 1973.  The camera angles are very good, the camera is not bouncing around all over the place from musician to musician like some of the the more recent DVD's.  I have a Cream DVD from 1968 the quality is really quite good, and this footage is at least as good if not better.  I was hesitant to get it fearing it would have been sorely lacking in quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes is an awesome band, and this DVD does total justice.

Greatest Story Ever Told
The real reason I bought this DVD, however, was for the segment with Antonio Carlos Jobim.  Frank and Antonio do a short medley of Jobim and Cole Porter-written songs (this segment of the show could and should have been MUCH longer) - but which medley unfortunately is credited to the arranging talents of Nelson Riddle - when in fact, the entire arrangement of all 4 Jobim and Porter songs played should have been attributed to Claus Ogerman.  The arrangement of these four tunes can be heard note for note in the "Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim" 1967 LP (and now CD) on the Reprise label.  Claus Ogerman arranged and conducted this entire album.  Shortened versions of these four songs were only "lifted" from the album for this tv show.  Antonio plays guitar chord changes in between the songs which make the 4 tunes flow effortlessly from one to the other.  Nelson Riddle does a fine job arranging the music for the rest of the tv special, but I believe in giving credit where credit is due - and by no means did he arrange the Sinatra/Jobim part of the special.
"Madman..." is a good album with some standout songs that are among his best.  There is nothing on here that is absolutely bad.  Highly recommended for fans of his early work.
The Bee Gees polish and talent is obvious from this performance.  I had previously thought of them as typical of vocalists with lots studio musicians to fill in their limitations.  Not so.  It was clear that Barry Gibb had as much command over his guitar as he did his voice (and hair).  Even more surprising to me was that Maurice Gibb was a multi-instrumentalist and band-leader (on stage at least).

4713	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	It's interesting to see how Steely Dan have morphed over the years, and how their sound, as a whole, changed during their lengthy hiatus.  Kicking off in 1972 with "Can't Buy A Thrill", the sound was predominantly guitar-driven, with hints of jazz chops and addictive hooks.  By the time "Pretzel Logic" hit the shelves in 1974, vocalist Michael McDonald had enhanced the Dan's musical schema with some blue-eyed soul, and the hits started pouring out.  "Rikki Don't Lose That Number".  "Black Friday".  The title track--all classics.  With "Katy Lied" and "The Royal Scam", SD anchored themselves into the mainstream-cum-progressive category by continuing to push the envelope with avant-garde chord changes and airtight harmonies.  So, when "Aja" debuted in 1977, the Dan were ready to drop a bomb into the spotlight.  A tough act to follow, "Aja" raised the bar for the wannabe acts with masterful musicianship by Wayne Shorter, Jeff Porcaro, Larry Carlton, McDonald (on his fourth album with the Dan), and heightened writing and performances by Becker and Fagen.

The selections on this disc are violently free of any unifying sound; the segues from "Directly From My Heart.." to "Prelude.." and "The Orange County Lumber Truck" to the title track are among the most jarring things in rock. Most of the selections were recorded live & rough; the rest are immaculate studio recordings. The common denominator is a touch of parody throughout.
I have to say that I  wish they could make another album that compares to the first 3  masterpieces they gave us in the 70's (Thrill, Countdown & Pretzel). I  did hear an acoustic guitar in 1 or 2 songs so that gives me hope for the  future. So I am 38 now, that means the next one will come in
The songs themselves (there are actually 9 of them, other tracks are interludes to catch breath) are rather long, multi-sectional progressive pieces, each one on a different subject. My favourites includes Stinkfist, Eulogy and 46&2, but every song, even enery minute is absolutely brilliant. With Third Eye, the album reaches a logical conclusion; this track might be the deepest of the deep, a tremendous cathartic experience.
I recommend this album for guitar jazz fans. 4 out of 5 because 5's should be few and far between- reserved for classics.

13. Nothing really matters (1999).- I like this song and the video, Madonna is dressed as Geisha, the video is odd, but I like it. 9/10
My personal favourite is Sucker Train Blues with its raging, nonsensical lyrics ("Brains are frying while the kings and queens are dying, Satan won the race and the miracle mile") but who listens to what Weiland's wailing? In rock music, it's the guitars and drums doing the real speaking.
First, it is self-conscious, calculated pop in some places, a blatant play for the mass audience.  "Dancing in the Dark," "Cover Me," and "Glory Days" embody this aspect. They were written to be hits.  Which is to take nothing away from them; I love hit singles.  But these are songs in which Bruce consciously decided to translate his Bruce-ness to an audience that had so far been immune to his charms, and it worked.
Of course, once I had enough loose change I bought the album and promptly proceeded to play the first side about five times as often as I flipped it over and played side two; having the CD means I tend to listen to the whole thing all the way through. I would argue that "Tiny Dancer," "Levon," "Razor Face," and "Madman Across the Water" equals the best side of any Elton John record. I also used the title track as part of a poetry unit for English class (ah, those liberal days of yore). The movie "Almost Famous" has made "Tiny Dancer" popular again, but anybody who listens to this CD is going to find out there are some other great songs too. In addition to John's music and Bernie Taupin's lyrics, I think credit has to be given to Paul Buckmaster, whose sweeping string arrangements never worked better in giving John's songs color and depth. "Madman Acros the Water" is Elton John's darkest album, although it is more a sense of brooding and forboding rather than anger.
The album itself is perfection. Soulful, powerful, lyrical, in fact everything you could want from a music, regardless of your preference or bias. This level of haunting beauty has 'broad' appeal.
This album has never been off my playlist since I bought it on the day of release in 1971.  It has withstood the test of time and the vagaries of musical fashions and changing tastes.
8658	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I bought this album having only heard a little of Bowie's massive archives. This album has since been whirled constantly by me. The first element which stands out to me is the presence of horns in  trks. like candidate,dodo,and big-brother blaring in the musical bed as twanging, banging guitar riffs. This instrumental marriage widens the explorations Bowie guides us on lyrically,from lovers in doorways in the city,to frantic,fleeing,paranoia of 1984. It is obvious that Bowie, like many others were affected by reading the bleak Orwell novel. Another highpoint of this cd are the trk. transitions which bleed magnificently together. These transitions gradually alter the mood and the pace of the songs. Bowie's vocals induce visions of a regal punk,or a rebellious aristocrat that casually roams the glass freckled streets in search of pleasure, refuge,and style. This music should be spit from your speakers everywhere;on the street where you live,on another floor,in the  back of a car,in a cellar like a chuch where the waters off. If you want it terrans....get it here then.

He does not try to express himself with words like any animal who can speak would do, or to express himself clearly like any human with some sense would do. He uses nearly exclusively body language and in that body language only one side of the picture, the gross and the gore, the dirty and the bloody. Punk they say? Punk they have the right to say. But G.G. Allin demonstrates if it is necessary to do so that he, as a punk rocker with a death wish, is an exhibitionist, an aggressive and violent person, a literal s***t-eater, a true p***s-drinker and a self p***e-taster. So what! So nothing. So not much. The death wish is no longer only a death wish in him. It is also a death instinct because he not only wishes death but he is cruelly violent against other people. If he really believes a body is a rock and roll temple, his vision of the temple is particularly dilapidated. It is Stonehenge after a gang of looters armed with twenty bulldozers have been on the site for a fortnight. Look at his temple, at his body: out of shape due to no exercise, extreme alcoholism, drug addiction of all types and kinds, not to speak of his idea that the body is like paper, to be scribbled on I guess. There is no explanation in this very superficial film. And there is no real presentation of his music. It is more some kind of self-satisfying review of this annihilating and nihilistic anti-art attitude on what is not even a stage, but just a piece of floor in some kind of back room. Punk for sure but without the music or without the political anarchism. Just some scatological provocation as if a provocation was enough to be considered as art in the simple fact that it is a provocation or as politics in the simple fact that is outside all norms. Too bad, and what's more he did not even hold his promise to commit suicide on stage. He simply died of an overdose. What a flop! What a let down! An artist should be able to hold his promises.

And the sound, archive that was, so are most of the other clips, is acceptable: we can clearly hear what and how he sang albeit that there is some slight surface noise.
If you ever take the time to listen, you will be delighted by the advanced resolution in the sound quality and how the vocals and instrumentations are simultaneously separated and reverberated throughout the six channels. In terms of awesome sound quality, Victim of Love never sounded so good. As a plus, if you prefer DTS 5.1 or if you opt for Dolby Digital, both options, where you can choose either one, are contained in this disc for your listening enjoyment.

1344	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This most perfect of all Firesign Theatre albums has greatly gained in poignancy for me as I travel through later middle age. The centerpiece of our story is an elderly man, George Leroy Tirebiter, who sits awake late at night, an insomniac impatiently spinning through the TV dial. Every so often George comes upon movies he appeared in decades earlier: Peorgie and Mudhead in "High School Madness" and a Korean War picture. At the very end of the album, after another long, exhausting night, a wrung-out Tirebiter gets a "wake-up" call from his answering service. The lady informs him that he has several messages from Stan Laurel, Babe Hardy, Mr. Roach and HONK! HONK! ("he wouldn't leave his name"). Tirebiter remembers them all and brightens considerably. Suddenly he hears the chimes of an ice cream truck off in the distance and George excitedly tells the answering service that he has to go, because "they NEVER come up in the hills!" Georgie chases after the ice cream man, nickel in hand, and at fadeout he magically transforms into a little boy.

The fact that the Ensemble Modern was able to give a convincing performance is remarkable.
9038	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Tool is a very unique band. They avoid the media, hardly ever show up on their music videos, and just let the music do the talking. I've had this album for about 4 years now. It really is a concept album if you think about it. Stinkfist is an individual's yearning for change, then from Eulogy to Pushit, this individual recalls his past experiences (like flashbacks of one's life before one dies), then Aenema purges these memories, and Third Eye is the rediscovering of one self.  The first month I listened to this CD I really didn't care too much for it, but that's how Tool albums work. They aren't accessible until you are familiar with what they are doing with the music. Then, one day, the volume on my CD player was accidentally turned up a notch. I was too lazy to adjust it, so I just left it there. I was listening to Aenema (the song), and suddenly I had a tool-gasm. I was lightheaded for a minute, and didn't know where I was or what I was doing, being fully immersed in the music. From that moment, I became a fan. No other band that I've ever listened to can do this; build a song up, and then have a climax that is just incredible.
1823	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	D.A. Pennebaker's filming of the final concert by David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust incarnation is a great piece of rock history.  Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders From Mars is considered to Mr. Bowie's masterpiece.  Mr. Bowie not only created a classic album, but in adopting the androgynstic persona, he blurred the lines between male and female and spearheaded the glam rock movement.  Unfortunately, this disk is a major disappointment from the visual side.  The songs and performance are first rate, but the picture is horrible.  The disk does not clean up the blemishes.  It is grainy, blurry and just plain tough to look at.  The camera work doesn't help matters either as Mr. Pennebaker keeps the camera locked on Mr. Bowie most of the time and many times in close-ups.  This takes away from the full experience of the show.  The producers did do a great job in remixing the sound and the 5.1 Surround Sound mode is clean and clear.  You are better off buying the cd soundtrack version than the DVD.  This is for diehard David Bowie fans only because of the atrocious picture quality not because of content.

I love how the original members explain their start and unbelievable  unexpected propelling into mainstream rock & roll acceptance then when they really were a bunch of geeky, frumpy local southern California kids in highschool who grew up together like the rest of us then, and simply enjoyed getting together to make music, and everything that happened to them was literally by chance & luck along the way before they even realized what was happening. I like the Tom Jones tour bus matter too!

Then a suprising Wasted Time (reprise) which is a short, orchestral piece, this works very well. Victim Of Love is maybe my least preferred track as not very melodic, unlike Pretty Maids Al In A Row and Try To Love Again, both are ballards in which the band excell. Finally The Last Resort is an excellent closer rounding off a recording which has stood the test of time.

The album starts out with "Sucker Train Blues" and with a name like that the listener knows that Velvet Revolver is ready to kick ass. It has great vocals and Slash has a solo that is reminiscent of the one he did in "You Could Be Mine" with those amazing 16th notes. "Do It for the Kids" has a dark sense of humor and this is where Weiland shows that he belongs in the band with his amazing singing (it stayed in my head for days [in a good way]). "Big Machine" has a universal message about the rock industry, but the music isn't that likeable. Cuts 4-8 are decent to good tracks, but nothing special. "Set Me Free" is a great song that introduced the world to Velvet Revolver. Too bad it was first heard in the terrible movie, "The Hulk." "You Got No Right" is a ballad that is actually heartfelt, an incredible song with great performances by the entire band. Slash has a great solo and the song is arguably the best on the disc, this actually surpasses the unforgetable "Don't Cry" off Use Your Illusion I. Most everyone has heard "Slither" which features a great guitar solo by Slash using the wah-wah pedal for all its worth (think "Civil War"). "Dirty Little Thing" is pretty good, but the album has a disappointing ending with "Loving the Alien" which sounds like an attempt at another "Sweet Child O' Mine" which failed miserably. The only reason that I bought this at first was because it had Slash, Duff, Matt, and Scott; all from bands that were great, but in the end had this been done by people no one had ever heard of, it still would be good, just it would not have received so much publicity. I would recommend this to anyone, even if they aren't GNR or STP fans. I had to listen to it about five-ten times all the way through to appreciate it because I was not expecting such a different sound so don't listen to it once and get rid of it because you don't like it. Give it a chance first.
8933	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Sugarloaf is an underrated band, they were far better than history will show them to be. This compilation is wonderful, it brings together most of their 2 albums "Sugarloaf" and "Spaceship Earth", leaving off a few songs, but great, none the less. Their music is just really good, I can't use any fancy words to describe it, it's just good, like many bands from their era. If you like classic rock, you should really enjoy this.
Others have written variations on this but, for the fan, this set is truly on a par with the best recent rock 'n roll DVD releases: "The Grateful Dead Movie," "Led Zeppelin," "Dig!" "The Kids Are All Right," "The Beatles Anthology."  Great stuff.
The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World
The rest of the disc is experimental, challenging, adventurous meat. "Didja Get Any Onya?," starts out in a big band-like jazz explosion. It goes through several motifs - featuring vocal experimentation, classical-like dissonance (in the middle section) and some loose and seemingly unstructured sax playing (which many may accuse of sounding like 'noise.') Lowell George does a vocal 'improv' which mimics what sounds like the trumpet a few times on this track. This has me laughing like a maniac. "Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Sexually Aroused Gas Mask" features an odd-timed rhythm, similar to the one found on "Didja." However, the rest of the track is given to vocal experimentation. If you don't have a sense of humor, this track will annoy the hell out of you. There's lots of hysterical laughter, yelling and roaring. Personally, this has me laughing hysterically. "Toad Of The Short Forest" starts out with some tasteful jazz instrumentation. Frank's guitar playing in particular gets the spotlight. Unexpectedly, the second half roars with blasts of free jazz improvisation. This becomes very challenging, as there are tempos/rhythms layered upon one another. Frank himself takes a moment during the track to tell the audience what time signatures various instrumentalists are using. He says Drummer A is playing in 7/8, Drummer B, Tambourine player & Bassist are all playing in 3/4 and the Organ player is playing in 5/8 - all at the same time. Definitely something for the cerebral who loves a challenge to tickle the brain. "Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue" is a meandering instrumental that I'm not too fond of. This is my least favorite on here. However, most of it has an ominous tone to it. "Dwarf Nebula Processional & Dwarf Nebula" seems like two different song titles. This would make a bit of sense because the track sounds as if it's divided into two different tracks. The first half is a quirky, pseudo-country/rock experiment that I wish would have gone on longer. The second seems like a backward recording of guitar solos and god knows what else. I really like this. "Oh No" sounds like a typical '60's r&b/rock tune. The vocals are unconventional, albeit melodic. This track is fairly accessible. "The Orange County Lumber Truck" is very strong on melody - something that many may be surprised to find here. A tasteful, Hendrix-like hard rock track with great guitar playing from Frank. "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" is nothing but jarring, chaotic, ominous, cacophonous distortion and feedback. The disturbing thing that I find is that these last 2 minutes can be addictive in a psychotic way - in that I personally wish that it would have gone on for another few minutes. If you slip into the designated mood, you may feel the same way. Anyway, it's moments like these that leave you wondering if there's really a discernible difference between music and 'noise.' Music and any other kind of appreciation is subjective and are nothing but personal opinions, right? If it wasn't, then EVERYONE would think, feel, observe similarly on EVERYTHING - no chance.

Some may be put off by the onstage antics of "Flo & Eddie", and I agree, they're given a little too much play on this album, but it's still a lot of fun, and the second side is the killer.  A maniacally over-the-top version of "Peaches En Regalia" combined with a juiced-up "Tears Began To Fall", preluded by a hilarious send-up of the groupie-laden early seventies.
3) Big Machine - Big, stomping song where Sorum really opens up with the drums.  Thumping, driving bassline that gives the song a serious edge.  Very good.  8/10

Dancing the Blues represents the energy, love and respect which Taj has for music.  There is a wide range of music from the motown sounds of Taj's excellent version of the four top's "Sugarpie Honeybunch" (oh no I'm in junior high again)to Chester (the wolf) Burnett' "Sitting on Top of the World".

  The version of "Catholic Girls" here really brings out the best that Ike Willis had to offer.  The voice of Joe come up really clearly here, and his backups really bring out the best of Frank's mastery of traditional harmony with the "don't bother Mary" chunk that outlines relatively traditional resolution practices.  The voice of the Central Scrutinizer makes an appearance here, too, and the subsequent inclusion of "Crew Slut" is an extension of the "Joe's" storyline.
The same could be said about John Schlitt. His voice can growl with the best of 'em, yet he can sing so purely and about such emotional topics that you'd swear he had a direct pipeline to God. By way of comparison, I'd say Schlitt's voice rivals that of Journey's Steve Perry. Schlitt is that good. (And equally as captivating a front man.)
All of this is here along with some outstanding album tracks and B-sides. There's A Girl Named Sandoz (Sandoz? It was the name of the Swiss Laboratory where Albert Hoffman created LSD) so it's pretty clear what that one is about. Then there's the practically miraculous early song, Baby Let Me Take You Home which contains in almost it's complete form the primary sound of many of the garage bands of the mid 60's, at least those which included an organ. (All-guitar bands modeled themselves more on the early Kinks).

Trip-hop/piano opens the album in "Getting Scared," starting off soft and transforming into a rocker. There's a dark, intense edge to the music -- the sensuality and fire of "Come Here Boy," the rage in "Rake It In," and the snarl of "Angry Angel." While there are some softer-edged ballads, the sound is of a young woman with some emotional scars.

9870	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	One of Costello's most riveting albums, Blood and Chocolate isn't quite as consistent as earlier outings but is, nevertheless, one of his most powerful. One could argue that, emotionally, it's one of his most personal albums as well. This is about as raw as EC gets.
The only drawback associated with this tape is the picture quality.  I don't know the origins or originally intended purposes of this tape, but at times is appears to be the work of an amateur.  On several occasions, the camera shakes momentarily as if it has been bumped.  Along the same lines, the editor of this video would surely garner no rewards for his work.  Many of the transitions from one song to another are terribly choppy and poorly done.  Don't let these technical flaws deter you from buying this video, however, especially at such a low price.  Judy Garland is close to her best throughout the entire performance, and Liza proves that she is much more than just Judy Garland's daughter.
Picture quality is very average (and this is not a compliment).
  P.S.-God I hate the term vinyl. It is such a "hipster" word. That is how these twentysomethings refer to LPs or wax records. And I'm only 35. But I never called a record"vinyl" growing up.
Mannheim Steamroller's version of these songs and every other song on this album should be the "measuring stick" with which to compare future Christmas arrangements.  Chip Davis has done such an excellent job arranging this album, that it has found its way into the hearts of the listeners forever.

Seeing Rick Wakeman in his gold cape ,long blond hair and the circle of keyboards surrounding him is quite something.
The DVD, however, does leave something to be desired.  Nearly all of the first half of the show (up to "Lovely to See You")is omitted, and the overture is shortened.  The DVD came out right after the PBS broadcast of the show, and a CD also came out with many of the songs left off, so at the time it was nice having the DVD which had a few songs the CD didn't.  A few years ago, however, the Moodies released a Deluxe edition with all of the songs and most of the talking restored.  A comment by John Lodge re: all the cameras being from "our friends at the PBS" was left off the expanded CDs (it was in the broadcast version of the show, which I have on tape).  Anyway, for some reason, the DVD has not been similarly expanded.  Great songs like "Emily's Song," "New Horizons," and "Voices in the Sky" are not included.  Why they have not brought out a DVD set of the full show is beyond me.
The album was two records, one in the studio, one live.  The studio recordings feature songs that are multi-layered with strings, keyboards, multiple guitar tracks, and great great playing all throughout.  Felix Pappalardi, an outstanding musician in his own rite, contributed on some of the more obscure instruments.  Pete Brown wrote the trippy lyrics to the Jack Bruce compositions.  What Cream was doing in the studio was about as innovative at that time as anyone.

It also created a career for the Animals that would last well into 1968 with many changes in personnel and an eventual change of name and style to Eric Burdon & the Animals in 1966. They had a steady stream of hits, though they were generally bigger in the U.K. where they almost always placed in the Top 10 than the U.S. where they most often had to settle for Top 20. The British market generally liked harder-edged songs than the U.S. The Animals weren't even afraid to release straight blues singles like John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom  or R&B like Timmy Shaw's (aka Jake Hammond) Gonna Send You Back to Georgia (Walker). ("Walker" always confused me. I thought it was a person but it turns out to be a section of Newcastle).
9187	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	It is obvious that Aenima is a bar-none accomplishment of sort, which was created so that the ear would explore lush and vast territorial depths that many cannot complete. Maynard and the boys have really worked themselves to accomplish an achievement like this. I do not think that anybody else in all of musics past has ever created such a diabolical song structure as Tool have proved they are capable of doing on Aenima. Pink Floyd could have possibly came close, but for this generation and for yours trulies ears, Tool is the band who has done so. Tool is without a doubt the mother who provides the breast milk in todays rock scene. You see beyond infinity bands who try desperately to imitate Tools capabilities but any one who has a brain in their skull, knows that they fail. Now if you haven't heard a song off Aenima, prepare for a mind altering experiance. Tools music had references to the end of the world, Christs death, selling out, and much more themes one must have an open mind upon listening to. If you object Tool, please go back to your Jars of Clay music and leave real music alone please. tool is the band of the 90s decade, in my opinion. And if they continue to go in the direction they did with Lateralus, then we are in for a big treat in the following years to come.

What I did (and which I think is the wisest thing to do for a number of reasons) is simply disable Autorun on your Windows system. This prevents the CD from autostarting when you insert it into your CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive.

Not a weak track--and a surprize "Stompin' At The Savoy" by Connick during Carly's costume change is incredible!  Should be both a live CD and DVD--better than her last live DVD & pairs nicely with it.
6637	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The title says it all.  I scrouged $5 of pocket money from my parents in 1977 to buy the vinyl LP and it stayed on my turntable for about a year (only occasionally to be replaced for a breif moment by other greats such as Dark Side of the Moon).  This is the Eagles at their absolute peak and not a throwaway track on the album.  30 years later it is on my iPod. The title track is haunting and the ripping guitar solo at the end is a simply brilliant guitar interplay between two of the most brilliant under-rated and genius rock guitarists about, Joe Walsh and Don Felder.  The album is a nice blend of hard ripping rock (Felder's solo on Victim of Love is simply "wicked" - supposedly done "live in the studio" with no overdubs) and lovely melodic softer tunes (I really like Randy Meisner's often passed over "Try and Love Again"). Only bands of the quality of the Eagles can do this variety on one album and pull it off.  The guitars are alternatively, haunting (like Henley's vocals), melodic (like G.Frey) and hard edged. Lyics are bitingly cynical and still relevant today... how many people still say the famous line "...you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave?"

All of Metallica's 80s output is 5 star stuff; Metallica's cover versions alone wipe the floor with most bands' music(including Limp Bizkit, buddy) and this collection of (mostly) rough bootleg footage is no exception. I remember many teenage basement and rec room viewing parties when this came out, but I have one complaint: these guys have(deservedly) attained a private jet and personal chef level of success in the ensuing years, and they couldn't throw any bonus stuff on here?

Be warned, if you are a FZ fan, you may or may not "get" this.  If you liked the LSO recording, Yellow Shark stomps it.  If Freak Out is your favorite and you were the guy on Baby Snakes hollering for Dinah-Moe Humm, you get no guarantees from me.  This is dense and heady, but it is probably the definitive recording of Zappa's chamber work.  At the very least, it's the swan song of the last great composer of the 20th century and is worth owning for that reason if no other.

This album cuts across age barriers as  I know plenty of kids who like it too.  I suspect that it's exposed more  than just this old codger to some new names, and at the same time, it's  given me some of the old stuff I loved too, the soaring, melodic guitar,  fabulous rhythms and - as I don't speak a word of Spanish - the totally  indecipherable lyrics!
More than any other Mannheim Steamroller album, Fresh Aire II's production is geared towards records.  Side A  (the Fantasy; tracks 1-8) clearly belongs together, and is quite separate in feel and approach from Side B.  It develops the theme of an epic battle, which is almost biblical in proportions (complete with a holy "Army of Pride" chasing away hosts of demons!).  This sounds overwhelming, but actually it's completely in line with Chip's irrelevant approach; The music is delivered with amusement and a good-natured sense of melody.  Indeed, the idea of "Fantasy" seems more likely a reason to experiment with grandiose textures than an actual classical-rock opera.  The only drawback to this approach is that almost all of the "7 doors" tracks clock in around 2 minutes, and being so good, that just isn't enough time to satisfy the listener.  (Don't worry too much though; like I mentioned before Davis' particularly likes these themes and rehashes them many times in subsequent releases.)

I first want to establish that Mickey Hart is one of my heroes; I've seen him live in various incarnations and I have all of his recorded releases. Now that I've set down my credentials, I can write that this is Hart's worst album. Beyond weak songwriting, the Mystery Box sound is sickeningly conventional. I would only expect this recording to appeal to 16 year girls on Long Island circa 1994. This misadventure occurred despite good ingredients and a decent recipe. The project included Robert Hunter, Zakir Hussain and conguero Giovanni Hidalgo. The Mint Juleps sing well. Beyond these qualities, the Mystery Box was a genuinely unique project for Hart. Moreover, the idea of a pop crossover in itself wasn't a bad idea -it just didn't work in this situation. So what went wrong? That's the mystery! Now if I could only find that darn box, the answer to this enigma may be inside.

I Like all the guys and groups they came from (their music) and I like this disc.  It's just that it doesn't rock like STP and GNR.  It still rocks.  Slither is a killer tune and there are some others.  The sound is very good for a heavy rock outing.  I just kept waiting for the tune that would blow me away but it never came.  It's not STP or GNR it's Velvet Revolver.  Fair warning there is copy guard on this disc and may be incompatible with some CD players especially CD ROM based machines.
Still, this was Elvis' first album where I found myself  skipping over songs, a trend that unfortunately became more the rule than  the exception.  Four stars only because of the impossibly high standards he  set with his first three albums.

And hey, we can't forget Maynard, can we?  He's an excellent singer, and he just gets better and better.  His melodic tone is nearly hypnotizing in its beauty, and the emotional power is overwhelming.  Aside from that, he's an insanely talented composer.  Some of these songs, such as "Eulogy" and "Third Eye", may seem a bit long-winded and drawn out at first, but after a while, you come to appreciate the subtleties, and the songs sort of "take form", so to speak. This writing style has only gotten even more fantastic on "Lateralus", which is an even more epic, and even more brilliant album.
8695	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Bill Hicks's secret weapon was that he wasn't a comedian.  Comedians are harmless guys who tell jokes and roguishly poke fun at our oh-so-silly human foibles.  Ah me!  This was not Hicks.  Hicks was a very serious and  fiercely intelligent social critic and moralist who just happened to be  extremely damn funny at the same time.  He told the hardest of hard truths  and was totally uncompromising.  All his CDs are brilliant, but I have to  dock this one a notch for the frequent musical interludes,which I find  obtrusive and distracting.  They do the same thing on Rant In E Minor,  where it gets really ridiculous, music rising between practically every  sentence out of Hicks's mouth, sometimes obscuring his voice for a while.  If they wanted to release some of Bill's music, they should have added it  on at the end in the form of bonus tracks or devoted a separate CD to it.

This album is definitely not for beginners or fickle fans who could never get beyond the first three albums. It's his Tonight's The Night, Station to Station or Songs of Love & Hate. Separates the connoisseurs from the tourists.
Opening the CD is the ageless radio classic "Green-Eyed Lady."  Jerry Corbetta's keyboards have the perfect sound for the song.  It isn't only the lyrical and musical combination that has made this tune a household name for over thirty-five years but the pleasantry of Jerry's mix and approach.  The second track is a superb rendition of the Yardbirds legendary - "Train Kept A-Rollin' (Stroll On)."  Inexplicably this is left off the current greatest hits package of Sugarloaf available for purchase.  The band puts the right level of energy into the interpretation but never tries for overkill.  Speaking of covers there is a medley called "Bach Doors Man/Chest Fever" included on the first record.  The later is an instrumental version of the Band's legendary song.  Once again Corbetta's thinking is to offer a solid musical piece without reinventing the wheel.  "West Of Tomorrow" can be compared to the enjoyable Three Dog Night hit "Celebrate."  "Gold And The Blues" finds the group deviating from the previous formula and offering their vision on a blues-rock journey.  It works well and shows that the guys could be diverse and still consistent.  "Things Gonna Change Some" ends the musical journey in grand style.  Listen intently and you can hear some of Dave Brubeck's "Take Five."
The amazing this is the power this man generates at age 55.  Mehtinks he'll be going this way at age 80, astonishing when we thought he would never live till he his 30th birthday.

And here he is still going strong when seemingly healhier specimens have long retired or even gone to their graves to push up the daisies.

Second, the interludes are not nearly as good as the songs. Tracks like Useful Idiot and Cesaro Summability are too easy. They fit in the context of the rest of the album, but along with Die Eier von Satan and creepy stuff like Message to Harry Manback, they are just stop-gaps between the music. (Although I'd have to say that negative Ions, which is nothing more than 4 minutes of static, is my favorite of the interlude tracks. Go figure.)

GG started out as a relatively normal punk rocker in the late 70's, but throughout the 1980's he became increasingly unhinged.  Ingestion of large quantities of alcohol and whatever drugs he could find no doubt fueled his growing paranoia and megalomania; by the time of this documentary, GG had become completely convinced that he was "God, Jesus and Satan all rolled into one" - though it is difficult to find any examples of the first two in GG's behavior, lyrics or world view.  The man was apparently incapable of any level of empathy or compassion, preferring instead to either beat or be beaten.

Godowsky himself was a giant of the keyboard and a great interpreter of Chopin (although his recording legacy doesn't appear to do him justice as he never felt comfortable in the confines of the ancient recording studio). He certainly has managed to push pianistic technique to its very limits in these 53 Studies. However, besides being pianistically effective, the writer finds the great majority of the pieces to be very musical and, in quite a few instances (e.g. No. 13 in E flat minor, No. 25 in A flat major, No. 36 in G sharp minor, No. 45 in E major), the effect is exquisite.

Just as quite a few others have experienced.


I listened to the thirty second clips here on Amazon, as well as hearing "Fall to Pieces" on the radio, and thought that the CD might be worth something.  I chose the "copy-protect" version mainly because it was $1 cheaper, but now I know that I should have spent the extra dollar for a CD that works.
The whole album's a bonus.
"New Kid" seems very out of place here (as I chronologically grow older...) but this is still, as with the "Born To Run" collection by Springsteen, an absolute joy to listen to.
What also makes this great is the era it was performed in.  This concert was recorded while they were playing new hits like "Another One Bites The Dust", "Under Pressure", and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" yet they still play FULL versions of older classics like "Killer Queen", "Now I'm Here". "Sheer Heart Attack", "Tie Your Mother Down", and of course the FAST version of "We Will Rock You".

While I think Del or Souls Of Mischief come more consitant on the lyrical tip  than Snupe, I feel that "Like It Should Be" is more solid in its  production than any other Hiero album. The beats range from the slow, bass  heavy feel of the the first quarter of the album ("Brown Sugar",  and "Sweet Potato Pie"), to the upbeat, jazzy remainder of songs  ("First Sermon", "Now What?"). Out of the album's  16  tracks, only two of them dissapoint, making for a pretty solid album from  start to finish. The track listing only show 14 tracks, but there are 2  bonus tracks included: "Brown Sugar Remix" and "Give It  Up". The only flaw of this album is that Snupe's subjects rarely  expand beyond pimpin' and bustin' out wack emcees. Still, he flexes ill  verses that never bore, so it's not really a complaint. My only question is  what exactly does Mike G do the whole album besides produce the intro? This  is basically Snupe's solo album.

This album includes two Elton John hits that you may still hear occasionally on adult radio stations: "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon".  While these songs are excellent, they are only the beginning, the first two tracks, on this incredible CD.  This album contains what could be my favorite song ever: "Indian Sunset" is an epic, soaring, affective song about the Native American Indian at the time of colonization, and it's unforgettable.  The title track is a mesmerizing journey led masterfully by Elton's haunting, intense vocals.  (I like this version of "Madman" better than the one on the remastered Tumbleweed Connection because of the embellished instrumentation.)  "All The Nasties" and "Goodbye" are equally compelling and representative of how marvelously Elton presents brooding, melancholy, thoughtful melodies.  "Holiday Inn", "Razor Face", and "Rotten Peaches" are more upbeat and up tempo, but they follow the pattern of interesting lyrics from Taupin and infectious music and vocals from Elton.

One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original, which leaned towards Big Band brassy, Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track, and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half, but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.
The remaster, which I picked up cheap,(not on Amazon) sounds(disappointingly) a bit thin to me.

The songs on the Red Rocks DVD are predominately compositions written and performed by Justin Hayward who, while he sounded as though he had a cold at the time, pulled off the vocals with aplomb. John Lodge and Ray Thomas are heard too, either in backing vocals or their own songs. Even Graeme Edge is heard at the beginning of the concert, reciting for the first time, his poem "Late Lament", which was originally recorded by Michael Pinder.

Its a hard, aggressive album, but you can always understand what's going on.  The instruments aren't obstructed by the vocals, yet they don't overpower the vocals or themselves.  Instead, every single member of this band is literally showcased whenever they play their songs.  There isn't so much an individual talent on this album as their is a collective talent that is awe-inspiring in just about every circle of rock musicians out there...
Lisa Girrard's voice is unbelievable. The video is wonderful because they do closeups while she is singing, and it is quite powerful to see her actually producing these sounds. Her voice is like one would imagine a valkyrie - the power of a tsunami with the delicacy of a hummingbird all at the same time. When you hear some female singers, like Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Enya, etc., you see goddess archetypes like Diana or Isis. With Lisa it is more like Kali. This is feminine energy, but it hits you like a freight train in the chest. Which is not to say it is harsh or ragged. Quite the contrary, she exhibits a control over her voice that is remarkable. She weaves soft Celtic lilting notes with deep, powerful tones, modulated by a Turkish or Berber-style vibrato that is amazing. Think German opera blended with belly dancing music and you will be in the ballpark, although that description really misses the true power and beauty of the songs. This is a woman who makes you feel the goddess in your gut as well as your heart, like Ann Wilson, Tina Turner, Janis Joplin, etc., but with a decidedly surreal twist. Lisa often sings in a language she creates herself, which adds to the mystique of their music. In some ways, she reminds me of Nina Hagen, although Hagen went from opera to more average punk rock. The power and control of their voices feels similar to me. (Your mileage may vary.)

Not as bad as it might sound in fact the title song and Rebel Rebel seem to get lots of radio airplay as well as cover bands versions, but still it was generally considered to be inferior to his earlier releases.
Each cd has it's own unique style, and this cd is one of 'em.

9857	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This, along with Imperial Bedroom, is my favorite Costello/MacManus album (I actually prefer his real name, Declan MacManus).  I have loved the fact that Costello has changed over the years, trying ever musical style known to man, writing probably around 1000 songs or so, and has never really made a godawful album (Goodbye Cruel World, generally considered his worst album, has some good tunes on it).  Declan released 2 albums in 1986, King of America (another masterpiece), and this one.  This one is much rawer and more powerful.  The opener, Uncomplicated, is superb.  The next one, I Hope You're Happy Now, is cool, too, but the 2 masterpieces are Tokyo Storm Warning, a breathless, amazing piece of wordplay and music, and the song I Want You is one of the best songs about love (and anger) I've ever heard.  Costello has been really amazing throughout his career.  He can still turns the anger on, but it never defined him as an artist or as a human being.  He's not stuck in arrested development, like some rockers can be.  He continues to grow as an artist.  He may have started out as a punk, but he isn't a punk, and honestly, never really was.  He has a ton of depth that really comes out in his music.  Declan rules...

The ex-dreamers influence can be found strongly in this album, Ancient Dreams and Indigo. The music here is getting close to new age, darker, moodier but still not missing the joyous and playful elements of Rivers.. or El Dorado particularly on "Forever the Optimist". Every track here has an impact on the listener depending on the interpretation and only PH can do it. Many of the songs here will carry you to the apex and then drop you gliding with satisfaction. An example is 87 Dream of a lifetime. This music was my life sountrack 20 years ago, in my moments of solitude I play the tape cassete now that I have it on cd the memories come in full vividness. The music here is timeless as best portrayed by the cover of a world over dry land. The world is hope and joy and the crack land is the melancholic side of this album.

The sad truth is that pancreatic cancer and fate left him in the dust, while his words remind today of how screwed we were and how similar things are now. Hicks was a sign of his time and can never be brought back, even in spirit, because his wonderful dream has been crushed so unhopefully by the Roves out there. The chaneys and bushes that so underhandedly make our decisions for us and represent the worst of this country so poignantly. The presidential regime we now have clearly proves that not enough people were listening to the great Bill Hicks. The boybands and destruction of music to widespread minimalism today clearly shows a largely positive opinion of Billy Ray Cyrus. And, there are more Rush Limbaughs today than you can point two sticks at. The people have voted for immorality and evil. Christians are so scared they're planning to secede the union in South Carolina, and their insanity is just barely above the level of Washington D.C. No wonder the rest of the world hates us.

Both remixes of the song are pleasing, but if there is a complaint to be made about them, it is that the screen simply dims while both tracks are playing.  Given the space made available to the developers by the DVD format, some visual goings-on during the remixes - still photos of Bjrk, behind-the-scenes footage of the video's production - would have been nice.

This is the "IT" cd to have if you love Gary Puckett & The Union Gap in their best quality, sound, arrangement and musical ability ever and want a great overall discography of music they played.

Albert Speer claimed that in December 1944 Furtwngler asked whether Germany had any chance of winning the war. Speer replied in the negative, and advised the conductor to flee to Switzerland from possible Nazi retribution.[37] Indeed, Furtwngler had strong links to German resistance that organized the 20 July plot against Hitler. As Furtwngler explicitly said during his denazification trial, he knew that an attack was organized against Hitler, although he did not participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well[38] and his Doctor, Dr. Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to avoid official manifestations, was a member of the Kreisau Circle.[39] Grove Online states that he was "within a few hours of being arrested " by the Gestapo when he escaped to Switzerland shortly after a concert in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic on January 28, 1945 (the Nazis had begun to crack down on German liberals at this time). At that concert he conducted an account of Brahms's Second Symphony that was caught on tape and is considered one of his greatest recordings.[40]
In short, then, 5 stars for the first 2/3 and maybe 2 stars for the last 1/3.

This CD won two major well-deserved awards at the 1994 Annual Grammy Awards for "Album of the Year" and "Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance." In these recordings of twenty-two noteworthy songs, he was ably backed-up by Ralph Sharon Trio: Ralph Sharon on piano, Doug Richeson on bass and Clayton Cameron on drums. All the tracks were arranged by the singer himself and some by the trio. With his exceptional performances, Mr. Bennett proved that he has that ability to command respect from his audience. There was a very good rapport between the singer and the live audience. They were very responsive and so appreciative and Mr. Bennett can't stop saying to them . . . "You are beautiful!"

They disbanded in 77 after a horible album called "Something Magic" I was unaware that they had reuntied in 91 with Robin Trower and Mathew Fisher. Then I found this in a used CD bin in Detroit. There's some great pop stuff here as well as some not so great stuff. The album would have been much stronger running at about 40 minutes without the likes of "Hand That Rocks The Cradle", "One More Time"  and "Learn to Fly". Thouroughly forgettable songs that just don't fit in with the better material here. The strongest cuts here are "All Our Dreams Are Sold" which features Trower at his best showcasing his original style. (Not that ersatz Hendrix stuff he got so wealthy doing on his own) "Perpetual Motion" and " The Pursuit Of Happiness" both of which are very true to the original sound of the band. Though somewhat of a mixed bag, I'm still glad I own it. I'm giving 4 stars because it's a little better than 3.

For fans of Gil Scott-Heron, this documentary is a must for your video collection.  If you lean to the left on the political spectrum, this video is also worthy of serious consideration.  Jazz aficionados might also like the music and the band which is first-rate.  For everybody else, I would suggest checking out one of Gil Scott-Heron's albums first (particularly from his late 1970's/early 1980's period) before buying this video.  In short, Gil Scott-Heron is well represented on this video, but to use the vernacular, you've got to "dig what he's putting down."
The sound quality of the Rhino reissue is perhaps a tad fuller than the Ryko reissue, but the differences are mostly subtle. The extra bonus material mostly serves to illustrate why the "alternate" versions didn't make the album, though it's great to finally be able to hear the sped-up version of "Man out of time" that survived as the intro and outro of the album version.

Anyway, the best songs are the first and the last, "Sweat" and "Opiate."  The second and third songs have really cool beginnings with all the eerie noises and drum intros, but from then on it's downhill.  The other songs, which are live, are pretty funny because they show how Tool started out as a band nobody's heard of.
No one else could have achieved this, and the performance of course also depends and benefits from the tensions contributed by the other two as well. These tensions, need I say, are mainly rhythmic and contrapuntal (rhythmic contradictions and ambiguities are also what this neo-contrapuntalism is all about). And that's all there even before you get to the improvisation which is sustained three part contrapuntal concentration but with plenty of light and shade and variation of dynamics. The most powerful example in music of the neo-contrapuntal style apart from this is Stravinsky's 'Rite Of Spring'. There aren't really any other examples worth mentioning of it being the sustained principle of the work, or the piece, outside of a handfull of other live Cream performances. Otherwise there are only a few examples, usually much shorter and less rigorous, of live rock music by such groups as Led Zeppelin.

"Lodger", the last piece in Bowie's Berlin Triology(following "Low" and "Heroes")is probably Bowie's most overlooked album, which is a shame as it's one of his best.  Beautiful compositions such as "African Nightflight" and "Move On" easily stand alongside the more sonically groundbreaking tracks of "Low" and "Heroes", while more straightfoward numbers such as hits "D.J." and "Boys Keep Swinging" lend a pop aspect to "Lodger" that the previous Berlin trilogy albums lacked at times.  Just as it is more accessible than the previous Berlin albums, it is also much darker in its subject matter(Just take a glance at the cover art, where Bowie appears to be lying dead/incapacitated on the sterile floor of a morgue).
And the way to hear them is in this box set.  It contains almost everything they did-it's only missing a very few stray songs that no one can find-maybe someday.  But for now and the foreseeable future, this is the set to hear.  Subtle and great.  Pick this up sooner rather than later-and while you're at it-pick up THE HOLLIES set mentioned above.  A perfect one-two punch of British pop-rock greatness.  It's never too late to catch the boat.
Then, there are some differences between the PPV version and the official version in the camera angles and some songs were fixed. The song "High Hopes" had a section of its ending lap steel guitar solo overdubbed from another show because if you have the PPV on video, David Gilmour hit different notes than the released version (this wasn't corrected on the DVD, you still get that pesky studio overdub). "Time" on the PPV version just had Gilmour and Wright singing "Thought I'd something more to say" but on the official VHS second keyboardist Jon Carin's voice was magically added in as it was on "Breathe Reprise" which was buried on the original PPV mix (could have been added in from another show as the microphone was either not on or the in-house mixer forgot to fade him in). Also, David Gilmour thanked Roger in a slightly lower tone on the PPV as opposed to the official video and DVD. Lastly, "Comfortably Numb" was edited from 11 minutes from the PPV to over 9 minutes on the DVD (this was not fixed as well for the DVD).

They broke out onto the scene with their self-titled debut sounding like a blatant Nirvana rip-off on quite a few songs.  Turned me off from them and I haven't listened since.  But the Christian music scene ate it up like they do most all rip-off bands (Bride/Guns'n'Roses anyone?  Third Day's debut pretty much got popular off of bands like Hootie & the Blowfish and The Black Crowes, and when ska got popular what happened?  Christian ska bands started popping up.  Even Living Sacrifice went metalcore when it started to become popular and I used to love older Living Sacrifice...)

Now, here is my review for a soundtrack that is, much like its film counterpart, often over-looked and under-appreciated. The film stars our boys Corey Feldman and Corey Heim, who were, in my opinion, two of the best teen actors of the 1980's. I saw this film about a year after it came out, and the soundtrack is, in part, what attracted me to this film. My favorite song in the movie... Well, I have no real favorite, but a few high ranking pieces would have to be "Rock On", "Dreams Come True", and "Where is She" (a title which, sadly, is not included on the soundtrack, and as far as I know, was never released on CD. The artists behind the song were Blue Future). The "Dream A Little Dream" rock themes were extremely nice to hear, and I love both variations. This film is a true gem, as is the soundtrack. If anyone who loved this film reads this, take my advice and buy this soundtrack. (Hey, this is coming from a guy who listens to the Offspring and the occasional Rob Zombie. Trust me when I say that ANYONE can enjoy the music of "Dream A Little Dream, young and old alike)

8835	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is the last of 3 albums Bowie did with Eno (his "Berlin" period, although this one was not recorded in Berlin. This is my favorite one of the three, and possibly my favorite Bowie album period. This one has no instrumental pieces, like on "Low" and "Heroes". The first half of the album has a vague "travel" theme to it. In several songs Bowie mixes in bits of African drumming or arabesque sounding string synthesizer sounds. These are all rock or pop songs, but they are all "deconstructed" pop songs, because everything from the instrument sounds to the songs' construction is turned on its head, at least that's how it seemed in 1979. This album features Adrian Belew on guitar making sounds that were basically unheard of at the time. "DJ" and "Boys.." are highlights - absolutely brilliant, and Belew truly uses his guitar like a weapon on his solos. The only really weak song is "Red Money", which is the music from Iggy Pop's "Sister Midnight" set to different (inferior) lyrics. Fortunately it's at the end, so it's easy to skip that tune, but the rest is highly recommended.
I am very puzzled by the fact that this title is out of print in the U.S.  To me that is criminal this has happened.  If you like Cohen and/or Warnes, I would get this title before it becomes completely unavailable (the import price is not as high as most import titles).  I understand the trepidation of buying a cover album and especially if you find a unique charm in hearing Cohen's voice (like I do).  But this is the one time where you will really be glad that you bought this album.  Other than Sharon Robinson (Cohen's main collaborator on "Ten New Songs") and the aforementioned Judy Collins (mainly because she has such a great voice), there is no other singer who can sing these great songs and pull off such a great performance like Jennifer Warnes.  Buy it and be simply amazed at this flawless recording.

Flash back to the 1960's in our totally psychedelic orange and pink bedroom with tye-dyed bedspreads and Beatles/Stones/ and other groups from the English invasion plastered on our walls.  There we sat with our teeny tiny little record player with 45's spinning with a needle that probably should have been replaced as we listened in awe to the belting voice of one Eric Burdon and the Animals.  We were in Heaven.  It was great and the sound was out of this world!

12. The Back Seat Of My Car - An epic power ballad which will have the hair on your neck standing up at its pulsating and dramatic climax.
The concert scenes are awesome. Taken from 3 different shows, Ozzy and his band pound through the hits from his solo work and Black Sabbath as well as playing his latest songs (at the time) from the No More Tears CD. Ozzy does his usual water tossing and clapping. Drummer Randy Castillo rocks the drums while Mike Inez plays away masterfully on the bass (especially on No More Tears). And, of course, Ozzy has his right hand man on stage with him, also going by the name Zakk Wylde. With his bullseye guitars, Zakk blazes through each song, adding his own touch to the songs written by Randy Rhoads while adding a new innovation or two to his own.

It's a fantastic documentation of a truly great post Waters Pink Floyd concert. If you like Pink Floyd, and don't already have this, get it, you won't regret it. Contains what has to be the definitive version of Comfortably Numb.
The most impressive thing about R. Kelly is that he writes and produces his own music. How many artists can say they do that? If your a fan or R. Kelly or a fan of sensual, soulful music you will most definitely enjoy R. Kelly's 12 Play.

3475	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	...great despite the fact that it's a hit. I don't think Carlos Santana is capable of putting together a lousy album (worst case scenario from this man is "damn good"), and I bought this one in that spirit. Then I started hearing a lot of media hype about a breakthough of Latino presence in the entertainment world--what with J-Lo, Christina, Ricky and Marc--that this album is a milestone effort to that issue. And it struck me that I've been listening to this man's music for over thirty years without really giving a damn about his ethnicity. What a shame that so many listeners bought "Supernatural" consistent with that old Tom Petty line; "...fer all thuh raw-hong reasons". Me, I bought it for the exact right reason--to hear one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived play.


 I got the distinct impression that the set was completely re-recorded. If that was the case all blemishes can be removed. Now, of course, with that line up one would hardly think that there would be a mistake. So we might not know what happened during the filming, afterwards or, in this case, how much happened afterwards.
In "Supernatural", his distinctive guitar sound is heard in an energetic mix of tracks with some of todays brightest stars.  No, this is not just Santana. As well it shouldn't be.
C'mon, STP and Guns n Roses were great bands who created a new sound.

2. Ram On.....simple song with reprise on other side.

The first of these hit singles is "I'm Goin' Down," which is another track highly reminiscent of the early days of rock and roll music with its fairly standard chord progression and its uppity sound. "Glory Days" is next, with its brilliant keyboard and guitar riff that gets your feet stomping. Then, the semi-soft arena rocker "Dancing In The Dark" (a number one Mainstream Rock hit) and the warm sounding ballad "My Hometown" (Springsteen's only time topping the Adult Contemporary chart) end the album in style.
If you are a hard rock fan and are tired of Punk Rock's trendy powerd chords, guitar solos that last 3 seconds, and mediocre vocals, then pick up Contraband. Velvet Revolver may very well be the pioneers of bringing back hard rock. I personally haven't experienced this type of music since GNR's break up, and the death of metal/hard rock in the early 90s that later paved the way for the Grunge era. Whatever your taste may be, if you are an anti TRL Punk Rock fan like I am, this album is definately a new taste that has been there before,  but with a new lineup and a new style. Long live Velvet Revolver.

6296	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In the early 70's Elton John and Bernie Taupin were putting out an incredible amount of amazing music in a very short period of time.  Putting out two albums a year could be tough on any artist, but the quality of these discs is what made things all the more incredible.  "Madman" is one of my favorite Elton John albums and for me it ranks right up with the best stuff he has ever done.  The title track alone is worth the price of admission with it's grand paranoid scope that is almost prog rock in it's nature.  I saw another reviewer give the album only 2 stars partially because he hates progressive rock.  I love progressive rock, so maybe that is why I enjoy so much of this album.  Of course two of Elton's most effective singles are present here as well in "Levon" and "Tiny Dancer" a song that was used so effectively in the movie "Almost Famous" a few years back.  "Indian Sunset" is another highlight bringing Elton and Bernie back to the old west of "Tumbleweed Connection".  The last 3 songs "Rotten Peaches", "All The Nasties" and "Goodbye" are a slight step down from the rest of the album, but still good songs.  If you are an Elton John fan "Madman Across The Water" is a must own album.
9782	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	David Bowie's "Low", his first collaboration with Brian Eno and also the first of his famous so-called "Berlin Trilogy" is probably the apex of Bowie's career. The album is one of the most successful fusions of popular music a major artist has ever attempted.
This music reaches me quite pure.  There is something about an artist earlier works that comes across more raw, true, fervent, pure and "Every Time You Say Goodbye" comes across in places as all of these. Though Krauss carries the band's main moniker, it's Union Station that has the talent that stands out here.  Ron Block, Tim Stafford, Barry Bales, and Adam Steffey trade off adding to the harmonies and take the lead in a few songs.  Those songs stand-out to me.  To my taste, Krauss' voice is a little too soft, a little too sweet to catch the down home spirit of bluegrass.  She can play one heck of a fiddle, but let the boys sing for the most part.

Indeed you have to be a fan of Pink Floyd to agree with me but the visual effects were really impressive at that time.
Everything is exquisite here:  we've got Joni in rare form, an older and wiser version of the folk singer of the 60's and 70's.  The supplemental players are first-rate, including Brian Blade on drums, Larry Klein (aka Joni's ex-husband) on bass, Mark Isham on trumpet, and Mark Leisz on additional guitars.  The small, intimate theater is filled with multicolored couches, and the stage is a small circle, sized perfectly for this excellent evening of music.  Highly recommended!  If you're a fan, this is one not to miss.
This was his debut album and, in many ways, still stands as a high watermark in his career. Pretty considerable some 30 plus years on. I think that ol' cajun blues rock oozes gusto on many tracks. And it certainly doesn't hurt to have quality musicians who add the correct amount of spice to use backing this talented musician. And what of Leon? He is the master of elocution of delta dixie drawl. It is unmistakable-it is distinctive - and totally unique to Leon. Just listening to him bend vowels and accent lyrics with that inflection is part of the joy of this music.

While this collection has much to commend it, you may wish to consider the similarly themed double CD (50 greatest love songs), which contains most of the tracks here and appears to offer better value for money.
I have to  admit that I really like U2's sound so I unashamedly admit that this review  is biased.
 I've read many of the customer reviews, and I don't think anyone has mentioned the bonus features. My DVD could possibly be a deluxe edition.

8573	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	"Rebel Rebel" was probably the first Bowie song I ever heard and it has aways been one of my favorites. The guitar sound is still one of the best I've ever heard and most of the research and interviews I've read said it was David himself who played all the guitars on the record except for "1984". If that was indeed the case then I think he out Ronnoed, Mick Ronson! It's brilliant! The rest of 'Diamond Dogs', released in the spring of 1974 is pretty good as well with other standouts including the title track and the aforementioned "1984". Supposedly this was intended to be a concept album based on Orwell's celebrated work but David couldn't get the rights. However much of Bowie's own dystopian themes fit in within the rest of the record so that it remains consistent. I like the "Sweet Thing/Candidate" suite in its avant gardeness (a foreshadowing of his future work) and the creepy "Future Legend" intro is quite effective. "Big Brother" works as a solid closer along with the truly bizarre "Chant" which ends fairly abruptly. The Ziggy era was over and although David didn't discard it totally with 'Diamond Dogs', his glam persona, which made him a star, was in full transition mode.

The track "Rebirthing" is about a moment just before the "event", and that is it's genius. Cooper & Howes are smart enough to know that is where the drama really is and they give that moment quite a soundtrack! There are many other great pieces on Comatose that touch on this theme as well. It really is a worthwhile listen.

1377	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Backlash.  That was the word to describe the reception that this film and album got when it was released 13 years ago.  U2 got slammed by the media and public for overexposure and posturing when RATTLE AND HUM first came out.  They were criticized for (a) taking themselves too seriously (b) trying to ingratiate themselves with rock and roll's legends (c) trying to put themselves up with those same rock and roll legends.  Thirteen years later this film and album still hold up as one of rock and roll's finest live albums by one of rock's best acts.  Revisiting RATTLE AND HUM in 2001, I can make the following conclusions:  (1) yes, U2 did take themselves seriously, but when they didn't they were also criticized (as evidenced in the Pop album and Popmart Tour) so the critics can't have it both ways and (2) U2 can take their rightful place amongst the rock legends they were fans of.  After 20+ years, they've proved themselves time and time again and they've earned it.

Rainmaker is a very haunting song with an intense misty atmosphere with some ceramic percussion. Sky Juice is a breathtaking song with very electronic synths and some jet sound effects with some thumping beats and a cool bass. However that is nothing like the next one. Cape Perpetual is beyond any word I can describe about this song. It's a very spooky track. It starts of with some strange breezy wind instruments and some thundering sounds in the distance. At about 30 seconds there are some synthesizer hums that fade in. The sound of the synth humming almost scared me at first listening. It then becomes a dark very space oriented song with ceramic percussion and thundering jet sound effects. I could close my eyes listening to this song and imagine myself traveling on the Orient Express through oriental space. This song alone makes this album a five star. Gentle Was The Night is a very beautiful song with just mostly synths. This is a great song. Fire Ritual is a very pop oriented song and some vocal doodling here and there. This is probably the brightest song on here. 87 Dreams Of A Lifetime lives up to the title. This is a very stunning and could rank as one of his best 80s tracks ever. It starts with just some ambient synths and the synths get louder and at about a minute into the song the real music begins. This is a haunting song with a catchy rhythm and a space jazzy stmosphere. This is my second favorite off this album. Dimension D is a very space oriented song with some haunting sound effects and a very dark ambient atmosphere. Forever The Optimistic is a pop oriented song with great electronic bass, a great hook and some synth tinklings throughout the song. I almost cryed when I first heard this song and today I consider this song a new age classic. Journey To Yoroba is another haunting song. It has lots of ceramic percussion and ambient synths. I love the drum loop to this song. The closing title track is great with more great synths and cool drums.
The days of seeing insane prices on Zappa CDs is soon to be ended !!!

While I am only very familiar with four of the songs of this album, I still rate it a 5 because it is one of the only few Samantha albums you can find on the market today. I was only disappointed that the album's version of "Naughty Girls" is a shortened version of the original album version. Besides this flaw, "Samantha Fox: Greatest Hits" is a must-have for anyone who thrived and grew up on eighties music.
9174	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	The movie CARRIE is truly one of the best psychologically terrifying movies in recent history; part of its "get under your skin" power lies in Pino Donaggio's eccentric and transporting soundtrack.  While it is  not the kind of music you play for a candlelit dinner, if you want to evoke  memories of the haunting film, this will more than do the trick.  Mother At  The Top Of The Stairs is perhaps the most artistically gratifying piece for  me, with its perfect blend of suspense and unbearably sad chords repeated  over and over.  It captures, without fail, the specific moods and feelings  of the characters and story brilliantly.  There are pieces missing however  -- as in the playful piece that underscores the girls' punishment-workout,  and the guys' tuxedo shopping.
The R In R&B Collection, Vol. 1
What else is there to say. This album is a perfect listen... even considering that it is a "live" album and that I am not such a big fan of that concept. The writing of the songs is superb... nothing seems to bubble-gum or too serious. It is all just right... edgy where it needs to be "What?" and sad when it is appropriate "Michael". There are love songs here (or more to the point, heartbreak songs) that are crafted deliciously. The co-written "Don't Look Back" between Cassidy and Rob Thomas, is a gem of a breakup song.

I bought his albums 'First Course'(1976)- 'Rio'(1980)but didn't reach into his 80's stuff. And unlike with the funk, i actually liked the music sound change through the 80's. When i got his later albums, i really fell in love with them. And this is also the case with Spyro Gyra,where i got the full discography and got songs from pretty much every album. With this being said, i wouldn't start with this album, but it is a great one to add to your collection. And i only give it four stars because i don't listen to every song on the album.

Okay....let's not go that far.  But listen!  It is not a "Donald Duck impersonator" you hear, but Clarence "Ducky" Nash himself, the man who voiced the Donald on a jillion Disney cartoons.  This I learned from David Grisman himself.  I went backstage after a show at the Iron Horse club in Northampton, Massachusetts, several months after "Acoustic Christmas" came out.  I complimented him on his fine Donald Duck vocal, and he told me he did not do it himself, but secured the vocal services--if "vocal" is the right word--- of Mr. Nash.  And in any event, "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" is a very short cut.

Months before, she released an album of the same name that was unusually different than her previous.  She was always known for her positive songs.  However, the album entirely explored her painful turbulations, including abuse, loss, depression, and others.  These songs are based on thoughts she endured during her two-year depression, 1995-1997.  Many listeners were shocked.  Some of these songs gave this tour a new outlook.  Despite revisiting many classic songs, audiences can feel her new style.
Its worth a listen. I like it and its been getting rotation in my CD player, but none of the tracks really sticks in my mind, and if you prepped a medely CD of this plus some STP tracks of old Id have a hard time picking out which is which.

Although Taupin's lyrics are more far-out than usual (and that's saying  something), Elton delivers them with fire and passion, backed by his own  stellar piano playing and lush, appropriate orchestral arrangements by Paul  Buckmaster. Tiny Dancer, Levon, and the title track are highlights, and  only the closing track, Goodbye is subpar.

I already knew the music, as I've had album for quite some time, but with the interviews offer a view of the artists themselves.  This video also includes two songs that are not on the album (while the album includes a song that's not on the video).  Therefore if you are a DCD collector, this video is imperative.
4. Madman Across The Water
Jennifer's voice is a fitting instrument for clarity of  delivery - every phrase is clearly audible. She's also capable of  pleading  words to ecstasy (Pretending To Care). Hidden among nine mid-tempo tunes is  a glorious and powerful surprise which raises the roof: `The Whole Of The  Moon'. The driving drums, majestic choir, exalted trumpeting and Jennifer's  zealous voice push this soaring tune high above all the others.
The medley of "Sweet Thing" and "Candidate" is probably the best example of this--  "Sweet Thing" features a romantic piano line that would not be out of place in a stage production and an absolutely stunning lead vocal from Bowie who takes full advantage of his range.  His performance is just absolutely staggering, but it has a very theatrical, almost over the top sound to it that reminds you of Freddie Mercury.  Likewise, the sing-speak vocal of "We Are the Dead" has the sound of something right out of a stage piece.  Mixed in with all this is just some great rock songs-- "Diamond Dogs", "Rebel Rebel" and "Rock & Roll With Me"-- and one piece that traipses at dance music ("1984") to make a pretty well balanced collection.

3439	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	SANTANA-SUPERNATURAL: This ain't your Dad's Santana. Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blooze instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's "I've still got legs" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the Clive Davis notion of pairing Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples. The catalyst was SMOOTH, a blistering, funk-fried Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever. Since Santana has always employed a wide palette of musical styles and vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker), hearing him jam on hip-hop, jazz-rock, and rap in tandem with Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, and Everlast is not such a far fetched notion. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana clause.
Where some have detracted from this outing as a "Pop" album from the Grammy winning queen of Jazz, I would reply, are you too snobby to listen to the incredible instrument? I loved this album from beginning to end. The power of "Nobody Does Me" (written by Rod Temperton of "Heatwave" fame) shows what a sexy and powerful voice Ms. Schuur has across more octaves than should be humanly possible. A superior version of "Unforgettable" before Natalie Cole did the computer generated Duet with her father, and "What a difference a day makes", should be enough to satisfy jazz purist. And the rest of the unbelievably great pop jazz on the rest of the album should satisfy everyone else.
It's clear from this that Pink Floyd is not at all a destroyed band, but one very much alive.  The video allows for a close-up glimpse of the band in addition to the light display, that might be lost to the audience at the actual concert.  For that it may even surpass the concertgoing experience for those who prefer a more intimate musical experience.  At times it may seem that the younger touring musicians are more "into it" than the band, but then Pink Floyd has always been more reserved than some.  The Floyd members show their passion in subtler ways.  If anybody in the band has a tendency to be visibly animated, surprisingly enough (or is it?) it's the softspoken keyboardist Richard Wright, who reacts very clearly to the music.

493	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is definitely Bruce's best album (other than "Live 1975-85" and "Born to Run," which is his greatest). From the explosive (esp. the drumming) "Born in the U.S.A." to the guitar-driven "Cover Me" to lamenting "Downbound Train" to the hits "Glory Days" and "Dancing in the Dark" to the chilling epic "My Hometown," this album shines! "I'm on Fire" is supposedly pretty good but I'm not so big on that one. "Working on the Highway" just annoys me but again, others may like it. "Darlington County" and "I'm Goin' Down" are solid as well. Overall a very good album!
Many reviewers felt that Frank Zappa was selling out with these recordings.  They're certainly more "commercial" than much of his previous stuff, but it's not vapid pop fluff.  Gone were the Serious Orchestral Woodwind passages of Uncle Meat, We're Only In It For The Money, Waka/Jawaka and Lumpy Gravy.  This is an album of sprightly mid-70s art/jazz-rock with mucky lyric and a sense of playfulness.  I personally love it, and it goes with Roxy & Elsewhere, the underrated Bongo Fury and Apostrophe'.  If you like them, you'll love this.
Watching this makes me feel 25 years younger. For the price, which is hardly more than a CD, you would be one crazy baldhead if you did not buy it.

With the addition of Schwartz, PG&E was complete.  The full band now consisted of Charlie Allen--vocals, Frank Cook-drums, Brent Black-bass and Glenn Schwartz-guitar and it was off to the recording studio.  The bands first release, Get It On, immediately spurred controversy when it's album cover featured sexual innuendos in the form of a train and a bullet aimed at a pretty girl, the cover was censored and the album was re-released and performed dismally.
Is there anything less than pure gold here? Well, it's only 35 minutes long - a bit on the short side. Musically my only complaint would be against the rhythm accompaniment, which on a few ocassions gets a little bit repetitive. After the same chord progression has gone around for about the 10th time, I tend to really miss the subtlety that a jazz musician would bring to the proceedings. The chords and bass-lines seem to be banged out in the same fashion over and over again in a few spots.
I know how the lady in the harbor feels ...
Luckily, Paul would rekindle the flame that ignited his best works  (briefly) during the early 80's and again in the late 80's - late 90's.
11. "Looking for Angels"- My least favorite song on the whole album. I don't like the way it sounds. It sounds like a rap song but not completely. To my ear, the verses sound like rap and then the chorus is pure Skillet but I don't like the song.

If money were the issue, I'd definitely spend it on TDC.  "I Have a Dream" is a good song, but to me, not reason enough to purchase "Gold" over TDC.
Another plus about this album is the record sleeves have a nice plastic inner liner thus keeping paper dust from getting into the grooves.  If you have record albums that have just plain paper sleeves I recommend replacing them with plastic-lined sleeves such as https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQSFKY/

1828	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Of course, this is a classic concert and whatever quality it encompasses should be forgiven.  But what's to forgive?  First, the sound has been remastered and really is a major improvement over the previous film.  It really was the "Spiders" last concert and needs to be seen as that, in a historical perspective.  The cinematography is, well...less grainy, but the camera is still bouncing quite a bit.  You can't have everything!  If you are a purist and just cannot stand an imperfect film, then take a pass.  Otherwise, this is a great collection of fifteen songs from "Hunky Dory" and "Ziggy Stardust..." (plus some) presented at the height of glam rock when glam rock really mattered.  In that respect, not many others than Bowie really did.

3793	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I never actually had an opportunity to see the Electric Light Orchestra in concert, the closest I got to that was watching a show broadcast on HBO back in 1978.  I don't know if it's the same show contained here; my memory is a bit fuzzy regarding a 23 year old show.  All I remember from that experience was how "cool" it was.  As a 13 year old in the year of Star Wars, anything with a spaceship and lasers was all that mattered.  The music was secondary.  Of course, as I grew older, I paid more attention to music, and always had great appreciation for Jeff Lynne's contributions to popular music. And this DVD is a nice offering well worth its price.  Now I knew when purchasing this, I would not get crystalline sound quality.  After all, back in the 70's, there was no such thing as digital sound.  But the sound quality in the Wembley show is actually very good, much better than some of the concerts released on DVD from the same era (Yes Live in Philadephia 1979 is one painful example of a bad one).  It does sound like there are some "backing tracks" in the audio mix, but it is really nothing annoying given the quality of the performance.  Picture quality does leave a bit to be desired; not much (if any) better than VHS, and with dated video production effects.  But then again, this was the 70's!  The real plus here is the full album length video for Discovery.  This is almost like a two-for-one deal in just this section of the disc:  a great album with very nice sound quality, and some enjoyable "performance" videos.  This was a few years before MTV, when the  promotion of an image was less important, and videos actually served to promote the music.  Of course, the production is a bit "outdated" as well, but if you do get into some kind of "retro" mood, you might just find it enjoyable.  Highly recommended if you enjoy ELO's music and want to see them captured at their peak.  Well worth the purchase price and more.
8575	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	No, that title's not a joke, I actually have a reason for it. Those, it seems, are the chief influences on this record - my favorite Bowie album, by the way. It's got elements of Reed's drugged-out, hedonistic VU material (the S&M themed "Sweet Thing"), mixed with the Stones' brand of sleazy rock (the title track, a failed single that's one of my favorite Bowie songs; "Rebel Rebel"). And since this stemmed from a failed attempt to make a rock version of 1984, "We Are the Dead", "1984" and "Big Brother" have overt Orwellian references.
1. Stinkfist - This song is so amazing. I love the intro to it because it sets the tone for the rest of the CD. Stinkfist was one of their biggest hits and Rolling Stone says (after ranking this album as #27 of the 100 most essential albums) that Stinkfist is the stand out track. I agree that it is an incredible track. I beleive however, that it is the second best track on here. 10/10

The songs are beautiful, the scenery gorgeous, and it's fun seeing John singing along with some wonderful country singers in a barn. The barn atmosphere brings a real intimacy to the entire experience. Some highlights for me are "Christmas for Cowboys", "Someday Soon", " A Change in the Air", and the Scottish lullaby that Kathy Mattea sings, while rocking a tiny infant. That song never fails to bring a tear to my eye!

9829	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The theme that unites these songs is one of "psychotic withdrawl". Bowie fled his rock stardom and holed up in Berlin, spending a lot of time in his room. And the songs are portraits of a man immersing himself and wallowing in his own alienation. There was always a schizophrenia at work in Bowies personality. perhaps most obviously on Aladdin Sane where he seems to be addressing it in the song Cracked Actor. And he obviously had a problem or a love hate relationship with Fame. So it isn't that surprising I suppose that he was always on the brink of reaching his breaking point. Low's string of songs feel like broken fragments of songs. One song is literally about broken shards, "Breaking Glass...in my room again". "Always Crashing in the Same Car", the same idea expressed a little differently. "Sound and Vision" is an attractive song as is "Speed of Life" and "Be My Wife". All show Bowie searching among the ruin for something to build from.  The wreckage of the first portion of the disc gives way to the very heavy atmospheres of the instrumentals. "Warsawa" sounds like a monastic chant but a space age one. The instrumentals are accomplished and Bowies wailing in some of them sounds like a kind of scream therapy among Enos post war European soundscapes. Spiritual searching and longing in stark atmospheres elaborates the alienation theme without the use of words. It is powerful. Interesting choice of cover art and the second cover in a row borrowed from movie stills. In The Man Who Fell To Earth the  Bowie character goes into a record store at one point and listens to a recording on ear phones. I think it is possible that is the moment this disc was born.
Nevertheless, this is still one of those "landmark" albums that is deserving of everything positive said about it (people can hate it if they want, but the longevity of this album and the band itself isn't coincidental, so don't hate on it just because you don't get it.)  I've owned three copies of this album before saving it to digital format.  You don't need to do all that, but I still recommend picking it up if you haven't yet already.
8644	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Just in time to usher out the end of 'glam rock', Bowie produced this wonderful concept album. It opens with "Future Legend", a scary, hip opening that also started his concerts. This CD contains classics like "Rebel Rebel", "1984" and "Diamond Dogs" and they live on like the gems they were meant to be. "The Chant..." is a hypnotizing 'beat-down' delight ending with a word; "rot"??? "Sweet Thing" is campy gay and not his best and "We Are The Dead" is exactly like the title suggests. "Dodo" and the demo of "Candidate" really don't add much to the album, but it's nice of RYKO to give them to us. The recording quality of the songs is mediocre - almost a tinny 'live' sound. If you can get past that and just listen to the "mood" that Bowie induces, you'll enjoy it.

896	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Nirvana is often credited with killing the "hair" bands common in the late 1980's.  Personally, I think while their influence was decisive it is also a little overestimated.  For one thing, we forget the impact that Pearl Jam's first album had at the time.  For another Guns `N' Roses first album was really the death knell to the pretty "New York Dolls" wannabes.  "Welcome To The Jungle" breathed fire and just laid everyone on their butts.  It was like riding a Harley-Davidson compared to a moped.  This was how hard rock was done and it had more red blood in its whiskey soaked veins than any band out there.
This is probably my favorite popular  mainstream corporate rock album of the past year. Sure it's a sell-out  (why else would Carlos have hired Clive Davis of all people to produce this),  but so what? It's such a great album. Give me this over Ricky Martin ANY day  of the week! At least Carlos HAS SOME DANG TALENT!  Some of these songs are  pretty awful (like the Everlast or Eric Clapton ones, for instance), but  that's okay because he plays them very well. It's easily the best thing  he's done since "Abraxas", and believe me that's quite a feat.  That was released over TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO! Do you have any idea how long  of a time that is? Don't forget: twenty five years after "Hound  Dog", Elvis was already dead!

Anyway enough with Yes's longest tunes, back to Close To The Edge, through out the song at different times there are clips of underwater microscopic life which in my opinion should have been left out, and just showed the band play. The song is very close to the original studio version, except the end where they drop it a step from F to E flat (I guess because Jon Anderson's voice couldn't take the pressure he put on it like on the album).

All the arrangements are first rate and feature great chords and lots of extras, too. They have so much sound that I am surprised to learn that there are only four guys in this group. They do a lot of flourishes in between the notes (doo, doot, doo; wooow; and so on), and they can sound like real instruments--horns that don't sound like someone pretending to be a horn. Another way that they are unified is that no one sticks out as being very different from the rest--like a basso profundo or a high tenor, not that this in itself is bad, but the togetherness works for them. Everything is fun and entertaining on this CD. Get this one if you would like a lighthearted a cappella group, or just if you want something to get your spirits up for the season.

I have several concert DVD's, including The Eagles Hell Freezes Over and James Taylor"s Live  at the Beacon Theatre.  In comparison, the audio on these two in a surround  format is excellent, but the audio here is substandard, hollow and tinny.  It may be that the Eagles and James Taylor were recorded on a stage  environment, whereas the Allman's used an outdoor format.  I hope the  Allman Brothers do a stage performance in the future with an emphasis on  the audio portion.

Whether you are a fan or not, you have to marvel at the sheer complexity and artistic richness of this epic production. Indeed, an old friend who still calls them "Pinky Fluid" enjoys the video with the volume muted. "Excellent wallpaper or screen-saver, when company comes over", he proclaims!
5633	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Yes, it has been documented in every review that the biggest hit on the album is the adult contemporary radio staple "Baker Street" with Raphael Ravenscroft's timeless sax solo but that is not the only classic on this album, in fact there is not a dud in this bunch of classics.  A few other highlights include 2 more top 40 chart followups "Right Down The Line" and "Home and Dry," plus these album tracks that show how talented this Scottish artist who was once the lead vocalist of "Stealer's Wheel is, including the poignant "Whatever's Written In My Heart," the title song, and "Mattie's Rag."  While disco was also happening at the same time this was recorded, this album is singer/songwriter pop music at it's best and ranks right up there with the legends of the genre including Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, and Harry Chapin.

The video to "Play Dead" is rather boring in my opinion. The song itself is amazing and Bjork's vocals are perhaps at their best here than in any other song of hers. The song was the theme to the movie "The Young Americans," starring Harvey Keitel. "Big Time Sensuality" was probably the most popular Bjork song of the "Debut" era, and the video is superb as well. The song used in the video is the Fluke Minimix, which is much better than the original version. In this video, directed by Stphane Sednaoui, Bjork is stood on the back of a truck which is driving its way through the streets of New York. The camera stays focused on Bjork all the time as she sings and dances for the viewer. The main object of this video, however, is to get across how Bjork communicates with the listener by the use of her body. Note how she moves her arms and legs, contorts her face, and smiles euphorically at the camera to express her extreme happiness at life. The director said of Bjork, "I saw her face and I heard her music...and I couldn't sleep." Honey, I know the bloody feeling! Many a night have I found myself absolutely shattered but refuse to go to sleep due to my obsession with Bjork. I simple cannot stop listening to her! "Violently Happy" is not really one of my favourite Bjork songs and the video is not very memorable. I like Bjork's videos to take my breath away and this one doesn't, sadly.
The title track starts well but outstays its welcome; large sections sound like a duck call repair shop in the midst of its busy season.  From there it gets much better.  For Calvin is inspired, the mildly sinister vocal introduction ushers you into a splendid, multi-layered descent that feels random but is, in fact, precisely controlled - nice.
2854	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	One of the best music video I have ever seen. I had seen FM twice before in the 70's, but never up close like this.
Taj Mahal is  wonderful and reminds us what rock and roll was, modern blues interpreted  by white guys. He adds the soul to it.
Christian music has always suffered from a very narrow framework that most songwriters voluntarily constrain themselves to. It has been inaccessible to the outsider. This has not been Skillet's weakness. John Cooper's most powerful work often comes when he goes for the jugular on the empty results of living a life with nothing larger than one's self.

This is an excellent album and a must for anyone with an interest in Sandy Denny's music, and indeed, high quality music of the era.

She understands Cohen's music well, having done backing vocals on some of his albums like Various Positions, and she covers his songs with loving dedication.

VERDICT: Borrow  this video if you can.

Weasels Ripped My Flesh is by far the most twisted album the original Mothers had ever done. All of this was various studio and live snippets from 1967 to 1969, so no surprise that the lineup involved was pretty much a who's who of The Mothers of Invention as it was in the late '60s. This album also seriously divides the listeners too (much like what Yes did with Tales From Topographic Oceans or Tangerine Dream did with Zeit). Like "Didja Get Any Onya", with a voice in a fake German accent starts complaining about people looking at him the wrong way, or "Prelude to the Afternoon..." where Roy Estrada makes these squeeling voices that are certain to clear parties. "Get a Little" is a guitar-dominated piece that wouldn't be out of place on Hot Rats (although slower pace than anything on that album). "Oh No", a vocal cut, courtesy of Ray Collins, was essentially a re-recording of a theme from Lumpy Gravy, this time done in Mothers fashion, meaning a regular band and vocals (the original was much more orchestral and instrumental). This song really shows all the finest qualities of the Mothers early music. There are a few really off-the-wall twisted experiments like "Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue" and "Toads of the Wet Forest" that doesn't exactly make for easy listening (but if you've heard your share of RIO-type of prog rock groups like Henry Cow, Univers Zero, etc., then you'll probably appreciate this, as it seemed Zappa's Mothers did seem have a big impact on such groups). Even detractors to Weasels Ripped My Flesh would find something to like with the more song-based stuff here. One is a cover of Little Richard's "Directly To My Heart To You", with violin work from Don "Sugarcane" Harris (who had once played for Little Richard). This one tends to have a more blues feel to it. Another is the already mentioned "Oh No". Then you have "My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Momma", vocals by Zappa himself. To me, it's a great album, maybe not to everyone's taste, but certainly a great way to end the chapter of the original (and in my opinion) finest version of the Mothers of Invention.
Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put his Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, "Beyond Belief." Toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early "punks" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's "Night And Day" and The Police's "Synchronicity" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to "Town Cryer" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall.
And what's up with Gilmour?!  Listen bloke, t-shirt and jeans would work if you were a metal act - and oh, how I wish Pink Floyd had gone more metal, a la "The Wall" - but here, with your gut hangin' out... dude, you couldn't have dressed up a little?!

Also noted is that this is a great collaboration with Brian Eno. I think this was recorded about the same time Bowie starred in Nicholas Roeg's film, 'The Man Who Fell To Earth' -- an art house cinema classic.
Production: Thumbs up.

  From the album Tonight (1984). Okay, I said he was going a little downwards and the album Tonight (1984) shows that, just like the Let's Dance (1983) album did, but BLUE JEAN is a song that will win all fans of Bowie over. No one David Bowie fan can deny it, whether he or she wants to deny it.

But to others that appreciate the music video as an art form can also find this dvd of some worth.  These videos aren't all chereographed dance routines and pretty faces.  It showcases the imaginations of some of the more creative minds in music video directing.  Michel Gondry being the most "out there" as shown in Human Behaviour, and Bachelorette.  These videos are basically indecipherable on first viewing, and only with multiple viewings could I make even a little sense of them.  Also Spike Jonze's "It's Oh So Quiet" video is a masterpiece of music video direction, in my opinion.  The video caters to the song, and the song melds perfectly with it, and it is such a cool video, for the lack of a better word.  The rest of the videos are all outstanding, but those are the standouts.  Buy it, and just sit and stare at the screen, you won't be able to turn away.

Then the fun begins, as Frank swings through the songs that made him a legend. "I Get A Kick Out Of You", "Street Of Dreams", "I've Got You Under My Skin" and "I've Got The World On A String" are fired off in rapid fire succession, each more energetic and expertly performed than the next. Frank's voice was still fairly close to the condition it was in 15 years ago, so hestills manages to maintain the songs' youthful vitality.

If you loved Skynrd in the past you will love this one! It is amazing they are still recording and writing new material. Great Songs, Great Musicianship are the highlights of the this one. I love it and hope they keep the new music coming! It is great to have some new material to sink your teeth into! I highly recommend this one!
Also, while a couple of interludes do seem ponderous at best, some of the songs are just so good that they make this album five stars. Sure, you know about the five singles maybe, but one track that's EVEN better than those is "Pus--t." 11 minutes long, it shows some of Maynard's most impressive vocals; the melody just catches you in. The song doesn't come off as the least bit overlong. I also like how the intro sounds like it'll be something kind of weird or orchestral, but then you start hearing standard Adam Jones riffs. Of course, the structure of "nema" is just breath-taking, and I find it very interesting. It has some really awesome Danny Carey drums too; there's no one quite like him. "Third Eye" is fourteen minutes long but can be suspenseful, especially when it reaches to its climaxes, descends, then builds back up. Hearing "prying open your third eye" is something that's going to get stuck in your head. Oh, and there's some really amazing melodies on that track as well. Sometimes the lyrics are kind of ambiguous, yet I have my own interpretations (I somehow think "Stinkfist" is about sex). There's some more straightforward stuff here, like the structure of said song and the slow-burning "H." as well as the sell out lyrics on "Hooker." It may seem a bit juvenile for some, but I find the track amazing. Also, some of the interludes are kind of interesting and mildly funny, like the cool futuristic organs on "Intermission" and the German-spoken recipe on "Die Eier Vor Satan."

About an hour into this one hundred minute video, Isham's camera gets irritating. The songs are great, but he never strays from his directing formula until close to the end of the concert. He is a visualist without a vision, trying to mask unknown flaws or his lack of original ideas after an initial genius outpouring. On the positive side, there is nary a cameraman to be seen anywhere onstage, thanks to some expert editing.

p.s. for those of you curious about the "H" references, after their debut album in '71, they adopted the curious habit of entitling all their albums with an "H" word or term, including their greatest hits album HISTORY.  They stopped this practice after Dan Peek left the trio, perhaps in reverence to him since the split was amiable with none of the acrimony that often exists in such divorces.  HOURGLASS does have one Dan Peek song on it, the remake of Everyone I Meet Is From California, so perhaps as a nod to Dan, the duo of America named this one as one of the "H" albums.

The best song on here is "Put Your Lights On" feat. Everlast.  It would freak the living (...) out of me if I were a little kid.  "Maria Maria" and "Smooth" are great songs, but they got WAY too overplayed, so now I don't like them as much.  "Do You Like The Way" feat. Lauryn Hill is a really good rap song, and I usually don't like it when Lauryn Hill raps.  The bottom line is, this is one heck of an album(even though I don't think it deserved 8 Grammys).  This isn't a Santana album though because it's just an all-star cast of musicians where Santana happens to be playing guitar.

Another Brick in the Wall was given more resonance given the patriarchal tone Gilmour had assumed.  Not sure where the children's chorus came from, as on these sets, Pink Floyd was backed by three svelte singers. I thought Shine on you Crazy Diamond was the best of the first set, beautifully explored and set the mood for the concert.  Learning to Fly was proof positive that Pink Floyd was as solid as ever.  The second set took in the Dark Side of the Moon, but somehow rang a little hollow without Waters. The images were what you had come to expect from Pink Floyd.  Pulse looks and sounds much better on DVD than it did on CD.

But back to this Marc DVD, said to be filmed live in British TV studios in 1977 (and various earlier dates in the DVD extras from those teenage "pop" shows that were popular at the time).  Yes, Marc is "alive" in the studio, but not necessarily "live".  In fact, his guitar is not even plugged-in and he appears to me to mime most of the songs.  In one or two of the DVD extra clips, Mark's guitar is actually plugged-in, but he still seems to be miming;  and sorry to say so, quite badly.
The Chain-the bridge portion when John McVie plays his short solo before the band takes flight.  Lindsey shredding and Stevie twirling like it was 1977.
The one thing included on Opiate which has become more and more lacking with each album is the blatantly obvious sense of humor and dismissive, insulting cracks at the society we live in. This is not to say I don't think Lateralus and AEnima are vastly superior to this, but there is a certain satisfaction in hearing Maynard rant and rave about commercialism in music and about that good old controversial religious figure JC on Opiate that started to only be included in segues between songs on later albums.

If you actually listen to the CD before writing a review about it... well, it's helpful ;) The lyrics are amazing.

So, yes, you get mimed Bolan performances by the man himself. Some of them are not very good, some of them are slightly cringe-worthy, but when you consider this DVD contains some of Bolan's last taped performances, it's a worthwhile addition to any Bolan fan's collection.

John's crooning on "Lean on Me" (which they still do in concert) is especially good.  Considering he doesn't have much of a voice, it's particularly effective.

Seems your Metamorpho received a special invitation to speak at a Metaphysical conference in Chicago.  I decided that my talk would be about Procol Harum's Home album. However, at the airport an interviewer misconstrued my statements and they came across as controversial political barbs.  As if this wasn't upsetting enough, when I got to Chicago and checked into my hotel I could see hoards of people gathering outside the lobby. From my room on the 12th floor (there is no 13th floor) I could look from my window and see swarms of people with picket signs that read "Seer Go Home!", "Boycott Metamorpho" "Down with Reflection" and, well, you get the picture.

What with all the mentions of "Hey 19", I'd like to add this interpretation (which I've yet to see elsewhere).

Okay, so this was filmed in the early 80's (1980 or 1981) before the release of the Hot Space album. It was filmed in Ontario, Canada in front of about 15,000-25,000 people. It's about 80 minutes long and has only one disc. Not too many special features to talk about here.

 But still, is this really 30 years old? Jeepers, it sounds like it was recorded last week.

The bonus disc is a treat as well. I'd actually forgotten the single mix of "Rebel Rebel," and my ensuing disappointment when I bought the album and the background vocals were gone!

9718	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	My first Bill Hicks experience was with ARIZONA BAY.  While it was in fact a funny album, I was put off by the mood inducing music and Hick's biggest draw, which was his large social baggage about religion and govt that he brought to his act.  I told myself that I would give him another chance and that chance came from RANT IN E MINOR.  The album is nearly twice as long, his baggage could be carried in steamer trunks on this album, but the material is three times as funny and at many times found myself almost hurting with laughter.  In particular the track called ARTISTIC ROLL CALL (about Jay Leno and the Tonight Show), is the funniest on any comedy album that I've heard.  Other noteworthy tracks are CONFESSION TIME (an obsession with the show COPS) and FEVERED EGOS (Bills idea for a TV show).  As I said the social material is a turn away at times (to me anyway), but the album is just too funny for me to give any kind of demerrit, unless it comes from the RUSH LIMBAUGH track (consider hitting >> on your player, it is rather disgusting.)



Unlike some of his other material, this album has aged remarkably well and sounds today fresh as ever.  Recorded at his farm in Scotland, one can sense the organic nature of it.

I won't bore you by heaping praise on her, but I might occasionally slip into the worship-phase I usually fall into when talking about her in this review. Oh well. My current art project is based on Bjork herself. I am exploring the way she adopts nature into her music and music videos, and how this is contrasted with the high-tech sound of her music (which can be heard on albums such as "Homogenic" and "Vespertine.") Therefore, I thought it would be wise to invest in Bjork's "Greatest Hits: Volumen 1993 - 2003" DVD. I already knew that this stunning video featured an amazing 21 music videos spanning 10 incredible years in the music industry, and thought it would be a brilliant source of study for my project.
City To City is his first solo album after the break-up of Stealer's Wheel, and Gerry's songwriting and pitch-perfect singing came to a crescendo in this glorious--almost spiritual--LP/CD.  Although every late seventies FM rock station played Baker Street and Right Down The Line for the power pop tunes that they are, the commercial success of these songs was the antithesis of the core constitution of Gerry Rafferty: quiet, unassuming, the forgotten man in the back of the room, bashful on stage, and yet with a zest for life and a dry humor that came through in his songwriting.  He believed in the power of song, and this LP reflects that ethos.  Most listeners of City To City will have memories of when they heard the hits, perhaps when spending time at the lake or in the car as a youth, but the Rafferty fan will sit and listen to the hit singles yet again, a fresh listen, and will recognize songs as deep as they are popular.  Baker Street's haunting meander is followed directly by the straight forward sensibility of Right Down The Line, a one-two punch of impeccable songwriting.

My father from the hills and hollows (yes, I am perfectly aware that it is nothing but hollas but what is an old yankee reprobate to do) of Appalachia. Down where the wind sings through the mountains passes and all that stuff. The stuff of Saturday night barn dances complete with fiddle, banjo, flute, maybe, after a hard-scrabble week in the mines, or trying to get one last damn crop out of that worn-out barren ground. The stuff of sweet-talking some mountain maid out of her virtue, of white lightening whiskey too hard to put in a bottle but just right from some ball jar. No thank you.
I suggest this. Trust me.

Perhaps you might buy both, and play both at the same time. It makes one wonder if a floating pig will come crashing into your living room as this kind of Floyd would create some sort of rift in the time fabric not seen outside of Doctor Who.
Breaking the songs down track by track would be futile, as one composition frequently runs into the other, but "Cheepnis" has always been my favorite.

I guess he figured since I'm a pretty young and angry lad, that I'd probably be interested in it.  I gave it a listen one night while I was cleaning up the house, and boy was I in for a treat!  I pretty much fell in love with it immediately.  Now, I haven't heard any of his other albums yet, but because of this one, I do have full intention on picking them up as well.  Bill Hicks knew how to put energy and heart into his performances.  He has a stance with every issue and he stupendously holds his ground for the most part.  I must forewarn you, however, that this is not for everyone.  Some of this leans way past the vulgar side of things, but that's what comedy is all about.  Now, I will also warn you that this is not just a spoken comedy album.  They incorporated music inbetween the tracks, so you get about of minute or so of music after every spoken bit.  The music is okay.  It's mostly just laid back guitar and drums, and sometimes there's some humming.  Most of the time I skip through it.  It was just something he was experimenting with.  It's not that much of a nuisance in my opinion, just hit the 'next track' button and you'll be on the spoken bit.  To sum this all up, Bill Hicks was a genius.  He was considered "over the top" by most, and went out of his way to shatter the rules.  His philosophies were set forth as aid for the free thinkers of the world.  He was a great, and energetic speaker, and any fan of intelligent comedy should definately be familiar with Hicks and his material.  Highly Recommended!
Best tracks are hands down Stinkfist,H., Eulogy, 46 and 2(the best song in the album), Aenema, Jimmy

This is gimmick-free rock, an organic product of the members' STP and GNR histories, and who better to sum up the attitude of this angry, explosive album than troubled troubadour Weiland - "It's complete honesty, so if people can relate, great. If not, they can f**k themselves."

"Tiny Dancer":  This is one of the two "hit" songs, but it also is the strongest track on the album.  Elton delivers some great piano work in this song, but one thing that I think gets highly overlooked is the subtle use of a Steel Guitar.  The Steel Guitar is used in Hawaiian music and if you listen closely on this track, you can almost hear some Hawaiian-like chords.  But this song is more than the Steel Guitar and piano - it is as perfect an Elton John tune I have heard.  Elton's vocal ranges are as good as I ever heard - and the instrumentation is perfect.  The reference to God is "Handing tickets out for God".

This self titled opus is that rare release that  pleases not only jazz enthusiasts, but pop/R&B lovers alike, without  sacrificing the integrity of it's craft. The two biggest hits of course  were "Lies"( a top-notch soul track with live jaunty horns funky,  bottom-heavy bass playing and some of Mr. Butler's finest scatting/guitar  playing) and "Take Good Care Of Me", a refreshing take on romance  and fidelity that never seems to sound old or dated. The remainder of the  album is flawless, brilliantly played jazz, my personal favorites being  "Barenese", "High Tide" "Sunset",  "Reunion" "Say We'll Be Together" and the lovely  "Going Home". An exceptionally strong second outing for this  gifted young artist who has only gotten better over the years. A welcome  additon to any serious collection.

13. Aenema-(6:39)-10/10
However, even with WOF's flaws, it stands head-and-shoulders above most other rock albums. Why? Because Cream was one of the best bands on the planet, and even though they weren't as good at the RAH shows as they were 37 years ago (who would be), they still beat out every other blues and rock band currently together today. And I do have to say, the packaging on the CD version of this album is exquisite. So get it, right now.

"Almost Blue" is one of Costello's most famous songs, a gentle piano ballad with a smoky blues feel. The fanfare trumpets of "...And in Every Home" completely take you by surprise but they fit the song so well that they quickly feel second nature and it's one more nice production touch that sets this album apart from anything Elvis had recorded before. The fast-paced "Little Savage" is an exhilarating ride while "The Loved Ones" contains a lyric revealing the original title for the album: "PPSILOVEYOU". The album's closer is the beautiful "Town Cryer", complete with Nieve's delicate piano and a soaring orchestra that brings the entire album together and leaves an indelible impression.

Now, there are some high points and some not-so-high points. My favorite song has to be "Somebody to Love." What an amazing, beautiful piece of work. Freddie is just stunning. Also worth mentioning is the fact that they FINALLY let drummer Roger Taylor sing his kick ass song "I'm in Love with My Car"! 'Bout time! Some not so great points are "Get Down, Make Love" (not so powerful, very studio-like) and the fast version of "We Will Rock You."

I think the problem might be that this isn't a "radio friendly" album. There aren't any catchy little hooks that so many bands aim for these days to get noticed.  It simply rocks. Hard.

This is an extraordinarily rare combination of the very best sonics with the very best performance.  The Chandos producers and engineers have captured one of the most-moving symphonies of the last century in all its emotional depth and complexity.  For the uninitiated, the Harris is more challenging, but it makes a good pairing.  As someone who has listened to and programmed classical music for 30 years, I HIGHLY recommend this CD.

The four "classic" Yes-men (not including new recruits Igor Khoroshev and Billy Sherwood) are now in their fifties, yet are still playing their hearts out and doing it in style.  It may be a bit shocking to a long-time Yes fan to see the band with so many wrinkles and grey, dyed, or bald heads, but as a relative newbie to the band, I find it very admirable that in their later years, Yes is still a live force to be reckoned with.

Eight singles (!) were released from the album, with seven hitting the top ten. "Dancing in the Dark" and "Glory Days" are the fun tracks on this album, showing that Bruce isn't always depressed, that he can make music that is fun to dance to and not heavy coated in meaning. "I'm On Fire" is a short romantic ballad that sounds much like Bruce of the past, but it has a faster beat and more of an 80's pop tinge to it. It's my favorite song on the album. "Born in the U.S.A." is the popular rock anthem that has been misinterpreted more than needs to be counted. "My Hometown" shows Bruce writing an introspective number, looking at both the positives and negatives of growing up. "Cover Me" and "I'm Going Down" are fast moving rockers for those looking for something not too popish and not too slow. "No Surrender" plays on the familiar theme of Springsteen not giving up on fighting for what he believes is right. The album cuts are pretty solid too, in fact, there really is no filler on this album. "Bobby Jean" is Bruces thanks and tribute to a band member who departed E Street shortly after getting married, "Working on the highway" is an old school 50's sounding rock song that is just fun to listen to, and "Darlington County" plays on the familiar theme of small town life and the struggles that they face everyday. "Downbound Train" has Bruce making a metaphor of comparing life to a train: you don't know where it's going and where it's going to end, but you're hanging on tight for the ready, hoping and praying for the best.

Overall, this album ROCKS. This is the best thing any of these musicians have made in a long time, rivalling Appetite For Destruction and Core. Between the 3 ballads and the other tough rockers, this album basically suits any tastes of music! Hopefully, these guys will stay at it and continue to make great music in the coming years, and that means not going to Rehab guys! If you're a fan of Metal, Modern Rock, Grunge, or Guns N Roses or Stone Temple Pilots, there is no way you'll not love this CD!

The strong emotion in each song blends seamlessly with each video concept. These are not your average music videos. Oh no. These are little cinematic shorts that dare to go where no music video has gone before. Bjork uses Michel Gondry frequently, who seems to incorporate abstract, exaggerated concepts for his work. This body of works left me wanting more. I cannot believe that this collection, spanning videos only from the 1990's, manages to outshine many of the music videos an entire decade later. Job well done.

I liked that there's no voice-over  narrative telling you the story of the band. Instead, the story is told  through interviews with the surviving members (Joey Molland, Mike Gibbins)  and a few select others. The production quality is a little cheap (in one  scene, Joey swats a fly away as he is talking) but it never gets in the way  of the story. The DVD is nice because you can jump to your favorite part or  video instead of fast-forwarding all day long.

1291	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	David Gilmour Live In Cocert, taken from two performances in London's Meltdown & Royal Festival Hall is a masterpiece of its own kind. Davide comes to stage with unshaven face and a T-shirt on. So humble and simple. He takes his guitar and kicks-off with an acoustic rendition of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond'. Wow! This is the greatest performance of the song to this date. Although his voice is not in fine shape but the power of his guitar makes it up. He follows with an old song by Syd Barret. He is the only Pink Floys member still meeting Syd sometimes and his dedication is invaluable. He revisitis Pink Floyd's past with 'Coming Back To Life'. Still his voice is not what it used to be. The best track is 'Je Crois Entendre Encore' which I haven't heard before and I assume it's an old French song. It made me cry and I really love the arrangement and the melancholy feeling of the song. He follows with a beautiful melodic new song called 'Smile. The presence of Michael Kamen on Piano and English Horn and the girl who plays Cello is truly magnificent on 'High Hopes'. The rendition of 'Wish You Were Here', 'Shine On You crazy Diamond (Part 2)' and ' A Great Day For Freedom' are all thrilling and moving. The Presence of Robert Wiatt and Bob Geldof on 'Comfortably Numb' are great but Roger is truly missed here. Overall, the performance as I wrote is a masterpiece and David delivers his best here. I just wonder why he hasn't played any song from his own back catalogue (1977's David Gilmour and 1982's About Face). The extra tracks are also great and you maybe surprised to see David singing his rendtion of Elvis Presley's 'Don't'. Thank you David for this great effort. I wish someday you can make things up with Roger Waters and we see you together again. I thank you.
CD #2- The second disk on this set starts with a 37-minute audio piece from the movie itself.  This is interesting, in a way, but only helpful for those who normally watch a movie with their eyes closed.  Once that track is done, and you get through a couple of short cuts, then you get to the meat of this disk, which is the song "King Kong" (divided into the last 6 tracks).  "King Kong" is an amazing and entertaining piece.  However, I must confess that I prefer the four minute version that Zappa and Jean Luc Ponty performed on the album "King Kong: Jean Luc Ponty Plays The Music Of Frank Zappa" (which can also be found on Amazon).
SIDE ONE
7123	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is where KRS-One starts to fall prey to didacticism, but he has relevant points to make, and the rapping is surprisingly nimble given all the information he's trying to pack in. "Who Protects Us from You?" is a bouncy anti-police-brutality rap, and KRS closes the album with the point that "World Peace" can only be achieved through a pragmatic, aggressive struggle for equality. Although Ghetto Music has a few signs that KRS is starting to take himself a little too seriously, overall it's another excellent effort and the last truly great BDP album.
The second side featured four ambient/instrumental Eno-influenced songs that were a complete departure from any previous Bowie recordings.  Of those four, Warszawa, Weeping Wall and Subteraneans were the most brilliant.  Weeping Wall invokes eerie, vivid images of the plight of the then-suppressed crumbling East German society.  Subteraneans feels like the emerging sun appearing out of darkness after Bowie has cleansed himself from the indulgences of the previous years.  In the absense of Art Decade, I would say this is a perfect album.

In closing -another triumph of space and time courtesy of Leon. I believe things work or don't work according to the time window in which they appear. This one was released exactly at the right time and, forever, will always be the right time no matter where you are at.

David Bowie's incredible expiremental album "Low" is one of the best he ever produced in the 80's. From start to finish it's a wild ride of musical genious that only leaves one wishing for more or listening to it again several more times. "Low"'s thematic elements of sadness and the grayer areas of the life are wrapped amid a storm of beautiful lyrics, enchanting vocal arrangements and rock and roll. You'll be singing along to the catchy melodies and moved by the beautiful instramentals that are found here. Don't miss out on the strange masterpiece that will forever stand apart from the rest of the music world as a gem.
But there is a singular problem here.  Very, very little film footage of Judy Garland in a genuine concert venue has come down to us.  There are snips, without sound, of her famous concert at Carnegie Hall; fragments of a concert on the Boston Common; moments of her legendary run at the Palace Theatre--but for the most part what we have here are songs culled from her various television programs, most particularly from the ill-fated THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW of the early 1960s.  And it's good stuff, yes, certainly, but most of these television programs were released to DVD a good while back, and serious Garland fans can now watch virtually every episode of the television series back-to-back if they want to.  THE CONCERT YEARS suffers in comparison for the simple reason that it can't be as inclusive as other, later releases are.
I bought the DVD this week after reading such positive reviews on Amazon.  Stevie Nick's voice is still in top form, despite what others have said about her voice during this concert.  She also seemed to really enjoy being back on stage with the band.  It's common knowledge that Christine McVie didn't want to be part of this concert, and it shows. This is my only complaint with the concert - she rarely smiles and looks out of place - she has the look of "is it time to go yet?"  She puts only an average effort into the songs she sings at this concert.  Anyway, aside from that, you get FM showcasing some of their best stuff including brilliant renditions of "Tusk" and "Landslide".

This was back when BDP dropped fresh material every year from '87 (Criminal Minded) until '92 (Sex & Violence), so that's not necessarily as easy as it may sound. With classic tracks like "Love's Gonna Get 'Cha", "Ya Strugglin' ", "House Ni***s", "100 Guns" (Ja Rule bit this joint), "Beef", and "Blackman In Effect", you know that the album is, at the very least, doper than most other 1990 hip hop releases. But there are solid tracks laced throughout the album and there are no fillers. Personally, I can't imagine why anyone would give this album less than 5 stars, but that's just me. This album is just as fresh now as it was 17 (oh my god, 17 years?!!!) years ago.

He attacks commercialism with 'I'm The Slime' He's talking about some girl he 'you know' in Dinah-Moe Humm. Raising Dental floss in 'Montana' I like how he used a typical rock signer in Fifty-Fifty and made fun of the signing style. The most famous and successful song off this album is definally Dirty Love which is a good song I think. The title alone explains what it is about.
Following this mans career - Gene Harris & The Four Sounds, Gene Harris & The Three Sounds, Gene Harris & the Philip Morris Super Band, Gene Harris All-Star Big Band, Gene Harris Trio and now, the Gene Harris Quartet...all have that driving blues-force we've come to love and enjoy.  Harris strived for perfection, always knew exactly who he was and what he was doing in this life.  His combination of ineffable delicacy and inexorable power became richer and fuller with each day, like natural sunshine, just keeps shining through.
New to the fold is Dream Theater's John Petrucci, playing on the opening song "Czar of Steel". One of the best cuts on the disc, it has a cool Jeff Beck vibe to it, utilising husky bass work and groovy guitar riffs, and a memorable main melody. Petrucci and Sherinian trade off insane solos, as Tony Franklin's fretless bass and Simon Phillips' drumming form the rhythmic backbone of the piece. "Man With No Name" features Zakk Wylde both on guitars and lead vocals, something uncommon for Derek Sherinian. Wylde does a great job building a thick, Sabbath-style atmosphere as he also sings almost identical to Ozzy Osbourne on the first couple of Sabbath releases. The song could be a perfect tribute to their influences had it not been for the middle part featuring a nice synth hook (which is later repeated by Wylde's vocals) and a smooth piano solo. Add to this this great violin courtesy of Jerry Goodman of Mahavishnu Orchestra fame and "Man With No Name" turns into a cool Derek Sherinian number.

However, I purchased this album for two songs - Born In The USA and Dancing In The Dark.  There are times that I hear a song that speak to me - an artsy phrase too often thrown around.  However, do not be fooled - this album nothing about being proud of America.  In fact, it is a slam against this great nation.
9583	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Love for Tender" starts what may be the most perfect sequence of songs in all of rock and roll history.  The whole album is great, but what (I'm assuming) must have been the first side of the original album, those first 10 songs, are as close to perfection as anything I have ever heard.  It floors me everytime.  The other "side" is fantastic too, but just the way this album kicks off and keeps coming at you...man, it kicks.  This album is also the one that convinced me that Steve Nieve is one of the great keyboard players of pop music as well, since he is the drive behind all that great music, imho.  (Not intended as a slam IN ANYWAY on EC, either.)

  As one of the other reviewers pointed out, Justin Hayward was coping with a case of laryngitis, and his voice lacks that resonance that always made his vocals stand out, but he's never off-key or even strained in delivery.  The concert is about equally divided between the early (up to Seventh Sojourn) and later work, with the middle section full tilt Moodies, with Lovely to See You, Gemini Dream, I Know You're Out There Somewhere, and The Voice, all full houses or better, slammed one after the other down on the stage. Later they played my one dissappointment of the concert, Isn't Life Strange, which I have concluded is strictly a lady's number.  When they reach the refrain, "It makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry-y-y!"  I'm completely lost.  Do you?  Are you going to? Am I?  Should I?  It's the only song I ever heard them do that borders on the inane. But it's easily skipped with the remote, although as I said, the ladies would probably scream bloody murder.  After a solid The Other Side of Life they close out the concert with another string of single smashes-I'm Just a Singer in a Rock-n-Roll Band, Nights in White Satin, Question, and, of course, Ride My See-Saw for the encore.  The beginning, as you've probably guessed, is a mixture of the sentimental old and new with ample back-up from the Colorado Symphony, which returns in the final pieces with ...well...symphonic accompaniment.  At the close, my middle-aged friend, you can almost hear the old disc-jockeys announcing, "..and now, from the Moody Blues, for the next four months on the charts...,". Alive and well.  I rest my case.
I strongly recommend this Deluxe Edition, although I was a bit disappointed with the DVD.

Love that ukelele on 'Ram On'! This was long before it became George Harrison's favourite instrument. George can be heard playing uke on some of his posthumous album "Brainwashed", and McCartney himself played it when he sang George's song "Something" as a tribute on his most recent tour.
So too, I'm a confirmed traditionalist [A shout from afar: "There's a revelation!"]  and so I responded in kind to those of the quill fraternity who felt Evgeny's requisite and in fact traditional 'classical' artist recital bowing to the audience [and all points of same therein depending on the hall configuration] was allegedly "wooden and romantic era pass." No doubt these are the same wags who ballyhoo for classical pianist formal attire to be abandoned as well as the orchestra to boot in a sort of Friedrich Gulda 'come as you are' style. Ahhh, and speaking of which, there is Gulda doing the "Emperor" 5th piano concerto in mufti, as it were, and conducting [!?] at the same time and a lone soul claps after the first movement so when nothing is heard after the second movement, he rises from the keyboard and announces in 'die Sprache' ["the language" -- German], "Na' und?" [and so? In effect, no clap?].

If you're expecting a high-fidelity kind of Event Coverage that Sees All and does everything except an indepth study of John Entwistle's nose hair, you either were born too late or have gotten too spoiled by culture and technology.  It's easy to forget that at the time this concert took place in 1970, Led Zeppelin didn't sell cars and the Rolling Stones didn't shill for Bill Gates.  Rock was youth music, viewed with suspicion by Old People (i.e., over 30.  Yes, if you're 34, old as you may feel, you were probably an embryo when this gig went off).  You never heard real rock on TV, and had to hunt to find it on radio.  The Square View was what prevailed in the national media:  squeaky guitars, flashing discotheque lights and gyrating girls in plastic dresses and boots.  Hippies figured in there somewhere.  But the so-called general public, i.e., you, if you were over 30 at the time, didn't know what rock sounded like.  The huge potential of the young as consumers was just being sniffed about by The Establishment.
My favorites have remained the same over the years: the creepy The Dead Man's Dream; the plaintive Nothing That I Didn't Know; the rousing About To Die; the enigmatic Barnyard Story; and the soaring Piggy Pig Pig which gets so much from Copping's organ. Many people I know never got beyond Whisky Train and many others think Still There'll Be More and Whaling Stories are the most memorable cuts. My opinion is that Whisky Train, while good, is pretty basic and repetitive. Still There'll be More has a good theme, but I find it lyrically weak from the first couple of lines and that detracts from the rest of it. As for Whaling Stories, it is too drawn out and also lyrically weak at times. Your Own Choice sounds like an afterthought and seems out of place on the album.

Overall, it's a different kind of music (or at least it seemed to be at the time) but one that I enjoy listening to a lot more often lately.

A soulful and gospel-like feel, with a piano and guitar melody features in the laid back "Rock N Roll With Me," a change from the previous theatrics.
American Beauty is centered on the art of songwriting, lyricism, solid vocals and harmonies. Less emphasis is given to soloing. They abandon the psychedelic explorations of the studio in favor of returning to their roots and drawing upon the country and bluegrass influences that run so deep.
James Taylor performs most of his classics, Fire and Rain; Carolina on My Mind; Sweet Baby James, and others.

4) Dear Boy - THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM AND ONE OF THE BEST POP SONGS EVER.  This is one of those "ideal" songs that could not be made any better no matter what, and it is up there with the top 10 or 15 songs the Beatles ever wrote.  Someone on this site mentioned that it's similar to Martha My Dear from the White Album, and it is, now that I think about it.  However, it's even better than that gem.

12. Masters Of War (Old Masters)
Originally filmed at The Hammersmith Odeon in 1985 on David's solo About Face tour I personally think it is superior to some Floyd!! He has an all-star band (Bad Company's Mick Ralphs on guitar and The Firm - AC/DC drummer Chris Slade) and Roy Harper and Nick Mason join him for one song each.
And yeah - He wanks away on guitar ... but there are a million guitarists who can play just as good - you'll just never hear of them because they didn't have the good fortune to rest upon someone elses laurels.
2515	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	WHAT A CLASSIC! This is Stevie Nicks at her all time best onstage! TRUE Rock and Roll. Shot at the beautiful Red Rocks ampitheatre in Colorado on her 1986 Rock A Little Tour, the crowd is CERTAINLY enthusiastic about this performance. She opens with a powerful version of "Outside The Rain" which segues into "Dreams" beautifully, and then into "Talk to Me", a number which she rarely does onstage because she says its difficult and draining - although she does a fantastic job with it. Tom Petty's "I Need to Know" is awesome, as is her single from the Rock A Little album, "No Spoken Word." She treats the audience to a truly beautiful version of another rare onstage performance, "Beauty And The Beast", complete with a photo montage of Mick Fleetwood, who she wrote this song about. The best performance of the night, in my opinion, is "Stand Back". Bobbye Hall, percussionist from Stevie's "White Wing Dove Tour '81" and "Wild Heart Tour '84", gives an awesome opening before the synthesizers kick in and Stevie dances unlike you have ever seen her dance before on an extra long intro and guitar solo. She and her dance partner do a really great job, giving a really high energy performance. She closes with "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You" - TRULY beautiful and complete with live white doves released at the end, a surprise for Stevie. One lands on her hand won't leave, which really touches her. She gives it to Mick and finishes with "Edge Of Seventeen". Peter Frampton plays guitar on this one in an all too brief appearance. Personally, this was not the best performance of this song, as she painfully adds extra lyrics and literally screams through half of it, not keeping up with the medley. Although this was shot during the time that Stevie was overcoming a coke addiction, it DOES NOT diminish her ability to give an EXCELLENT and POWERFUL performance..well, minus "Edge of Seventeen." All of the favorites from Stevie's solo band - the legendary Waddy Wachtel on guitar, percussionist Bobbye Hall, back up vocalists Sharon Celani & Lori Perry-Nicks, are included in this performance. The lights and staging are superb. Keep in mind this was shot before Dolby Digital Sound, but the sound is quality. Typical 1980's close ups of Stevie singing that were recorded after the performance are also on this DVD and although it is "totally" 1980's with big hair and glam, it's one you'll watch over and over again! A must have for any Stevie fan!

Featuring Flo 'n' Eddie from the Turtles, this version of the Mothers of Invention split its shows between extended, musically challenging instrumentals and lyric heavy, comically centered "pop" songs.  Zappa's sociological obsession with being a rock star and all that such a job entailed reached its peak on this tour with his extended "Groupie Routine" and his inclusion of several numbers from the soundtrack to "200 Motels" (none of which are featured here, but were part of the sequence herein included).

If you havn't heard this album you must get it and experience it for yourself,  although i've been a tribe fan for the long time, i'm sure it isn't too late to become one: because this is one of the greatest groups in rap/hip-hop's history.  I don't think you can fully apreciate these two catagorys of music unless you heard tribe and I don't just speak for myself.

But perhaps what makes this recording so exceptional is the tight musicianship of the players, and the exceptional skill displayed by the players. Zappa's guitar solos on Zomby Woof and Montana still give me shivers up and down my spine, and despite being 42, I still have to crank the volume when these tunes come on.
1736	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I originally bought the VHS version of this 1990 concert and I really like it. That version released in 1992 was cutted to 13 songs, leaving behind hits such as "JUST LIKE JESSE JAMES" or "HEART OF STONE". Now this re-release on DVD is loaded with special features such as an alternative opening, a big blooper from a concert of this tour that started and Cher's microphone wasn't working, a TV Commercial promoting the the tour, a backstage of home movies with Cher's commentary (Cher makes some comentaries throughout the development of the DVD), a clip from "HEART OF STONE" (song) with a personal camera, photo gallery and a cut from footage of Cher's crew backstage. Next to this extras you can find the tracks "TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS", "HOLD ON", "MANY RIVERS TO CROSS" and "TOUGHER THAN THE REST" with multi-angles of your choice. What I find ridiculous is that on the VHS version this songs were on the concert on its part of the show but now they appear as speacial features. And well I still wonder why they didn't release the WHOLE show without cutting it to just 13 songs. Well I believe that we still have to wait for that version.

The music is smoky, eyes-closed pure and retro-cool.  Dana Colley's baritone sax seems to be everywhere at once keeping up as an accompaniment and harmony to the vocals and then the next instance carrying on the burden of the slot usually filled by guitars.  It's pretty mind-bendingly talented.  Mark Sandman, who unfortunately never did quite discover a cure for pain to replace his drug use, sounds like a raw Chris Isaak.  The drums and heavy slide bass lines are in lock step making the songs jump right along and making you forget that people even have a need for a lead guitar to make music come alive.  When a rare guitar does appear on a song, it's a "Battle of Evermore" ala Led Zeppelin moment on track 7: "In Spite of Me" with Sandman's whispered husky voice making their music even more varied and beautiful

It featured Tony Martin on vocals, Tony Iommi, on guitars, Geezer Buttler on bass, and Bobby Rondinelli on drums.  This is the only Black Sabbath studio release to contain both Geezer and Martin (Geezer and Martin were both on Cross Purposes Live, as well.)  In my opinion this is a very good album.  Headless Cross is the definitive album with Tony Martin, but this is right up there!  I think Dehumanizer was a great heavy album, and Cross Purposes, while not as heavy, is certainly a worthy follow-up.  When Geezer and Iommi get together, you know it's going to be a great album.

The Reagan Administration's ironic use of the title track, as well as the raving one-star reviews posted below, only go to show how subtle and pointed (and thus inaccessible to many right-wingers) the messages in the Boss' songs are.  Classic.
 I like what I hear on this CD:
Seeing Mustaine perform is even better, you want to talk about a great performer as well as a godly guitarist, watch mustaine crunch those riffs.  Then Hammet came along, who as well plays great, but he by far is no dave mustaine and never will be, but replacing dave is beyond comprehension.

Yes, this album is a classic, maybe the best pure "McCartney" album.  It is filled with melodicism, great arrangements, hooks galore and, with no apologies, great nonsense lyrics.  The Beatles had lost their sense of fun; to Paul's credit, he knew it, tried to restore it, realized it couldn't be done with the Beatles anymore, and set out to achieve it on his own (with his wife Linda).

The Eagles, now including Joe Walsh, hit their complete stride with "Hotel California."

This song still is a great song to listen to and will last for countless years to come.
I remember The Distant Sound Of Thunder CD having a distracting amount of audience noise (they never seemed to stop and listen!), and was pleased to have it be much more in the background for this concert's mix. The sound is really good (even as just audio). Having Dark Side of the Moon performed in entirety was great (alot of emphasis on the trippy projection and lights), and the encore of Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell was powerful with the grand finale' of lazers, lights and explosions being over the top but fun too. However, I liked the beginning of the concert (disc 1) more. The only other concert DVD I've seen close to this level of art and grandure is Peter Gabriel's '03 GROWING UP tour, but this is much more intense and cohesive. I missed Waters and wondered how much better or different it would have been with him, but overall, the show is complete as is.

This is highly recommended.  Enjoy!
Second -- considering the age of much of the source material the quality of both images and sound are excellent.  The presentation is roughly by performance date starting with Enrico Caruso in a silent film dated 1907 and ending with a excerpt by Tito Gobbi in 1964.  The earlier material comes from film, the later material starting in about 1956 appears to come mostly from TV broadcasts.  Much of the material is not available elsewhere.  The people who introduce each segment are, in many cases, as famous as the singers and include, for example, Thomas Hampson, Charles Laughton, Bob Hope, Schyler Chapin, Magda Olivero, and Jon Vickers.

All songs here are distinctive, memorable and so very well done.

But, no nevermind my preferences- there is somehere here for everyone. Nice nourishment for your soul.
  I do have some minor complaints. Since this performance is largely acoustic there are no red-hot solos. Gilmour truly is one of the greatest soloists ever, on par with Clapton and Hendrix and aside from the mournful blues number with Mica Paris his virtuoso soloing is nowhere to be found. Even the famous outro solo on 'Comfortably Numb' is way too restrained for my taste. I kept waiting for him to deliver the other worldly guitar pyrotechnics I loved from previous tours but instead he choose the minimalist approach. I also couldn't help but wonder how this music would've sounded supporting Roger Waters lyrics and concepts. Gilmour and Waters always sounded better together than apart.

An awesome collection of recordings spanning the period 1967-69, "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" is a Zappa experience par excellance.

5183	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Jerome Froese joins Edgar Froese and Paul Haslinger for another intense foray into the world of electronic music.  Up-tempo tracks such as "Melrose", "Yucatan" and "Rolling Down Cahuenga" predominate, fiery, percussive and minor in tone with structures that build and stirring percussive beats that drive ever-forward.  The interspersed slower tracks are a nice compliment to all of this, gentle and really very pretty (especially the wistful closing selection, "Cool at Heart").  Saxophonist Hubert Waldner, who also played on the group's previous release, "Lily on the Beach", joins the core trio here as well, wailing away to great effect on the opening track.  What I like about Tangerine Dream's work is that it is unapologetically electronic, making full use of synthesizers by playing to their strengths--variety, volume and modernity--rather than trying to use the keyboards to emulate the sound of, say, string orchestras or folk instruments (which they really can't match ...yet...).  By taking this approach, Tangerine Dream creates vibrant, new music--richly textured, intelligently structured, and all their own.  Try their next release, "Tyger" for some creative departures.
418	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Slash's second solo album features just about exactly what you would expect, sleazy rock n roll in the west coast L.A. glam tradition.  There are lots of gritty guitar solos and the vocal histrionics of Myles Kennedy soars above it all.  Unlike Slash's last solo effort from 2010, that featured a myriad of guest stars, this album features Slash's touring band with gives the album a bit more cohesiveness.  Kennedy is one of the great vocalists in rock today and his presence here on all of the tracks really brings Slash's music to a new level.  All that being said, I don't think this album is quite as strong as the last one from 2010.  The songwriting here is good, but with 14 tracks it ends up having a bit of sameness about it all.  Still, if hard hitting old school rock n roll is what you are looking for, this album certainly delivers.  Slash is playing better than ever and obviously the fact that these guys toured together for over a year has made them a tight as hell musical outfit.  Overall I don't think this one quite rises to the level of its predecessor, but it is a solid 4 star album.

A comment on the rapport he has with Tommy and Chris--it's so beautiful to witness. They fuel off each other and the audience; the energy shared...Wow!


One of the best known and perhaps most brilliant of his songs is "A Song For You".  This was a big hit for the Carpenters in 1972.  A big nod to Leon, it was also the name of their LP.  Everyone from Bing Crosby to Joe Cocker to Willie Nelson to Nancy Wilson, plus a long list of famous names (I lost count after 70 artists) have recorded this one.  Leon sings this one from the heart.
It is an exemplary recording of Brazilian Jazz, laid back easy listening at it's best.

Likewise, Springfield's choice of material tends to defy genre.  She did indeed do a host of recordings that most people would describe as "soul," but at the same time she did everything from lounge-style to Broadway to blues-inflected.  It is extremely difficult to think of another singer with such broad tastes: from "the wall of sound" effect of "Stay Awhile" to the smoky, nightclub-ish "The Look of Love" to the super-clean style of "Goin' Back," she encompassed virtually every 20th Century pop idiom.
8846	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Way back in 1987 I bought the Rykodisc CD of Zappa's The Grand Wazoo.  Over the years the CD was either lost or sold, leaving me yearning again for another copy.  I then purchased the remastered edition of the album (unknowingly) and was quite shocked and disappointed when Zappa's son Dweezil interfered with the mixes and song order from the original master tapes.  Gone was George Duke's lush, rock-jazz fused electric piano solo in one particular song.  It was completely buried in the mix to benefit Ansley Dunbar's drumming, which now is brought up in the mix.  Another flaw was the very first song on the album is not The Grand Wazoo--its For Calvin and his next two hitch-hikers. Please keep away from the remastered edition of the Grand Wazoo and do what I did, which was to buy an original 1987 Rykodisc copy, used of course.  This one was mixed and approved by Frank himself.  Sorry, Dweezil.

5619	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	If you do want the very best and only the very best, it's all right here and most of the songs sung so outstandingly were written by Roy himself either in partnership with Joe Melson or Bill Dees. The touching Christmas tune, "Pretty Paper" was written by Willie Nelson and "Dream Baby" and "Shahdaroba" by Cindy Walker who wrote many-a country tune including Jim Reeves' "Distant Drums" (which Roy covered). These songs as done by Roy Orbison touch the emotions in a way that only a relative few can. These are priceless. Also Roy took Elvis Presley's rousing  1957 hit, "Mean Woman Blues", and made it his own in 1963. After some years off the charts as a solo artist, Roy was on his way to making a new round of hits with his magnificent voice when he died in December 1988.  The songs in this package are from his best years on the charts.
563	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	In some ways this is similar to "Nebraska."  The songs are quick character sketches, they touch on the troubles experienced by ordinary people in the United States.  The difference is that the people here aren't serial killers or the like, instead they face their problems with quiet heroism.  Consequently the album is upbeat, filled with anthems and even triumphant at point.

But take out the big single, and there's still a lot of good stuff here.  One would think that after listening to Carlos Santana's guitarwork for almost thirty years, it would start sounding the same.  I didn't have that problem here.  There are plenty of songs that stretch out long enough to give his guitar a workout.  If you like this, and I did, then this is a very good record.  And the beer commercial is pretty good, too.

9653	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Most successful musicians are good at their particular style; what sets the great ones apart is that they can cross over to different styles successfully. It is really admirable for anyone of Zappa's stature to even want to work outside the box. But FZ pretty much lived outside the box, and this CD is proof. If you have an interest in Zappa's chamber or orchestral compositions (and be advised, this isn't "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow" with violin accompaniment; these are real chamber music compositions), this is the one to buy. The London Symphony Orchestra sessions worked fine as compositions, but the recordings are rendered unlistenable by FZ's unfortunate choice of using 40-50 PZM's (pressure zone microphones) on the orchestra. I'm a recording engineer so take it from me: other than for a few very esoteric uses, PZM's take "suck" to a whole new level. The Yellow Shark, in addition to featuring performances by fantastic musicians, is very well recorded indeed. I personally would have been a little happier had they cut out at least some of the generous applause between tracks, which becomes tedious after awhile, but hey, it's a small matter. These are very good musical works by one of America's most gifted composers. The tragedy, of course, is that we can only imagine what he would be writing now if he were still with us.

There's a feeling I get every year around Christmastime, and TSO "director" Paul O'Neill (who produces Savatage's albums) captured it exactly on this CD. As a matter of fact, on TSO's web site, O'Neill writes, "I love writing stories and I've always been staggeringly fascinated with Christmas. It's such a magical time of the year. If you're walking down a New York City street around Christmastime and it starts to snow, the potential for magic can be felt in the air.

Jimmy Barnes and Joe Bonamassa do an excellent job at covering Lazy, a largely instrumental song, by turning it into an extremely hard-rockin song, and one that is complete with wailing guitars and synths. Track eight, Space Truckin, when performed by Iron Maiden, is an insanely hooky, and very lively and energetic song with memorably melodic vocals; and the next song after that is also performed by a metal band, this one named Metallica. It is surprising that James Hetfield and the Boys were chosen to cover When A Blind Man Cries, as it is a sad, slow, dark, and murky melodic ballad, and not one that is thrashy at all. With that said, though, it does show off Metallicas metal roots by uncorking a ripping melodic guitar solo section as well as trafficking in some heavy, pounding power chords near the numbers end. And, of course, it also has plenty of shredding, wah-heavy guitar leads that practically scream classic Hammett, too. The album then concludes with a bonus track in the form of another cover of Highway Star, this one being an adherently groovy and highly infectious one pulled off by Glenn Hughes and Steve Vai.
No other music video or live concert audio recording that I have ever experienced does a more effective job of communicating the sheer excitement of a musician performing on stage. And more than any other recording, this one makes me want to run out to a gritty nightclub and hear some live music, ANY live music.

While "Hotel California" is a great song, several other songs on this CD are excellent.  "Life in the Fast Lane" and "Victim of Love" show some of the influence that Joe Walsh had on the previously country-flavored Eagles, as does the guitar heavy ending of "Hotel California".

Many people see fit to compare it to his older stuff, but i really see no comparison.  THis is a completely different thing, very unrelated to songs like "black magic woman" and the like.

679	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The astonishing Marc-Andre Hamelin has done it again. This two CD set is now the best available recording of these amazing pieces. Not that pianists have been lining up to tackle them. I know of only two other pianists that have dared to record a complete performance: Geoffrey Douglas Madge (whose recording of these pieces is, I believe, out of print now) and Carlo Grante. You may draw any conclusion you please from the fact that Madge took four CDs, Grante three, but Hamelin only two to traverse these finger breakers. Godowsky (1870-1938) was, perhaps, the greatest pianist that has ever lived. He was playing the piano at three years of age, and that without lessons! His understanding of the modern piano and its capablities was unique and profound. All of the great pianists of his day (and he lived in an age of masters - players like Rachmaninov, Hoffmann, Grainger, and Busoni were his peers) held him in awe. Godowsky's "Fifty-three Studies based upon twenty-six Etudes of Chopin" are infamous for their murderous difficulty. Twenty two of the studies are for the left hand alone. Several of them contrapuntally combine two of Chopin's etudes at the same time. The results have been vilified by many as a blasphemy against Chopin; however, Godowsky loved Chopin's music and considered these pieces an act of reverence. They are unique in the piano literature and every lover of the instrument should be familiar with them. It takes a musician of Mr. Hamelin's Olympian gifts to do them justice though. It was said in Godowsky's day that he was writing for a future generation of pianists. Mr Hamelin shows that generation has arrived with a vengeance. These fascinating CDs are well worth your time and money, don't hesitate to purchase them.

I purchased 'Vicious Cycle' and thought it was pretty good and that, finally, the latest version of Skynyrd, (with Johnny Van Zant as the front man), was finally developing it's own sound instead of trying to reprise the glory days of Ronny Van Zant.  So I purchased 'God and Guns' and was pretty disappointed in it.  Still a new sound, but the vitality of the songs was missing somehow.  So, with some doubt, I purchased this album, 'Last of A Dyin' Breed.'  S***!  From the first couple of notes of the title song this album rocks!  True southern rock sound and sentiments fans have come to love with all of the guitar this band is known for thrown in for good measure.  This is  the good ol' boys at their (newest!) best.  The song 'Ready To Fly' brought tears to my eyes, and anyone who has had to say goodbye to a beloved parent will closely identify with it.

  Ok, on to the songs that are  recieving criticism being included in this album.  The first guest on the  album is Dave Matthews on the track Love of My Life.  Matthews, like  Santana, is very influenced by world music as he himself is from South  Africa. (One listen to any of his albums will show this.)  Everlast lends  vocals and rhythm guitar on the haunting Put Your Lights on.  This song, I  admit, had to grow on me, but after the fifth or sixth listen, is the  standout track on the album.  Moving past Smooth and Maria Maria, comes Do  You Like the Way with Lauren Hill and Cee-Lo (of the group the Goodie Mob)  This song, muddled at first, but one standout is that Cee-Lo is as talented  of a singer as he is an emcee.  The final two tracks, featuring non-Latin  guests are Wishing it Was featuring Eagle Eye Cherry and The Calling, which  will be a classic showing the insturmental genius of both Carlos Santana  and Eric Clapton, who is a true blues master.

Whatever the  case, ATSOS is among the weakest albums made by the "band". Let  'em In, despite its top 40 potential, is a third rate McCartney tune a la  Your Mother Should Know (i.e., its uninspired ). Silly Love Songs captures  the flavor of mid 70's disco and demonstrates that Paul's ability as an  arranger is still strong. It's one of the better songs on the album. Time  To Hide by Denny Laine is a stand out among most of the material as is Wino  Junko. Beware My Love is one of those McCartney rockers that jumps out to  surprise you just when you thought the album was going to get worse. Beware  My Love is this album's secret weapon and one of the best mid 70's rockers  McCartney wrote. Macca's shredding lead vocal and the strong hook make this  into a minor classic.

Played the DVD twice in a row. The back-up singers seem tired at the very beginning, but then they loosen up and start to enjoy the fun. The music is just outstanding - simple, laid-back and harmonious. The part when Bob starts to dance is for crying out loud.
5441	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album was released at a time when Cohen was almost forgotten, about seven years before the tribute albums I'm Your Fan and Tower Of Song would spur renewed interest in his oeuvre. Warnes' interpretations are always graceful and moving. She understands Cohen's music well, having done backing vocals on some of his albums like Various Positions, and she covers his songs with loving dedication. My favorites include Aint No Cure For Love (from Cohen's I'm Your Man), Coming Back To You (from Various Positions), Came So Far For Beauty (from Recent Songs) and of course the formidable Joan Of Arc where Cohen himself sings some of the verses. Her voice is the perfect vehicle for his poetic lyrics of romantic longing and despair, and my only complaint is that I would have loved to hear her interpretations of Suzanne and Sisters Of Mercy too.

 Despite its instrumental nature, The Grand Wazoo can be viewed as a concept album.  The liner notes tell a story of Uncle Meat's creation of an illusory replica of Rome.  This replica is ruled by Cleetus Awreetus-Awrightus (which is a conceptual continuity phrase), and has a complex but entertaining mythology based entirely on music.  Non-musical people (called Questions) are rounded up and put out of their misery, but only after several chances at redemption.  His army consists of musicians, and their battles with Cleetus' arch-nemesis Mediocrates (whose army is heavy on vocals) are fought on a sonic battleground, playing shuffles to drown out their barrage of Ditties.  His staff includes Gregarious the drummer and Erroneous the bass player.  To reinforce this mythology, Erroneous is credited with playing bass on the Grand Wazoo, although Erroneous' actual identity is shrouded in mystery.  The instrumental sections conjure visions of the goings-on of these people.
With some Broadway performers by the time of age 40 or so only perform because they know they are incapable of doing anything else; And by the age of 40 or so, may not find it enjoyable to perform any longer. But that was NOT the situation for any of the ladies in this concert. Every single one of the leading ladies was obviously have a grand time, and wouldn't have wanted to be doing anything else. And of course the same applies to the audience.

3171	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Sure, you're thinking, "I can buy 'The Entertainer' DVD set and get this along with other Garth specials; why bother with the VHS?"  Here's why: The DVD version is severely edited.  First off, as a marketing ploy, two songs were excised from the program and put on the DVD as "bonus tracks."  Moreover, there were several between-songs moments that were sacrificed and unfortunately, many were the kinds of things that really helped make the Central Park show a standout Garth event.  The highlight was when Garth explained how it was that Billy Joel was still around to come out in the encore and perform on "You May Be Right."  They stole the car that Billy came in, is the way Garth explains it to the audience.  True?  Doubtful, but it's amusing.  On the DVD version, Billy Joel is simply all of a sudden on-stage again with no introduction.  The DVD version is too perfunctory to really capture the magic of this event, and for that reason, you really owe it to yourself to acquire the original, unedited, VHS release.
As if I had not already loved that album, based on this I would LOVE to see the whole of Rick Wright's Broken China performed in a similar sized venue--obviously it will need a little more on the technical side (and perhaps a bit more visually, given that the story does lend itself nicely to that), but I would think there'd be a way to keep it a small and intimate performance. Would be very nice. :-)

Among the many things accomplished by this album was the resurrection of the careers of Turtles Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan.

The technical aspects of the remastering make the recordings crisp and almost pop out of the speakers.  Their first big hit was the excellent "House of the Rising Sun" with its crying organ and Burdon's powerful emotional vocals, "The only thing that gambling is is a suitcase & a trunk; and the only time that he is satisfied is when he's on a drunk."  And then Alan Price's organ wails.  Classic and crisp, it pours from the speakers reborn.  My favorite Animals track is the wild "It's My Life" with unique guitar part, the thumping bass and the tap of the sticks on the cymbals flying out of the speakers, "There'll be women & misfortune."  One of the favorites from the Vietnam era and probably one of the most popular oldies for our soldiers in Iraq is the classic "We Gotta Get Out of This Place."  On "Retrospective," the bass thumps infectiously, the cymbals clang, and Burdon's vocals goes through the roof, "My little girl you're so young & pretty; and one thing I know is true, you'll be dead before your time is due."  These are some of the finest moments in classic rock.  Other highlights include the churning "Inside--Looking Out," the smoky "San Franciscan Nights" and of course "Boom Boom."  This package has great notes, a great selection of the Animals' best, but most of all the high standard of technical excellence in remastering makes this an essential disc even for those who have these tunes on vinyl or earlier CD releases.  Wow!

Musically there are no  real changes from the seventies except for an increase in funk; in that  respect it could be said to continue a trend started in Gaucho 20-odd years  ago.  "Cousin Dupree" and "Janie Runaway" are as good  as anything they did in their heyday, as far as I can see.  The strange  thing is that Two Against Nature makes it seem as if they've hardly been  away rather than taking an extended hiatus through most of the 80's and  90's.

All 15 tracks flow together effortlessly and the whole album should be heard from beginning to end. It's like a movie where every scene is important and to not see the whole thing would greatly hurt the experience. In fact, this album is my second-favorite EC album, only behind All This Useless Beauty. From an artistic standpoint this may just be his brightest and best.

6892	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is another one of those McCartney albums that was trashed by the critics when it first came out. Time has been very kind to it though and it really is a strong effort. One of the reasons for the bad reviews of any Paul album is because of his Beatle past. In some ways he will be haunted by it forever. This album came out shortly after the Beatles' breakup so the comparison was inevitable. If McCartney had never been a Beatle his sales would have suffered but perhaps his solo work would have been more accepted by the critics. Ironically, this is probably his most Beatle sounding album. Ram has some of the funniest and most ridiculous lyrics I have ever heard, but for me that is only a minor drawback. On very few albums can I say I like every track, but on this I do and with the addition of two bonus tracks, this makes Ram even stronger. Ram is loaded with catchy riffs and melodies and some truly wonderful vocals. Paul puts on his best Elvis imitation as he goes a little deeper in the throat and at times just blows me away. His voice is so expressive and he has the ability to change his style of singing from song to song. I have to hand it to Linda too; because she does give us some first rate harmony on several tracks. Ram is probably one of the top five best McCartney albums.

2119	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I was forunate enough to see a show on this tour which I thought was the best Gabriel tour yet. This video documents it excellently. Peter Gabriel concerts are always riveting but on this tour he had many more tricks in his bag of goodies. His ability to involve his audience in the each songs story is uncanny. He runs the gamut of emotions in this set. Special credit goes to every member in the band. They help to propel the songs' intensities while each revealing a little bit of their own personality. It was easy to tell from Paula Cole's singing that she was destined for stardom. This tour was way ahead of it's time and sets the bar very high for any theatrically inclined singer or band.

Because it is one of McCartney's best sounding albums. I do not own the CD, I own the original vinyl version. And after listening to his other albums, and then giving RAM a spin, I was shocked to hear such a well recorded and bright piece of work coming from McCartney, where the songs are consistent in their volume and relation to eachother track to track. Everything is clear and can be heard, and nothing drowns out anything else. It made me wonder what happened to him after he released this album.
Anyway, this DVD video collection of "Madonna: 93:99" is a fabulous collection of song and video.  Madonna looks different in nearly every video.  She has so many different hairstyles and a vast wardrobe of unique costumes.  If I could put a woman to represent my idea of sex and religion, it would be Madonna.

  This album has been  cited as the inspiration for countless 80s new wave synth bands and beyond  (NIN, Prodigy).

That being said, I would only ask that before you disagree with the value of this review, please take that into account.  I've had this CD for quite a while now, periodically going back to give it ONE MORE TRY.  And I just can't get into it.  I find the music here to be so overbearingly scripted and unoriginal, that it immediately leaves my player for weeks before I try it again.  And again....  The bottom line is that I've heard these songs before....  Many, many times....  The point of this review is by no means to knock the art of musicals.  For those of you that are fans of them, I'm sure this soundtrack is a true joy to listen to and I hope you enjoy it.  (I see that many of you do).  This review is for those folks who, like me, were on the fence about buying this CD because they are ardent supporters of EJ's more pop-oriented music.  Trust me on this one, if you have the special edition of Peachtree Road, or have already downloaded Elton's versions of "Electricity" and "The Letter", you have all you need from this release.  As a last note, for those who are still not sure, Elton's version of "Maggie Thatcher" is a good indication of the kind of songs that permeate this soundtrack. If you enjoy his version of that, there is a very good chance you will like this CD more than I do.  Thanks for reading.....

For all of that, though, the absolute and indefinable screen magic and stage presence that radiates from two of the world's most legendary entertainers is more than palpable here - it's real, heartfelt and honest. Judy and Liza seem both enamoured of and slightly overawed by each other, and their shared medleys and duets (which comprise most of the track listings) are breathtaking. Liza more than holds her own with her opening number "Gypsy In My Soul", and in terms of sheer enjoyment, their rendition of the classic "Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again" beats the Garland-Streisand version hands down.

However, I just want to say Rebecca Luker who sings Falling in Love With Love is the best of the  Broadway Ladies. I may be bias because I was in a play with her in college  but she does have a beautiful voice and I wish the rest of the world could  know her better. She has had the lead in several Broadway shows including  the revivals of Showboat and The Sound of Music but just is known for  Broadway. Also pleasing to the ears is Andrea McArdle, the original Annie,  who sings a medley of Look For The Silver Lining/Tomorrow. I always thought  her voice was wonderful and wish I could hear more from her. Enjoy the  comical Life Upon the Wicked Stage performed by a little girl and a bunch  of sordid "Ladies" of the evening. Adelaide's Lament by Faith  Prince has good comic timing as well. Also enjoy Rosie O'Donnell hamming it  up with Liza Minelli for Liza with a Z. My only complaint besides not  having Julie sing which I guess was impossible was the strange number  performed by a butch lady in men's clothes. I didn't get it and didn't  really enjoy it. Maybe I should get out more, but don't know what the song  was from and thought it quite weird. There is one other number I want to  call attention to and that is a trio of Andrew Lloyd Webber songs which is  quite good. Do wish they had let Rebecca sing more.

to "Two Against Nature." When I first heard it I felt that some of
  "Watercolors","Sanctuary" and "Water From The Moon" all embrace a meditative Latin fusion ballads which emphasize Rit's rich improvising ability on electric/acoustic guitar and the synthaxe which he's shown playing on the cover.  "The Sauce" and "Hero" both throw down some creamy,slick yet driving 80's style jazz-funk grooves. Most impressive is Herbie Hancock's "Butterfly",very much rhythmically abstracted from the original to have a strong new wave influence. I really cannot recommend highlights on this album because it contains nothing that's less than stellar. The most amazing thing about it all is not only how successful Rit is at being musically creative within the contemporary jazz idiom,but how he uses that idiom to represent the embodiment of diversity and futurism the Earth run stood for. And aside from the excellent quality of this album,a lot could be said about that by itself also.
Now, does anyone know where I  can get a copy of Aja?  Just kidding.

To watch Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, and kd lang (in a dress no less!) singing backup vocals, and Roy playing along with the likes of the Boss (Springsteen), a young Elvis Costello, and the other well-know musicians was pure magic. And folks, the piano player was the brother of a gal I went to college with. So it was joy and wonder to watch this awesome video.
If you like Roy Orbison, you will like this.  Are you a fan of Bruce Springsteen?  He's there, as is Jennifer Warnes - many other really outstanding musicians.  If you are not familiar with Orbison, know that he was very influential in the early days of rock, as many of the people you may have heard of, such as McCartney, Springsteen, etc. cite him as an influence.

So, to begin with, listeners are likely to reject  individual songs, like "The Dead Man's Dream," a Lovecraftian  horror tale of terrifying power, or "Barnyard Story," whose  closing quatrain has to be the most exquisite artistic expression of  suicidal depression in pop music history (if not all literature).

  13. He Touched Me
Two that were released by major labels and failed ro climb very high in spite of that backing were Life's Too Short by The Lafayettes - # 87 Hot 100 in July 1962 on RCA Victor, and Here I Stand by The Rip Chords - # 51 Hot 100 in April 1963 on Columbia.
The Lauper-Madonna "rivalry" in the 80s was mainly a media creation, but to the extent that it had any validity at all, what did it say about us a culture that the icy "material girl" beat out the one who really could sing and, moreover, exhibited a lot of heart?  I knew which one I would rather have a beer with, for sure.

This disc has one of George's best track lists, including  "Who Do You Love?" (popularized by many commercials--Sam Adams beer the most recent); George's signature Rock & Roll version of Hank Williams' (Senior) Country and Western classic 'Move it on Over'; the story-with-a-moral 'Cocaine Blues'; and another George favorite, 'Baby, Let's Set a Date'.
7891	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this CD when it was first released in 1994 and I have had a long time of listening pleasure to evaluate it now.  Why have I waited so long and why bother to review it now?  Sheer laziness to the first part and sheer awe to the second.  When an album sticks with you over a long period of time it must be good.  It hasn't been pushed to the back of the shelf or left in a drawer and suddenly re-discovered, it's just a really good album for America fans and great introduction and inspiration to new listeners.  Hopefully anyone who hears this album as a first introduction to America, will be inspired to go back and pick up one or two of their more famous "H" albums or their debut self-titled album.  America were often derided by the ill informed or the generally blasphemous music critics of the 70's, lauded as imitation performers in a soft rock genre of wanna-be rockers.  Those people were ignorant.  They had no idea that the bulk of America's string of hit albums in the 70's, seven in total, were all produced by The Beatles legendary George Martin and that his magical touches elevated three very talented young guitarist-vocalists to a level of near-perfect song-craft.  Bull-pucky I say to those castigating critics with no ear for tunefulness!  AMERICA ('71), HOMECOMING ('72), HOLIDAY ('74), HEARTS ('75), and HIDEAWAY ('76) were all tremendously well crafted ear-candy albums that you could play start to finish and nary find a wart anywhere upon them!

Smooth is just amazing, Maria Maria has a great urban feel, and the collabos with Everlast, Dave Matthews, and Eric Clapton really work well. I remember when I saw him perform at Jones Beach three summers ago -- this music was great then and its just as good now.

"Round Midnight" is the lone Columbia album that captures the sound, cohesion, and special interplay of the Prestige sessions, on which Miles made it clear that 2-beat need not be consigned to dixieland or society dance bands: it can be as cool, hip, and swinging as 4/4 walking bass time. Moreover, the notion that Coltrane didn't yet have his chops together on the Prestige dates is simply misleading: the "presence" of his sound, the energy, the inexhaustible melodic imagination should prove he was near or at the top of his game.  And Red Garland shows why he was and continues to be one of the most influential jazz pianists of all time (I know I've copied him more than any other pianist).

deeper and deeper
Back on topic, I don't own this CD, but I own all the albums the songs came off of.  They are all classic material.  Great, oldschool jams uncontaminated by blood-sucking A&Rs and silly, bandwagon trends.  My favorite thing though has always been Kool Moe Dee's excelent delivery.  I can't really think of anyone who flows thier voice with that amount of clarity, percision, and confidence.  He never sacrificed this when he was spit-firing his rhymes at blinding speed or flowing more slowly.  His MCing still stands out today among so many of the supposed premier MCs that came afterwards who mumbled their flows half-hazardly.  Much can also be said for his funky lyrics and wit.  This is hip hop that will stand the test of time.  When people go back and really study the history of hip hop, he will have a sizeable entry.  Hell, hes responsible for the first record credited as introducing technical rhymes, metaphors, and speedy delivery.
The percussion is what really stands out on this album.  There is a lot of intricate parts, but nothing that takes away from the songs focus.  Do yourself a favor, and try to drown all parts, but the drums to see what I mean.
6845	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This joyful album has it all.  Admiral Halsey is almost like a children tune, Long Haired Lady is pure romance and Ram On is Paul in an acoustic setting produced yet like he's in outer space.  It is worthwhile listening to the opener, Too Many People, and study the "FCK the Beatles" picture on the sleeve.  Paul was not only having fun but was also being extremely funny.
Very interesting to find out which nuclear physicist they engaged to decide how to split the profits among the legions of artistes involved though but overall, a great album that's worth having in any music-lover's collection.

The band's third full-length is another great cd, and is a breath of fresh air thanks to all the critics who said they had that "NOFX sound" on their first two outtings.  Some time off has led to a different sound than their past two albums.  The real stand-outs here are "Violins", "Move the Car", "Sleep", "Sick", "Razor Burn"...I might as well name all the tracks, huh?  Definitely worth your hard earned money.

The booklet is quite avantgarde with Bowie photographed in different poses in strange outfits that look very New Wave. All the lyrics are included and we get a personnel list that list whom and what they play on the album. 4/5.
Until a comprehensive collection like that is done, you still have the Video Collection 93:99 to give you a fix. And still there's the glaring, practically criminal omission of Erotica, Deeper and Deeper and the infamous Justify My Love. More importantly, however, the DVD justifies and cements the notion once and for all, that Madonna is the master of the video art form.

Girlfriend is one of those rare albums that does not have a bad song.  It perfectly blends a mixture of hard rock, pop rock and ballad.  From the rocking title song 'Girlfriend' to the deeply emotional songs like 'I Thought I Knew You' and 'Don't Go'this album runs the gammit of emotion, but still has room to have some fun with songs like 'Does She Talk?'
P.S. The company should have  provided subtitles(lyrics) for foreigners like me.
I love these videos, but I am mad that "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", "You'll See", "Deeper and Deeper", "Erotica", "Justify My Love" "This Used To Be My Playground" and others are not featured here. Madonna did the samething on her first Video Collection (Leaving "Burning Up", "Live To Tell", "Crazy For You", "Who's That Girl?" and others off. Hopefully she will release a COMPLETE video collection.
Get a copy and listen to it in traffic or on a train.
The band is terrific, too. If the names Lee Sklar (bass), Russ Kunkle (drums) and Danny Kortchmar (guitar) ring any bells, it's because just about every Cali-Rock album though the early 70's on had their playing. They have only gotten clearer and cleaner with time, and the recording is well honed by their considerable skills (although there's too much high end in this CD for my tastes). Despite that, "Live At The Troubadour" is one of the most enjoyably pleasant CD's I've bought this year.
I have owned this when it was a gift given to me on vinyl. Yes before, it was retro.
The first video in this collection is the stunning "Human Behaviour." This was Bjork's first video as a solo artist from 1993, and it sure makes an impact. The song is a look at humans from an animal's point of view. Bjork is singing the lyrics, which already suggests she is an animal - apart from the crowd and very much her own creation. Directed by Michael Gondry, we see Bjork in the woods with a giant teddy bear searching for food. The bear is also being hunted by a hunter in the woods. The bear chases after Bjork as well, but she outwits him. The woods are used as a metaphor for the human psyche; Bjork as the animal is lost in the woods, which represent the complex and dark characters of a human being. In the video to "Venus As A Boy," Bjork carefully fondles an egg while explicitly singing about copulation. This video is rather strange and a bit boring in my opinion, but there's a deeper meaning at work here. This video is quite funny, though, as Bjork thinks about a guy she admires, carefully observing the egg being fried. This video juxtaposes implicity with explicity. Brilliant.

I cannot argue with the blurb on the box about this being Yes at their peak and with their greatest line-up of all time, but the sound and picture quality of this DVD are extremely disappointing.

Live In New York, or "Zappa In New York" is an amazing record, long and short. And where most live records do a little repair in post-production to hide bum notes, and beef the sound up a little, then not tell the consumer, this product, if you will, tells you where augmentations have been utilized, and why. But still, if you gold-plate a dog turd, it will still be a dog turd. Not the case here. Frank Zappa's band, at the end of 1976, played some shows in New York City, and we are fortunate to have this document; it sounds fantastic. Detractors cite crass, mysogenistic song titles and lyrics, and there is a case to be made here, I guess, but ol' Frank just did what his audiences got into - he delivered the goods. The opening track, about female mammalia and malted beverages, has a little something to offend everyone who decides to be offended by a somewhat funny song, but it is actually a very sophisticated piece of modern Vaudville entertainment. The band unapologetically chugs along while Frank has a staged showdown with the Prince of Darkness, portrayed by one Terry Bozzio donning a rubber mask while drumming and singing. He multitasks all through the show, playing from sheet music (how many drummers do this?) as he contributes lead and backing vocals all through these shows.
Pulse is the best music/light show concert that you will ever see.
I feel that given Lennon's wicked sense of humor,that these three records are probably more of a put-on to all the Beatlemanics,art critics,music industry boffos,etc.

The swooping guitars are awesome and yet subtle and fill a crucial spot in the intro melody. The guitar solo is masterful. Much of the time in the solo is taken up with only a few sustained and repeated notes and the bulk of the solo is made up of bends, trills, swoops, dives, and inventive tremelos. Each note of the minimal note count speaks out to us in important ways. It reminds me of lyrics that say volumes with only a few words. It's one of my all time favorite guitar solos.
Susannah was particularly good at putting her own interpretation on old classics. Her version of the Bing Crosby/Andrews sisters song Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive is given a completely different arrangement to the original - a wise move, as Susannah could never swing like Bing, Patty, Maxene and LaVern.

  There is one other important factor in Wilson's legacy.

There tended to be a perception that an artist would make their money out of public appearance on movies,TV and touring. While they were out on the road often enough though,many of them were actually having their publishing rights manipulated by different people such as managers and producers. This meant that when the day was done,someone else owned the music they made. It's an age old story. But considering the debilitated state Jackie was in at the time of his death,there's a lot of injury added to insult. However in songs like "Night",taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samson-And-Delilah/dp/B00819EQR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samson And Delilah</a>&nbsp;Jackie brings his own vocal expression to a song a lot of rhythm & blues and soul fans will likely consider to be very corny sounding to them. Generally speaking I shy away from reviewing compilation albums. In the case of this era,each song on a single were crafted as a statement of their own. And that gives them important musically historic value on a set such as this one. Though many reviewers place Jackie Wilson under the banner of rock n roll,that was at first only a blanket term used by Alan Freed to describe rhythm & blues. So I am not going to deny any further what this music is. It's first generation R&B at it's finest. And just for pointing the way towards the classic Chicago soul sound and even Motown,these songs more than serve their purpose as they are.
This could have easily been released in the 70's and  their sound would have fit right in yet it stands as a great piece of work  today nearly 20 years later. Such is the timeless nature of Steely Dan that  will win new fans, and thoroughly delight old fans as well!

The quality is actually better than I expected it to be. I would give it 5 stars except for it's a bit short.  It is at least 4 stars, however, and well worth owning.

"Ram On" is a veiled reference to McCartney himself. Paul Ramon was one of the many pseudonyms McCartney used for himself while a member of The Beatles in his youth. "Eat at Home" celebrates the domestic bliss that Lennon would be celebrated for on his last great album "Double Fantasy". Paul was just a bit ahead of the times here. "Smile Away", "Dear Boy" (another supposed veiled dig at Lennon) both are stand outs as well. The former has a nice funky beat, the latter is McCartney on piano with some stunning backing vocals and a sharp, tricky arrangement.
In fact, although this is supposed to be a Christmas album, I find I can listen to it year 'round (as I am right now and it's August 31st).

Altogether whether you are a Dead Head or like me a casual fan of the group this is an outstanding DVD to have of the Grateful Dead performing live.

This is singlehandedly my favorite album of all time.  Where 'Undertow'  was just an excellent alt-rock album, 'Aenima' is in a class of it's own.  It's epic, it's brilliant.  The lyrics are incredibly deep and beautiful.  The music is incredibly powerful and goes straight to your head.  Maynard's  voice is too good to be true.  I think Tool gets a bad rep because they are  usually grouped with all these lame nu-metal bands.  If you've passed up  this incredible band because of their fanbase, you're missing out.  The  lyrics are very ambiguous but the personal interpretations you can get out  of them could change your life.  Please do yourself a favor and buy one of  the best albums of the 90's if not one of the best albums ever.

Mott the Dog.
* `Where the Streets Have No Name' = the very track that's used for its movie trailer (included on the dvd) where the band is seen entering the stage (and the first shot to bring the concert footages in colour) presented in slow motion for the trailer; and also there's the live rendition of their chart topper `With Or Without You'; plus their epic ballad from the same JOSHUA TREE album `Running To Stand Still', and a great heavier rock live rendition of 'In God's Country' against it's atmospherical country-ish studio version which appeared in the said album.
I own a copy of this band playing a gig around the time this album came out, and the band was absolutely perfect. King Cockroach will always be my favorite. And India Town has one of those distinctive melodies.

3. Rock n' Roll With Me

6823	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This album is a good Paul solo work, with a lot of contribution from Linda.  The opening cut, "Too Many People" was written as an acerbic poke at John and Yoko.  John answered back on the "Imagine" release, "How Do You Sleep", where he taunts Paul and Linda, and even posed holding a pig by the ears as another shot at Paul holding the ram by the horns on the cover of this release.  There is some bare bones work like the cute rocker "Smile Away", with Paul and Linda background vocals as well.  There was the single "Admiral Halsey" with its layered production and dissimilar song parts patched together.  "Ram On" is a melodic tune that is an almost incomplete melody that appears in two different parts of the release.  "Three Legs" is a strange song that sounds like it could use some additional work.  "Heart Of the Country" is a nice tune with a catchy chorus and some interesting guitar work between Paul and Hugh McCraken, especially on the middle break.  "Monkberry Moon Delight" has some powerful vocals by Paul, who shows a rawer side.  "Long Haired Lady" is another strange love song to Linda, with many mood changes.  "Back Seat of My Car" is lovely melody that suffers from too many theme changes and some over production.  In all, this is a good disk, but not the best of the Paul solo/Wings releases.


And what Tool see is dark and engrossing as it is beautiful and liberating.

Second glimmer:  I give the CD a little more airtime in my world and discover that the first four songs ("Divine Intervention", "Waiting", "Girlfriend", and "Looking at the Sun") are about as strong, musically and lyrically, as anything I've heard from the Beatles or Stones or Van or Bob Zimmerman or ANYBODY.  And who are these guitarists?  Oh, just Richard Lloyd and Robert Quine...maybe in the Top Ten of post-Elvis Stratocaster heroes (Scotty Moore, ya know I love ya).

Listen to Standage-Pinnock with the English Concert, so much more satisfying with the solo violin in proper relationship with the other musicians, and even a bass line that can be followed throughout the performance. One of Archiv's better recording-balancing efforts.  Standage has a magnificant instrument from which he extracts a wonderful sound on most of the work he records.
Its definitely going to be at the forefront of this years contention for best album in my own little world. Whats great about it is the constructed mix of Rock, Piano, and raw emotion. No, this is rock, not emo... but I could stop right here and in about three minutes write about three pages on the definition of emo and how it isn't just a genre, because emo transitions into every genre...

All the performances are great; my favorites are probably Don't Cross The River, Moon Song, Rainbow Song, and California Revisited.  Listen for Dewey Bunnell's unique introductory guitar licks in Tin Man.  And the fake crowd noise following Windwave gives a sense of the band members' playfulness.  You'll enjoy the musicianship throughout.  Even if you're not a die-hard America fan, this DVD is wonderful for anyone who likes this band.
  The title track is about a lost Vietnam Vet with no support from a government he fought for.  "I'm on Fire" is another good haunting passionate track.  And of course the big hit was "Dancing in the Dark".  Get this album for a piece of rock history and know there is another America that has nothing to do with Bush/Cheney's version.

1431	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	If Orson Welles had been in the prime of his career in the early 1980's, he may very well have been the lead anchor in "Special Bulletin", an homage to Welles' classic, panic-inducing "War of the Worlds" that has been updated for the nuclear age.  The basic premise surrounds the news coverage by the fictional RBS network of a tense standoff in a harbor in Charleston, South Carolina, between authorities and domestic terrorists aboard a tugboat.  What is it the terrorists want?  Through the use of the news crew they took hostage, they insist on a forum to air their demands.  Specifically, the United States government must disarm all nuclear weapon devices in the Charleston area and bring the detonating devices to the tug boat where the terrorists will take them out to see and dispose of them.  If their demands are not met, they will EXPLODE A NUCLEAR BOMB that they have on board to boat!!  They give until 4:30 pm the day after the initial skirmish to meet their demands, or the bomb will detonate at 6 pm.  The news coverage proceeds very much like one would expect during such a crisis, complete with speculation on if the threat was real, press conferences on the government's reaction, scientific analysis of the effect of the bomb if it explodes, and biographies and psychoanalyses of the terrorists. In fact, the coverage was so authentic that local television affiliates were flooded with calls from panicky Charleston residents who wanted to know if this was really happening (in spite of constant disclaimers that this was not an actual event).  The tension truly begins to mount as the deadline draws close and there still has been no word on if the government with adhere to the demands.  Just after the first deadline passes, the government announces that they will be sending all the detonators to the tugboat.  As the terrorists cheer the approach of the trucks that supposedly carry the detonators, there video feed in the tugboat is knocked off-line to conceal the team of Special Forces commandos boarding from the other side of the ship.  A brief, but fierce, firefight ensues, leaving the terrorists either dead or captured.  With the boat now secure, it is up to the nuclear bomb squad to disarm the weapon before it detonates.  Alas, as the final deadline grows closer, they trip one of the anti-tamper devices and the bomb explodes.  It's a truly horrifying moment caught on tape that leaves one feeling as though they just witnessed a huge atrocity.  In the aftermath of 9/11, such a film is even more chilling.  "Special Bulletin" is an excellent cautionary tale of the effects of the news media, terrorism, and the nuclear threat all rolled together.
"Hourglass," is the perfect companion piece. The opening song starts with a haunting Santanta type riff with a song titled, "Young Moon," and it's one of those songs that a person listens to once, and then they can't stop singing it through out the day.

There is a great live cd "Unshaven: Live At Smith's Olde Bar" that chonicles many of these tunes and captures the ferocity of Shaver live. I had the chance to see Shaver live in 1998 at a club in Houston, Texas. What energy and verve these guys displayed!!! Billy Joe came out into the audience after the show and I even chatted with him a minute or two. I told him I was from Alabama and that Texas had a Montgomery and Huntsville within 25 miles of each other, much like two of Alabama's four largest cities. He mentioned he had lived in both Huntsvilles and I asked him how it felt living near the 'death chamber'. Billy said the Alabama version of Huntsville provoked death more than the Texas one because 'you die from the rocket fumes'. The guy is like meeting your next door neighbor or something; no pretense whatsoever. Perhaps this kept him from being the 'household name' he deserves to be because he does not have a 'stars air' to him. I like to believe it makes him more remarkable and loved by the fans because 'he is what he is' on his records! The girldfriend wasn't bad, either LOL!
It's far from a perfect movie, but for a modest production, it is quite ambitious and accomplished a lot.

Wasted Time (Reprise)
Sweat is a great opener, an acid inspired hard rocker with killer double kick courtesy of one Danny Carey... the bridge features Tool thrashing out, something to behold. Hush is a short and funk influenced song with hilarious lyrics railing against censorship... I wish they'd pull this one out live more often. Part of Me is perhaps my least favorite one on Opiate... maybe Tool's heaviest song, with lots of rapid fire double bass and stacatto timing.

As a result his voice is almost unrecognisable in comparison to STP's earliest records; his voice has a much regenerated sound. And it's obvious when listening to Contraband that a lot of the vocals are looped, seeming to suggest Weiland can't burst out those vocals consistently. Teamed alongside the old GnR crew, we get Velvet Revolver. Unfortunately VR sound more like a tribute band to either STP or GnR. But the album will still hit at least four times platinum, will have big hits in the charts, will be popular...but for the wrong reasons. For the band members pasts, they will be so popular.

One song that sounds like her later work is `Come Here Boy' and this is a standout track on the album. This album had plenty of her unique song writing and vocals that existing fans will enjoy and even at this stage you could tell that originality suffused every aspect of her music. As a stand alone album this is pretty impressive but if you come to this after hearing some of Imogen's later work you may be slightly disappointed; but there is no need really as this offers up some top tunes and shows the development of this underrated and unique artist.

6431	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Madman Across The Water" is perhaps Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's most creative musical and lyrical output, when compared with their other stellar early '70's albums for a number of reasons. For instance, "MATW"'s two opening tracks, "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in "Levon"). "Tiny Dancer" was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes "Madman..." a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy "Holiday Inn". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, "Honky Chateau", was released the following year in 1972. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of "MATW"'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as "Razor Face", he pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwraught "All The Nasties". Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of "Honky Chateau". The CD's title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan "suspensful down your spine chills and thrills", courtesy of "Madman's..." intense lyrical and orchestral jinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in "Indian Sunset", as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dwelled amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, wouldn't you say?). The lyrics of "Rotten Peaches" would focus on the sad sack trial and tribulation nature found in a majority of Elton's and Bernie's musical and lyrical compositions in future albums as well. For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders wouldn't have it any other way, including yours truly. "Goodbye" is a fitting end to the CD's macabre, storybook-like novella. "Madman Across The Water" is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s). Aren't you just "dying" to have this title in your Elton John library right about now?

If you don't own this music in any form, buy this first, because you will get a clearer sense of what the artist intended to do.

This new remastered edition improves just about everything about the sound. Less "tizz," a more natural midrange, a sense of space around the individual instruments and voices. You could say it sounds more like an analog recording now. This is noticeable even when listening to the CD played back from the computer on headphones. An audiophile system will do more justice to the reproduction, of course.
The set is interesting it begins with "I've Got My Eyes On You" (A tune Buddy wrote with Willie Dixon at Chess) from his early days in the 1960s. You can see a very good Black and White film clip of this tune with young Buddy really getting into it in Rhino's Blues Masters Vol 2 DVD. Buddy also gets in to it here and even breaks a string. He switches polk-a-dot strats (this design on Guy's signature start comes from his mother's dress pattern) from Black to Red it's edited look for it! Later in the set he returns to the black axe. "Sweet Black Angel" is of course the risque Blues standard made famous by Robert Nighthawk and others in the 1940s and 50s. "Talk To Me Baby" another well known tune done by Sam Lay and others. See Sam Lay do this tune on the Martin Scorsese series "The Blues" in the "Fathers and Sons" film at the Chicago Blues Festival.

Sales plummeted,  fans defected, I held onto my wallet and stopped buying Zappa albums. The  music became complex for its own sake-and less enjoyable.

3708	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	"The Videos 86>98" documents Depeche Mode's visual history from 1986-1998.  It has promotional videos for each single released during this era, and it also boasts a documentary featuring interviews with Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher, Alan Wilder (who was with the Mode from 1982-95), and Dave Gahan, along with producer Flood, manager/producer Daniel Miller, and photographer Anton Corbijn.  He's not only the band's photographer, but he also manages the band's entire visual output.  In addition to directing 18 of their videos, he's also done much of their album artwork, as well as stage design for the band's tour for the "Songs of Faith and Devotion" LP.  Having said all that, this DVD is as much Corbijn's as it is Depeche Mode's.  Anton's dark, grainy imagery nicely compliments the mood of Depeche Mode's synth-based music, from the Western-themed "Personal Jesus," to "A Question of Time," to "Walking in My Shoes," to "In Your Room."  But that doesn't mean Corbijn dominates the entire DVD.  A few promotional clips directed by outsiders also stand out; the best of which is "Only When I Lose Myself," helmed by Brian Griffin.  This double DVD set comes with another disc of goodies that weren't included in the now-obsolete single-DVD version of "The Videos 86>98."  Four promotional clips are also included: "But Not Tonight" (a dated, but fun video that has scenes from the 1980's film "Modern Girls"), "One Caress," another version of "Condemnation," and an alternative version of "Strangelove."  In addition, we have three documentaries promoting "Violator," "Songs of Faith and Devotion" and "Ultra."  The first two are filmed by Corbijn, and they're both quite interesting, especially the one for "Devotion," in which we watch a goateed, rail-thin Gahan give his $.02 on the band and the making of the album.  Fletcher, Wilder, and Gore also contribute their thoughts, but it's songwriter Gore who provides the most insight and depth.  So, if you have the single-disc DVD, should you make the upgrade and get this double disc version?  That depends on how much you like the Mode. Casual fans should probably stick with the single-disc DVD, but diehards like myself will enjoy the three documentaries on the second disc, so it's worth revisiting this very fine DVD of one of my favorite groups around.

After his somewhat juvenile attempt at a solo start with "McCartney," Paul decided to get serious and get some seasoned session men who could flesh out his ripe melodies and riffs.  It was the best idea this project had.
The standout songs are the first and the last. While "Stinkfist" is a deeply touching emotional rollercoaster, "Third Eye" is an atmospheric, surreal journey through a jungle of sounds. "Pushit" is also very important and the most progressive song we find on this album.

Low caught me completely off guard. Early industrial came to mind. Then, ambient soundscapes, then...well, I just gave up trying to put a label on everything. It was all just so unique and different, nothing I had ever heard had really touched upon this particular type of sound. The instrumentals, Speed of Life, A New Career in a New Town, and Art Decade seemed so claustrophobic and yet, so expansive at the same time. The seemingly suicidal despair of Breaking Glass, Always Crashing in the Same Car (great titles!), and Subterranians seemed so comforting at the same time. Finally, this was an album with genuine angst, not the commercialized  angst force fed by record companies through bands like Korn, Slipknot, or Blink 182. As far as I'm concerned, there's no better album than Low to throw you into the pit of despair, then pulling you out again by actually enabling you to meditate and move on.

"Pretty Maids All In A Row" is somewhat reminiscent of Joe Walsh's work on his first (and best) solo album, 1973's Barnstorm. "Pretty Maids," like most of Barnstorm, is a nice deviation from Walsh's more well-known guitar rave-ups. It was written with Barnstorm-mate Joe Vitale, and has a dreamy, richly-textured production, utilizing piano (Walsh) and synthesizer (Walsh & Glenn Frey). It also has some nice percussion work from Henley and, as usual, heavenly background harmonies.

The Low End Theory saw the conversion of Quest from a typical Native Tongues group on People's Instinctive Paths to having their own distinct, mature flavor.  Thankfully, A Tribe Called Quest continue in the same vein and to great results.  Their laid back, liquid smooth production again meshes perfectly with the rhymes of Q-Tip and Phife and both MCs prove again that they are rap's Dynamic Duo.  If any doubts about Phife skills existed at this time, they were dismissed as Phife proves that he can hold his own against the best.

Until RYCODISC's CD version came out around '96, the only way a person could hear the album as Frank had intended was if one could get ahold of the recording of this famous broadcast.

6. Fall to Pieces - It's a picture of the honest, painful journey that Scott took through drug addiction.  This song is a little risky because while shorter, it is structured in a similar way to Sweet Child O' Mine.
Let's get this clear from the beginning. The Trans-Siberian Orchestra comes from Savatage and oddly enough there are still some people who are not aware of this as the origin point f the group. The signature piece of this Metal Ensemble entitled "Christmas Eve Sarajevo" first appeared on the Savatage CD "Dead Winter Dead". The tune stood out on the CD back then and also received a large amount of airplay on stations that would never play the music of Savatage in the first place. The music of 1996 was very steeped in the "alternative" movement and hard rock music was seldom heard and looked to die a quiet death. Clearly this track would prove another road could be taken with heavy music.

U2 fans will buy this video no questions asked; casual fans may want to get ZOO TV: Live From Sydney first because of the latter's glorious picture quality.
In short this is a wonderful production from start to end.

Second, when or if he let his music be re-recorded, he asked from the artist attempting to sing it that it be sung for him before it be recorded.

8871	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the more bizarre records in popular music. The original release was four sides of vinyl, covering many genres and styles. The CD is expanded to include a long sequence from the film, the official release, and outtake sequences, which isn't really necessary, but it does help put the concept of the finished film into context. Despite the rambling nature of the complete release, if you listen to it in its entirety, you do have a sense of going on a journey through sound, compliments of contemporary music's true pioneers, the Mothers Of Invention. Even though Frank Zappa was the group's spear-head, it becomes obvious that this particular group's sound and image were unique, even in the Zappa catalogue. At the time, he needed these musicians, however much he may have since said otherwise, and I don't believe this would have the sound, mood, and appearance that it has if other players were involved. Proof of this would be one of the tracks on the later release, "Tengo Na Minchia." Not the original band, and there is a night-and-day difference between this and the rest of the soundtrack. I am one of the world's biggest fans of FZ and The Mothers, but I think he messed with an ideal-sounding and ideally-paced release by including this. Just an opinion.

But for what the members of Velvet Revolver excel at, "Contraband" has few equals. "Headspace" and "Big Machine" make glam rock relevant in the new century, as well as having fab solos. "Slither" is the kind of Heavy Metal that Audioslave promised but never delivered. "Loving The Alien" even cops to Bowie. I really hope that the elements that comprise Velvet Revolver can hold their stability long enough to make a second album that ups the quality of the lyrics and can also resist the temptation to play the compromise card.

Much like Joel Osteen as a preacher, Smith has the perceptive wisdom to illuminate that our hearts are wounded in life's ordeals and need some perspective to sort things out.  We are cajolled to continue as weary pilgrims on the title track; then encouraged not to lose heart on the truly ethereal "Calling Heaven".  Truly effective, he has the goods to diagnose the problem with existence ("Cry for Love") and relationships ("Breakdown").  Then, he offers heavenly consolation ("I'll Be Around" and "Someday")  Yet, once he presents an understanding God, he presents praising the Lord as our ultimate remedy ("As It Is in Heaven" and "Crown Him with Many Crowns")  As is typical of Michael W. Smith, he leaves his congregation with a message that comes from God in the first person (an attribute he takes on so well with the inspirational invitation of "I'm Waiting for You").

With the loss of their bassist Paul D'amour it's surprising that in 3 years, after the release of Undertow, the band can put together such a masterpiece. I love every single track on the album including my all time favorite "Pushit". The progressive nature of this album shows the detail the band puts into their work. Each track has its own truly unique sound. The progressiveness in nima can be shown by how tracks are linked together with segue's making it one big song. Some may call these "filler" tracks but personally I think they just add to the music. Tool is about atmosphere and that is definitely what this cd is comprised of. My song ratings are below... (Excluding segue's)
To this very day I fail to understand why Capitol Records put "Beware My Love" on as a B-side to "Let Em In." That song could have stood on its own as an A-side and a rock n roll hit. As a B-side I don't remember it getting any airplay, not even on album rock stations, which is a shame since this classic rock song will fit in any AOR format.

Exquisitely produced by Alligator Records, Roy gets a chance to stretch out and show what he can do with a guitar.  On the opening track, he tries to make his guitar sound like a church organ, it seems, and he almost pulls it off ! The one thing about Roy Buchanan is his singing voice : it just doesn't do the trick.  Often he just seems to say the lyrics as opposed to sing them.  He brings in a couple of guests to sing on a few tracks, and these add further to the unease about Roy's own voice.  His guitar playing is tops, though ! Listen to tracks like "Mrs. Pressure" (his former guitar teacher ! What's in a name ?) or "Sneaking Godzilla through the alley" (great title !) and be convinced.  This is the first of 3 albums Roy made for Alligator, and they seemed to set him on the track to greater recognition.  Sadly, though, all came to an end when he was arrested one night for being drunk in a public place and took his own life in his cell.  A sad end to a great guitar-player's life.

If you want to hear these songs the way they were meant to be sung, there are plenty of better singers.  If you want to hear Carly Simon doing what she does best, put on "No Secrets."
There are 'mystery' backing vocals, provided by no-one present on stage. The close ups of Fogerty are always cut off prematurely, as if they didn't want you to notice that the lip synch wasn't quite in synch. It is very disturbing to watch, because you get the feeling that someone is pulling a fast one. It seems to me as if a lot (if not all) of this 'concert' was re-recorded or dubbed-over to gloss over the rough spots and present the band in a more favorable light. And that aint right!
The lyrics don't make a whole lot of sense to the average guy. Reading and listening to them, I was struck by how much I can relate to them. However one line in the song ("Rocket b**ch is blasting off") seems like a rehash of a line in the STP song "Hollywood B**ch" ("Blow up the b**ch with the firecracker smile.")
  3) MAN, THIS GUY IS ANGRY. I mean this guy makes your average angst rocker sound like that guy from linkin park. That and the lyrics, though very well thought out, are pretty dark (Example: me and him [god] both have our desires. WE both want to rape you! from opiate). Alhtough if your reading this review I doubt you care, especially if your a huge tool fan, just I wouldnt reccomend showing the this to the sensitive ( siblings, offspring, ect.). Like another reviewer said this is not a safe album.

It's all here. Directed by Spielberg acolyte Phil Joanou, this film captures the electric dynamic that U2 is able to establish with its audience during its on-stage performance as well as some cut-in 'behind-the-scenes' footage depicting the band in everyday situations. This is some of the best concert footage ever shot IMHO (and I've seen Led Zeppelin's 'The Song Remains the Same' movie many times, as well as Pink Floyd, etc.).
After "White Heat", Madonna decides to go to her WHO'S THAT GIRL songs, by starting off with the film's opening song, "Causing A Commotion". Great performance here.

This is disturbing pop...beautiful madness.  This is a great album.  This CD with the original 11 tracks is very good, but I prefer the RYCO version with the two bonus tracks (if you can find it).  Five Stars.
The opening chart-topping title track contains one of the greatest dual guitar solos of all time with Felder and Walsh alternating ala Clapton and Allman and the song itself is a treat about a state of mind called Southern California as it was in the 70s. The first chart-topping single "New Kid In Town" follows and harkened back to the early Eagles sound and tells the story of fame and failure and knowing them as impostors that they are sung by Glenn Frey. The hard rocking Top 20 hit "Life In The Fast Lane" is next and brings Walsh's guitar riff together with biting lyrics from Henley and Frey about excess and self-destruction. The first half ends with the classic "Wasted Time", which slowed things down again and is a great Philadelphia-soul sounding ballad about a good person in a bad relationship with a beautiful Philadelphia-soul sound type string arrangement.

The show is great: over half of their last great album ("A Song For You") and their last GREAT tenor (Glenn Leonard) and their last year with Dennis from his first stay with the group.  It is the end of an era with the Tempts and with R&B singing overall, as disco and white rock dominate to excess.  Dennis sings "Memories" near then end and I can just hear him also saying his actual goodbyes to the group and fans as well.  The group is very jumpy and disco-y, but they still have that magical precision and class.  Otis even sings well - twice!  And the cutaways to the "beautiful" German girls are hilarious - they are all horses.  Only one dude in the whole audience was moving to the music.  But they did clap a lot!
Elsewhere, hearing and seeing this live performance of "Close To The Edge" was quite refreshing, and sits quite nicely with the studio version. The opening was melodic and mesmerizing, although there were some parts in the beginning where you couldn't see the bandmembers, due to some of the art collages. This may annoy some viewers as this appears in other places during the performance, particularly during the third movement, "I Get Up, I Get Down." It was almost like magic witnessing Rick Wakeman, wearing his glowing silver cape, playing that soaring synthesizer lead before the crashing rhythm section jumps in to close out that third movement.
Trust me....this is worth your time.
From the very fist note of the very first track, "Well May The World Go", you know that you are encircled by magic . . .and the magic remains mesmerizing track after track after track through this experience.

This falls short of 5 because there's nothing innovating and different. Slash, Duff and company are solid, but I expected something a little edgier and dirty. That's small and forgettable stuff though. Guitar solos were mainly on point, but short of making an idiot of myself as if I was playing the guitar.

914	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Like a lot of people, I had been eagerly waiting for this CD for months.  I was so excited when I finally bought it, plus it was only 10 bucks.  Anyway, I had heard some of the songs on VH1.com, and had already heard "Set Me Free" and "Slither".  On first listen, I was disappointed...a lot.  That was June 8th.  It's now June 26th and I've listened to it everyday since.  I love it.  The only song I tend to skip over is "Spectacle", the rest are amazing.  My personal favorites are "Do It for the Kids", "Fall to Pieces", "Headspace", "Set Me Free", "You Got No Right", "Slither", "Dirty Little Thing", and "Loving the Alien" (a beautiful song).  It's a fantastic album, it really is.  Scott Weiland sounds better and stronger than he ever did with STP (except maybe for Core).  I never knew much about GNR, but those guys sound very strong, Slash especially.  Duff sounds good and Matt is a very good drummer, he hits hard, but knows when to bring it down a notch.  Dave Kushner is usually mentioned as an afterthought, but he really plays well and complements Slash; he has some cool noises coming out.  If you liked STP's first album, Core (for the singing) and the instrumentation of Guns N' Roses, you'll probably like Contraband, I sure do.

The 1999 album, Supernatural features acclaimed duets with some of the biggest acts in the music industry, like Rob Thomas of the group Matchbox 20, Eric Clapton, Everlast, and Dave Matthews. Although the songs are mostly in a foreign tongue, the acclaimed duets like Put Your Lights on with Everlast, Maria Maria, and Smooth, all became a huge part of Pop culture. Nobody could've ever imagined this in a lifetime, not even the "Corporate Pop" industry of acts like Britney Spears and NSYNC.

The album fearures such incredible hit songs as "Smooth," "Maria, Maria" and "Corazon Espinada" each of which are just totally entrancing and beautifully melodic.  The song "Corazon Espinada" is particularly Santana at his most creative.  "Corazon Espinada" literally means "Spined or Stabbed Heart."  Clearly, Santana is talking about his Heart being stabbed and all the 'Pain that LOVE brings!"  Truly all audiophiles should own a copy of "Supernatural" by Santana.

After getting a rundown on this band, I wasn't sure if I'd like them or not so I orders Beethoven's Last Night and was totally, and I DO mean totally, blown away.  So I ordered the other 3 TSO CDs despite them being Christmas music.  When I first listened to Christmas Eve and Other Stories, I was again immediately blown away.  This is the 2nd TSO CD I've listened to and I am awe struck.  The story this CD tells is one of beauty.  It's very touching and like Beethoven's Last Night, it can bring a tear to your eye.  But I have a heart for children anyway.  The orchestration, vocals, lyrics all seem to complement each other.  The finishing touch on this CD is the children's choir.  Despite this being a Christmas CD, it doesn't matter what time of year you listen to this.  In my opinion, it's a beautiful story set at Christmas time.  I would definately highly recommend this, an all of TSO's music to anyone.  I wasn't a fan until the first listen to Beethoven's Last Night.  Then I was hooked.  If you haven't heard any of TSO's music before and you want the experience of a lifetime, buy this (or any TSO) CD.  It's best to sit and listen to each one from beginning to end with no interruptions.  Read the story in the enclosed booklet, then play the CD and follow along.  It's guaranteed to touch you.

A couple and their kids (one being a teenager) go to visit friends way out in the English countryside during the Christmas/New Year's holiday. Things start off well enough but one and then more of the younger children seem to start getting sick. It's not obvious right away but as the illness progresses and spreads the kids start getting more uncontrollable, and what, at first glance, seems to be accidents happening in their presence turns into outright hostility and killing.

"Penguin In Bondage" is actually based on a clever and humorous take on the blues style in both the vocal melody and guitar solo.  It's a weird song.  I sure wish that guitar solo was longer, though.  It needs an additional two minutes to make it even MORE exciting for sure.  "Pygmy Twylyte" follows it up.  It's basically a fairly normal song when you consider just how outrageous Zappa's whacky ideas are usually like.

I've purchased both the Blu-Ray & DVD editions from Amazon's British website and viewed both on my 54" plasma T.V. and can assure you that the Blu-Ray disc's picture is dramatically superior to the DVD edition, even if Blu-Ray makes the film grain more visible(the concert was filmed under low-light conditions).

Becker and Fagen produced some of the finest rock (and jazz-rock) of their generation, and now the kiddies weaned on the Thompson Twins up to the Backstreet Boys can see and hear what real musicianship and songwriting/lyrical talent can produce!!  Every song is a keeper.  And the depth of talent in their band would make any musician sit up and take notice.  Makes just about any other rock act pale in comparison.  Steely Dan is all about susbstance over style -- musicianship (and humor) over showmanship.  They didn't need flashpots, elaborate stage lighting, dancers, or any other gimmicks to sell out their 2000 tour.  And for you young non-believers out there, read "Naked Lunch" to discover the source of the band's name.  Maybe that touch of naughtiness will entice you to at least give this band a listen.

  Bill Hicks mercilessly went after soulless musicians, lying politicians and demagogues, wife beaters, those who exploited their fame for cheap ad money, and most of all, ourselves. But while Bill both spoke of how he couldn't stand mankind, but always maintained hope for a world where people would put down their arms and egos and unite. That will be Bill Hick's legacy and it speaks louder today than ever before. And it is almost 11 years since Bill Hicks passed on.
9173	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Frankly, I think I wore the LP out in my youth, and the appeal of the CD is lost on me, even as I can claim Donaggio's previous DON'T LOOK NOW (1973) as one of my five favorite film scores of all time.  I can still  hear why I was mesmerized way back when. Donaggio's score IS adolescent  angst in a Herrmann/classical/pop vein, and he does this well.  I was never  extremely fond of Katie Irving's breathy vocals, but the title tune could  have been a smash country and western ballad if someone in Marketing had  possessed that insight at the time.  Donaggio's gone on to score about a  hundred fair-to-middlin' Italian scores, and some bombastic ones for  DePalma (BLOW OUT - far too saccharine and BODY DOUBLE - well, I love the  Minnie Mouse-doing-the-Eurodisco-streap-tease song).  In my maturity he  seems a little over-the-top, but he did seduce me into a world of feelings  and impressions previously unavaible to a teenager, and for this I remain  grateful.  Film score purists will be better directed to his Italian  output, such as OLTRE LA PORTA, and his lovely western score, AMORE PIOMBO  E FURORE (Love, Bullets and Fury), which contains a dynamite vocal by  legendary wild woman/Cajun, Ronee Blakely, and, of course, the haunting  DON'T LOOK NOW.
You then may wonder why I don't rate "Lather" a five star album. Maybe I should, but in my opinion (don't shoot me!) Zappa never made a five star album. For that, his music is simply too diverse. I don't even think he ever sat out to make a masterpiece as such, his music is just one continuous, unstoppable flow of creativity. And even how much I will recommend this fabulous recording, I can't think there is anyone, no matter how ecclecting and accepting in musical taste, who can possibly like everything here.
This is daring stuff, but not so much room clearing as has been ascribed of it.  Cutting and yet warm and fuzzy at the same time.  Just like an electric rodent razor.

When I was a kid living in Butte, Montana, I had this craving for music that was NOT available to me locally.  Before Montana, I lived in Ventura, Ca.  I lived on a steady diet of all kinds of "weird and unusual" sorts of music, pretty much whatever came my way.  I found some of Zappa's early albums in a cut-out bins (no kidding) for "3 for a dollar".

9726	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Brilliant, intelligent, thought-out comedy/cultural critique/preaching.  Wonderful, important insights about the evils of the Bush Family and the rest of the Religious Right; the soul-destroying problems with our mass-consumerist culture that pretends to be progressive and intelligent and, dare I say it, even pretends to be art.  Hicks' time was far, far too short on this earth.  Hicks' words are relavent, important, and oh so well constructed.  What a great writer he was, as well as being an incredibly good speaker. This is not comedy, certainly not stand-up comedy in the way we usually think of it.  He was a man with a message, with a mission, a holy quest one could almost say, to try to wake people up to be see the world around them as it really is, not in the sugar-coated, censored, stripped-down, bland way the media and the government would have you believe. I must admit, I find much more in his words about how to live as a fully actualized human being, and as a member of a society - and what a good, true, just society would look like - than I hear from most preachers/Christian theologians I've come across.  Certainly much more than the lies and mistruths the government and our schools and our news sources feed us.  Buy yourself a Bill Hicks CD, and have your eyes opened, and your mind expanded.  Or, if you realize you don't like what he has to say, I think we can all agree that, at the least, Hicks is an incredible example of a man who had something to say, and followefd his heart and went ahead and said it and did what he had to do to get his message out.  We can all a lot about following our call from him, even if you don't like what he has to say.

And according to my research- Christine Perfect (maiden name) McVie is around 53 years old-- and her presence on stage gives me thrills.  Christine is not in the Live in Boston show and her absence became obvious- by comparison with The Dance show.

The Concerto itself sounds clean and strong. The sheer variety of themes and ideas still surprises me, especially as to my ears classical music often consists of taking one flimsy idea and riding it relentlessly into the ground. Steve Morse's opening solo is way shorter than Blackmore's extended barrage in 1969, and also thinner sounding, lacking the warm Gibson guitar tone which sat so well on top of the orchestra (whether they liked it or not!)

7117	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album consists of the tracks Baker recorded especially for the Bruce Weber documentary `Let's get lost' - a retrospective of the life of the great horn player and vocalist.  Baker's life was troubled - his drug addiction is legendary, and ultimately caused his death, directly or indirectly, as the individual chooses to view the events.  His musical genius is indisputable - and these recordings are an incredible witness to that.  The group accompanying Baker (featured here on trumpet & vocals) is a small one:  Frank Strazzeri (piano), John Leftwich (bass), Ralph Penland (drums & percussion) and Nicola Stilo (guitar & flute).  There are standards a-plenty here - songs that will be loved forever by the likes of Duke Ellington & Billy Strayhorn, Cole Porter, Johnny Burke & Jimmy VanHuesen, Antonio Carlos Jobim - as well as a tune by none other than Elvis Costello, just to show that great ones are still being written.
Two things impressed me about this debut CD.  One, Third Day (specifically Mac Powell) wrote all their own music.  Many new bands either cover other people's songs or bring in more veteran guest writers. Also, young bands often have yet to develop good song writing talents.  Of course, none of these traits played into Third Day's first CD.  Secondly, Rich Mullins played as a guest instrumentalist on "Praise Song."  Those of you who are Rich Mullins' fans know that he was gracious, but he did not lend out his name indiscriminately.  Having Rich Mullins play on this album is an endorsement indeed.

All the tracks seemed so familiar to my ears,and with the help of the team of horns,this "live"performance hits the  top!  For those sentimental bluesfans,rare moments of great ,joyfull  music!

 I'm not as familiar with the Eric Burdon & War era singles (except to note that "Sky Pilot" is the full 7 minute version, and for the 45 single, the song was split into part 1 on one side and part 2 on the other), so hopefully someone else will comment on that.
Santana has the  verve to share his talent. He is respected and plays with musicians from  hip hop to rock. When a man of music is acclaimed by such a wide breadth of  musical genre.....we all are rewarded. "Maria, Maria" is the 1st  song my teenage sons & I have ever enjoyed together! And that in itself  is what music should be about, bringing people together.

So far as the music, the normal  repertoire is here.  Standard stage versions of classics like Nights in  White Satin, Lovely to See You, Story in Your Eyes and their traditional  closer, Ride My SeeSaw are included.  A true highlight is a magnificent  version of New Horizons, powerfully enhanced by a dynamic orchestral  background score.
I saw this band (which featured jazzman George Duke)in Chicago and they were amazing, although Frank was bemoaning the fact that they weren't much on the "crazy stage antics" side of the equation. I sure wish I could go back and relive that episode from the non-rock side of Zappa.

5409	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This landmark 20-year-old collaboration between songwriter/poet Leonard Cohen and singer Jennifer Warnes is in my opinion the most successful album for either artist, both artistically and commercially. Warnes' pitch perfect, emotionally charged voice teases out every last nuance and dimension of Cohen's inspired lyrical and musical compositions. Even on Cohen's most highly charged songs, one is able to fully appreciate the sweet timbre of Warnes' voice, but at the same time the sensuality and beauty of her voice never obscures the sharp edged, painfully romantic, tragic, fatalistic themes that have marked Cohen's finest and most characteristic compositions, many of which are represented on this album.
957	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	No its not GNR meets STP, and no its not that classic blues sound everyone is once again waiting to hear since the GNR 93 break up. But this is the esence of hard rock, strong rhythm guitars, a key lead guitarist (who beter than Slash), easy but heavy base and great sadistic vocals. Velvet Revolver has this and much more in their debut effort Contraband. It is understandable that loyal GNR and STP fans will despise this album at first, and maybe forever; but as a music fan, the fuse between rhythm guitar and solos is reluctantly appearing track after track. The vocals and lyrics are poetic and harmonic but also hard and dark perfectly coordinating with the tone of every song.
Last week I bought the 1999 remastered edition and was taken aback by scope of this particular work. Forget what you may read by Rolling Stone or AMG, this is one Bowie's deepest works. The fact that he was rebuked by Orwell's widow is a moot point. Here Bowie is bridging the gap between the glam era of "Man who sold the World"-"Aladdin Sane" to the 'Plastic Soul' period of "Young Americans" and "Station to Station" without missing a beat. The only missed beat was with the music critics, as it always is.

Merely doing a play-by-play of the CD's songs without anything extra is pointless.

While the joyous cover versions of "Lets jump the broomstick" and Dylan's "Down in the flood" are a treat it is inevitably the slower songs that stand out. The gentle country plaintive country of "Crazy lady blues", the blissful autumnal melancholy of "Late November" and her great take on traditional folk of "Blackwaterside". Her own obsessions also loom large not least with the oceans which played out in so many of her songs including the glorious "Sea Captain" (the demo here is actually a better version) and the aching beauty and imagery of the mystical title track with the Paris Theatre live version particularly poignant. The album also contain three versions of the remarkable "Next time around" which the one of todays great singers Joanna Newsom has described as "carving out some sculpture .....it's just unbelievably ambitious and interesting and just reaches such incredible heights. My personal favourite of the three remains the simple piano demo which is devastating in its simplicity with Denny's voice touched by the angels, although Harry Robinsons string based arrangement is very fine indeed. Such a contrast again is manifested on the album version and demo of "Wretched Wilbur". Robinson's strings on the first version give it a lush texture but the English folk rawness of the guitar based demo provides an altogether harder and more honest edge.

If the overall improved sound isn't enough, this remastered album offers four additional performances of Cohen compositions that are not from the original studio album sessions, including a Warnes-only live version of Joan of Arc, which is riveting even though it doesn't offer the magical duet with Cohen featured on the original studio album. Each of the four additional cuts would have been worthy of inclusion on the original release of Famous Blue Raincoat, which is high praise indeed.

The last issue: Do I hear what I see? On this one I can agree with some of the critisism. Even if the vocals and playing are live (maybe not 100% though), the editing is done so that you, from time to time, loose the presence feeling that is so important on a live DVD. For some strange reason this aspect was better delivered on the VHS. In all other aspects this DVD blow the VHS version away totally.
I hadn't listened to this CD all the way through in a long time, but it gave me chills to hear it again.  All three of its members, separately and together, put their career-best work on this album.  For Clapton, there's room to argue that Derek and the Dominos is on the same level, but this was clearly a high point for Bruce and Baker, who were just as brilliant individual musicians, and the live tracks bring back the high level of improvisational brilliance the trio was capable of, for those of us who couldn't hear it in person.  Listen to these live tracks, then listen to the comparable live recordings of the Stones, Led Zeppelin or the Who. Or even the Grateful Dead, said to be the pinnacle of live noodling. As great as those bands were, they didn't come close to Clapton-Bruce-Baker.  Their studio career wasn't quite as brilliant, but this album is the best of the original collections (best-ofs are the way to go to get the best of the rest).  One thing I notice.  With all the diverse styles Cream tried, they never sounded ponderous.  They were never "rock dinosaurs." Baker and Bruce kept them light on their feet, imbuing every track with the graceful drive of jazz no matter what else was going on. That and a sense of humor.

You've heard much of this album, even if you don't realize it. It's a classic and if you can separate yourself from the hype and listen with fresh ears you'll find one of his most consistent and accessible works to date.
I collect vinyl and five could not miss this.
Most of this album is just filler. "Spend A Lil Doe" just didn't make sense to me. "Queen Bee" is another of these songs that I saw no significance in. Although if you're from New York somewhere, you'll think these song are the best ever. I seem to can't grasp that concept.

I seriously started listening to FM radio in the early Seventies because that was the only place to hear "Levon," which was my favorite song for about half a year (I believe it was replaced by "Knife's Edge" by Emerson, Lake & Palmer). Consequently, the shift in my musical appreciation from Top Forty to more sophisticated musical forms can be traced to this particular song Elton John song and this special album.
3751	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Excessive is the surely the word to describe U2's monstrous set of tours during the 90's. While their albums like "Achtung Baby" and "Pop" were experimental and groundbreaking, it was their tours that really pushed the enevelope. Consider that PopMart boasted the world's largest TV screen and it STILL projected images of pop art from the likes of Andy Warhol and onward. It can even be said that the musical value of U2 was proven during the epic Zoo TV and PopMart outings because it is the songs that breathe life into the eye candy, and sometimes the scope is lost in the wave of wonderful, driving melodies the band produces. PopMart was as far as the band went (or at least we think), before settling down for more intimate venues for their 2001 Elevation Tour. And it's not just the costumes and screens that change, the music is retouched a bit here too. "I Will Follow" is given some kind of echoish techno, wah-wah sheen while tracks from Pop such as "Gone" and "If You Wear That Velvet Dress" actually sound improved upon live. Some of the material like "Mofo" is weak and we're glad to see the band churn out the classics like "With Or Without You," "Where The Streets Have No Name" and "Until The End Of The World." "Mysterious Ways" is a noteworthy performance, a song that already sounds fit for the future and beyond. "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" is the band rocking out on a glam-rock jam that is at times both diabolical, seductive and stylish. The fun is also in spotting all the quirky animations that appear in the back screen (the liquid bursts that appear during "Gone" really add to the scope of the performance). In the end it proves U2 are capable of putting on some kind of quasi-theatrical epic that rivals most Disneyland, Universal Studios shows and still retain the ability to play some wonderous music.

I've listed to "Aenima" 4 times now, but already I find it lives up to the hype surrounding it, just like "Lateralus" did. For newcomers: This is a GREAT Tool album to start with because it contains some of the best elements of Tool: the dark, gritty and somewhat bitterly juvenile "Undertow" as well as Tool's complex though provoking magnum opus that is "Lateralus". But beware, this isn't your typical hard rock/ metal album, like other reviewers will tell you, it takes time and attention... be prepared to set aside enough time to listen to this record in it's entirety and probably not like it. You'll be rewarded though as your brain starts to sort things out and piece parts together... which is the best way I can describe it. It's just structured so differently than anything else one typically hears from popular rock groups... To be honest, I fell asleep halfway through during my second listen to "Aenima", but on the 4th listen, It hit me, and I was rockin this album just completely enthralled by it... On "Lateralus" it took me like 10+ listens to fully appreciate it, but when it finally hit me... WOW. Anyways, again, this would be an excellent place to start in my opinion... It contributed to Tool's amazing evolution. "Aenema" IS Tool's first progressive metal masterpiece.
This album, like his others, is very funny.  (With the exception of what I have mentioned in the first paragraph.)  He talks about how much he hates L.A., England and hooligans, Dinosaurs in the Bible, and problems with the Church, government, and much more.

Having been a Dan Fan since teenhood (I really "discovered" them in the 80s, long after they had disbanded,) I shrieked with delight upon learning they had reconvened -- and unlike some other bands that disband and then reconvene, the Danny Boys HAD NOT CHANGED THEIR SOUND! They still have that great jazz-pop-rock sound they treated us Dan Fans to on AJA and GAUCHO. The Dan are pop -- they're rock -- they're jazz -- THEY'RE GREAT!!!! Every song was excellent and I cannot choose a favorite. All of them have a tendency to stick in my brain for a long time. I just wish I could give this CD ten stars. I recommend it highly
But the problem here doesn't lay with the music.  The problem lies with the cd itself.  Music this important deserves better treatment.

Just to let everyone know, I bought the audio CD version released on January, 28 1992.  I believe this is the very first CD version of the album.  I mention this because, despite being old, the sound quality is actually pretty good.  It's loud and clear.  If you have to buy an older version to save a few bucks, this version wouldn't be a bad idea.  I've heard plenty of badly recorded and terrible sounding early 70's live performances, but Roxy & Elsewhere doesn't count as one.  Solid job to everyone involved in the recording of this performance.

My favorite  song on the album is "Opiate", but they are all superb. Enjoy.

"(-) Ions" is a four-minute instrumental track of atmospheric sounds and electrical sparks in the background that serves as an intro the final track of the album called "Third Eye". The thirteen-minute song "Third Eye" starts off with a sample of comedian Bill Hicks talking the good things about drugs and saying that all the best rock albums were made on drugs. During Hicks' talks on drugs, Tool comes in with a powerful, blistering song with intense drumming from Carey, guitar grooves from Jones, and Keenan's powerful vocals who screams in the fourth minute of the song. After four minutes, a huge instrumental part comes in from Jones, Chancellor, and Carey comes in for about a few minutes then there's a quiet break during the eighth minute part of the song until things get loud again by Keenan's ferocious vocals who screams like a madman backed by the rest of the band's powerful instrument assaults.

This video consists of 90 minutes of Metallica concert footage from 1983 to 1986 (Keep in mind that all of this footage  was shot on early '80s VHS film, so the video and audio quality are  extremely poor for DVD.)  The video has been cleaned up somewhat from the  VHS release of this title, but imperfections from the source tape are still  easily recognizable.  The audio is in mono, and isn't of the best quality,  but it does come across a tad cleaner with DVD.  However, this is a  must-buy for hardcore Metallica (and possibly even Megadeth - Dave Mustaine  plays on a few songs) fans simply for the fact that it captures the early  vengeance of live Metallica, and is the ultimate tribute to Cliff Burton.  Don't expect super hi-res picture quality or Dolby 5.1 surround; just  expect raw, angry, intelligent heavy metal from the best rock band of all  time.

That said, seeing how this album was recorded behind the scenes lends an even greater appreciation.  Listening to the world's funkiest drummer, Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, dissect his Purdie Shuffle is nirvana for this drummer.  Rick Marotta's groove on "Peg" is also a wonder to behold.  Becker and Fagen are truly masters at getting the right performance from the right person and integrating them into the most amazing whole.  Whereas most musicians this meticulous would get a soulless performance, Becker and Fagen get one for the ages.

His mother bought him Zips instead of Adidas,which(the latter) was a hip sneaker brand. "You're ruining my rep!",the Fresh Prince tells his mother. "She said,'You're only 16,you do not have a rep yet!'" is the line that follows. He gets into trouble with the law when his mother and father take a vacation. The unlicensed Fresh Prince takes his mom's new Porsche for a spin and picks up a chick,a 12-year-old runaway! The cops pull him over for going 90 MPH,35 miles over the maximum legal limit. He's arrested for the crime and his parents had to come get him out of the police station where he was taken to. The car was impounded as well. Man,were the FP's parents angry. "Take it from me,PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND" ends the hit rap song. Another track contains samples from George Benson's BREEZIN'. The other songs are cool. Later,the Fresh Prince aka Will Smith would have a hit TV sitcom,"The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air",which he was the star and a major movie career and taking Jada Pinkett to be his lawfully wedded wife.
(Theoretically, you *could* pipe this sort of music into an elevator, but then no one would want to leave; proper elevator music makes people want to get out as soon as possible.)
Yet there's a final bow at the latter style, from the second single, "I Surrender (To The Spirit Of The Night)", whose guitars and keyboards, thumping drums, and rhythm mimic "Touch Me".  I can imagine that this or the "Touch me" song were candidates for Foxy's breakout single and "I Surrender" lost the coin toss.  There's still a lot of energy in this number though.
There's certain flashes of the group members past, but also shows potential for maybe another album down the road if enough people dig VR's debut. It might seem sort of an early 90's grunge/hair band album, but it should grow on you. Even for me, only hearing the album only twice all the way through. It is a relief from some of the pre-manufactured music out there now.

Pure and emotionally provoking music that leaves you soothed and relaxed. The difference in this cd, compared to his others, is the piano focus that Yanni uses. Most of his other works are more synthesizer oriented. Don't get me wrong...those works are beautiful, but there is just something about his piano based compositions that really strike me. Very poignant. (I love solo piano anyway). I just think this really showcases Yanni's multitalented ability. As with all his music, Yanni composed and produced every song. He is accompanied on this cd w/ a variety of instrumentality.... acoustic violins, cello, bass, keyboards and percussion. Interestingly, each songs title really fits the mood of the song. You can "feel" the emotion that went into the writing and playing of these compositions. In my opinion, this is Yanni's best work.

Wish You Were Here:
As for the music, it's absolutely peak T-Rex. As was the norm for 1972, both the early and late shows are 1-hour and have the same set list. Nonetheless, they are markedly different. The 5:30 show is a bit ragged, and Bolan is plagued with microphone problems (he literally has to follow the swaying microphone back and forth while singing Telegram Sam). In addition, Bolan's guitar is turned too low in the first show and the rest of the band seem a bit stiff. Yet, it still reflects a band at its creative apex (having hit it big with Electric Warrior and completed many tracks for The Slider). The second show is AWESOME and worth the purchase by itself! The band is tight, Marc's guitar is loud and driving, and the energy exchanged between Bolan and the crowd drives the set forward to increasingly intense musical peaks. I did notice that Tony Visconti (who mixed the DVD) adds some subtle lead guitar lines here and there that are clearly not being played by Marc on stage, but this is not a distraction and there are plenty of true leads played, especially as the late show fires up. The songs are as fresh today as they were in the 1972 days of T-Rexstacy. What's great is that T-Rex fans get the total live experience they've craved for years AND the unfamiliar viewer will finally "get it" and "get it on" with Marc and T-Rex. As an avid fan for over 30 years, I can finally say "I'm satisfied!" You will be too!
6384	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Of all the "two-per-year" albums Elton John's contractual agreement imposed he deliver during his initial 1970's sojourn - considered his finest era as an artist, and most certainly his most fertile and organic creative period - MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER remains, without a doubt, his crown jewel and flawlessly overshadows his entire four decade [ongoing] catalogue. The magnificently haunting and brilliant masterpiece title track alone is worth seeking out and purchasing on the various compact disc original/"remastered"/alternative version(demos; etc.)issues/and most definitely this[sonic wonder]SACD version, for the irressistable sounds within justifies one's curiosity beyond comprehension. This entire album is Elton John's finest moment ever - regardless of the ongoing disputes as to which album from this period is the best. MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER is a rare breathtaking vocal/orchestral/singer-songwriter's[accidentally innocent]life's work[in a panoramic view]realized to utmost perfection. He covers more ground on this disc alone than he does during his entire career! The two majestic standards["Tiny Dancer/Levon"] which initially propelled this incredible recording to stratospheric selling status upon its release are merely surface hints of Elton John's musical genius, which lies within the remainder of this stupendous album's remainding tracks - it's unbelievable that none of these became hit singles in the wake of "MADMAN's" popularity, but still, they have become Classic Rock radio playlist staples in their own right through the ages. MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER has aged genuinely well and remains a mesmerizing classic amongst the most supreme albums in Rock history. Thirty some odd years later, currently in the next millenium, Elton John remains a rarily gifted artist whose current musical creations continue to capture the imagination of unsuspecting listeners' ears and draw new admirers to the circle of his magical allure.

It contains virtually everything the group recorded for both DECCA and CBS.  The sound quality is superb, although I was initially disappointed that the DECCA material was  not in stereo, having stereo mixes on other CDS.  However, after reading  the excellent booklet notes by Alec Palao, I accept that mono is the way  these tracks should be heard. (the Decca material has since been issued in wonderful stereo on a 2CD collection & is also essential for fans).  Listening to songs like "what more can  I do" and "summertime" convinces me that the Zombies were  one of the 60's best groups. "I remember when I loved her" sounds  like it was recorded in a graveyard at midnight,with ethereal organ and  tambourine which sends chills up my spine.

I do have to admit that I'm not a big fan of John Williams' style, but can anyone deny that this is a good score?  I hope not!  The main theme is exciting and adventuresome (if a lot like the Williams style that I'm not that fond of) and the London Symphony Orchestra (has Mr. Williams ever used anything else?) is fantastic.  Probably my favorite part of this score is what the liner notes call the "Ark theme."  It's very eerie and the total opposite of the main theme.  Check out track 9, "The Well of Souls."  Marion's Theme is also very good, very tender and romantic (though Marion didn't strike me as that type of woman in the movie....).

The original Mancini recordings consistently exhibited two traits: lush orchestration, often with strings and chorus, and some of the most enjoyable and memorable pop melodies ever scored.  Well, the near-incomparable melodies are still here, of course, but now in a context of a tighter, smaller, hotter ensemble.  The arrangements are simply killer, as one would expect from Mr. Grusin, and the surround-sound engineering is as well done as any I've encountered; subtle but readily apparent use of the rear channels to expand the soundstage without moving the listener out of the audience and onto the bandstand.  Some of the more obscure Mancini compositions are covered, a nice touch.  One minor criticism: "The Days of Wine and Roses" as originally done was so beautiful a song that even Mr. Grusin fails to impress with his instrumental rearrangement, which actually is excellent if not referenced to the original piece. Easily five star stuff. My thanks to Mr. Grusin and all those involved with making a recoring of rare quality that I'll enjoy for years.

"The Art of Singing" is an incredible collection of opera arias sung by virtually all of the opera greats of the twentieth century. Pavarotti and  Domingo,however,are notably absent. Yes,Caruso is also included--an excerpt from a silent film in which he is seen (but not heard) singing his great "Pagliacci" aria "Vesti La Giubba" has been rather awkwardly synchronized with his early recording of that piece. The rest of  the footage featured in this documentary is amazing. The home video viewer is allowed to see and hear greats that one never even hoped to see before the age of videocassette--Benjamino Gigli, Jussi Bjoerling,Renata Tebaldi, Tita Ruffo, Feodor Chaliapin, Rosa Ponselle, Ezio Pinza, Giuseppe di Stefano, Giovanni Martinelli,etc. as well as Renata Tebaldi, Maria Callas, and Leontyne Price, all singing the music that made them famous. They are seen in screen tests, rare film shorts that have not seen the light of day in more than fifty years,early television appearances,and even excerpts from full-length films like the 1933 Chaliapin "Don Quixote". Nothing is allowed to distract from  the performances,although the quaintness of some of those early shorts,as well as the early makeup on some of the male singers, may make you laugh. The early television excerpts are presented on simple,uncluttered sets,and there are no attempts to "gimmick up" the presentations. Noted opera singers and music experts also put in appearances to comment on the art of such greats as Maria Callas (shown singing excerpts from  "Tosca" and "La Traviata",her greatest roles). Actors  Charles Laughton and Jose Ferrer turn up in rare TV appearances to  introduce segments featuring Jussi Bjoerling and Boris  Christoff,respectively.

In this live concert performed at Carnegie Hall in September of 1998, Column A is hearing performers doing the songs with which they are most associated.  From the evening's selections this would be Karen Ziemba & Bebe Neuwirth doing "Nowadays" from "Chicago," Priscilla Lopez singing "Nothing" from "A Chorus Line," and Nell Carter's "Mean To Me" "Ain't Misbehavin.'"  True, they essentially sing these songs the way we heard them on the original Broadway cast albums, but when you are talking Faith Prince's rendition of "Adelie's Lament" from "Guys and Dolls," Jennifer Holliday singing "And I'm Telling You" from "Dreamgirls" or Elaine Stritch standing on stage and once again nailing "The Ladies Who Lunch," there is only reason to be happy.  The performance that straddles the two categories would be Andrea McArdle, who starts off singing "Look for the Silver Lining" before moving to "Tomorrow" from "Annie."  True, her voice is not what it was when she was a kid, but there is a certain poignancy in hearing the adult McArdle try to do the song for which she will always be remembered differently.

"Indian Sunset" places Elton in the moccasins of a proud Iroquois warrior, determined to die in battle rather than succumb to the incursion of the White Man. ("And now you ask that I should watch the red man's race be slowly crushed, What kind of words are these to hear from Yellow Dog whom white man fears?") The impact of the song builds from an initial almost a cappella verse, with only occasional keyboard all the way to a full blown arrangement that soars beneath Elton. Truly Wonderful...

All in all, a great classic but a little flawed, unlike many other (Led Zeppelin IV, Second Helping, Animals, etc...). And I consider On The Border as the best Eagles' cd, because it doesn't bore you, as Hotel California does, in spite of having best songwriting at times.

This effort fits like a old pair of sneakers, comfortable and perfectly molded to your feet. No new ground is broken here, no new sounds to push the envelope of rock, just one of the finest collections of songs ever assembled by one guy. Once you get past the hits "home and Dry", "Baker Street" (one of the best songs ever), and "right down the line" there's still much more to consider...The Title track, "Mattie's Rag", and "whatever's written in your heart" are all just as good as the hits, but it still doesn't end there...the rest are equally sublime. This album was all over the radio in the summer of 1978, I remember it like it was yesterday, but alas I was 11 and paid little attention (Baker Street is a bit much for an 11-year-old to comprehend) I "discovered" this gem in the summer of 1989 and spent many a peaceful evenings down by the lake soaking up these tunes.

I first saw the VHS version of this show in the late 90's when my love for Stevie Ray began, and watched it again for the first time in years when I recently bought the DVD. Considering the small amount of concert film currently available of this legendary musician, it is a blessing that this small club performance was even filmed at all. This is likely the only footage we will ever see of Stevie Ray Vaughan in a small and intimate club setting, and the camera crew did a nice job of capturing this raw performance on film that night in 1983. The insightful bonus interview with Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon is just one more reason this DVD is a must-have for any blues/rock fan. Shannon and Layton come across as sincere, down to earth guys with a lot of respect and admiration for Stevie, and they tell some great stories.

With all the great bands out there whose music is unavailable on CD, and there are 3 CDs of drek unloaded by this wanna-be variety show loser pile o'poop on this website. There is no justice in the world. While great psych and progressive rarities, highly talented rock bands of the 70's and 80's, and great albums of recent vintage that are sadly out of print languish in dank record company vaults, you can get not one, not two, but three CDs filled with the tackiest, most meaningless, crap ever released by a record label?!?!?!? AAaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I cannot think of one group I'd rather NOT listen to more than these guys. They even LOOK boring. But this music is too bad to be boring, and they have sentenced themselves to endless purgatory by releasing what has to the most tasteless, weirdest and vilest version of Chuck Berry song ever with Hail Hail.....and that one of the "members" calls herself Taffy should tell anyone all they need to know without removing that shiny silver disc from it's plastic tray. To anyone who may find themselves in possession of a Starland Vocal Band disc, do everyone who may be in earshot a favor, leave it wrapped in it's shrink, toss into a garage can and run away. You'll thank yourself in the morning. -10 stars. Truly wretched!!!!
This album got some bad notices back in 1971. Reviews of subsequent solo Beatle albums would often include the line "at least it's an improvement over Ram."  The best that was said of it was that it had a good deal of energy.  John compared Paul's first LP 'McCartney' favorably--"at least that one had actual songs".  George said that Paul had spent too much time isolated up in his Scottish retreat. "He clearly has no idea about the music that is being made today"  Ringo was the most damning: "Paul's a genius, but his albums disappoint me.  There is not one single tune on his last one, Ram.  I feel he's wasted his time--he seems to be going strange." All sorts of people, including me, were wondering when Paul would write his next "Hey Jude" or "Let It Be".  We weren't willing to take the music on its own unique terms.
"Do Not Stand In The Shadows" is punk rock at its best. It brims with a positive motivating high-energy. It's a rebel voice pushing you to get out from underneath whatever oppresses you but fully in the light of day free of any nihilistic tendency toward self-destruction. This is one of those great songs that radio seems to overlook.
purchasing this. I listen to In My Time from yanni my parents


  I also reccommend:
My absolute favorites are Audra  McDonald and Andrea McArdle.  McDonald is such an incredible performer who  deserves a Broadway show!  Her version of "Down With Love" is  full of such energy and talent that I almost forgot Streisand's version!  McDonald sings it with hilarious "My Man", "He Touched  Me" and "Music That Makes Me Dance" lyrics.  She is really  incredible.  And Andrea McArdle cleverly reigns herself in and sings a  touching, quiet version of "Tomorrow" from ANNIE.  She has such a  great voice -- her cameo in the ANNIE TV movie was a surprise, and she  sounded  great!
The whole album, it's cover image of the spaceman pioneer venturing into primal territory, the Hindu inspired messages of Let's See Action, Nothing is Everything/Everything Is Nothing,Evolution(great collaboration with Faces Ronnie Laine singing his song also found on faces 1st step album), Pure and Easy, a wonderful remake of The Seeker and the rest of the songs are not mindless doodlings but are all refreshing sketches and songs smacking of heartfelt sincerity and emotion.
I guess my point in this review is that there is a reason why this album is one of the biggest selling of all time, because it's a masterpiece!! As cliche as that has already become, it truly is. It has everyting that you could want in 47 mintues.
"Ladies and gentlemen, WATCH RUTH!"

2602	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	They were two brothers who were both in jazz but so different that they could not work together. At least till after the death of their father which brought them together for the production of the concerto of Janet Blair's husband's concerto, and yet under the conducting of a third party. But when they were together they made miracles particularly in their trombone-saxophone duets. The film shows how difficult life was for jazzmen at the beginning, but also how the radio transformed the spreading of this music, and then this spreading was amplified by the recording of their music on records. Jazz is typically American in its use of rhythm and new instruments like the saxophone, and old instruments like the clarinet and the trombone which are perfectly transformed in the process. But most of all, jazz would not have existed if they had not used the radio and records to reach the wider public. Jazz is the first music of modern ages. It was also a great success because it expresses life in our modern times of cars, factories, machines, industrialisation and mechanisation. People expected a new type of music in phase with this new life and jazz provided it to them. This film is thus both historically and humanly true and sensitive.
Bearing little resemblence to his early punk days, the tracks here are a lot longer and take more time to develop.  I don't know where Amazon got its track information from but believe me, this album only has the first 15 tracks that they listed.  However, this is still overall a brilliant album with every track worthy of being on a best of compilation album of Elvis Costello.  My favourite track which was also a small hit single is "You Little Fool" but others like "Town Cryer" and "Man Out of Time" are also standout tracks.
Highly recommended.

What does this record sound like? Not much of anything, but it sure is loud and it sure is very long. For arty post-pubescent teenagers with a penchant for vapid navel-gazing and intolerably lazy self-aggrandizement, it's manna from heaven. Melody is for losers, after all - the longer and the less listenable the affair, the better and the _deeper_ it is! If Tool has a defining element, it is sludge. Not too different from the Melvins, in that respect. For the muse descended upon Tool, and she spake thus: "Tool, remember this well. If you play fast sludge, this will be Aggressive. If you play slow sludge, this will be Ominous. Other bands are just Aggressive, so this will give your album Depth. And if you eschew melody as if it were the bubonic plague, you will be Unique and Against The Mainstream." There's the Tool aesthetic - the less substance the better, since any level of detail will expose the utter lack of anything worth exposing, and vagueness gives everything a superficially "enigmatic" air. Okay, okay, so other artists have done this "oblique verbal cut-up" thing before, some with success, but they didn't do it in the context of an hour of bludgeoning guitar slime, and they had more than moving eyeballs to offer. At the very least, they were all honest enough not to act like they were above their own intellectual excesses. And moreover, their intellectual excesses themselves had a lot more class; Maynard, however, mixes meaningless exotic-sounding bromides with sheer crassness - what immediately comes to mind here is that monumentally imbecilic "auto-erotic lotus." Look! It's obscene, it's ugly, it's utterly juvenile and inane, but it's shaped all weird, so that makes it a Symbol understandable to only the chosen elite, all of whom just happen to be Tool fans! No. Ugliness is not beauty; that notion is a pathetic cop-out for those with nothing beautiful to offer.

I really never expected the acoustic KISS to be good but it really is. It is much more calm, and much more mature sounding. They didn't play any of the hard core songs like Strutter, but the songs they did play went great with the acoustic sound. Another thing I was surprised about was that Ace showed up! I was worried that he would have skipped out on this because of past relations with the band. The concert went great. The fans were cheering by the time it got to Rock N Roll All Nite, which also was a good acoustic version. So if you are interested, or already listening to KISS, you should definitely get this DVD or CD.

This was the CD they had just released. I have owned this CD for at least 20 years and like prior reviewers, I think this is one of the finest examples of late 80s fusion jazz. They carried on in the tradition of Weather Report, Return to Forever from the late 70s. Jimmy Haslip is one of my favorite bassists, along with Jaco Pastorius and Scott LaFaro.

"Beware My Love" is a very poor attempt at being a hard rock song. McCartney's voice is horse and the lyrics were too stupid. . .and the song still has no get-up-and-go. It is as bland as the other songs.

"San Ferry Anne" is really good, but "Warm and Beautiful" is *definitely* an extremely banal ballad.  I don't care for it at all.  Paul has done significantly better ballads than this one.

8838	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	That seems to be Maynard Keenan's prescription on Aenima, Tool's second full-length album.  Of course, on the title track, Keenan directs his ire toward Los Angeles in particular; but this city is obvioulsy being used as a microcosm of American society.  L.A. is merely the most visible symbol of the prevailing culture of consumerism that is cheapening and degrading every aspect of western society.  If I might be so presumptuous as to take a stab at the driving idea behind the lyrical content of this record, and Tool's latest, Lateralus, (although it is dealt with less fatalistically on the latter)  I would say it goes something like this: People are losing touch with their own identities and with reality in general.  Our culture is full of s#!t.

3148	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This concert was recorded close to the death of Roy Orbison, the late, great rock & roll singer of the 1950s and 1960s.  Orbison is like no other rock musician, in my opinion.  This is because he combines the romanticism of his best-loved music (this includes the wonderful, well known "Pretty Woman") with his signature falsetto tenor.  His voice is comparable to some of the greatest mariachi vocalists of all time.  Sometimes, I would sit and watch him and could swear he had Mexican ancestry--he really breaks your heart, the minute he opens his mouth.

We'd play records sometimes all afternoon, and then eventually we'd start trading records.  I remember trading my 45 of "No Matter What" by Badfinger for this single of "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."  I got to like that single so much that I played the flip side and that song was "Too Many People."  Man, I really liked that song too.  So eventually, I gathered up enough change to get about $4 together so that I could go out any buy the whole album (actually it as a cassette) of this Paul McCartney album "Ram".  This album was really cool.  It felt kinda raw and personal.  But, there was an element of humor and disconcern about impressing anybody with these songs.  That contributed to its appeal.  Out of all the songs on this album, I think "Eat at Home" is the least impressive, however it is still an enjoyable song.  "Dear Boy", "Heart of The Country", and "Back Seat of My Car" are my absolute favorites.
I have picked up slash's solo albums since the snake pit and of course the velvet revolver fiasco. In my circles a heated debate always brews about the best guitarist etc. I am sure any avid rock listener has experienced this - clapton, van hailen, Stevie ray v, Steve via,  the edge, page and countless others lead the debates.

Overall, Townshend's first solo album is a keeper despite its minor flaws.

  From the Little Earthquakes Era: Silent All These Years and Winter are simple videos with children, personal touches and many close-ups of Tori's face.  Crucify was done very well.  It starts off with Tori just wearing a bath towel and goes into Tori playing the piano and taking a bath fully clothed.  I thought that video fit the song well.  The only video I did not like was China.  It was basically just a man piling rocks and Tori singing/playing piano.

"RAM" is an essential Paul McCartney achievement and later came "Band On The Run".
The anthemic title song starts things off and lays the foundation for the rest of the album. A song about a Vietnam veteran who, after going overseas and fighting in a war for the U.S.A., is forgotten by his own country when he returns home. It's an angry and disgusted battle cry against the injustice of it all. The underrated and guitar rocking Cover Me follows, and I think this is one of the best songs Bruce has ever done. Energetic, desperate and lonely, it picks up where the title cut ends.

Of course, the huge hits, "Levon" and "Tiny Dancer" grace this album, but all the songs carry a strong sense of pop/rock with a minimum of perfect orchestration. After this album, Elton John pushed his style in slightly different directions, but returned to this original fashion with albums like, "Songs From The West Coast" and "Peachtree Road".  This album has always been a classic and in SACD format, the sound is absolutely brilliant!
It's very interesting to see how all the screen films have been included on the DVDs. This is something that many fans have been keen to see.

 Big Machine....a punk anthem song that lets us all know that we've compromised in some way. There is no true counterculture. We're all slaves to a big machine... Also refers to how the media molds us, enslaving us to images of people they create, which may not be true.
Keith Reids lyrics are haunting and sometimes nightmarish and although he touched on these themes in previous albums("Something Following Me" from the first album; "In Held 'Twas I" from Shine On Brightly) he decides to totally devote a whole album to distressing themes.

9314	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	If you can call Metallica "heavy metal", then you might as well say that Eminem is a nice guy. Tool's more heavy than Metallica ever was or will be. Some of the songs on this disc are about as heavy as heavy metal gets. It's dark, disturbing, and is guaranteed to make you shiver. If you don't, it's obvious that you're a robot. Songs like Stinkfist, Eulogy, the title track, and 46&2 are some of Tool's best yet. While songs like Third Eye and Pushit are a definate test of your patience, they're also really good. If you can make it through the end of Third Eye, then you're a true Tool fan. Eulogy and Useful Idiot are pretty self-explanatory. There's also an Intermission track (if you've seen Monty Python & The Holy Grail, there's an intermission scene and they play cheesy music that's kind of like this), that's how long the CD is. It's the longest CD in my collection, clocking in at 77 minutes . 46&2 was one of the songs that got me interested in Tool in the first place. Undertow was obviously aimed at a more mainstream audience, but Aenima was obviously aimed at a more hardcore audience (there's no censored version). If you liked Perfect Circle's Mer De Noms, and think that Tool is anything like them, are you dead wrong. If you like heavy metal, this is an album you must check out. Can't wait for Tool's next album.

I think Ram comes very close to being a masterpiece.  The only thing preventing that from happening are a couple songs that feel like throwaways.  Songs just tacked on to fill up space.  Of course, they are still melodic as heck, and great to listen to despite that.
Once standing onstage, our lady of the canyon breaks into a fine solo rendition of 'Big Yellow Taxi'. Some will immediately recognize the echoing, hollow sound in her guitar, as guitarists will notice her playing throughout the concert in what appears to be an alternate tuning, a sweet sound full of magical tones, definitely signature Joni Mitchell, kind o' blue. She charms the audience in a laid back manner throughout the show as well, explaining lyrics and telling tales of her songs.

Every piece  of music in this CD is a delight! The 3 countertenors featured in this CD  have very distinct voice quality and tone, but each is equally good in  their chosen songs. "WHITE AS LILIES" is one melodious, touching  song! It is a MUST HAVE!
  So for those of you out there, who are open minded, and don't believe that "they will be damned for listening to an antichrist band." Then this album, though short, is a great buy. After all even harmless billy joel once said "i'd rather laugh with the sinners, then cry with the saints, you know the sinners are much more fun." An excellent choice for all you sinners out there.

It is often dissonant and it's odd time signatures and complex song structures make this album more than just relaxing music. But it's involving music.

It is very touching. The concert is recorded live at Moon River Theatre in Branson, Mo. This video contains 25 classic Christmas Songs as seen on PBS.

 Even the four additional tracks are exquisite. Contrary to many reports they are not left-overs from the original sessions. They were recorded after the album was released and at least one of the songs was lovingly rehearsed in Jennifers' living room. Hearing them is like finding buried treasure. "Ballad of the Runaway Horse" is simply a masterpiece.

6640	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album remains a classic to this day, and sounds fresh still.  The Eagles were moving towards a rockier sound at this stage of their career, having scored a big hit with the most mainstream album of their career, 1975's "One Of These Nights".  With the darker images of that title track freshly on their mind, the band sought to use the newly adopted style to comment on the seamier side of life in Southern California.  The rougher, darker edge to their music perfectly complemented the biting commentary of "Hotel California", "Life In The Fast Lane" and "Victim Of Love".  But what truly separates this album is the styles they chose for the other songs.  "New Kid In Town", a tribute to the innocent youth moving into the dog-eat-dog music business, plays with a soft, pure country lilt; the slow, mournful blues of "Wasted Time" is in sharp contrast to the biting satire of the darker tunes; and the tone of "Try and Love Again" feels like jaded optimism.  Finally, the build of "The Last Resort" from near silence to a power anthem mirrors the fast-paced growth of not only the population of Southern California but also the growth of the arrival of the businesses willing to do anything to make a buck.  To suggest, as another reviewer has, that the Eagles were selling out to make more money, is not correct at all.  In fact, the band was thumbing its collective noses at the big businesses of the day, much like Tom Petty did in this decade with "The Last D.J.".  And if you can ever find a more thorough and biting commentary on the whirlwind that was SoCal in the late 1970's - buy it.  It would have to be amazing to outdo this one.

8157	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Put It In Your Mouth" is basically everything a ill EP should be. Out of the five tracks on the CD, the first four are mad raw. The last track, is just average, but don't let that stray you from buyin' this EP,  cuz the first four tracks are dope enough to make up for a whole double CD  of wack songs!!! Akinyele is one of the most distinct MC's to come up  lately, due to his gruff, husky voice (like B.I.G's), and his hilarious  rhymes (mostly dealing with his sexual escapades). Each track is produced  by a different DJ, but the overall feeling is that of upbeat vibes, that  accuate Ak's comedic lyrics. Bottom line is: this EP belongs in every true  hip hop head's collection.
"Daytime Drama" is a nice midtempo guitar-driven track generously drenched with synth. "Eyes Without A Face" lays down a gorgeously smooth bass groove, courtesy of Sal Cuevas, for one of the best loved ballads of the 80's with nice female backing vocals by Perri Lister. Showcasing great dynamics, an extended bridge section hits you with guitars and great lyrics. Once again Idol is able to take you into the underworld with a reality that leaves little doubt that he's lived the life he describes.

941	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	As a long time fan of both Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, I was really looking forward to this disc. Although I was a bit surprised by the album, I am very pleased with the results. As you would expect, it sounds a bit like GN'R and a bit like STP. Although it sounds more like STP than GN'R. If you are expecting 'Use Your Illusion III,' you may be disappointed because Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin were a huge part of the GN'R sound. However, 'Contraband' isn't supposed to sound like a GN'R album, this is a new band. Producer Josh Abraham gives the album a modern twist. Unlike Slash's Snakepit, nothing on this album sounds retro. Although the album sounds modern, it's sprinkled with Slash's signature solos. Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum provide a killer rhythm section and guitarist Dave Kushner gives the music an extra layer of thickness.  Scott Weiland sounds great as always and is a perfect fit for the band.
1949	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This review is in no way meant to knock the Moody Blues because their performance was stellar and so was the awesome orchestra.  'RR' was great but....... It needed so much more footage to spotlight this great night, IMO. The folks who put this together should have added some extras: i.e., behind the scenes, making of the show, deleted songs (yes, there were several!) interviews, etc... You would think for an occasion this special they would have, but alas they did not. To get all the aforementioned extras, I had to buy the can-be-hard-to-find companion DVD 'The Other Side of Red Rocks'. Why Ray Thomas's truly PHENOMENAL and FULL-LENGTH performance of 'Legend of a Mind' wasn't on this one makes me think the editors got hold of some of Timothy Leary's little paper dots. This was a faux pas of the highest order. Still, "Red Rocks" is a must-have for any Moodies fan. Do yourself a favor and get the other DVD as well. Watch them back-to-back and be prepared to stand up and cheer your head off.
Yessongs is the best of Yes Mk 2 (more or less +Howe, Wakeman, -Bruford). It is a legendary performance of music made before it's time. The incredible Howe-styling on his many Les Pauls, And Wakeman on the Hammond C3 and the much ignored mellotron, Anderson's unique high vocals , and Squire's characteristic chunky Rickenbacker. Then the stage ambiance, enhanced by Wakeman' sequin cloak and Squire's winged cape; the incredible tension of the simplistic music, tight vocal harmonies and CO2 fog of 'Close to the Edge' is haunting. GET THIS DVD if you have any interest in progressive rock. This, in a large nutshell, is the essence of progressive.

I am a progressive/progressive metal aficionado from before YES & ELP. "In the Court of the Crimson King" is probably the first recognized progressive album/ group and it still is alive and well today. King Crimson lost Greg Lake to ELP and gained Bill Bruford from YES. Bill Bruford did play on some of songs on the Yessongs album, but Alan White replaced him during the Yessong tour(s)and played drums & percussion on the Yessong movie, which was from a performance recorded during the tour(s).

For what it's worth my two favorite tracks are Almost Gothic and West of Hollywood. These two guys never cease to provide me with a sense of musical wonder.
We also see that Bob wasn't much of a guitar player, more of a singer/songwriter.  He plays only the rhythm "cha-chick". The lead ax is in the hands of Junior Mervin I think, who has great fun playing blues licks next to Marley's gyrations, although Junior seems a bit loopy at times.  The I-Threes are crucially important, as is Tyrone Downie on keyboards.

The beats and music are slammin' and the lyrics are boombastic-fantastic. It gets better and better everytime I spin it. I've heard it said that KRS is too political, or too "conscious", or all about his philosophy, but how is that even a complaint? I like music that rocks me, or makes me want to dance, or drops the funky beatdown like James Brown with a badge, but that is merely the minimum requirement. It has to do all that AND make me think, otherwise, why bother? If I wanted music to go braindead to, I'd just tune into top 40 radio and put my head under a truck tire. If you want more from your music than something to eat up your time while the world floats past you, BUY THIS ALBUM, then check out the rest of KRS's incredible catalog. Peace.

Mickey thomas' rendition of the title song is superb, especially as you can picture the scene it is used in the movie where Corey Feldman dances like Michael Jackson to impress Meredith Salanger - an 80s classic.
If the tunes are a bit overfamiliar, Hamilton certainly doesn't treat them sleepily: each rendition is delivered smoothly & beautifully but with genuine craft & freshness.  The disc has a lovely, warm feel, reinforced by the glowing studio sound.  It's a disc that isn't for those looking for flash--indeed, it's perhaps a touch too becalmed (it might have benefitted from another uptempo number maybe, though certainly Hamilton's calling card is ballads).  Its most beautiful moments come on "It Never Entered My Mind"--an absolutely flawless rendition--& on a swinging "Autumn Leaves" & a surprisingly hard-hitting "Bernie's Tune".
"Dancing in the Dark"- By far has the most synthesizer action, but somehow it couldn't work any other way.  Also makes a good sing-a-long song.
6155	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Leon Russell is easily one of the most underrated and underappreciated artists of all time.  This, his first solo album (although when listing his albums in chronological order, I list the earlier recorded but later  released "Asylum Choir 2" as his first) is the one that people  should get into to become familiar with Leon's interesting musical mix.  Blues, country, rock and gospel all fuse together into something some  people have called Okie-Swamp music.  Whatever you call it, it is  incredibly infectious.  And the Gold Disc is the way to go on this release  because not only do you get the original order of the album (which places  Russell's odd cover of Dylan's "Master of War" into proper  context), you get the original cover art (with the famous Shelter egg in  the top left hand corner of the sleeve), and a great number of bonus tracks  including a sped up version of his Asylum-era "Sweet Home  Chicago," (now called "The New Sweet Home Chicago") an  awesome jam between Leon and Eric Clapton, an alternate version of  "Shootout on the Plantation," a great unreleased track  ("Indian Girl") and "Shine a Light" which features Leon  on piano, Ringo Starr on drums and Mick Jagger singing (oddly enough, this  song is credited to Leon Russell here but when it turned up later on  "Exile on Main Street," it was credited to Jagger and  Richards...truth be told, it sounds more Jagger and Richards to me).  Aside  from the bonus tracks, the album has been remastered back to its original  mix (the album version of "Shootout on the Plantation" sounds  more piano laden) and all of the studio banter and stops and starts have  survived.  And on top of all of this, "Delta Lady," "A Song  For You," "Hummingbird," "Roll Away the Stone" and  "Pieces Apple Lady" have never sounded better. This is the first  time Leon put out so many great tracks on one album.  Later, he would make  more profound albums, more personal albums, more diverse albums and more  complex albums but he never made a more fun album.

"Cold and Ugly" is another lyrically simple song, performed live, that starts out like thrash rock. The guitars crunch and wail, but the lyrics become quiet, drifting back to a grunge sound. Between the wails this song is about relationships and people, and how they are beneath the exterior they show the world.

9944	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	When I found myself nursing a desire to really get to know David Bowie's music a good many years ago, Changesbowie was an obviously natural choice for me - one CD filled to the brim with 16 songs encompassing his entire career up to the point of the compilation album's release.  Rather quickly after giving this disc a spin, I became a Bowie fan.  Bowie has always gone his own way, evolving through some really quite weird metamorphoses over the years, but his music has always been consistently good.  While I'm not that fond of the track John, I'm Only Dancing, I can honestly say that I enjoy the other 15 tracks almost equally.  Space Oddity and Ziggy Stardust are as much fun to listen to as Bluejean and China Girl, and the consistency of the appeal of one man's music over such a long period of time strikes me as quite extraordinary.  One should note that these songs cover a period of time between 1969 and the mid-1980s, although the version of the song Fame included here is a 1990 remix.  This album offered the best of both worlds to me as a neophyte Bowie fan, combining the songs I was already familiar with from the 1980s (Fashion, Let's Dance, China Girl, Modern Love, Bluejean) with some of Bowie's powerful early material.  While I hear some of these older classics on the radio from time to time these days, I was completely unfamiliar with them when I purchased this CD.  I have yet to explore Bowie's early days in any great detail, so I cannot even speculate as to other songs that might have deserved a place on this album.  All I know is that Changesbowie gave me a limited yet broadly impressive introduction to the work of a unique musical legend and will lead directly to my eventual purchases of albums from throughout Bowie's distinguished career.  This compilation album remains the best introduction to the body of work Bowie produced in the first decade and a half of his still vibrant career.
Paradise Lost
 It was on the second viewing that I found that yes, while the sound is great; there is a weakness in the visual department. The quality of the video is fine, but the things that are presented are lacking for two reasons. First, except for a few times, the camera work is too kinetic. It is as if there was a 10 second rule... no static shot for longer than 10 seconds... really, try counting to 10 (or even 5) during any part of the film. You just start to watch Gilmour tear into a solo, and then they change the image to the back-up singers who are only swaying while not actually singing. Or they do some bang, bang, bang thing where they go drummer, bass player, back-up singer, guitar, drum, horn, all too rapidly to appreciate the actual skill of the person that should be getting a long single framed shot at that specific time. The other problem is that the band is playing in a giant venue and there is a terrific light and laser show going on that encompasses the entire arena. There is no way to experience the effect that the audience was seeing on a T.V. screen, yet the video keeps trying by putting too many long shots, where the band looks like ants and the screen is washed out with strobes and laser beams. The resulting effect is one that both takes away from the musical performance while rendering the light show as a small unimpressive thing. I want to see Pink Floyd up-close and on full screen, not the view that the people in last row had. There was way too many of these long shots, and often right when you would wish to be watching the actual musicians produce that great sound. If there was ever a case for the multiple angle potential of the DVD, this would be it. They had the footage, so allow the viewer to watch what they want, a close-up of the band or tiny ants that you are told are Pink Floyd washed out in a light show. In the future I can see myself putting this on as a music only DVD (with the T.V. turned off) quite often and enjoying the sonic experience without the jerky camera work.

Norman doesn't play too much of this "fast stuff" anymore, but his lines still have a driving forward motion to them that make even the fastest tunes here, like "Salt Creek", sound relaxed and effortless. I always wished he'd do a fingerpicking record as I think he's underrated in that regard. "Down At Milow's House" has a parlor-classical poise to it that almost reminds me of John Renbourn. I was familiar with his duet with Bromberg on "Arkansas Traveller" first before hearing this solo version.

9794	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In 1977, David Bowie relocated to Berlin and engaged "non-musician" Brian Eno in a partnership that would span three albums, "Low" being the first.  Bowie was riding on a creative high after the triumph of "Station to Station" whereas Eno was entering one of the most fertile periods of his career.  The resulting collaboration was extraordinary-- Eno seems to have a way of getting the best out of anyone he collaborates with, and this is no exception.  "Low" may be, for all intents and purposes, Bowie's masterwork.
I highly recommend this CD.

I came here to see the BAND, so the incompetent post-production personnel should've known better and kept the focus SOLELY ON THE BAND!  (Ugh!  Those "films" are offensively lame!!)
Not to mention the music. Buckmaster's orchestral arrangements are soaring. Davey Johnstone lends his madolin guitar for "Holiday Inn" and Rick Wakeman of Yes fame plays the organ on "Razor Face". Every song will invite the listener to sing along even after the most cursory listen. The sound on this remastered version captures the big, theatrical sound of Elton's music. There isn't a weak song here. While this is not Elton's most known work, it may well be his best.
The best track is the title track. Simple and relatively clean with Warnes' voice up front and center with the instruments mostly unprocessed and honest. But even this wonderful little song is weighed down at times with layers of overdubs put down by someone with auditory horror-vacui.
I have a lot of good memories connected to Born in the U.S.A.  I remember when this album came out, and I was barely starting kindergarten.  Back then it almost seemed natural that this commercial album would be the next direction Bruce would take his music, and a HUGE feeling came over many of us before this album was released that his incredibly popularity was just around the corner.  It's a feeling I've had for years, and one I've never forgotten.  This album just feels like it was meant to exist.
"Cost of livin' gets so high

Lyrically, this album's hardly mindblowing, at least not compared to his Beatles work.  But its clever and irreverent enough to be interesting.  The songs on Ram lack the syrupy sentimentality of many of his other solo songs (like My Love, Silly Love Songs, No More Lonely Nights.)  At the risk of overstating the case, Ram is more Neil Young than Neil Diamond.  It's really a rock album with a lot of emotion, sprinkled, of course, with a bit of Paul's cheekiness.
This is the real deal, music played by true bluesmen that were not in it for the money.
I am now 17, and this album still amazes me like it did when I was 9. The production still sounds fresh and innovative while Tip & Phife's lyrics do not sound dated at all. A Tribe Called Quest were really ahead of their time, and their music will be enjoyed by hip-hop fans past, present, and future. "Award Tour," "Electric Relaxation," "Oh My God," "Midnight," "Lyrics To Go," etc. are some of the best songs hip-hop has produced. If you are a fan of hip-hop, you MUST own this album. Seriously, if you don't have it, go out and buy it IMMEDIATELY!

5. Take It!- (7/10) Funny little skit by Biggie.
9332	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I bought AEnima after I had worn out Undertow, the second Tool release.  Tool kind of did the whole rise to stardom thing backwords. Instead of becoming popular with an independent-sounding record, Undertow was a mainstream album.  AEnima is not a mainstream record.  An aggressive, satirical, nightmarish blend of insane vocals, drums (Danny Carey's arms must have been ready to fall off after this album), heavy bass, and distorted guitars is definitely not for everyone.  The rythm changes so much in these songs that one track sounds like three seperate ones.  The artwork is extremely disturbing, but also kind of hilarious, and very original (I like the animated artwork of the West coast, the eye, and the contorsionist).  Tracks on this CD to look out for - "Stinkfist" (very listenable), "Eulogy" (thought-provoking piece on religion), "H" (had to get some new headphones after listening to this a little too high), "46 & 2" (oh YEAH), and "AEnima" (one of the greatest songs ever).  But don't get me wrong, "Hooker w/ a Penis" (hilarious in a dark sort of way), "Die Eier Von Satan" (a recipe in German), and "Third Eye" are all great.  Listen closely to the first part of "Eye," it's pretty funny.  The only song I really don't get is "Message to Harry Manback," but hey, that's what the skip track button is for.

Personally, I wish "TVC 15" was thrown on here but I'm not complaining.

6626	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I was 21 when this came out but was not a big Eagles fan since I was a musical snob and they were a comercial success.  When the title track hit the airwaves, I heard a plagerized version of "We Used to Know" by Jethro Tull. It has an almost identical chord progression. But then again, I was a musical snob.  Now, in my aged wisdom, I have dropped all the snobbery and have given this "album" a second listen.  While it's not in my top 10, it's up there on my list of great albums.  I actually always liked "The last resort" for it's message and sonic appeal.  I was also a Joe Walsh fan from his James Gang and early solo work (FM radio only!) but never liked his squeaky voice.  His brilliat guitar work made up for it.  So Walsh on guitar with the other Eagles professionals made for flawless rockin riffs.  I also have changed my opinion of "Victim of love". In my snobby days, I scoffed at it's simplicity, being more attracted to complex musical forms, but now.... it has become one of my favorite songs BECAUSE of it's simplicity!  (The excellent guitar work helps, too!)  Anyway, this old non-fan is now a new fan.  I may even go out and get tickets to see the old geezers before they expire!
When Jennifer Warnes released this collection of Cohen songs, she was preeminently qualified to do so, having performed with Cohen both in concert and on recordings as a back up singer.  Here she put together a wonderful selection of Cohen's finest songs and reinterpreted them from a female perspective.  On some songs this took minimal efforts, such as "Joan of Arc."  In concert Cohen had often had either Warnes of Julie Christensen to sing the part of Joan, while taking the part of fire himself.  This is, however, the one studio recording that presents how Cohen performs the song life, Warnes becoming a tragic Joan and Cohen joining on her the album to be her fire.  Cohen also gave Warnes one of his best songs to debut, "First We Take Manhattan."  It is a glorious, bizarre, fierce attack on eighties cultural pretensions, provocatively bathing it in fascist imagery, a song that proved that Cohen, who was at the time this album was released was considered past his prime, could still pen a magnificent song.  "Song of Bernadette" is another highlight on the album, but my favorite number on the album is Warnes's extraordinary cover of the album's title cut, "Famous Blue Raincoat."  Cohen sang it originally as a 4 a.m. letter to his wife's seducer, who has left NYC to live elsewhere.  The calm and cool exterior of the words belies the hidden pain and passion that have caused him to write.  As Warnes sings it, she becomes not the offended party, but a concerned, saddened friend of all.  The shift in viewpoint alters the song entirely.  And Warnes sings it with all the power of a great chanteuse.

The experiences of growing up in depression years gives him a determined I will never give up attitude.  I love that his son, Eddy plays guitar on this album (now deceased).  Both Brother Phelps and Waylon Jennings guest on this album--great performances.  Billy wrote so many hits for Waylon--his famous outlaw songs.

"African Night Flight" is a hodgepodge of a track with "cricket menace" by Eno, weird jungle sounds, quickly-sung vocals, and some African tribal sounds.  The words "asanti habari" and "asanti nabana" is Swahili for "hello" and "goodbye" respectively.
It starts off with black-and-white footage of her performing at a very young age and traces her career from the early days up until her death. It's a joyful video which focuses on her life and career, and doesn't dwell on her murder, and makes no mention of Yolanda Saldivar. There's concert, video and interview footage with Selena's humor to go with it all. This video is awesome.
Of course, the record company robs us of "I Pray, Ole" in this remastered reissue. But noticing the current rate of the anniversary packaged albums being produced maybe we'll see something (however I wouldn't hold my breath).
 It's the final song "Parents", which is a supersonic power rock ballad that elevates you through the stratosphere. A song very similar in structure to "Led Zeppelins" "Stairway To Heaven", Burke Shelley sings of the torment of turning from child to parent, hitting the heart fair and square with Mott who has a few puppies of his own. This song alone makes this album worth hunting down.
I give it 5 stars ONLY because I can't give it more. It deserves it.

3547	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Am I not hearing something here?  First of all, back in the day Santana could kick out some sweet jams.  His guitar work has always been excellent. What the hell is this though?  Aside from the excellent "Put Your  Lights On", the rest sounds like either some record exectutives  power-lunch meeting deal signing or Muzak guest starring some guy who  sounds like Carlos Santana.  After winning all those grammys I decided to  borrow this from my girlfriend and honestly I can't hear what all the fuss  is about.  From the first time I heard "Smooth" and "Maria  Maria" I should have known this was going to suck.  Looking over the  credits it seems Carlos had writing credits on about 3 songs which means he  pretty much phoned in a performance, had his name put on it, and sold a  bunch of records with a little help from his "friends".  You want  a real comeback album that's worth the hype and Grammy attention?  Pick up  Bob Dylan's "Time out of Mind".  Guess what?  On that one the guy  who has his name on the album cover actually writes and sings the songs he  is playing.  Novel concept these days.

Even if you don't like anything about Tool, you should download Opiate the song just for the secret song, The Gaping Lotus Experience.  It's hilarious and tells a great story.  Sure, this is Tool's most lacking album but anyone who's heard their later stuff knows that this was just a warm-up.
(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction (Extended Version)  7:23
You don't hear many albums like Uncle Meat. Even in the context of 1969 experimentation,  Zappa's ideas are simply too esoteric and sophistacated for mass conception. Only very obscure bands like Henry Cow even hinted at picking up Uncle Meat's massive torch. In an age of Hendrix, Joplin, and Led Zeppelin blasting out flame-thrower blues, Zappa's brillant, mad-geunius confetti was bound to get lost beneath the whale of Stratocasters.

This work is full of absurd humour, which probably only the band members truly understand, but musical jokes like God bless America can still be funny or at least make you smile. The whole album sounds like that Frank Zappa had a very weird dream and he put it on the album. I think this album is more mysterious than many psychedelic albums and this album actually contains one of the best psychedelic songs of all time Mr. Green Genes. The album has a tight absurd atmosphere, if you listen it throught. It contains some of the most imaginative and brilliant popular music ever Electric aunt Jemina, Uncle meat, Mr. Green Genes, Uncle meat variations and Dog breath in the year of plague. It breaks many barriers of popular music and turns everything upside down. It is not perfect. Some of the material is absolutely crap, but it is the brilliant and the most unique work ever. I'm a poet and this work has inspired me more than any other. In Uncle meat Frank Zappa has once again created a new musical universe. Certainly not a starting point for your Frank Zappa collection, but if you already own some Frank Zappa albums, give it a try. I highly recommend this for you.

This soundtrack has a lot of added tracks that was either  previously unreleased, or tracks that contain previously unreleased  material. The unreleased stuff is pretty good, but it follows with the  movie too much and doesn't really go through smoothly. Another great  addition to the CD is the 24 page booklet with interviews and other  assorted sketches and photos of the movie. This is a wonderful soundtrack  with lots of upbeat sounds, just like in it's impressive theme music.

6910	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is the most "Beatlesque" of all of Paul's post-Fab Four output. This is also his most "English" album...kind of his "Waterloo Sunset"; songs that seem inspired by living the  pastoral British rural life. I don't understand why many dismiss this album  as a trifle..perhaps because it only yielded one "greatest  hit"--"Uncle Albert"? At any rate, there isn't one weak cut  one here, even the one or two-minute "filler" tunes that have an  endearingly rough "home demo" sound (reminiscent of  "McCartney"). There are cuts like "Back Seat Of My  Car", with a melody line and vocal harmony arrangement that would make  Brian Wilson weep; the great country-blues "Heart of the  Country"; the dead-on Elvis vocal impression on the infectious rocker  "Smile Away"...the list goes on and on. This British import  reissue also wisely includes the A + B sides of the 45 that was released at  the same time and didn't appear on the original album: "Another  Day" and "Oh Woman Oh Why". Excellent remastering on this  disc also--far superior to the domestic US version.

Superhuman-10/10:Starts off with a hard riff and loud base line, but slows down to just Weiland singing. But soon after the first chorus, it picks up to be a very hard-rocker! Slash's solo sounds very spooky and follows the song's tone to a tee!

I think, personally, that if you don't like at least 75% of a CD within the first couple of listens, it isn't worth it. I've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me, but I still think it is not that good.

423	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Unlike SLASH's first post-VELVET REVOLVER solo album, which featured a myriad of guest singers and musicians, Apocalyptic Love sees the former Gunner re-team with the nucleus of his touring band - vocalist Myles Kennedy (ALTER BRIDGE), bassist Todd Kerns (SIN CITY SINNERS) and drummer Brent Fitz (UNION) - for an absolutely rockin' 13-song soundtrack to the summer of 2012. First single `You're A Lie' continues to dominate North American radio airwaves; and with good reason, it's so damn catchy! Hands down, second single should be `No More Heroes', another ridiculously infectious tune. The key to both of these gems lies in their irresistible hooks and sing-along choruses. Admittedly, some of the other cuts, such `Hard & Fast' and `Standing In The Sun' - which bears a slight resemblance to GUNS N' ROSES' `Locomotive' with its rumbling riff - are growers, requiring a few listens before they too rattle around your brain long after the disc's done. Mid-way through, `Anastasia' offers a beautiful acoustic intro followed by a superb picking pattern, while `Not For Me' takes things down a notch, allowing Myles to show his tender side. Throughout the entire album, Slash solos effortlessly and admirably; proving he truly is a guitar icon without parallel. The deluxe edition of Apocalyptic Love includes two bonus tracks: `Carolina', which sees Slash hit the talk box, and `Crazy Life', guaranteed to have your foot stompin' before you know it. Also included in the deluxe version is a free t-shirt offer and bonus 30-minute DVD comprised of interviews with each of the four guys, providing insight into the creative process, as well as footage of the band rehearsing and  recording a handful of songs live off the floor at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood, CA. Pity the lyrics weren't included in the booklet, but it's hard to imagine Apocalyptic Love sounding any better; as the only album to top it thus far this year is VAN HALEN's A Different Kind Of Truth.

There would be no more hit singles after that, although there would be four more single releases in 1966/67 and one additional LP - Everyone's Gone To The Moon (LRP-3471/LST-7471) in 1966. With one exception none of the 8 singles sides appeared on any of the albums, that exception being a cover of the Norma Tanega hit, Walkin' My Cat Named Dog, which was the flip of Balboa Blue on Liberty 55925 in 1966.

Goodbye: 8/10
Initially, this is a much heavier album than Speak for Yourself and Imogen's voice is much more prominent with the music and her voice both taking center stage. There is less of a submission into sound as she seems to be a little more aggressive and less sultry as in her later creations like Goodnight and Go.
Fresh from his reunion album with Lou Reed - 'Songs For Drella', dedicated to their common friend and idol Andy Warhol - Cale returned from several years' rest with this one-time concert, which proves to be the most accessible recording of his that can be found. Cale appears with nothing but a piano (and occasional acoustic guitar) in this concert, and with all the production, noise and sonic experimentation removed, Cale is revealed as a remarkably talented performer, fantastic musician and especially brilliant songwriter, as his marvelous lyrics and melodies sound better here than anywhere else. Songs like 'Ship of Fools' and 'Thoughtless Kind'- barely audible in the original studio releases - sound incredibly new here.

Included are some of the best visuals I've ever seen - I can't listen to songs like Bedtime Story without seeing those doves and the floating Madonna's; Frozen, one of the best songs she's ever recorded, actually makes you cold - the picture indeed matches the song.
The album is very good.  It's got a variety of styles from rock, synth, pop, Latin, reggae.  I think the weakest songs are Words in My Mouth and Le Bleu.  They may take time to grow on me.  But the rest of the album is good all the way through on the first listen.  The bonus tracks are actually more enjoyable than those two tracks, imo.  Especially Horizontal Twist.  My favorites are What I Heard, The End of the End, Girlie Girlie, and Love Doesn't Frighten Me, all excellent, very catchy songs.  Hopefully What I Heard will be released as a single.  It's got an 80s new wave sound that I love.  I've listened to the live versions many times.  The other songs are good too but these four stood out most to me so far.  I think the album is strongest in it's first half.  Horizontal Twist probably would've worked on the standard edition of the cd rather than just a bonus, because the album really picks up again when that one comes on.  Debbie's voice is as strong as ever.  She sounds very youthful especially on songs such as opening track D-Day and the other faster & upbeat songs.
Given the above, this album has become one of those classic impossible not to have in every serious collection of music representative of this extraordinary and magical decade.

And now it gets better and more hilarious every time I watch it.

But even I have to acknowledge that he's simply one of the all-time great guitarists, even if a lot of what he's done isn't to my liking. For many, even Clapton-detractors, Cream is without a doubt the finest and most interesting band he ever played in. Each of the three musicians had experience before, so they were no strangers to music when they got together in 1966 and recorded and released their debut, Fresh Cream. That one was more pop-oriented, but the blues influence was still there, as there were covers of blues songs. Disraeli Gears is without a doubt the band's high point, which included several songs that became radio staples ("Sunshine of Your Love", "Strange Brew", etc.). The band moved to psychedelia which really served them well.

Unfortunately, my next experience with Zappa was the Sheik Yerbouti album, which is nothing at all like this. I'm glad I heard this first, or I would probably have never bought another Zappa album. This album has some terrific instrumentals that really defy categorization. Jazz influenced for sure, but certainly it is not jazz. There is a lot of humour in it at times, and some unusual sounds. Made by what, I dunno. My favourite track is the 18 minute plus "The Little House I used to live in" which features 2 fine piano solos, a violin solo and an organ solo. The organ being played by Zappa. Also included are 2 vocals, the doo-wop "WPLJ" and "Valarie". As good as they are though, the instrumentals are certainly the stand outs.
Now after a long series of rehabs, cleanups, and AA meetings, most of the surviving ex- Guns `N' Roses members have come together as Velvet Revolver.  They say they are all clean and sober now-and so who do they choose as a lead singer?  Scott Wieland.  An interesting choice in that most of us had been expecting to open the newspaper some morning and read a story about authorities finding Wieland dead in an apartment somewhere of an apparent drug "misfortune".  Still, recovering junkies and alcoholics do tend to pull for each other.  And for all his faults, Wieland does have a dynamite voice.
  Awesome video. The video features Madonna in the Mujave Desert in California. The physical tone of the video is very dim, like a gothic-night time look. Madonna is featured in a long, pitch-black wig and a pitch-black dress. Her hands are covered with henna tattoos. Very creep, but amazing.
04. Time To Chill: Like the title suggests, this one slows it down a bit with a slower, more chill beat. The Fresh Prince plays off the production nicely, and spends a lot of the tune rapping about the beat. It's a solid change of pace for the structure of the record thus far.

Each of the 14 tracks on this album clearly show where Smitty's heart is: pointing to the Lord. The wide range of messages found on this album will result in one or more of them hitting the heart of all who listen.
Now, it's smooth sailing for the more conventional listeners. "My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama" is a classic tune, and an obvious hard-rock parody. Of all of Zappa's tunes, this one should be on regular classic-rock radio rotation. "Oh No" is possibly my all-time favorite Zappa tune. Obviously addressed to the Student Left/Hippies of the late sixties, it also sure sounds like an open letter to John Lennon. The title kind of spells it out, too. "Oh No". Ono. Didja get it? Vocalist Ray Collins sounds great! "The Orange County Lumber Truck" gives us a smooth ride down tonality lane with some great Zappa guitar & some fantastic drumming from Art Tripp. Maybe ironically, I find the screeching title track to be the least controversial thing on here. Maybe at the time it was shocking and/or grating, but it's merely a cliche now.

The vacation worked. Creativity abounds in this fantastic return. Observations are readily available, and these two will always twist them into a delicious musical adventure.

These are basically the highlights, along with "Forty Six & Two", with its unforgettable and unmistakable bass line. What keeps me from giving this album five stars is the weaker numbers like "Hooker With a Penis" and "Die Eier Von Satan" and also how this still feels a bit all over the place and in need of some tyding up. A handful of classic Tool songs isn't enough to make a classic album just by itself and nima I think suffers from that. The album that would follow five long years later would fill in those blanks perfectly, though.
I'm a firm believer in cheating with Desert Island Picks, by choosing box sets.  If I had the choice of one Zappa release to sustain me in isolation, I would not have to think for very long, because Lther has it all.  The ultimate FZ representation, hands down.
Loving The Alien-10/10: Another slow song, Weiland's vocals sound very heart-broken, and Slash's acoustic guitar playing might even bring tears to the soft-hearted. Great solo from Slash,and this song perfectly end this great album on a soft note!
10.  Homeless Few - this is the last ballad and song on the album.  In fact, it is probably my fav of the album.  Sure, it's a ballad, but listen to the lyrics.  They have a real message that hits home and the music behind it really helps in the presentation.  I normally like Greg Volz era ballads, but this one really speaks to me and John and co. do such a great job on this.  This would be one I would want to hear live.  They were very bold in this song but in a way that hits us in our hearts.  There is a message here that we are not to forget those right here who need help.  I think that helping others is great but sometimes we help so many people so far away that we forget that there are people right here that need the help.  We need to help right here so we can help everywhere else better.  Their message was very clear here and the music itself is just so good.  The chord transitions and such is just great.  If I am not mistaken, John Lawry wrote the music on this one?  Yep, I just checked the liner notes and he wrote the music.  As a keyboardist myself, I've always admired his writing and arranging abilities and it shows here.

"Wasted Time". Don does ballads like no other. Raspy voiced yet hits the high notes with no problem... just beautiful, the "reprise" was kind of unnecessary, but not a big deal. Might have made more sense for the album.

If you have the overpriced CD set, you already know the general structure of the concert. (Why is the CD still in print while it's impossible to get a legal copy of this video?)Only part of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" is played, and much of the beginning of the show is dedicated to songs from Floyd's then-current album "Momentary Lapse of Reason." These songs have aged better than you might expect, particularly "On The Turning Away," although Gilmour's voice is a little rough at the start. We then get a great version of "One of These Days" and we plunge headlong into "Dark Side of the Moon" territory, with a couple of choice highlights from both "Wish You Were Here" and "The Wall." The band's versions of "Us and Them," and "Time" are particularly nice.

[4:10] Too Many People
although rather listless at times, 'lodger,' is full of great, often fun songs. there is plenty of keyboard experimentation (the best track of which is easily, 'repetition,') but there is also a vital return to his use of soulful, dancable beats and the stripped down rock 'n' roll he so obviously loves. the three songs that best portray his departure are the sensuous, 'dj,' the frantic (and even harrowing) beats of, 'look back in anger,' and the simply wonderful, 'boys keep swinging,' an invigorating little camp rocker that hints at bowie's infamous gay undertones.

We thought that our baby hated being swaddled, but that wasn't true! You have to swaddle and rock him.... and put him on his stomach or side, its amazing watching these babies in the video just immediatly stop fussing and become calm. There IS a calming reflex, and knowing how to trigger it is a very important part of parenting a newborn. This video came too late for my first baby, but I will CERTAINLY use it for my next one! I really wish that I had known about it before. EVERY PARENT should watch this video before and shortly after having a baby. It is amazing how well it works for newborns. I did try it with my 2 month old, and it did work, but he was a little old to be used to it anymore! BUT I HIGHLY recommend this video to EVERY PARENT! its AWESOME!!!!

Ms. Brightman is such an astoundingly pretty woman, and she absolutely glows throughout the whole production. She doesn't have as much makeup on as in La Luna, but honestly she doesn't need it.

Meanwhile over at Capitol, ENDLESS SUMMER was riding high. For this 20-song set, Capitol recycled some strong pre-PET SOUNDS material, and included album cuts of three singles. Mike Love helped with track selection and even suggested the LP's title. The album hit #1 nationwide and stayed on Billboard's LP chart for three years. Its strength of sales along with Capitol's follow-up, the #8 peaking Gold Record,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SPIRIT-OF-AMERICA/dp/B000LPD0SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SPIRIT OF AMERICA</a>&nbsp;(1975), literally revived the group's fortunes and coffers.
Then, in 1967, he volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps, and served with honor in Vietnam. In 1970, he was decorated with the Bronze Star, two Silver Stars, the Croix de Guerre and the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving an entire batallion of U.S. soldiers in DaNang by boring three regiments of Viet Cong to death with an acoustic version of his signature tune, "Born to Run." His experiences in Vietnam served as first-person source material for his album, "Born in the U.S.A."

However, if you twist my arm, I will tell you that (Da Le) Yaleo, Love of My Life, Migra, Corazon Espinado, The Calling, and --yes, I will spoil it-- the "extra track" are all awesome!  The extra track is really just an extention of The Calling.  It adds about four minutes to the song.

Filmed, rather than videotaped, "Movin' With Nancy" has a lush quality unusual in specials of the era. Sinatra's cinematic duet with Lee Hazelwood on "One Velvet Morning" is presented like a filmed poem, something Edgar Allen Poe might have imagined if he hadn't been so gloomy.

I've seen his Tsaichovsky with Karajan when he was around 13. From this DVD, we can see his fingers and hand position much more clearly. Very high bridge and very unique indeed. He has small hands and rather delicate fingers, but his fingers are so independent as could be seen from the way they curl or lift separately from each other when he is playing. Tachnically he is amazing if not stunning and his rhythm is clearcut or perhaps too clearcut.

Years ago, friends and I began using the LP of this album when evaluating audio components.  To understand why, just play "Toccata" at a relatively high volume.  This disc has lively, dynamic music that has been blessed with outstanding recording quality.  To appreciate it at it's best, I recommend that you turn out all of the lights and crank up Toccata - that's what I dubbed the standard darkness test.  Towards the end of the tune, there are some incredible drum sounds.  Classic Fresh Aire !

Being an almost-elderly fan of the EAGLES, I had not had this album in CD format, thus was ordered.
The title track contains one of the prettiest guitar solos of all time, and the song itself is a treat. New Kid In Town harks back to the early Eagles sound, while Life In The Fast Lane brings Walsh' skills to the fore as well as Felder's. Wasted Time slows things down one more time and is a great if cliched ballad, due to the nevertheless beautiful string arrangement.
I'll admit that  at first I wasn't too pleased with this CD, but the more I listened to it,  the more it grew on me and now I listen to it constantly.  Every song on  this disc is great!

8690	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This was noteworthy at one time for being the only way you could get most of the album "New York London Paris Munich" on CD.  The differences make it an interesting collectable; it omits the updated disco medley of "Moderne Man/Satisfy Your Lust", and presents both songs in their original format, when both tracks were split into a 7" single.  It is an odd choice, since both of the songs are recorded in a style that owes more to glam rock than disco, and they sound at odds with the rest of the tracks.  This isn't an album proper, however.  It also contains the original B-side to "Pop Muzik", "M Factor", and this particular compilation remains the best way to own that track (the eventual issue of "New York London Paris Munich" on CD contained a wealth of bonus material, but the bonus tracks are all linked together and contain little fragments of one another at their beginnings and ends).

It turns out, in this celebrity world filled with artists who bounce back and forth between rehab, bad relationships, and other cutting edge (self-destructive?) behavior, we have the rebel Imogen, who's absolutely positive, creative and sharing personality permeates everthing she does.  We also have alot of artists, who really aren't much more than their promotion, publicists, and plastic surgeons.  Immi's musical talent is the real thing - watch her lay out a complicated, multi-track song playing solo, on stage, in front of thousands of people.  Its amazing.

There are, as I have said, some negatives.  For me the most irritating is that the cameras had very limited angles to film the concert.  Almost all of the concert seems to have been covered by two cameras, one onstage that seems to linger almost exclusively on stage left (the right side viewed from the audience or camera) and one that is in front of the stage.  The result is a feeling of constriction, as if you aren't really getting a good view of what is going on.  This is exacerbated by a tendency (primarily early in the performance) of the cameramen shaking the camera while filming the performers, as if an active, dynamic camera produces results preferable to a static one.  As is always the case, they were wrong (one of the great benefits of Jonathan Demme's STOP MAKING SENSE is that since then almost all concert footage has been shot with rather static cameras).  The problems aren't restricted to the visual.  The sound, while not exactly muddy, isn't as crisp as one could hope.
7908	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I'm writing this review partially from memory. This was a favorite early 70's album, but in recent years I've only heard about half the tracks. This was RT's first statement after leaving Fairport Convention, where he pioneered revolutionary fusion of traditional ballads and rock. This album was an admirable step forward, reaching heigths that he only occasionally touched during the Richard & Linda years and only truly exceeded with Rumor and Sigh almost 2 decades later. There are some throwaways here, but the best songs are rich with humor, invention, and emotion. I haven't heard "The Old Changing Way" in 15 years, but it still moves me to tears. If any CD ever tempts me to spend $25 for an import, it would be this one.

I'm not a fan of the live stuff here. Drum solos aren't my thing, and 20 minutes of "Spoonful" is about 14 minutes too long. The studio cuts are top notch and remain ahead of their time.

Corea is the best fusion composer and his bandmates Weckl and Patitucci are sometimes even claimed to be the very best musicians on their instruments.

It takes at least a high intelligence to recognize genius, it's a judgement call and I'm making it - Bill Hicks was a genius in every way.  What Bill did, was make blow holes right through most of humanity's rediculous hypocrisies and superstitions.  And he's not a snob with language, which is great.  Sometimes in life you have to say the "F" word, and Bill uses it like the artist he was.  "Here's politics in America: 'I'm going to vote for the puppet on the left'...'I think the puppet on the right is more to my view...wait a minute!  There's one guy holding up both puppets!!!!'  GO BACK TO SLEEP AMERICA, YOUR GOVERNMENT IS IN CONTROL!".  I've never heard the truth about politics put so succinctly and yet so accurately.  Bill knew how to perceive evil for what it is - well, evil.  We have been so conditioned by mass media that when someone like Bill comes along and speaks the truth, some of us recoil.  Not me.  First of all, he's right.  And, being very like Bill Hicks myself, I must say something.  Buy this cd NOW.  You have to, buh buh buh, you have no choice.  Buy it - you need to hear this.  Buy EVERYTHING that Bill Hicks has put out, because in this fascist world we live in it's not too long before material like this will be deleted forever.

Though Warnes had long been known as a gifted singer, this was her break out album.  She emerged from the back ranks of American singers to become known as one of the premiere interpreters of song in America.  And the album did more than merely establish Warnes as an important artist.  Leonard Cohen, after great initial success in the late sixties and decreasing but definite success in the seventies, was in the eighties in a period of decline.  More and more, his albums tended to contain a few amazing songs with some astonishing bland ones.  Too often the gems were ignored in favor of the weak cuts.  There had been a decided drop in quality of his albums for some time.  But FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT created a new interest in Cohen, and only a year later, Cohen capitalized on the success of Warnes's album in general and her cover of "First We Take Manhattan" to put it on a new album of songs, his best album sing his SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN debut.  I'M YOUR MAN started off with "First We Take Manhattan" (which was made into an MTV video) but progressed to a very strong set of songs, including not just "I'm Your Man," "Ain't No Cure" (another song Warnes had covered on her album), and "Tower of Song," to what might be his greatest song of the past twenty years, "Everybody Know," a scathing dissection of sexual mores in the post-sexual revolution generation.  Not just this, the success of FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT and I'M YOUR MAN led to a reexamination of Cohen's more recent albums, and from them a number of masterpieces were rediscovered, most prominently "Hallelujah" from 1985's VARIOUS POSITIONS.
Yassassin (Turkish For Long Live) is perhaps the most culture-tinged piece of the album, with some odd Mid-Eastern feel, hence the name.  This song was actually released as a promo single in--guess where--Turkey.  It's obvious that Bowie was determined to get a certain feel out of this song as concerned with style, and he pulled it off well.

If you are looking for a single collection that best comprises the best of Roy Orbison's most formative years, then this is the one to go for. It is comprised of all of the original recordings, performed with the original backing band. I have listened to this album again and again, and am always amazed by just how terrific, and almost operatic a voice Roy had, and how well he fashioned it as an unrivaled instrument for the dramatic delivery of an astounding string of popular hits. It will make for endless hours of melancholy recollections with the singular sound and undisputed best voice in rock and roll, as Elvis Presley himself referred to Orbison. Enjoy!.
All the members of the band are older now, and it shows--but that is not necessarily a bad thing, for although they have lost some of the brilliant spark that fueled their early recordings and concerts they have gained a tremendous amount of control.  And it shows in the music.  From the concert's opening with "The Chain" all the way to the traditional close with Christine McVie's solo on "Songbird," everything is slick and flawless.  And the highlights are many.

Shatner doesn't sing so much as speak the lyrics to the songs he covers just like with the recent Best Buy commercials. Anyway, this would be a great "bad" gift to give someone. Shatner!! ...What a bloated cornball.
Sarah has so much talent to spare, she makes singing appear easy, almost as if she were conversing with us. She emotes sincerity, a love for the song, and a love for performing it for us. During the opening piece, "Eden," she rises from a red-draped divan -- an allusion to the album from which the newest songs for this show are selected -- dressed in a silk, black gown accessorized with a filigreed breastplate fashioned after the attire of Nordic goddesses, a nod to her theatrical roots and denoting her pop-opera fusion. She then allures us with her supple, ornamented, genteel hands as she details the shortcomings in a previous friendship. The song conveys a longing to make the friendship whole, to finish what was left unrealized. In the context of this show, the audience is now the friend, and she seduces us into putting aside our misgivings with the promise that she will attain completeness with us. She more than meets her obligation. For the rest of the program, you'll be spellbound.
The Medallion introduces the a mysterious theme in french horn,pus a little part for the nazis (later to be better developped in Last Crusade).
I'm sure there are those that don't like the music of Glass and Adams because they find it "too radical," and they'd still rather listen to Beethoven.  My view is that music such as CENTURY ROLLS is reactionary, a bankable but aesthetically bankrupt formula.

This album will help you. I've bought many CDs in my life time. Some I keep around just for an occaisonal listen. Some i pawn two days after buying it. And then there are those that I will keep till the day I die. Aenima is one of them. You just can't go wrong with this album.

6564	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Each cut on this album is a gem unto itself.  The arrangements are diverse, each individually tailored to the piece at hand, and the music covers a wide range from Renaissance carols to 20th century tunes like "Winter Wonderland".  The instruments themselves range from bagpipes to acoustic strings to "vocalized" trumpets (on "Silent Night") and the original singing Donald Duck (on "We Wish You a Merry Christmas").  Beauty and humor both abound.  I'm listening to this album as I write this review, and it's been a staple of my holiday celebrations for over 10 years.  Read the other reviews for more specifics on the musicians, but all you need to know, really, is that they're all supurb.  Like all of the Grisman Quintet's albums, this one radiates the pure joy of making great music.  This is one holiday purchase you won't regret -- ever.
All of that being said, one of the many great things about The Sounds of `66 is the fact that a number of these tracks aren't readily available on other albums, at least not that I know of. I can't remember which female artist made I Know a Place famous, but Sammy truly brings the song to life in a wholly new form. What Did I Have That I Don't Have? is perhaps my favorite song on this CD; it starts a little slowly, but Sammy fills it with enough passion and emotion that it is all but flammable by the time he gets through with it. Once in Love With Amy and If It's the Last Thing I Do are great songs I have not heard elsewhere. I never cared for What the World Needs Now Is Love until I heard Sammy sing it; he wails, producing a much more animated song than Burt Bacharach could even conceive of. One of my all-time favorite songs is What Now My Love?, and Sammy provides a rather unique version of it here. The song starts slowly, sounding almost like uninspired lounge music, but Sammy quickly picks up the tempo and energy, eventually drawing the most vocal audience response of the night. One selection that is admittedly rather strange is Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead from The Wizard of Oz. This ain't your Munchkins' version because Sammy belts this thing out and makes it a truly hip experience. Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone (which really showcases the talent of Buddy Rich on drums) closes out the set on the kind of high only Sammy could aspire to.
City To City is Gerry's career crowning achievement.  Gerry's solitary demeanor and shunning of publicity and its trappings limited his exposure to the music buying public, and to this day, many view Gerry as a "two-hit wonder".  But, alas, those that know Gerry Rafferty's career know him as a beacon of independent living: keeping the life he desired, rather than the one that others desired for him.  He was "true" for fulfilling his passion as a songwriter and singer, and not an empty passion for adulation and riches.  He took the road less traveled, and toured infrequently, and eventually saw his popularity wane as a result. Few other artists have forgone the spotlight  and wealth for a simple, straightforward lifestyle, and most who do are not recognized at all as their talents may be a shallow well. Rafferty, however, managed to walk that thread-fine line between being used by the record label like a ragged and worn mannequin, or fading away entirely. No, Gerry managed to hone his craft and play it right down the line, if you will, and remained alive and viable to those fans sincere to his music over decades. The constant fans appreciate that Gerald was as talented as the best of his contemporaries, the ones that had multiple gold records, but that he elected to live his life differently.  A man's worth, in the end, is in his ability to follow the beat of his own drummer.  And to this, one must raise a pint of stout to Gerry Rafferty.

I like the "country" flavor in Warnes' voice.  Joan of Arc is heard twice on this CD.  One is studio, and the other is live.  I like the "live" version better.  Great song.  Thank you for the care you took in this recording.  Buy this album.

Other audiences world-wide follow suit at his remarkable pianistic abilities. Perhaps Christopher Nupen said it best in the documentary itself, "This man has a gift, of its kind, one of the finest and one of the rarest [...] at this evening's recital [in the south of France], Evgeny will play over 30,000 musical notes, all in perfect sequence, all in delicate balance and all from memory. That is a feat beyond the imagination of most people. And he will do it with a limpid clarity given to very few. [...] Not now and again but again and again."

Overall, the show was very good. There are several times when you feel the absence of Roger Waters, especially in light of the band's reunion for Live 8. It was almost painful to watch "Comfortably Numb" where they used multiple singers and some electronics to do Roger's part. This might have been O.K. in 1994, but since the DVD of the full group from a year ago can be had, the 1994 performance pales until the Gilmour vocals and the great guitar work come in. In the hierarchy of what `Floyd fans have on DVD, this probably falls below that 20-some minutes from Live 8, and because of the audio quality above "Live at Pompeii". Still, it is nice to have this set after so long a wait.
6028	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This review is for the 2009 Salvo cd. I've been a huge fan of the Salvo reissues. Their A Salty Dog & Live With The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra are a very tiny handful of cds in my music collection that sound better than the vinyl. Nick Robbins, who's done all the remastering in this series, has done a superb job on those.
It is easy to see in the demeanor and facial expressions of the magnificent cast of artists that perform on the DVD, that they feel the same way about the boundless talent and persona of this icon.
What I admire about all the old legends from Sun Records is how original and unique they all were.  Elvis, Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash....they all developed their own individual styles and never wanted to sound like each other. The same can be said for the one and only Roy Orbison who was just as much his own man as the others were. Today's cookie-cutter pop, rock, and country clones would do well to take a lesson from these legendary pioneers and the originality they stood for.
5601	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I was always a critic when it came to judging albums for qualities, there are a lot of bands that lets face it, can't match up to the standards with the rest of the album, and usually only have maybe two hits played on the radio. I can actually say there are at least 7/10 songs I like on this album. I first reconized Gerry Rafferty way before I even knew his name and liked his stuff, try four years old, cause that was about the time this album came out. I've always liked the sax on 'Baker Street' and the album just packs the punch all the way thru with 'Right Down The Line' almost like a swing to it. The title track is pretty good to with a little country ting to it. Also 'Mattie's Rag', even though the clarinet is eerie on this song it still sounds good. The next one I like is 'Home and Dry', makes you feel like there's hope in any relation, but also good song. I also thought that 'Waiting For The Day' was a nice way to end a album, on a good note. Like I said, this album has good lyric writting in it, and also the music is very enjoyable, even for being almost thirty years old. And now as far as the title of my review, this album only has two songs played on the radio, and that's a crying shame, even his previous band the 'Stealer Wheels' had a few other good songs too besides the one they play all the time like 'Stuck In The Middle', yeh that's a good one, but what about 'Late Again', that one kicks too. Well anyways, this album is really good, and worth picking up.

Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when "Imperial Bedroom" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with "serious music" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley ("The Long Honeymoon") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like "In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman's shoes" would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the anger behind "Shabby Doll."

Then there's the rest of the album which I still think is very good. There's a couple songs that I'd file under "ok", but the majority is rock solid songwriting. Really good stuff, some of it bordering on soft rock, but I like that too. Lastly, love the album cover. I have it on vinyl, and recently bought the cd. Then I imported the disc to my itunes so now I never leave home without City To City.
What makes "Pulse" remarkable is the selection and order of the  songs played, and all done very musically and with precision.  Gilmour's  guitar work here is second to none.  This video is far superior to  "Delicate Sounds of Thunder" (which I also liked), in that the camera work  is seamless and stays focused on the members of the band.  If I find any  fault at all with this concert, it was in the saxophone player.  While he  played it straight, there wasn't much life breathed into it.  See Scott  Page's renditions in "Delicate Sounds of Thunder" to see what I mean.  Between 1 and 10, "Pulse" gets an enthusiastic 9.

The song, "Another Star" was originally a disco-styled Stevie Wonder tune from "Songs in the Key of Life," but the way Gene plays it, you'd think it was a swingin' jazz standard. Other notable tunes on the CD are "Black and Blue," in which Gene builds an amazing blues solo at a slow tempo; "Blue Bossa," which is done in a swing feel (I don't think Gene can NOT swing); and the amazing piano solo in "Will You Still Be Mine." Gene's powerful, yet clear-as-a-bell tone can overshadow the rest of the group, but it is worth mentioning that the guitarist, Ron Eschete plays some very tasty stuff too. Drummer Harold Jones and Bassist Luther Hughes don't get many solos, but they lay down a great swing feel. Being a jazz pianist myself, I transcribed Gene's solo on "Will You Still Be Mine." It took months, but I am proud to say that Gene's playing has influenced my own playing in a profound way. Buy this CD. It's a bargain and you'll never get tired of it.

Though I continued to like much of the Beatles music, both group and solo, this album proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only were the Beatles not Superman, they (or at least John) was capable of putting out embarassingly bad product.

The album has a slicker, more studio sound than his first album, but the songs follow the same simple formula.  The songs all sound like he could have written the entire album in a couple of hours.  But Mr. McCartney sings them wholeheartedly and puts his trademark charm into them, that you can't help but enjoy them.  "Too Many People" is a pleasant, acoustic number and "Three Legs" has a blues riff.  "Eat At Home" has a Buddy Holly influence while "The Back Seat Of My Car" is a pure pop pleasure.  "Smile Away" has an infectious chorus.  "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey" is an eccentric number that sounds like a left over from Sgt. Peppers.  It is the best song on the album and it became his first solo number one hit.

  6. Swing Down Sweet Chariot
Sound is paramount here; perhaps more so than song writing, but fortunately we have equal measures of both.  We quickly learn here is merely an insightful economy of words, presumably born of the cut-up technique.  Note the "new" sound from video games like Space Invaders on "What In The World" a sound no one would dare include on a record today, or even by the end of 1977, as it quickly became hackneyed.  Here, it remains a relic revealing a remarkable innovation, not quite forgotten 30 years later and appreciated all the more.  "Sound and Vision" flopped on the charts, but nonetheless captured the essence of that era, a little bit of the old 70s homage doo-wop, a danceable beat, and a great rock tune.  Lyrically it describes the state Bowie must have been in ("blue, blue . . . pale blinds drawn all day, wondering what to say . . . blue, blue") looking for a new direction, "...waiting for the gift of sound and vision."  "Sound and Vision" is so deconstructed it's almost produced backwards, brilliant.  "Always Crashing in the Same Car" includes savvy vocalizing by Bowie round a tune that is barely sung, revealing the poet in the pauper.  "Be My Wife" is a nostalgic return to the pauper's life, and perhaps the strongest song on the album.  Its directness is punk in attitude, yet really a catchy roadhouse piano tune, and a surprisingly perfect fit here.

This dvd was supposed to feature guest artists, Mick Fleetwood & Peter Frampton, however, you don't get to see very much footage of either of them, especially Peter Frampton. The entire concert only lasts about 57 minutes. It seems like there was a lot of expectations here for a longer, & more organized concert than what it turned out to be. Stevie's lead guitar player Waddy Wachel even seems to be frustrated in this dvd. He tried to "get down" and really jam on guitars with Peter Frampton, but it only happened to a very limited extent.

2466	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Stevie's voice is going through a slight change on this video but it was good vocals on it mostly, EXCEPT I didn't like low growls on Edge of 17 and "Talk To Me". "No Spoken Word"  I had never heard this  song before I bought the video but it is a good song and I like it. Stevie  of course does some changes to some of the songs lyrics.  The 15-minute  talking/singing version of "Edge of Seventeen" wasn't my  favorite. "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You" , was the  highlight for me because the vocals were very much like on the CD and it  was a good performance. The downside to this video was the annoying fake  close-ups which they made later and added to the video later.  I think  they tried TOO hard on special effects on this video. "I Need to  Know" was as usual, not too much changing. "Stand Back" was  Ok , with it's very long intro before the singing. The dance sequence  Stevie did with some guy was good in this song. I was dissapointed to see  Mick Fleetwood so little.  Stevie did a lot of dancing and some kicks  especially in "Stand Back"  . I liked "Outside the  Rain" but "Dreams" wasn't too good. "Beauty and the  Beast" is GREAT with nice vocals and the most beautiful sparkly white  long cape/shawl she wore.  The release of the "White winged  doves" after "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You" was  very cool and Stevie seemed to like it alot. The intro to the video with  the plane and the people goin up the mountain and Stevie waving to fans was  nice. Stevie was nice to greet the fans so much after the very long  "Edge of 17". It is a good video with nice vocals but definatly  not as good as her "In Concert" video from 1982 , maybe cuz it  was missing the FM Goodies such as "Gold Dust Woman" and  "Rhiannon". I would say it was worth the money and suggest buying  it!

Having been almost knee to knee with Roger Waters for the duration of about two hours, I had been converted. I saw them almost every time they came to Philly, including the concert where the fans dispensed with fences and swarmed into the arena - but who could blame them?
It is about the apocalypse, the destruction of the world and the calm aftermath. Also it is about judgement day and the fate of all. Brooker's tonal changes in this piece make it particularly effective. And I like Keith's lyric "God's alive inside a movie! Watch the silver screen!". Which leads one to ask if movies reflect reality or vice-versa? In any event, these songs will not let you rest and ignore it's themes. They make you recognize your own limitations in this life.

Thirty-six years later, in November 2007, James Taylor, Carole King and members of their renowned original band "The Section" (featuring guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell Kunkel) returned to the Troubadour for a three-night, six-show run to celebrate the venue's 50th anniversary. This CD/DVD captures the show in a 75 minute celebration of some of their greatest songs.
I truly adore this concert. Ms. Brightman brings all her talent and charisma one-hundredfold (like always) to this great performance and makes it stand out as possibly her best production to date.
I own most of Cale's albums and the three career retrospectives of his work. I like "Rainy Seasons" better than all of them because this live recording proves that Cale's music stands on the strength of his songwritting and doesn't need a lot of orchestration or post-production "enchancement" to work. The additional tracks that have been piggy-backed onto the original 1992 release make this CD a real dollar value.
The reason for this program, according to Anonymous 4, is because Hildegard's chants for the feast of St Ursula -- around which the program is based -- were intended for use in liturgical settings. Here the CD is divided into three sections, for Vigil (aka Matins), Lauds and Vespers. Hildegard's music would have been performed in such contexts.

I can be a witness to that from the Dominican Republic of the 1950's. This video shows Lanza and his life. When a supermega star like Placido Domingo decides to become the voice of this project then you should realize the greatness of Lanza.  I read a book on the life of Jussi Bjorling and is interesting to read about the friendship and respect this other megastar had for Lanza. This video is a must for the new generation of opera lovers or curious so they know who was the generator of opera as a more popular art form years before the three tenors. Juan Mansfield

The guys tell how they all met, what they think of the fans (the millions and millions of fans!), and what they like to do when they're not being *Nsync. The video contains five of their early videos: "I Want You Back", "Tearing Up My Heart", "God Must Have Spent A Little More Time", "For The Girl Who Has Everything" and (an added bonus) "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays". I was thrilled to see the holiday video because I had never seen it before, that goes for the other videos as well. =] The video also contains live performances from the Disney Channel Concert Special ("Tearing Up My Heart", "I Want You Back", "God Must Have Spent...") as well as some other live performances of "I Want You Back" and "Tearing Up My Heart".

This is about THAT unique.
For those familiar with the prior PULSE VHS, this is that concert, just looking and sounding better than you could EVER have imagined. I also really like having the films behind the band, chronicled for closeup viewing to music, in special features. I wish they would have included some material for concert B (which started with Astronome Domine, not Shine On), but, hey, you can't have everything. Simply put, a spectacular concert by a spectacular rock giant. I love it. Now, for Delicate Sound DVD. I say bring it on, Dave, the sooner the better. I love Pink Floyd. Had they left the One of These Days material in, I would have given it a 5.

Sadly they never could rise above this peak and their more recent offerings are nowhere as good as this. In particular, the departure of Don Felder in 2001 (he wrote all the music to Hotel California's title track) has rendered their latest offering (the Long Road out of Eden) a terribly bland and overproduced yawn...

But you know what? After playing it a few times, I've come to realize (well, at least in my opinion) that there isn't a single bad track on this CD. Not a single one! How's that for impressive?
feat, yet, they were in top form.  The audience clearly enjoyed their renditions, as well, of such songs as "Tuesday Afternoon," "Question,"


The sincerity and playing of the skeletons/remade later Who classics are essential listening for any Who lover and the spiritual feel of the songs are a trip coming from this musician.
And then the song slams back into the chorus with the bass and guitar to finish the song and end the collection with the "Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family".

Some of the reviews of this album are savage. The negative reviews miss the point. As a piece of modern experimental music, this album is made to order. If the listener is expecting a collection of pop songs, well, look somewhere else, you won't find it here. No "Silly Love Songs" here.

9696	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I can not emphasize enough, my appreciation for this man's, and this group's work. Frank Zappa has said that the original band was good, but lacked the ability to perform his more difficult material. Combine this with the cost of touring this band, and it just did a nose-dive into the ground. It's kind of difficult to figure what the whole story was, because Don Preston has said that Zappa complained about the the band being too big and expensive to tour, but kept adding personnel nonetheless. "Freak Out" was recorded when The Mothers existed as a five-piece, and there are at least ten musicians on this, but the end result doesn't suffer; even though it's left-over material, it's top-notch left-over material. I just don't think any of it fit into any existing format of the band's work up to that point. The same with "Weasels Ripped My Flesh."
6215	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I bought this on cassette when it first came out.  The original art work was a lot nicer.  But, I suppose it's what's inside that really counts.  This disk is short, but has some great songs.  The title track, Mr. Chow, and Ricochet are the standouts on this CD...but, their isn't a bad track on it.  This recording is actually better than most of their later ones.  This is a good one!!!

I can forgive it all because he's one of my favorite artists, and because I saw two shows on this tour so I know what "the big picture" was in terms of the visuals of the show, which are given a little less emphasis than they should've on this DVD.  Overall the performances themselves range from the very good to the mind-blowingly good, and some of Peter's songs sound better live than they do in their studio versions.  I simply can't stop listening to "Come Talk to Me" and "Secret World".
Highly recommended, both for the improvement in sonics, and the songs themselves. The bonus tracks did not strike me as essential, but they are certainly nice to have. A well-done and worthy re-issue.
What really strikes me is that the record does not seem as though it was recorded twenty plus years ago. It sounds as fresh as if it was just done. The recording quality is excellent and i would say most bands that play this style currently wish they could sound this good. Cheers Lonnie!

Many people consider "Hotel California" to be the best rock song ever, and it would have been sufficient to make this a worthwhile album by itself.  There is more, however.  None of the other songs is what I would call a smash hit, but there are several great tunes.  My personal favorite (aside from the title track, of course) is "Wasted Time," but there are others (Life in the Fast Lane, The Last Resort, Pretty Maids all in a Row) which could be considered hits.

One thing I do know is that on the radio, my favorite song right now is "Schism" from Lateralus. This one's kinda in the mood of hate, wanting God to "flush it down". Then there's some songs I thought were real funny like "Hooker With A Pen_s. You just gotta listen to judge. The intermission, well it's an intermission. You should know the greatness of "H.", one of the less angry songs, but still angry. It's actually melodic, too.
6729	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is quite possible the best Eagles album ever, and it truly has some awesome sounds on it. From the haunting and unforgettable sounds of "Hotel California" which is a great track with some great lyrics  and great allusions that truly bring about some vivid images and powerful  emotions, to the hard-driving sounds of "Life In The Fast Lane"  which is a powerful song about addictions, to the melodic and often  overlooked "New Kid in Town" which is just a great ballad all  around. This album is truly magnificent and probably deserves most of the  praise it receives. My only complaint is the same that I have of so many  Eagles albums, they wrote great singles but didn't really put together  great albums. That being said this album is probably as good as it gets.

8428	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Despite this album only being six "real" songs, it's still amazing, and showcases Tool as a more angry band than what we experienced during Lateralus. The two live tracks "Cold and Ugly" and "Jerk-off" are absolutely amazing, especially the conclusion of Jerk-Off where Adam Jones trills and Maynard screams "Die" for about 15 seconds. While the lyrics of this album seem rather judgemental, especially in Opiate, Tool is a band that encourages people to think for themselves, so you can take whatever you want from these songs. I recommend Undertow, Aenema, and Lateralus over this, but it's still a great album.

The other great highlights here are 'Levon,' 'Rotten Peaches,' the title track, 'All The Nasties,' and of course my personal favorite "hotel anthem" 'Holiday Inn.'
Every time I listen to it it gives me goose bumps and tears swell up in my eyes and my chest fills with pride and warmth. It inspires me to do great things.
The only duffer is a bland cover version of 'Let's Jump the Broomstick', but that's brutal nit-picking.
This series is to be taken as a showpiece of the different ensembles Zappa has worked with over the years, and in some instances, the first half of a particular song is edited onto the second half of a different version of the same song, an interesting effect, but in Volume 6, the continuity is interrupted (in my opinion, anyway) with an unusual editing job on "Lonesome Cowboy Nando," which is just a spontaneous reworking of "Lonesome Cowboy Burt," originally from "200 Motels." The original is the "Flo and Eddie" line-up (Flo being Volman and Eddie being Kaylan), featuring Jimmy Carl Black singing. Here, the 1988 band is playing it while Zappa improvises some words about an inside joke that only the guys in the band get and laugh at, but to an outsider, it makes no sense. Nowhere near as funny as Ike Willis' "Lone Ranger" jokes, concerning an old Lenny Bruce routine, which come up at different times in this series. But this performance is intercut with segments of The Mothers playing this song at The Pauley Pavilion in 1971(The show where "Just Another Band From L.A." was recorded ), the same band that played the music for "200 Motels," and it is a far superior performance, compare the two; they are both in this track, back to back. This leads into the "200 Motels Finale," which is actually the second half of the the film's version of "Strictly Genteel," a fast, feel-good jam with references to the film in the lyrics, and, the second disc, this volume, and the series ends with the Halloween performance at the Palladium in New York, of "Strictly Genteel." This was the performance featured on the MTV special in its early days, when MTV still played a variety of music, not the format it now has. The band finishes, Frank says "Good night," and that's it. The end of the series.
I must admit it is much softer than what I expected, but there was no dissapointment at all.

8764	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	for their third release, Tool explore the progressive rock territory previously forged by such bands as King Crimson. however, Tool are conceptually innovative with every minute detail of their art, which sets them apart from most bands. make no mistake, this isn't your father's rock record. sonically, the band has never sounded tighter. long exploratory passages are unleashed with amazing precision, detail, and clarity, which only complements the aggressive, abrasive shorter pieces on the album. there is no compromise from any member of the band, with each of them discovering the dynamics of his respective instrument and pushing the physical capabilities to the limit. topics such as the philosophies of Bill Hicks (eloquently eulogized in the packaging), evolution and genetics, and false martyrdom will fly over the heads of casual listeners. but those listening closely will discover a special treat: a catalyst encouraging them to discover a world around them to which they otherwise might have been blind. if these aren't good enough reasons to listen to nima, then just trust the simple fact that Tool deliver the hard rock goods every time the band chooses to release something.

It's a very enjoyable collection of songs from Rogers and Hart, Rogers and Hammerstein, and a few others even including a rendition of the traditional song Danny Boy. All are with the minimal background, piano and orchestra, adding just the right amount of atmosphere behind Carly's crystal clear voice.

Unlike the one before this (which should have been titled "The Aretha Franklin Show")this DVD has a variety of new artists and legends. Opening the show, the incredible Tina Turner exits her limousine and walks down the red carpet to the intro of her hit "Simply The Best". CLEARLY the audience agrees with her song's message - she is simply the best. She then sings "The Bitch is Back" with Elton John (ommited was "Lets Stay Together" which aired on the original television version) and is joined by Cher for a duet on "Proud Mary" - one of the highlights of the show. Oh, but Cher...how bright she shines for a moment through "If I Could Turn Back Time" until she decides to lip-synch "Believe". Wow. What a let-down. What was SHE thinking. But the best is yet to come. Here comes country bumpkin LeAnne Rimes who sings "Written In The Stars" with Elton. Who made HIM a Diva? Legend - yes. Diva - not so much. Then there's Faith Hill before it was cool to like Faith. She's a Diva in training. She and Brandi sing "For You I Will" but you'll wish that they hadn't. And then here comes Whitney...let the drama begin. She sings "Its Not Right But It's Okay"...yeah, its not. And then sings with Mary J. Bleige who was going through a severe ghetto period - the dress and tatoos say it all. Whitney sings "I Will Always Love You" but of course she has to bring Bobby Brown and her little girl (Bobby in a wig) up onstage to declare her love for them. About the only great thing she does is when she invites Chaka Khan to join her on "I'm Every Woman"...yeah, all the divas - MINUS Cher, Tina & Elton, who were smart - join them onstage for this closing number. Oh its all so much to take in. The only thing it lacks is Bette Midler cussing everyone out and some drag queen dressed as Streisand shouting 'WHERE'S BARBARA!?!' in the front row. All of them bring their own bands, the lighting/effects/sound are good and everyone from Mark Lauer, Star Jones, Susan Lucci and Martha Stewart are all in audience. Hmmmmm....ehhh, go ahead and buy it. If you took the time to look it up on Amazon. Com, go ahead. You've come this far! LOL ;-)

'Born In The USA' thrusted Bruce Springsteen into the stratosphere, selling more than 24 million copies world wide. There is no weak song on the whole album with mega hits "Born In The USA", "No Surrender", "Glory Days", "I'm On Fire", "Dancing In The Dark" & "My Hometown". Even then the younger Bruce Springsteen then remarked "There will never be another (Born In The USA)", indicating the musical mastery in the album that even him as prolific singer-songwriter may not be able to match or better. This is by far a classic rock album of note, one of the best by far, not only by Bruce "The Boss" Springsteen but in rock as a whole! This album will please many rock enthusiasts, new & old ones on how a rock album should be, a highly recommended album if you like "The Boss"'s music, a landmark album of note!

It was great hearing Slash play with so many different artists, and in particular the different styles.  I even liked the Miles Kennedy stuff the best.  But a review of this album almost comes down to a judgment of Miles and whether or not you like him.  And in my opinion he's great, in moderation.  There are definitely some great tracks on the album and Slash is amazing as always.  I gave it three stars right off the bat because Slash could roll out of bed and manage that much.  But I could only give Miles the one additional.  This is a solid album that should be in any hard rock collection.  But it ain't great.

Sure, during this tour I think I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and during that time, my parents would only play Floyd CDs all the time, so it got a little tiring and of course, god forbid I gave in to their Adult music instead of the current Aerosmith fling I was on at that time...grr. But watching this concert always gives me the chills...especially the end of Comfortably Numb...Well, just watch what happens at the guitar solo at the end of the song and watch the crowds' reaction. Its an amazing scene. Anyone who has anything bad to say about this video except that its too short...needs to be dragged into the street to be beaten by a piece of heavy mining equipment and left bleeding in the moonlight. Almost sounds kinda romantic, lol. Overall, definately the BEST live video I've ever seen. Scared the crap out of some of my friends though, but for different reasons. One was totally at awe over the video and actually seemed to be in a trance because he was drooling, lol. The others' reaction was mainly, "hey who are these guys; I know this is a Pink Floyd song...But who are these old guys?"

12. Dirty Little Thing-5/5-This is one of my favorite songs on the album and might even be my favorite. I love the music, I love the way Weiland sings it, and Slash's solo is incredible. It's a song with great verses, a great bridge, and a great chorus.

For those who truly enjoy Low and "Heroes", the 1978 release of Stage is a must have.  Stage captures the highlights of both these albums with the added bonus of Adrian Belew on guitar.  The quality of that recording is just phenomenal.
The package here is differently designed than the hardback books for the previous three releases; housed in a box (that is roughly the same height as the deluxe books but much thicker)with a textured cover that is almost like a burlap sack, it's nicely designed. There's a large format booklet (another minor complaint is that it isn't hardbound but we can't have everything I suppose. It just doesn't look like it will handle wear and tear well)t features comments from the musicians involved (including Denny Seiwell, Hugh McCracken, George Martin who orchestrated "The Back Seat of My Car" for Paul).
As you would expect from Steely Dan the music is just perfect. The muscianship is of the highest quality and the selection of songs is fairly representative of their career at that point. The sound quality is high (Dolby Digital 5.1 / DTS) and I can't see how anybody who likes Steely Dan can fail to enjoy this.

It's a remarkable blend of Eric Dolphy/Ornette Coleman free jazz, on-the-road rants and hijinks, and just plain Zappa  goofiness. As has been noted, Zappa did put a 35-minute sample of dialogue  from the movie on CD number 2 -- by all means skip it; it's worthless. (As  anyone who has seen 200 Motels knows, Zappa had no business making movies.)  But the rest of this work is a spontaneous masterpiece that (almost) never  stops pushing the envelope. Despite the casual atmosphere, one senses in  Zappa a man who never ceases to demand the very best from his musicians. He  asks them to do the impossible and on this record, it sounds like he gets  it.
5613	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Of all the immortal albums in rock 'n roll history, this one just HAD to be recorded in the 70s, the most confused decade in the genre's history. For an era that was pumping out acts like Alice Cooper and The Clash alongside a seemingly endless barrage of disco trash and some of the most mawkishly produced pop music ever to soil the ears of man, calling it "confused" is an act of extreme courtesy. Yet this seems precisely the thing that designates "City To City" a masterpiece. Despite the album's love affair with the flowery, post-psychedelia production that turned pop music into a pageant of circus cast-offs by 1978, the strength of Rafferty's songwriting stands firm. The album's most amazing moments come at times when Rafferty seems to have sent his producer out on another take-out run for the band. Good clean tracks like the stirringly intimate "Whatever's Written in Your Heart" and the flawlessly composed "Right Down The Line" attest to the power Rafferty can command when left to his own devices, while the hysterical onslaught of bells, cymbals and keyboards that usher in "Baker Street," Rafferty's most famous single, sound like the start of some 25-year-old Perillo Tours ad. Yet the songs themselves endure: Baker Street soon clears the clutter and slides effortlessly into a gorgeous ballad with that unmistakable sax riff cutting a backbone through the song, rivaled only by Rafferty's stinging guitar work. "The Ark," a beautifully understated ballad brought to fruition by a particularly moving vocal performance, is as successful an opening track as there has ever been. Only the title track and the album's last two songs seem incapable of overcoming the desperate production that threatens to derail the album throughout but, thankfully, never manages to do so. It is this tension between indulgence and tact that makes for one incredible listening experience. That Rafferty essentially abandoned his talents soon after is just as tragic as "City To City" is miraculous.

8915	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	'Lodger' separates itself from 'Low and '"Heroes"' just by the mere fact that there are no instrumentals.  But while it may not have the groundbreaking aura of those two, it is, in my opinion, the most rewarding  of the three.  The songs are just catchy as all hell.  Only the closer,  "Red Money," is weak.  "DJ", "Move On", and  "Red Sails" are the best of the lot.

Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin also perform to perfection on this DVD of their television special. Sinatra sings "You're Just Too Marvelous" and "I See Your Face Before Me."

9436	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In a career of brilliant work, some Zappaphiles have called this album a blatant sellout.  This is preposterous.  This is not a sellout by any stretch of the imagination.  It's simply Zappa, one of the most prolific and greatest musicians ever to exist in the US or the world, reinventing himself.  There is not one song here that can be called a blatant attempt at top 40 airplay.  Every song here display Zappa's sense of humour, sense of satire, and intricate musicianship.  My favorites are I'm the Slime (which is still valid today), Caramillo Brillo, and the Zappa classic Dinah Moe-Humm.  It's taken a while for Dinah to grow on me, but it has.  Zappa once said that thanks to songs like Dinah (and Don't Eat the Yellow Snow and T***ies and Beer), he managed to get enough cash to make his orchestral work (the LSO album in particular).  So the album was a hit, but it's still Zappa.  It can't be mistaken for anyone else.  This is great stuff, yet one more great album in the Zappa universe.

The only criticism I can offer is that, while Walter Becker is a good guitarist, his solos aren't memorable, and we would all have been better off if Jon Herrington did most of the solos (his solos, often searing, *are* memorable).

7749	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	John Cale, it seems, is often at his best in a live setting.  When I saw him in 1995 with the Soldier String Quartet, Cale himself on piano and occasional guitar, and pedal steel player BJ Cole filling out the ensemble,  it was one of those rare transcendent occasions where every audience member  seemed to be experiencing the same hypnotic glow, held in sway like the  tide under a powerful lunar magnetism.  A (regrettably) long out-of-print  live document, "John Cale Comes Alive," captures Cale's strength  on the other end of the spectrum, bashing out brutal rockers with a hot,  stripped-down backing band of guitar, bass and drums.  In this regard,  then, it should come as no surprise that "Fragments of a Rainy  Season" (1992) is an excellent set.  However, as it covers his work  from "Paris 1919" (1973) to "Songs For Drella" (1990),  it also illuminates certain songs in Cale's catalog and in effect smooths  out a lot of the rough spots in an interesting but erratic  career.
I must confess I was not initially impressed by the album's lyrical content, being turned off by reams of profanity and what was ostensibly punk-ish vitriol and juvenilia. But, as Keenan writes in "AEnema," "Try and read between the lines," I found that careful attention revealed that Tool possesses as much lyrical intuitivism as musical insight. Some interesting themes include genetics and false martyrs. There are also shades of philosophy that set the tone for Tool's next album Lateralus, where Keenan gets into Eastern philosophies in a big way. Even the lyric in "Hooker with..." is whimsical in its irony (though the song's real merit is just rocking out). Even better than the lyrics is Keenan's incredible voice. It's not his singing ability that impresses me, but his voice possesses such a gamut of qualities that it makes him unforgettable. He can sound broken and weak, ferocious and violent, or anything in between.
During "Mysterious Ways," (the best live version I've ever heard) you can get a glimpse of Edge's wife who belly dances on stage during the song and toys with Bono.
Trevor Lucas plays an unsympathetic role in the Fairport chronicles. Most fans consider him almost "evil". And while he had a certain reputation in UK circles in the 1970 period, it was mostly for being Australian and for women. Lots of women. In the Fairport story he is derided for a lack of talent & destroying Sandy. Leaving that aside, I like his contributions here. His deep voice singing is fine in limited doses, and such is the case here. I can't see where he brings the album down. Truthfully, I rather like his contribution on the Gordon Lightfoot song, "The Way I Feel". OK, the Dylan cover, "Too Much of Nothing", sounds like folk night at Middlebury College, and should have been left off the album if he also wanted the "Ballad of Ned Kelly". Being an Aussie, I'd concede him "Ned Kelly", but a mediocre Dylan cover drags the album down. I also recall the original album having a Trevor song, "Iron Lion", I think. It seems to have dropped off the Hannibal re-issue, etc. I kind of liked that song, but those who put together these things must have their reasons.
9884	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	With an excellent coupling, Chandos provides us with first rate performances of two of the most succesful American symphonies. As a foreigner, Jaarvi knows how the folksy music should be played. For  instance, in the Copland first movement the music starts quietly and swells  in a huge arch to a big climax which in the concert hall should be nothing  less than explosive. I went to see this work at San Diego Concert Hall some  years ago and was disappointed at the current offerings on CD when I  subsequently attempted to obtain my own definitive copy. However, this  effect is captured here, the conductor resists the usual tendency to push  the pace on, thus enabling the listener to pursue his thoughts in real time  with Copland's exposition. The other movements are excellently played but  to my mind it is the way the first movement is played which differentiates  the performances of this work. The Harris work is a celebrated symphony  which has always been played since it was penned in the 1930s. The mixture  of New England hymnody and folk strains are totally synthesised into  something new by Harris. It will be remembered that he was born in a log  cabin, like our Abe! The opening is redolent of the hymn and yet the mood  becomes transfigured as the symphony takes its course through stages  entitled: Lyric; Tragic; Pastoral, etc. The conductor and orchestra do a  wonderful job in playing this well known and well played symphony in a way  that sounds fresh and exciting. The first performance must have been really  special. This new music must have been like a breath of fresh air to the  listeners. Harris has sublimated the sources of inspiration that made him a  composer and yet kept pure those elements that move anyone who cares about  or loves the Spirit of America. The work has a classisism about it, a  restraint that is not so apparent in the more sprawling Copland. Thus two  faces of America are portrayed here, firstly there is the Apollonian  Harris, tethered to formal structure and outcome, his orchestra is not  Wagnerian; he relies on form and structure rather than texture and volume.  While the Copland may not be quite Dionysian, he does let rip in the finale  (Fanfare for the Common Man) with an indulgence in emotional patriotism.  One is aware this is a big symphonic ensemble playing. It is enough to make  the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end!

7424	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album has many influences all mixed together, bringing a much greater meaning to the hip-hop culture. The greatest influence heard is of a jazzy musical mix of horns, snare drums, and the jazz guitar. Jazz has many influences on hip-hop, but A Tribe Called Quest took it to the limits by creating the relaxing atmosphere that Jazz seems to create for the listener. Mellow electric piano notes chime in the background of almost every song, as flowing lyricists (Phife Dawg, Q-Tip, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad) rhyme about anything from the type of women they like to touring the world, Redman being locked in the car trunk, and the various night-life's that lurk the inner city. The greatest feat this album offers is of the simple poetic pauses in-between knowledgeable lyrics by the addition of noise or of a simple piano beat with the chorus. Music is poetry and life is poetry, and this album offers the musical aspect and the lyrical aspect of life (poetry). Cop this album up for real, if you really want a head trip!

BEDTIME STORY
6917	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I own every single album Paul ever recorded, and this one is certainly the most ignored.  Considering this is only his 3rd solo effort, the progression of Paul here as a singer, songwriter and producer is  astonishing.  Most notable is the mixing of this album, with strange echo  effects attached to the vocals as well as Paul's placing of microphones in  weird places for other instruments.  This album features a strange stew of  music styles, but Paul carries it off and delivers his most  "throat-y" vocal delivery EVER on "Monkberry Moon  Delight." An experimental triumph for Paul (he recorded an  instrumental, big-band version of this album in 1978, re-titled as  "Thrillington".)  A must have for die-hard Mecca fans.
 Side two of the LP started off with the great tune "Ted End", that has a real Beatles type charm to it. This would have fit in on "Abbey Road" quite nicely. On "Your Mine",  John gets to play the Devil himself , with lyrics Cousin Kevin would be proud of. "No. 29" is a drum based rocker that has the fastest runs on bass guitar heard on record (up till this point in time). The closer  "I Believe In Everything", sounds cheerful untill you check out the lyric sheet and see that John is being sarcastic once again.

"Alarm Call" features yet more images of nature as Bjork floats down a river on a raft, encountering crocodiles, snakes, deer, lizards and piranhas! Perhaps Bjork's most popular video is the awe-inspiring "All Is Full Of Love." This amazing video, directed by Chris Cunningham, features two robots in a production process. No one is around them apart from machines which add parts to their bodies. The two robots then passionately embrace, kissing one another rather erotically. The idea in this video is that love is everywhere; love can flourish in almost unthinkable situations amongst everything. "Hidden Place," apart from being an amazing song, has a very interesting video to accompany it. Bjork is but a few inches from the camera as a number of bodily fluids float around her face, from her eyes and into her mouth, up her nostrils and everywhere else. "Pagan Poetry" is a superb song with a very abstract video which I can't even begin to comprehend.

I was not sure what to expect from Morse, even though im a fan of his and saw him with the Dixie dregs and solo. I can honestly say I was amazed how good these guys still sound, I mean hell a few of these crusty characters are pushing 60. Now about Steve Morse, ohh man did he rock my house, I could not help cranking it way up ! His solos were so hypnotic, it was really like being their at the show. That boy can play hoooo man. Anyone whos a Deep Purple fan and even if your not, if you just love rock and roll you gotta see this ! All rock fans owe it to themselfs to see this classic show .....

This concert has been criticized for the background music. This is trivial subject to focus on, but I think the supporting choral group, consisting of African young men, lends perfect harmony to Brightman in ONLY AN OCEAN AWAY and DELIVER ME.

As you can see from the total playing time above, the 'outtakes' on Disc 2 may be short, but they're shockingly good. Mastered by ANDY PATTERSON in 2007, they are book-ended by two new 30-second instrumentals that would have worked beautifully on the finished album, but time restraints probably meant their exclusion. The fully-instrumented demo of "Baker Street" now shows that Rafferty came up with the famous Sax solo note-for-note while "Mattie's Rag" loses the slightly cod-Irish feel of the finished album cut - and is better for it. The 'Early Studio Version' of "Take The Money And Run" is fantastic - the finished song would turn up on his next album "Night Owl" in 1979, but here it's fully formed and 'so' good - a reminder of how 'hooky' his melodies were. Gem-award goes to "Stealin' Time" - the first to be acoustic only and its gorgeous - pared-back and still as powerful as the church-huge finished item on Side 2 of the original album. And when he sings "...so goodnight...yeah goodnight..." on "City To City" you genuinely wish there was more of this. What an impressive songwriter he was.

Instead, they got Zappa to divide the original Lather album into four separate albums, often with different arrangements and mixes:  Zappa in New York, Studio Tan, Orchestral Favorites and Sleep Dirt, and a few songs found their way onto Sheik Yerbouti too.  Warner Bros. also decided not to pay Frank for his work.  So Zappa played the entire Lather album over the radio airwaves from which countless bootlegs have been made.  Ha ha Warner, you greedheads.  So finally, years later we get an official release of Lather, Zappa's magnum opus and arguably his best album and it was worth the wait.

As far as The Wedding Album goes, this is purely for the 'patiently-inclined'. The first track (lasting some 20 min.) shows the pure innocence and simplicity of true love, where 2 lovers can be satisfied by merely speaking each other's name.

3143	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In the interest of full disclosure I should start by saying that I have three favorite singers (each in a different style) and Roy Orbison is one my three all-time favorites.  Roy was such a consumate professional that he managed to outdo his own original performances during this concert.  I'd buy the disc for Roy alone, but there's much more . . .  When I first saw this concert on TV back in the 80's I paid almost as much attention to James Burton on guitar and Ron Tutt on drums as I did to Roy.  Burton now qualifies for the descriptive title "legendary" because of his contributions to so many early Rock recordings.  I have the Laser disc of this concert and it's great.  But this DVD far exceeds the quality of the Laser Disc in both picture and sound quality.  If you have an earlier version of this concert and are debating whether to upgrade to the DVD, I can tell you that you won't be disappointed.  The 5.1 sound track is light years ahead of the original stereo.  I could go on and on about the enhancements, but I'll illustrate with a simple example.  On this DVD I can clearly hear much of James Burton's guitar work (out of the left front channel) that was totally buried in the stereo mix.  Heck, buying the DVD was worth it for that alone, but you'll hear even more.  Plus they included two songs that were deleted from the original Cinemax special and early concert releases.

US released November 2004 (December 2004 in the UK)  "Madman Across The Water" by ELTON JOHN on Universal/Rocket B0003610-36 (Barcode 602498240298) is a 'HYBRID SACD Surround Sound, SACD Stereo and CD Audio' single disc Reissue. It's a straightforward transfer of the original 9-track 1971 album and plays out as follows (45:33 minutes):
1814	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog.
  The first six numbers here,in particular "Reet Petite","Lonley Teardrops","To Be Loved","I'll Be Satisifed" and "Doggin Around" read like a hit parade right of the bat.  You find Jackie moving from a bouncy,brassy sound right into a pretty straight ahead blues on the latter mentioned song. Most of these songs were written by Berry Gordy who,of course would become famous as the founder of Motown and these songs are how he established his music career and got known. The middle section finds some like minded songs such as "Lonley Life","You Better Know It" and "Am I The Man" but also numbers such as "Night",very theatrical and almost Broadway style pieces that rely mostly on his voice for genuine drama. But are outside the soul tradition. On "Baby Workout" Jackie is back to his brassy rhythm & blues best on another of his classics. One song that caught my ear was "No Pity In The Naked City",a 1964 slow blues number about the cold attitude perceived in New York City towards the less fortunate.  After that it's clear Jackie was gearing his career into a heavy soul direction with "Whispers","I Get The Sweetest Feeling","Since You Showed Me How To Be Happy" and of course "Higher And Higher". Once can see here the uptempo mid 60's windy city soul. On the latest track on here "You Got Me Walking" from 1972,it's still the same story but there's some fuzzed wah wah in the production,and the influence of the funk era showing up a bit. So wonders where Jackie might've taken it if he hadn't had a heart attack in 1975 and died a decade later.

The negatives - nearly 40 minutes of Mothers stalwarts overheard discussing an early version of the film, Uncle Meat, and the infantile and smutty Tengo Na Minchia Tanta - cannot be blamed on the 1969 release, which was free of this mind-numbing, self-indulgent stupidity.

Just great great great stuff from a period when Townshend could do anything--ANYTHING--on the guitar.

"Uncomplicated" clangs in like a ringside bell. One immediately gets the sense that everyone's playing in the dark, pissed as hell, determined to beat any semblance of melody into a pulp. Steve Neive hits the Wulitzer like a drunken carny. Pete Thomas seems to be pounding on the decapitated heads of those he hates. As if in spiteful opposition, Bruce Thomas plays as if he's creeping up to push the shiv in. As for Costello, he gleefully lives up to the self-deprecating nickname "little hands of concrete", spitting out his lyrics as if he couldn't stand the taste of them.

Then, there are albums that are simply stunning in their impact on the individual listener and deserve an equal place with the best rock has to offer.  Such is "City to City".  No rock album has ever hit me with the impact of "City to City", and it is one of my "five albums to have if stranded on a desert island".  Like many, I bought the album after hearing "Baker Street" many times on radio.  I put the album (vinyl, by the way) on and thought I would wait through "The Ark" to get to "Baker Street".  Imagine my surprise at being totally blown away by "The Ark"; what a way to open the album.  Listening to it reminds me of the charge I get listening to "The Great Gate of Kiev" at the conclusion of Mussorgky's "Pictures at An Exhibition".  After "Baker Street", the music never slacks.  "Right Down the Line", "City to City", the utterly satisfying "Stealin' Time", then two more outstanding mix of lyrics and instrumentation with "Mattie's Rag" and "Whatever's Written in Your Heart".  By this time in the album, expect to be blown away--but don't stop yet, because the final three ("High and Dry", "Island", and "Waiting for the Day") satisfy the ear and make this album a total joy.  If you've listened to "City to City", you know what I'm talking about; if not, be prepared to be stunned.  This is rock music at its finest.

"Highland Cathedral" is an attempt to carry on the "Amazing Grace" tradition and the Scots DGs do a great job with a variety  of support elements.  The Band of the Light Division is in the musical background with Graham Jones directing, but unfortunately we never get to see them with the pipes & drums.  Interesting to note that the early 2008 USA tour of the Coldstream Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards had Graham Jones now directing the Coldstreamers. With keyboards, various brass intruments and other background effects the pipes & drums of the Scots DGs show that they still have the innovative spirit.

One ball drop is that although we get a stack of credits the lyrics aren't included. And of course my aforementioned issue with the number of versions. Sure it may not be to the bands discredit but it's a pain when this version has extra tracks, another is enhanced (coming out 5 minutes after everyone went and bought the regular Joe version) and dual disc variants and a copy protected version in attempt to force people to have to buy tunes multiple times just to put the stuff onto their ipods etc. So it would seem that apart from musical excellence these guys have also learned to be market savvy in a business sense.

You probably already know this from reading other reviews, but Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO) is the alter ego of Savatage, a mostly heavy metal/progressive rock band whose albums tend to lean toward the "concept" side of creativity, which is to say they're generally quite a few notches above most music these days...and often contain flashes of brilliance not found anywhere else on the planet.

Every replacement since has been because of the whole album & not just one song. "Matties Rag" & "Whatever's Written"..are my favorites.
  But then it grows on you, fast. And it gets better with each sucessive listen after that. It has a lot of layers, sonically and in meaning, and has a "flow" to it; in that way, "the Pink Floyd of Metal" might be a good descrption for the band and, more in particular, this album. Don't expect solely headbanging metal here (through you'll get your doses of that with "Hooker with a penis", "Stinkfist" and so), because there is so muche more to this album that calling it metal is almost insulting.
The disc was originally released in 1988, and it shows.  We're talking heavy on the synthesizers here.  The disc is a weird blend of pop and rock.  The pop releases are more timeless than the rock, which just scream 80's at times.

After "Lucky Star", Madonna goes back for one quick costume change. She comes back out in a 1950s short white skirt to perform, "True Blue". The skirt is similar to the skirt she wore in the song's video. Her voice sort of falls a bit, due to what I think is from her being really tired from performing, but this performance is amazing.
Excellent theme work is present on every track...but the stand out is PURE TALENT, The Mannheim Steamroller Gang...a fine example is ~ "INTERLUDE V", "VELVET TEAR", "A SHADE TREE" (one of my favorites), "TOOTA LUTE" and finally "GOING TO ANOTHER PLACE", as we listen to Jackson Berkey (piano/harpsichord), Eric Hansen (classical guitar/lute/bass) and of course our composer (drums/recorders/dulcimer/percussion), the extraordinary author of this enchanting release ~ CHIP DAVIS!
Lots of folks in the '60's sang well.  Not too many could be downright operatic in their range and tembre.  One was Roy Orbison.  He sang with passion, which most often translated into the pain of unrequited loves.
The songs are hard edged, but also very melodic,  textured and accessible.  Each song is so refined and perfect.  The  production quality is fantastic.  All the instruments complement eachother  perfectly. I think most people would like this CD, even fans of Jazz,  metal, etc.

The film excerpts are intensely boring and Tengo Na Minchia Tanta does not at all fit in the album, but the album is still a five! The album contains brilliantly written chamber music such as the two part Uncle Meat, The Legend Of The Golden Arches, Dog Breath Variations, Sleeping In A Jar,and Pound For a brown On The Bus. It also contains some fascinating avant garde, such as Nine Types Of Industrial Pollution, Zolar Cyskal, The Voice Of Cheese, Louie Louie, Our Bizarre Relationship, God Bless America, Ian Underwood Whips It Out, We Can Shoot You, If we'd All Been Living In California, And Project X. The album also contains some rock influenced chamber music such as Dog Breath: In The Year Of The Plague, Mr. Green Genes, And Cruising For Burgers. The album also has some awesome doo- wop songs like Electric Aunt Jemima, and The Air. The jazz songs are the intense multi part King Kong.

Instead of two-disc DE's - we get SACD HYBRID single-disc releases for "Madman Across The Water" and "Honky Chateau" (there are SACD variants of 1973's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" and 1975's "Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy" also). These single-disc 'Hybrid SACD/Surround Sound/CD Audio' for "Madman..." and "Honky..." reissues both feature new DSD and Surround Sound SACD mixes and both will play on standard CD players. But if you want the best out of the Disc - better to have SACD playback or Surround or both (chek your players capabilities).

Leave all the past behind, if you want to hear a great rock album from a band that will hopefully create more albums leading to an epic album, this is a good start.
And along came Gerry Rafferty.  The Scottish born folky whose music you will hear on this album often having a Celtic resonance hidden just underneath the surface, paid his dues up to CITY TO CITY.  Owner of a one-hit wonder with Joe Egan, in Stealers Wheel (they tried very hard to keep the wheel rolling unsuccessfully), his claim to fame was singing an impression of Bob Dylan with paranoia driving him under.  Three years after the final breakup of the Wheel, Rafferty found himself writing golden poetic tomes, setting them to a finely crafted folk-rock structure and rolling out one of the best damn albums ever made.  It was unique to what was going on in 1978 and it remains a unique masterpiece to this day.  Timeless is what CITY TO CITY is, because it can relate to any person, at any time, in any place where they find themselves.  The songs are engaging, captivating, undulating with an introspectiveness which is just out of reach enough to make it seem perfectly suited to whomever is attempting to grasp it.  While the massive hit Baker Street retains mythic to legendary stories about its construction and recording, the entire album from The Ark to the finale of Waiting For The Day is a continuous journey through some of the best writing ever committed to song.  Yes, Right Down The Line followed as a second single chart success, and City To City became a third FM staple and minor hit, but every song on the album flows from one to the other with a beauty which is most often unmatched by even the best artists.


Third Eye: This song is basically an extended jam session. It may sound boring at first, but "the pieces fit" once you get used to it. Again, the song really climaxes at the end. Great ending to the CD.

This was when she was making really catchy music and before she started cussing out fans and flipping them the bird at every stage appearance. You'll see fans dressed up like her and enjoy a bunch of those good early songs. Watching it again, I had to laugh when she claimed to "not need money" and threw fake money at the audience. Look at her now and her need for more and more. It almost doesn't seem like the same person. I'm sorry, but the 80s were more fun! The quality of the tape was good also.
After they split with Mickie Most, they switched to another record label, where they had some success using the name Eric Burdon and the Animals but with a somewhat different musical style (psychedelic instead of R+B), including two more UK top ten hits (Don't bring me down, San Franciscan nights) and several lesser hits of which Inside looking out, Help me girl, When I was young and Sky pilot are included here. Alan Price left the group before the split with Mickie Most and had several hits as a solo singer. These are outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find.

Whether you purchase CITY TO CITY and/or NIGHT OWL separately or alone, or, economically pick up the beautifully remastered two-fer with both discs in one package, these two albums, especially CITY TO CITY, were masterpieces of art in a one year period where music was evolving, casting off shackles and venturing into a new era.

6428	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion, Madman Across the Water stands nobly as one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  This album, produced at the height of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin frenzy during the early 1970's, is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Although this album went platinum, it has not received the same level of historical attention as other Elton John albums.  The reason for that escapes me, but suffice it to say that those who own Madman Across the Water have discovered the secret treasures of this album.

* A performance of their song 'Mlk' and 'Bad' from their 1984 lp THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, that didn't level in any way close to their classic performance of the song that appeared in their 1985 4- tracked ep (consisting of a pair of studio outakes and one of the couple live tracks from the said album), WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA - that rather turned as a curio when Bono perhaps on an absent-minded impromptu impulse sang a pair of ROLLING STONE songs by the end of it - seguing to 'Ruby Tuesday', (which went quite incoherently to the theme of the song), and most peculiarly ' Sympathy For the Devil' - that seem to tell the song 'Bad' is rather spoken under the perspective of the so-called virtue-istic sentiments by no other than Satan himself! Perhaps just an incidental quirk, or perhaps an intentional pun of sorts coming out from Bono- who years after donned the McPhisto-devil alter ego persona of his against the Fly, who stands to symbolize egotistic arrogance in its persona, being that Bono had the knack for 'tourrette' psyche, flaunting whatever criticism or comment that's thrown the band; which I guess is also the responsible driving factor for U2 to turn techno-pop, almost to a point that's as scary to sound nearly a lot like the pop music of Michael Jackson.

I had never really given them a chance and I didn't really feel like wading through the cd because all the songs have really long intros and it was bothersome. Both Aenima and Lateralus were shoved in my closet somewhere. One day i was staying home from school with like a 103 fever so i figured I'd give al these cds I never really listened to another chance (the strokes, jimmy eat world, american hi fi, <which were shoved in my closet for good reason> and then TOOL!) Wow. Tool is one of my new favorite bands. Maynard has an incredible voice. Aenima is tools best CD. With the opener Stinkfist, to the last song Third Eye, this Cd just rocks. My fave songs are Stinkfist, Aenima, and Hooker with a Penis which has one of the coolest choruses I've ever heard. If you like artsy music with an edge Tool is definetely for you. Their lyrics rival those of Cobain and the musicianship is the best I've ever heard from a metal band. Danny Carey is a virtuoso on the skins. If this review isn't enough to make you go out and spend every last penny you own on this band (by an Aenima for every day of the Week! :)) then just listen to em for yourselves you will not be disappointed.
2160	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Another Sabbath album with Tony Martin at the helm and in my opinion another good one.  "Cross Purposes" was the album that came after the ill fated reunion with Ronnie James Dio and its subsequent release "Dehuminizer".  Although I am a huge Dio fan was really disappointed with the reunion effort and think that "Cross Purposes" blows "Dehumanizer" away.  The music on this album sounds the most like classic Sabbath of any of the Tony Martin era recordings as the team of Butler / Iommi combine once again to produce some really strong material.  Bobby Rondineli (Rainbow, Blue Oyster Cult, And Quiet Riot) is also on hand n the drum kit and delivers a fine performance.  Although he seems to get slammed by many die hard Sabbath fans I maintain that Tony Martin is an incredible vocalist and this album produces some of his best work to date.  Highlights include the opening track "I Witness", the heavy handed "Virtual Death" that has Geezer's signature bottom end written all over it, the ballad "Dying For Love", and the catchy rocker "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle".  Tony Iommi has some really tasty guitar solos on this album and shows that he was still a very capable guitarist in the mid-90's.  The album peters out for me a bit with the last two tracks "Cardinal Sin" and "Evil Eye" which are ok, but nothing spectacular.  Overall I would rate this right behind "Tyr" as one of the best Sabbath albums of the 80's or 90's.
6886	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	To me, Ram is unquestionably Paul's finest solo effort and a good album by any standard. On this one, Paul really sounds like he's meaning it. This is far from the helpless (still somewhat charming) clumsiness of albums like Wild Life, Red Rose Speedway and McCartney 2. Neither is it the cold, forced professionalism of Pipes of Peace, Off the Ground and (unfortunately his emptiest effort to date) Driving Rain. On Ram, Paul sounds like a brave fighter, eager to fill the empty space entailed by the Beatles' break up. This is very good songwriting combined with some of Paul's best singing ever. To me, Ram has just the right combination of roughness and ernesty, counterbalanced with sheer fun. This is the Paul I will always prefer! Paul's later solo efforts did occationally contain glimpses of the quality of this album, but in its totality, inevitably failed to match it. (One song that would easily fit into Ram is Ebony and Ivory's excellent flip side, Rainclouds. If you like Paul, and Ram in particular, make sure to get it, one way or another). All in all, this is perhaps my favorite album by any of the former Beatles, unless perhaps "Plastic Ono Band" from 1969.

Trip-hop/piano opens the album in "Getting Scared," starting off soft and transforming into a rocker. There's a dark, intense edge to the music -- the sensuality and fire of "Come Here Boy," the rage in "Rake It In," and the snarl of "Angry Angel." While there are some softer-edged ballads, the sound is of a young woman with some emotional scars.
Before going philosophical/theological, let me start with the music.  One disappointment with the above mentioned Queen video was that they avoided the complex vocal harmonies they are famous for.  Styx did not do this at all.  I think the only Memorex moment was the intro keyboards on "Lorelei", which allowed Dennis DeYoung more flexibility in singing.  This was the exception.  The complex instrumentals and the great vocal harmonies of Styx were present.  My only disappointment was that they didn't do "Mr. Roboto."
My one qualm with the show is Liza Minnelli's  performance.  Watch this one -- I could swear they've done some  post-performance dubbing on her vocals.  The whole "Some People"  song seems  dubbed.
2. Fever(1993).- This video from the cover of Fever is very stylish, there's a lot of red colors since I guess represents fever, the version is dancy and the video somehow erotic. 9/10
But it is hard to beleve Zappa edited this together after this band was kaput. The way Zappa jumps from avant-garde (Didja Get Any Onja) to blistering blues (Directly from my heart to you) to other styles on the album  feels entirely natrual, as if no other peice could follow the one that proceeded it. Weasles has a white hot threat throughout, which never lets up.

In all, a great concert movie, with outstanding audio quality, and with REM at its peak. But that's just my opinion.
3597	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I never really was a Santana fan.  I like some of their songs and definitely can appreciate his masterful guitar playing, but I was curious enough about this effort to buy it.  My curiosity started when I heard that  Dave Matthews contributed to a song.  Being a huge DMB fan, I started  thinking about it.  Then I heard "Smooth".  That sealed it for  me.  I have been so sick of Matchbox 20 for the last year that I didn't  really care if they ever recorded anything else or not.  Now I'm thinking  that Rob Thomas should leave the band and go solo if he can do stuff like  this!  His voice and Carlos' guitar are a perfect mix!  Other favorites are  Everlasts' "Put your lights on" (another big surprise),  "Migra", "Maria Maria", "Primavera",  "The Calling" and of course "Love of My Life".  The  Lauren Hill song is the only one that annoys me (it would have been better  to include on her CD with Carlos guesting).  This whole CD brings light  into a world that was rapidly becoming a musical void.  It transcends  style, age, race, and culture to provide a truly positive musical  experience.

I knew I loved "I'm On Fire" which always had some sort of exciting sexiness to it, which actually would then conjure up this album cover (helloooo!), but then singles like "Dancing In The Dark," "Cover Me," "Glory Days", "I'm Going Down" endless good old fashioned rock & roll. Sure, his every working man schtick would probably get boring if I were to have a Springsteen marathon but 12 fairly fun songs keeps me feeling slightly patriotic, if only to stand up and salute that album cover.
Melt my cares away...
The third disc is a bit of a hodgepodge.  The songs range from ones that had been officially released in formats such as EP's but are extremely hard to find to demos of songs that went (regretfully) unreleased.  There are also full-band demos of songs which were later released, which hurts the disc a little because these demos usually aren't too incredibly different from the finished versions, just understandably rawer and less slick.  It's too bad there weren't original home demos of these songs in their infant state available--that would have been more interesting.

This is exemplified in the final piece, "Be-Bop Tango", whose live performance borders on the athletic.  In between the two tightly-structured sections his musical crew is given license to improvise, free-form, around a series of secret hand signals before coming back together to bring the piece to an abrupt finish.

546	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Many songs from this record have been overplayed, the album has had hype surrounding it since the day it was released, and by now there's really nothing left to say about Born in the U.S.A.. In spite of all that I love it and rank it right up there as one of Bruce's best and most consistent efforts. It's easy to complain about the poppy, synth-based 80's sound but it feels genuine and the songs still hold up 30 years later. It was that perfect moment when his songwriting managed to attract both faithful fans and newcomers all in one shot. Decades later it still has that indelible effect.
I know they are thinking about their legacy, and striving for peak musical performance, but, and it's a big but, the deleted track leaves a big hole in everyone's favorite metal Floyd song, flying Pig included. One the plus side, I love the Bootlegging the Bootleggers tracks! On the Turning Away is simply staggeringly good. This was Floyd and Gilmour at the very best, with Dave's strat, and his array of HiWatts turned up loud, and ad-libbing and improving left and right with brilliant material and great lead guitar work, despite the accidental laugh at the beginning of Dave's singing after the a ca pella. Marooned is similarly spectacular. I saw several of their concerts, and this is what they were like live most of the time, creative, doing different shows in different cities, even re-arranging the same songs in consecutive nights.

2480	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	So many reviewers have stated on here about Stevie's drug use during this tour and especially this show, but I don't think the video comes off that bad.  Even with the video edits of close up face shots and effects clearly added in later the production is pretty good.  The only real issue I saw with the show was that the camera man seemed to have an ADD disorder by moving the camera around to fast on every part of each song.  If anything I thought the concert was a little short only showing 9 songs instead of the 12 or more she actually performed at the show.

However, for all of that, its still a good effort. I basically feel kind of sorry for the band; this album is getting hyped so much they will have a hard time living up to it in the long run, and risk the backlash effect of over saturation. This could have been a sleeper hit that would grow on its own merits, but instead is getting way over promoted.

It includes "Spasticus Autisticus", "Billericay Dickie", "Pam's Moods", "There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards," "F##king Ada (my own censorship there), and many other songs not on the Landmark CDs. This one even spell's "Superman's Big Sister" correctly on the credits, whereas Landmark spells it "Sueperman's Big Sister."
To have many performers joining in the celebration: The Band, James Galway, Cyndi Lauper, Sinead O'Connor, many others and Roger Waters himself... Wonderful... The sound is great, the video presentation is solid and there is a documentary on the coming together of the concert.

Lodger is also a little more experimental. The first time I heard tracks 2 through 5, I was laughing hysterically and rolling around on the floor, because the songs are so messed up and out there. Whenever you're feeling sad, just listen to those and they'll cheer you right up! Man, they're hilarious!!
6869	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Ram is definately fun. I always heard a nod to Brian Wilson in this CD. I think if you go through Ram and really listen to it you will hear all the layering of positive feelings and rich harmonies and solid songwriting. I lot of variety but still it holds together with a 'sound'. Definately a CD one should have in their collection if they are a Mac fan. If you love melody you should be a Mac fan. This is not a deep lyrical masterpiece. Just 'smile away'.
It's fun to see the same gang of people in Cher's entourage back then, as in the "Believe" and "Farewell Tour" DVDs. The backup singing is powerful as ever, showing us that Cher & her team only get better with each tour. And of course, Cher never looked so good! Her big hair and sexy peekaboo "Nearly-Naked" outfits rock! This is definitely my favorite "Cher" image. My DVD doesn't come with a booklet or liner notes (credits). I'm not sure if the entire batch are like this. The bonus material is fun. I appreciate Cher even more now, than before. Thank You, Cher, for releasing this fab DVD. I knew we could count on you! Cher belts out each song almost exactly as in her studio recordings, yet you can tell she's truly not a lip-syncher or phony. This is definitely a Must-Have in your Cher collection!
