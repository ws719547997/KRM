2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons.

I think these strings approach the line toward "harsh" on certain rigs but they don't quite cross it.

Let me tell you, if you're on again off again with chorus pedals absolutely get this one and bathe in its swaying power. Yes, it's pretty sounding, yes, the depth switch makes it so much more fun, but more over, it actually makes you stand back and think about what you want to get from it. It may be only one knob, but from that one knob comes many tones and you'll never regret having a chorus, rather, that you waited so long to get this one.

These things (the patch) are specifically made for drum heads and beaters and they do the job they're supposed to do at a reasonable price. Anyway, the talent and any nuance is in your foot, not the patch. You get different sounds from your snare and toms with different strokes, and same applies with your foot and the kick drum.

1718	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These work like a charm for our drummer who runs a hard wired in ear rig.  We run these off of the mics we carry to the gigs and supply our own cables to hook up to his rig. The FOH can hook up to the other side and do their thing.

Put this N35X stylus into the body of an SC35C, and you have a much better tracking, and better sounding cartridge...unless you NEED to track it at 4-5 grams...then the SC35C is what you need.  I had a lot of old SC35C cartridge bodies laying around at my place, but didn't like the sound, or the very heavy tracking.  These great sounding, great tracking styli make those usable to me now.  I'll probably buy a few more, while they are still available.

Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.

--(***** Overall) Suzuki Firebreath, Suzuki Promaster, Suzuki Olive, Seydel Noble: Amazing. All of these are better than the mid-priced harmonicas reviewed above. However they are not cheap, so I recommend the Lee Oskar as a first harmonica until you decide you're going to stick with the instrument. Even if you're "sure" you'll stick, I still recommend starting with the Lee Oskar because beginners are more likely to misuse and break their harmonicas, and so you get the pleasure of looking forward to and appreciating your future upgrade.

I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit.

6136	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar.  The Squier had no effects, just a clean channel and an overdrive button.  I couldn't afford a bunch of pedals, but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar.  I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is Awesome!  For such a small amp, the output is plenty loud for practicing at home, and it runs on batteries, too, so I can take it anywhere.  The effects are better than I'd hoped for.  This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer, but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family, this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus, flanger, phaser, or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.  I'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time.  I don't need the deafening stacks that the kids like.  I love this amp.

I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you're not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.

It came well packaged with plenty of padding and no dings on the outer box. Shippinhg was box within a box and the outer box was extremely heavy duty. The guitar...no rough edges, straight neck, no dings. Perfect condition. As I would have hoped, the strings were a tad loose, no problem. I'll be sticking to light strings as I haven't held a six string in over 40 years. All the hardware was tight with the exception of the toggle switch knob. This guitar is a great bargain for someone just starting out or getting back into playing, you get better than decent hardware and Gibson goodies.

It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.

Pros of this glass slide: it a very clean straight to the point sound

  When I decided to finally add an overdrive to my setup, I spend about two years trying out different options. I was in no hurry, and I wanted to get a really good overdrive no matter the cost. Some of them were expensive (the 'Klon' cost over $300), and some of them were much less. Unlike delay, modulation, and reverb pedals, in the world of overdrive effects, a correlation between price and quality isn't nearly as strong as you might imagine it to be. You could spend as much or as little as you want and essentially get a decent product. This is because overdrive is overwhelmingly the most popular effect for guitar players.

93	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This proven mic has come down in price, while the one below it--the Sony DS70--has remained pretty much the same.  For the extra 15 bucks, the Sony MS907 is easily worth the upgrade.  The only advantage of the DS70 is not having to worry about having a fresh battery installed.  The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2.  Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste.  On the other hand, if you've picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.

Spend the extra few dollars and go the Pro route. It's still cheaper than the competition and you are getting a very comparable cable. The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly. The rubber-like shielding around the cable itself makes it feel well protected and it won't kink. I use them in the studio but they would work well on stage.

Although the tone adjustments have been simplified to a toggle between the three pickup combinations and an overall tone control for both pickups, this is not as big a deal as many might make of it. Given the vast array of other things that influence electric guitar sound -- strings, amp choice and settings, effects pedals and so forth -- the guitar sounds great as is.

4648	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I started buying strings at walmart and radio shack because i didn't have anywhere else to get them. i finally set a few of my guitars down and went out and bough new guitars because they were hard to play hurt my fingers and sounded horrible. i even stopped playing for a while because i started to think i sucked at playing. i decided to sell a few of my guitars because they sounded bad and hurt my fingers to play but wanted to clean them up and put new strings on them first for the new owners. After getting these strings and putting them on not only is the guitar easy to play now but the sounds is not at all like i thought it would be. The guitars sound wonderful and i have decided i'm going to keep them all due to these strings. Thank you for helping bring my passion to music back 5 starts all around
These pics are still the only pics I'll use.  Might as well and do use just my thumb and fingers if I misplace my Big Stubby pics.  Recently changed to 0.007 and 0.008 string sets and first worried that a 2mm thick Lexan blade and teeny strings would be a recipe for buying new strings.  Instead, the light grip these pics facilitate coupled with the light touch needed to fret ultra-thin strings without changing the intended notes combined for all sorts of fun and enjoyment.  And my favorite 0.007 guage strings are made by Dunlop, too.  Thanks, Dunlop!

9826	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The standard of the world, as far as I know. What's not to like? Been using them for years and years, must be pretty darn good for something. I find that material and shape are the most versatile among flat picks, Just soft enough to sound good and be grippy and hard enough to hang onto and dig in when needed. The color helps to spot them in my bag or when dropped. For me, these replaced the previous standard, which would be the venerable Fender Medium.
I did not think I would like the wound strings at first, but they do balance out nicely with the fluorocarbon ones. They are pretty smooth for changing chords and don't squeak too much.

6777	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This is a good pedal for switching between two guitars into one amp, and I like the fact that it doesn't require power unless you want to use the LED feature.  While most people - myself included - will opt for using the LED to make it easier to track which instrument is active, a 9V battery will do the trick, and unlike most pedals you don't have to worry about it running down when you leave your instruments plugged.  Naturally, that's because the battery functions only to supply power to the LED, and I've had it on constantly for weeks with no problem.

Shielding is not so much an issue with guitar cords as microphonics and cable capacitance. Using the wrong cable with a high-impedance guitar amp will cause your trebles to get muddy, and as you move around, the cable will act like a microphone, amplifying every slink and slap against the stage through your speakers.

I guess the locking mechanism is a failure point and that is their canned line. Anyways look at the angles of the legs, that's pretty poor engineering if you understand stability.

Especially when newly applied, this wrapping creates a super tacky and cushioned grip. You almost have to shake the sticks out of your hand to let go of them. The tackiness weakens over time, but I find an application is good for months of 2 to 3 night-a-week usage before requiring replacement. The only downside is that, if you use your sticks reversed to do rim clicks, that's obviously not going to work.

If there was a way to adjust the sensitivity on this pedal, I would definitely give it 5 stars. It's well worth having one of these, especially if you have another pedal plugged in alongside it, though I would want to test one against the original Yamaha FC3.

Anyway, back to the needle. This fit in perfectly to my RX3P cartridge. As soon as it was installed, I went thumbing thru my record bins to figure out what to play, and decided on a couple Moody Blues LPs. They sounded fantastic. I'm so glad I can play my records again.
The bottom line though is this is meant to be a practice amp, yet it has more clear output than you'll need. Beautiful mellow tones, yet has the ability to deliver the "bite" needed. Virtually any style of music will make you smile as I did...and am.

With the Alesis I was able to change quite a bit with the existing drum beats, as creating new beats takes quite a bit more then I have.  But, I am able to edit the existing patterns, deleting drum sounds, changing the individual volume/tone/timbre of each drum and have been happy with the results. It isn't hard to do ONCE YOU KNOW THE SEQUENCE of buttons and menus.  The Boss 670 had a better better over all sound but, when you start playing or recording it isn't noticible.

You can store the capo on the headstock of your guitar and have it ready at a moment's notice. These capos are great if you play out live because you'll never misplace them.

7891	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The first Gramma I purchased was to use underneath a subwoofer in a 5.1 home theater/audio setup. This product really does a great job of isolating and tightening up the notes from the subwoofer so that what you hear is real bass and not something that is affected by the floor.  Next I bought one to put underneath a stand for my audio and video components. I know that sounds crazy and maybe it is, but I wanted to isolate everything from the vibrations on the floor. I really don't know if that makes any difference sound-wise since I didn't do a comparison, but I feel better knowing the stand is resting on a Gramma instead of directly on the floor.  My third and fourth Grammas were purchased to go underneath left and right studio monitors used to amplify electronic drums when I want to hear them without using headphones. Again, they do the trick of isolating the sound so what you hear comes from the speakers and not impacted by the floor. They are very sturdy and the claim that they support 300 lbs seems accurate to me. My only complaint is that these are pretty expensive considering one could probably make something like this for a lot less money, but since I am a klutz when it comes to making anything and am lazy as well, to me it is worth spending the $$ for one of these. Or four.

I am a musician and needed a cable to connect an instrument to a PA (sound system) that was 1/8 to a 1/4 and this did not pick up the bass at all and the volume was very low with a poor signal. My friend connected it from his phone to the PA as well and it was as if it was going through a $2 speaker, very muffled, terrible sound quality. I don't understand these other reviews that were good!!! Please do not make this mistake!!!

Its biggest weakness is the treble high , it is very weak and boxy  , but at least it's not harsh. Classical string instruments like violin or cello sounds not very well , piano is very fuzzy, it cannot distinguish between low and high . Bass guitar and drums are fine ,  guitar ( both electric and acoustic ) sounds very nice , according  to my previously, mid is very good . The music style I recommended that fits this headphone well are acoustic, country or old school blues . Pop,rock and roll and metal are fine . I  don't recommend classical music, it is wasting money if you use it for classical . Overall, from low to high , they are all sounds very behind , I don't know how to describe, it just too smooth. By the way this headphone already comes with adapter that use for guitar amp( I wasted 12 bucks ).
It will leave very small doses of pick dust on your guitar, but nothing like regular tortex.

We lost the five-note chimes after we had a party and our house, and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them.

2334	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful sound.

I play what Luka Bloom called "electro-acoustic" guitar - that is acoustic with a few choice effects.  This chorus is a great place for any acoustic player seeking to expand their live presence a bit, to start.  A lot of new players go for multi effects pedals - and those can be great, but there is a steep learning curve, and can be a very expensive option.  Start with a good chorus like this one, and then add others when your budget (and your experience) let you!

To be honest, I was really disappointed with this Pono when first got it, and I expected the most of it out of the three I have, because Kala is just a cheap brand made in China. Pono is still made in China, but they have their own factory (Kala shares factory space with Lanikai and many other uke makers), own training and culture, and they are all inspected and set up in Hawaii at the Koolau factory. However, there was nothing special with the sound - with stock strings it sounded dead, and with Aquilas it sounds bouncy and bright but not as fun as the Kala soprano.
I compared this set to a Red Label Super Sensitive Steelcore, installed both of them on two violins, each violin was installed with both sets of strings for comparison, and the the Prelude won inevery aspect I mentioned above.

At first, you'll find them difficult to use because of their size, but once you get used to them, there's no better. They are a little slippery, but I believe there are "max grip" versions of these picks that will solve that. The pointed tip is the most important aspect of this pick. As for acoustic guitar, you don't want these. Get a soft nylon pick for acoustic, you won't be able to strum with these very easily, they're stiff. Highly recommended to everyone.

The only negative thing about this capo is: I have very sweaty hands and when it's hot (as it usually is on my country) this is a little slippery to get on/off the guitar neck. If it had some rubber even on one of the sides where you apply pressure to attach/release it would help me.

I was trying to think of different ways to spruce up its less-than-exciting sound... So I tried these high tuned Martin strings and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. My old, not-so-flashy Yamaha workhorse acoustic sings like it never has before and now I have a unique sound to pull out from time to time! They sound great and, although I was a bit shocked to see how thin the 3rd string is, they have held up great strength-wise as well.
7321	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I like this peddle mostly because it is not too complicated a concept to operate. You can tweak the 4 knobs to acheive the desired chorus effect easily.

OK, now you're probably wondering what's not so good about this mic. Well, the one thing I don't like is that the grill is not aligned symmetrically with the Shure nameplate, either on a flat side or at a diagonal). Soes the grill screw on, or is it permanently mounted, or is it a clip-on? If it's a screw-on, then I can see how it's not aligned perfectly, you have to turn it to line it up.

Quality is good, though, so although these strings don't really do it for me, they're certainly not something I'd toss in the trash.  The Kobza has a sort of Cittern shaped body, so the acoustical properties are probably a bit different than the average 12 string.

4600	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The Gator 76 Note Keyboard Cover Is Fabulous! I'm sure the 61 note cover is just as great also. The fabric is stretchy so it 'pulls' on and makes a nice form fitting fit, so it looks great on the keyboard, no sloppy overhang or waste. Looks easily hand-washable if it ever gets to the state where I want to 'freshen it up' and it also does the job it was made to do by keeping the keyboard dust free and clean. The photos give an idea of what it is but in my opinion it is even better looking and nicer when you feel the fabric and see how well it works. Its flexible nature means this cover would probably work on most keyboards, but I don't know, it does work perfectly on my Yamaha NP 32 keyboard.

The "pick pack" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you're a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.

7267	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I love this tuning bar.  I chose it for its design and weight distribution.  Many years ago I severely injured my left hand and lost the ability to play my guitar.  As I grew older I found that I still had the desire to play so I started using a lap steel guitar. I tried several tone bars before I bought this one.  This one has just the right feel and fit for my decreased mobility of my left hand.  It does not cause my fingers to become fatigued to where I have to stop playing.  I would recommend it to anyone who may have the same problem where injury prevents fingers to function normally.

306	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I'm using this with a Yamaha YPT-300 and it works fine except that the pedal is very light-weight.  I kept having problems finding it with my foot or having it move.  I found a piece of wood 9"x16"x3/4" (23 cm x 41 cm x 2 cm) and mounted the pedal to the board with double sided carpet tape.  (Glue would work too.)  I even put little rubber feet on the other side of the board.  This setup works perfectly.
Carrying it is a breeze.  Because it's lightweight and shallow, carrying a full rack (unless you have heavy tube pre/power amps) is completely manageable.  The handles feel nice and durable, but I'm only hauling about 30 lbs. of equipment.

I'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important "gear component."

One tip to those thinking of buying these I would get a bag or some other container because a pile of 72 picks is not really easy to manage neatly.  Another thing you could do is get about 6 feet of gaff tape and tape them all to something so you could grab one if you drop the one you're using, or toss one like an idiot to the audience if you are playing in front of one (or think you are).

6202	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought this Capo about a year 1/2 ago, still using it and in great condition. Im not sure if my strings get out of tune or the capo grips too much on the frets but I have to retune every time I use the capo
The case is, as others have said, not capable of protecting against anything except scratches or dust.  It's better than nothing, but the bottom-mounted zipper makes casing and uncasing awkward and slow, and I always worry about the fabric pulling on one of the tuning keys and untuning it.
I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap "boutique" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.

2316	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Still the industry standard, and for a reason. As close as you're going to get to an ideal balance of frequencies for a human voice. You need a little mike technique to find the sweet spot between too far away and too close- it throws out a huge low-end hump if you overcrowd it, but once you find the spot, you're there. The on/off switch helps me because I am playing trumpet as well as singing, and except when the horn is tightly muted it's best to shut it off while playing. Working like a charm, and for the price it's a steal.
4706	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use these for all my guitars. They are great and they hold up well. Plus they are generally $19.00 at GC and about $14-$16 anywhere else.

I got these in medium and the allow better strumming but are still stiff enough for faster single note runs.
Overall, it has wider ranging uses in a studio, and is inexpensive enough to be affordable to hobbyists or folks on a budget. The sound enhancement is real, but not as wide ranging for live playing. If you play loud rock or metal and are looking for something to enhance your sound on stage (other than vocals) you may be disappointed. On the other hand, for lower volume music and certainly lightly amplified acoustic instruments, this may make a significant improvement in live performances as well as in the studio.
6025	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	With a simple modification,  you can totally change the sound of this pedal from its trademark thin and fizzy sounding distortion, to full and rich sounding. Here's what I did. First , take off the back plate and locate diodes D4 and D5 on the circuit board. (They are marked). Then simply snip the ends off of both of them disconnecting them. It's the most popular and effective mod for this DS1. There are many videos on YouTube about this simple great mod. It turned my Boss DS1 distortion into a fantastic, way more expensive sounding pedal. Have fun!

5939	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	I bought an Ephiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus and this case was included with the guitar. It will protect your guitar around the house and going to practice. The quality is exceptionally poor. The cover is soft and tears really easy even with a gentle bump. The trim that covers the seam on the outside fabric was loose on mine and soon to fall off. Epiphone sent me a replacement case and it was just as bad as the first. I bought a Gator abs case and while it is not a flight case, is much more durable than this case.
One thing the XL+ probably could have used was a button selector for quick switching between presets.  I really have no idea how you would use this thing live if you needed to change to a different preset mid-song.  The MiniNova and even some other Korg products use a button bank that is much easier to navigate on the fly.

4911	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These have been my go-to straplock on all my basses since 1992. I have some I've used for over 20 years. Never had a set fail on me. You do have to oil them occasionally, but that's a small price to pay for reliability. Give them a tug when you pop the locks into the buttons to make sure they're holding, and you're good to go. I've never lost a C-clip from a set (which holds the lock together on the strap), but even if one were to pop off during use, the strap still won't come off the instrument. I've had several bandmates use Schaller locks that lost the nuts on stage, and seen guitars go crashing to the floor as a result. Schallers also tend to unscrew the buttons from the guitars more easily than Dunlops. Other new designed locks seem to utilize Dunlop's ball bearing concept,
Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!

7583	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I didn't actually purchase this pickup through Amazon but I have an Ibanez QS320 that it came with.  The previous owner of the guitar actually put it in although he got the wiring wrong and I had to fix that.  My all time favorite pickup is the good ol' DP100 Super Distortion and I never put much into blade pole pickups.  All that changed, however, when I plugged this guitar in.  Very nice highs and sustains very well.  I can get harmonics from most places on any of the strings.  The bottom end is fine, the DP100 has a better response in the lower frequencies I think.  Some say this pickup is only suited for high volume output but of all the guitars I have ever had, many with single coils, this thing can beat them all when properly wired with the selector in the next to bottom selection.  Shimmering clean tones and acoustic like sounds can be had from this thing so it is versatile.  If you want to scream leads and then clean it up this pickup will do that for sure.  Totally recommend this as a player of guitars for over 30 years.
3936	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the "White Room" by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives, I probably should give it 5.
The only negative was the lack of a reverb.  Even if they would have added a digital modeled reverb, it would have been a great add on, but this bare bones amp is probably light years ahead of the amp I started on with which was a small Transistor Sears amp in the mid to late 70's..

1786	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once.
8620	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I really dig these picks. Nice and fat, easy to hold. I don't like the scraping sound when lightly strumming, but I've found them useful for playing single note lines.
1115	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Awesome
As expected this is a monster metal pickup. What wasn't expected is this pickup is awesome for classic rock also. Without the aid of a stompbox the Dimebucker has just enough heat to overdrive your amp naturally. I found myself immersed in the British Invasion. The pickup was nailing some of Keith Richards more distorted tones and was a nice match for a few Who tunes. Even when playing some of Paul McCartney's more aggressive guitar lines from The Beatles like Taxman the pickup did an awesome job.

If you're expecting the deep rumble of something like a Fender Jazz bass, don't hold your breath because the EB0 is a short scale - it has decent bass, yes, but not that earth moving deep thump.

It uses a single AA battery which should last for a long time.  Some advice - toss the included battery in your pile and buy a good one that won't leak.  I recommend the L91 lithium AA batteries because of their long life and long storage without leakage.  This is a battery you won't be replacing for a couple years so it's best to put a high quality one in to begin with since you'll forget it.  The L91 also provides about 2x the usage of a normal alkaline battery, but it costs ~2x as much so it works out in the end as a wash.

3584	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar is a GREAT GUITAR for $169.00 (The average selling price at the time of this review). The pickups, tune-o-matic bridge and stop piece are the same ones used in Epiphone's more expensive guitars, and are similar to what's used in much more expensive Gibsons. Although the tone adjustments have been simplified to a toggle between the three pickup combinations and an overall tone control for both pickups, this is not as big a deal as many might make of it. Given the vast array of other things that influence electric guitar sound -- strings, amp choice and settings, effects pedals and so forth -- the guitar sounds great as is.

As a result i am compelled to return this otherwise good product (though it doesn't compare to flight cases or SKB 4214W like molded plastic cases).

Since this was a tight fit over my board I did not need to use the added drawstring that allows you to adjust it for smaller boards. However, that string is the key to making this work with smaller 76- and 61-key boards. Believe me, the material is slippery enough to need this adjustment because I own the large model of this cover for an 88-key and it will shoot off like a slingshot if not adjusted tight for smaller dimensions.
8725	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Although these picks are much more substantial in overall size (in terms of thickness) than those used in the past, I very much enjoy the feature that makes it much more difficult to drop them when strumming.

So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.

7097	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	Intended to maximize sales appeal to a wide range of musicians, the SR16 offers 50 different drum beat styles (rock, jazz, country, etc.) using up to 12 pieces of percussion instruments (kick, snare, cymbals, toms, etc.) making up a drum set. Each piece is assigned to a physical drum pad button on the face of the SR16. For me, I found only about a dozen factory-installed drum beat styles (called presets) I can use. Of these, I can easily change the tempo for live performances. BUT this is where easy ends.

5304	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This is a quality instrument cable with quality ends. I like the circuit breaker, and it's very helpful to me as my amp doesn't have a mute function.  However, I don't like that the cable is so stiff and won't lie flat unless you lay it just right. If you move around, it gets easily caught on things. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Because of this, I was looking at purchasing one of the circuit breaker ends. Thank goodness I read the reviews first and found it they can only be used on Planet Waves cables.  I do use the cable some, but mainly only in practice when I'm going to be sitting or standing still.


We bought our first set of these, the Zenergy5 with five chimes, as a bit of a lark. They rapidly became a favorite, which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time. The chimes sat on an end table, and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them.

As for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue).  Even with the right fit and a fresh battery, I found the MS907 to be somewhat underpowered for optimal results.  It wasn't until I plugged it into an Onkyo preamp that I was satisfied.  Again, I suspect that a mic with a USB connector would permit better gain levels with most computers.

I like the look of the Les Paul body, and since the closest Gibson dealer is 2 hours away, I decided to look at the local shops first.  They sold lots of Fenders (liked the Cabronita Telecaster $500) and Peavey (liked the SC2 Vintage $250).  But I didn't know the brands as well.  Since I wanted to stay under $300 and figured the Les Paul model would be a good bet for a few bucks more on Amazon, I put in my order.

--(***__ overall) Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still the best wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, but don't be fooled, they are likely to be custom-assembled custom-tuned custom-polished. At mid-price range it has my (slightly) favorite sound, but the Special 20 and Lee Oskar are significantly more comfortable and their holes are easier for a beginner to single out.

6866	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've been playing for a long, long time, there really is no way to know how many different picks I've tried. A lot. I've found quite a few here and there that I've liked for short periods of time, but I almost always end up going to back to the heavier (like blue and purple) regular Tortex picks. I like the feel of the those picks, my only complaint really is that I'm pretty hard on a pick (mostly from practicing scales); I tend to wear the edges and tip down pretty fast, but I can never bring myself to just throw them out. I always seem to have piles of useless picks!
6950	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are fast becoming my favorite picks for both electric and acoustic. I prefer a flexible pick and the 0.60 ultex is just about the right combination of sound and feel for me.

7909	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use this under an Avatar 1x12 speaker cabinet with a Blackstar HT Metal 5 head and Marshall JVM 1 watt head on top. Big improvment in the low end from my guitar. Helped to tighten up the sound and keeps the bass from traveling and shaking things in my room or non shelves. Worth the investment.
These mics are a great choice for many applications. They don't shine in every scenario of course, but generally speaking you can't go wrong. Also, these are built like a tank, and if something does go wrong (busted grill for instance), the replacement parts are easy to find.
3324	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	We (my band) have been using 57's and 58's and they're good mics. Workhorses for sure. But we're loud (rock/metal) and to get the 57's and 58's up loud enough, we had feedback peeling our faces off. Not pretty.
The rack's aluminum borders on the outside of the rack runs to the inside of the case, and is punched with holes for the rack (it's a single piece of metal).  However, the actual rail is a secondary piece that requires screws to be in place to keep it in that sits behind this piece.  It's not a huge deal, but if you aren't paying attention, all your rack equipment will be mounted sideways.  I almost returned it when I realized everything was sideways, as I thought this was a huge quality control issue, until I realized it could be fixed by loosening the screws, pushing the equipment in the desired direction, and rescrewing while holding it in place.  It's a bit irritating, but that should only ever happen once with this case.
7094	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought the SR-18 to replace my old Zoom RT-123 that finally started failing after over a decade of serving me well.  I have a full computer recording setup with high quality drum plugins but I still love the vibe and hands-on immediacy of a good old-fashioned groove box, and the SR-18 does not disappoint.  It sounds better than I expected, with a good selection of surprisingly decent acoustic kits, but it's those deliciously dated kits and samples I actually like the most.  My philosophy is, if you're going to use a standalone drum machine these days, embrace its mechanical nature and look to software if realism is what you're after.
6584	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	It arrived and in the process of installing the pickup found that there were missing parts namely the screw driver and short guitar cable. Then when I got it done and ready to test I found that the guitar switch didn't work therefore the combination guitar/synth didn't work either. One installed I'm not going to uninstall and return. I found a way around the all issues so there you have it. Just buy a new one.
There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.

I did not see where the cross over was originally mounted so not sure of the exact cause other than maybe shipping damage due to a less than stellar mounting design of the crossover board.

There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?

11	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I am enjoying my ukulele. I had one a long time ago. It came with a good teaching book with a CD and a DVD. The ukulele came with bag, and it also came with a set of strings.  I did purchase a tuner from Amazon, which works swell. I am learning to play already. It is fun to play. It is a good way to learn to play.
4285	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Trying to find the perfect slide isn't easy.  Everybody's got different size fingers and preferences.  I suppose I can go to a store and ask them if I can stick my finger in all of their slides...  Anyway, this slide is ok for me.  It fits my ring finger fine, but I guess I prefer something skinnier.  I'm not a slide player.  I just have to cover a few slide licks.  For that, I won't complain about the size.  Build quality seems nice.  I've dropped it twice, but no break.

6829	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Nice sturdy unit as expected from Morley at Amazon pricing.
I guess you could try to plug this directly into the condenser mic, but it probably wouldn't work that great without power. This is one of the best connectors that I have ever used. It's seriously great. It doesn't rattle around at all, and it supports awesome quality sound. I got the 5 foot one, but I really like that it comes in different lengths.

5116	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	Tried installing these on a Gibson SG.  The screws that come with the straplock are longer and/or thicker than the standard ones on the SG.  Therefore, I did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar. The SG screws do not work with these because the heads are too big.  In essence, these did not work for me.
8949	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i don't see how you can go wrong.

1095	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Item as expected, great value.
This pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset.  Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals. The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried.  There is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.

7188	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great product.
Overall the kit is decent.  Is it a 4 star product . . . no, but its price and how its packaged added points.
Other shortcomings:
As with most electronics made in China, something will start going wrong with this pedal after about 5 years.  Usually it's a poor jack connection or the switch.  I just ordered another pedal because mine started turning itself off randomly, I've had mine for 5.5 years.  But regardless, it's a cheap pedal, you can easily go buy another one.  On to Boss DS-1 #3!

* The Chinese examples I have seen tend to weigh more. One Indonesian model I saw weighed a full pound and half less than the Chinese model right next to it. There is not, unfortunately, any way to tell from the box or from the barcode or SKU number on the box what factory a given example inisde the box came from. The system will deal out whatever is in stock at the moment.


6333	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I could not beat the price. The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal. It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear. Also, it not to big. It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board. Very happy with this item.
1.  Aesthetically, it's pleasing and has a very cool professional appearance.  I know that aesthetics aren't always a huge concern for people...but I know that some, like me, do have a little affinity for it haha.
Will doubtless also fit the electronic S6, as there is a little extra space at the bottom for the connector.

814	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Love this cable. So good and yet so affordable!
I have never encountered the clip problem, but for a buck and a half this SHOULD be better. Equalizers fail to remove the sound of your fingers plucking the strings. The finger sound IS the prevalent sound. Save your money for something better.

It's suitable for studio recording (and can be used on instruments, too), live performance, and defending yourself from would-be muggers in the back alley behind the dive bar where your band just played.

Ibanez, and a silver cadet by ibanez. They were okay. Compared to this? They don't tho is just the thing. It's got good sound, decent pickups, nice finish, and feels solid enough for any player.

7125	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great drum machine with lots of options. I'm relatively new to guitar playing, I practice everyday and am getting better all the time. The drum machine just makes playing so much more enjoyable. When you want to put your chops to the test it's nice to be able to play along with a beat that you choose. Now this is more than enough for me but you can program for all sorts of your own stuff and more. You can't go wrong buying and using this and you'll wonder how you managed to play without it.  The price is good so that's not an issue and so far it's doing what I ask.
6180	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	highly recommended. it works perfectly so that i don't have to learn but 3 or 4 chords and play bunches of songs. that makes me so happy after tying since 1966 to learn 3 chords. it's something to look forward to
4138	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is the state of the art in board pedals
6883	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My favorite. Years ago I had the opportunity to play using a real tortoise pick. There is a reason why there is so much talk about how nice real tortoise plays. It is because tortoise is really is that good. Dunlop Ultex (or Clayton Ultem) is the closest thing to tortoise I've ever used. Warm when you want it warm, bright when you want it bright. I like the .90, 1.0, and 1.1 sizes. I used to like the .73 but found that they didn't offer the control I wanted and were a bit bright. Dunlop offers the best price and variety of Ultex pics.
1246	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	It works!

1348	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	Given the good reviews, I expected more. Fairly flimsy, skinny gauge. The connectors unscrew very easily so need to be checked before use every time.
7794	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I'm a relatively harder player, and these thunder rods hold up for awhile.  Much better than the smaller doweled T-Rods that ProMark offers.  I had been using Lightning rods and those would start flaking and shredding in a couple practices.  The Thunder Rods last alot longer (which is to be expected from the bigger dowels), and the volume they create is just right for small room practicing.

9596	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Evans heads are among the very best.  I used this head for an 18 inch bass drum I converted to a big floor tom.  Hydraulics last forever and do not suffer from excessive overtones, even in larger sizes.  Enough said!

2917	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	The output is pretty low.  I run this mic into a preamp then to the mixer.  This boost the input signal to normal levels and really warms up the sound.  The mic itself is very comfortable with the proper adjustments and sounds crystal clear.  I run sound and play lead guitar at the same time and this mic allows me to do both with ease.  Get a preamp they are not expensive.  I use an ART Tube MP.......it does amazing things for this mic.
1572	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	A bit bulky but they work as expected. The clip to attach to your clothing or a pocket is high quality. I use with a Shure headphone type mic. Very convenient.
8892	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This pick holder is awesome. It just snaps on to your mic stand...add 6 picks and start rockin'! It holds the picks securely so if you're performing outdoors the wind won't blow them away.

3082	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Everybody knows who set "the standard" when it comes to an acceptable level of audio quality with microphones.  This is a great supercard, dynamic mic.  My primary use for it is miking acoustic guitars.  Turns out it can do pretty good vocals as well.  The biggest difference between the Beta 57, and the regular 57 is the Beta is a supercard while the standard 57 is just a cardioid.  So the Beta is also a bit hotter, and a little less muddy, if you will, while still maintaining a good level of warmth & fullness.  You can spend a bunch of money on instrument mics if you choose.  But the Beta 57 will cover a lot of bases, and do it well.  I would probably opt for the standard 57 for miking electric guitar amps.
9240	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Can't play without them! Perfect thickness, not too thin that rips or slips out of my hand and not so thick that it gets caught on my strings when playing fast.

At the same time, Korg's design choices have other advantages which become more obvious once you own and use the device for awhile.  This thing is LIGHT - weighing in at only a few pounds, it's fully capable of being played on your lap comfortably (I actually played it in my car a bit the other day just because I can).  This thing is also extremely PORTABLE - not many synths with this kind of firepower can run for about 4 hours on 6 AA batteries.  You can power it with Korg's KA350 9V adapter (which, unfortunately, is center-positive and a bit of a non-standard barrel size), but I'm thinking I'm just as likely to throw a set of Eneloop rechargeables in there, and it will encourage me to use it all the often.  So, yes, the XL+ doesn't necessarily "feel" like a professional device, but at least on my unit, everything works reliably, and owning this synth begs the question about so many other mini-synths on the market: What, really, is the point of making synths smaller if they are still heavy, clumsy, and anchored to a wall adapter.  The XL+ is none of those things, and is all the better for it.
Unlike a Tortex, the logo does not rub off in your hands.
I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.
To me these always feel perfect.  Also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little "comb" that moves the wheel on the pot.

These are good low level Pro headphones.  I'm happy.  I'm seldom happy with products cuz most so called pro stuff is really consumer plus or kids in garages.  See my review on JBL small computer speaker for some advice.
4747	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect replacements for Ovation guitar factory strap holders. Ovation supplies guitars with just the base part that screws into the guitar, if you ever need to replace or want to change colors, these are the ones. One caveat, the supplied screws are wood screws, Ovation uses an insert molded into the fiberglass bowl, that accepts a machine screw. Don't use the wood screws supplied with the straploks, its the wrong pitch and the wrong thread type.

I no longer recommend these headphones, I feel the sound and build quality have suffered since the move to building them in China. They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.
This guitar sounds good! Out of the box it comes with strings already installed and it's even nearly in tune. It appears to be already adjusted for intonation or at least close to it. Even though the included strings sound alright, I will probably be changing them soon to Ernie Balls because they feel a bit rough on the fingers and I prefer the slick feeling of regular slinkys.

The "Firebrand" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.

Ease of use: Aside from its convincing sound quality, perhaps the reason the SR-16 has remained in production and a favorite among musicians is its ease of use. The SR-16 was designed with the non-drummer solo musician in mind and is considered one of the easiest rhythm machines to program. It's interface has been copied (but many would say not trumped) by BOSS, Yamaha and others. The manual, while poorly edited does more than any other rhythm machine owners guide to cater to solo musician who doesn't understand the first thing about sequencing drum tracks and it's A,FillA,B,FillB pattern foot switch configuration makes it easier to improvise with... In short, you don't get much customization with the SR-16, but what you do get feature was is going to be the most popular setup which makes the device much more approachable than many modern rhythm machines and sequencer options. Has a full MIDI in/out through implementation so the SR-16 can be patched in and controlled from DAW's (Pro Tools, Cubase, Live, etc...)

I have opened up shows performing as a hip hop artist and DJ for rap a lot records, Kurk Kobangz, Lil Wayne and many more.

Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.

I like how they come with new rubber covers as well, although it is always dicey putting those little things on at the end of the night, usually somewhat intoxicated.  Very easy to bend or break a needle when putting it on because you are putting it straight towards the exposed needle and it you even bump it, your needle will get bent. It's happened twice already to me, but luckily on a worn out needle both times, but still, it shouldn't be that easy to break...  4 stars instead of 5 because of that.

With the new design of the heads so they will mate up with the drum shell has definitely shown a better tone quality.

I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.

5468	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Well thought out unit that does what it says it will, drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized, it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent "give." And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer, allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell, even my cats can't do that, and they're porcelain.

Most of the reviews I see (negative) speak to buzzing or string breakage, etc.  Firstly, the G string on ANY acoustic is the most likely to fail, statistically.  Not that I have had many of those break - I just haven't.  Guitars DO change with age - and are also affected GREATLY by environmental changes.  Wooden instruments need a good consistent 40-45% relative humidity, either where that sit, or in their cases.  Maintain that, or you will most likely go out of tune and do damage to the guitar, over time.

Consider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II version as you get a spare cord and spare ear pads with a velvet like feel. Having these extra parts on hand is worth the extra cost and makes this four star item a 5 star item.

After using this, things are much improved, although I'll still eventually have to replace the pots, they're just too far gone in the upper half. I wish it had a way to keep the straw with the can when not in use: any spray product that comes with a straw should have a way to keep the can and straw together (especially when it costs this much).

Seems well build, but for pros or the gigging musician, you may want to save up some change and buy a better pedal. 5 stars because of the price and what I was expecting to get.

Hint: Be sure to shop around! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points, including shipping.

It still looks brand new, and the elastic bands are still in perfect shape.  They haven't frayed or snapped yet.  I still think this was a great buy.

One final note: this model has the traditional finish and is slightly more mellow than its brilliant finish sibling.

3872	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	After researching for a bit ended up buying this unit, I am glad I did, love the sound.
8416	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Great plectrum. Comfortable in size but lacks the round tone that jazz guitarists usually go for. Anyone in any style can use this pick, but something better suited for the jazz guitarist is the Dunlop 205.

8326	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I never wanted to plug into a bunch of crap like a guitar player w/ a bunch of boxes on the floor but my buddy @ the pawn shop said 'dude just try it out and bring it back if you don't like it.' Well I was totally blown away and had to go back and pay for it (@ the goodbuddy discount). HAD TO!!! Theres really way more options/effects than I actually use or have space to list here, but everyone will find something they like, and the effects sound great, they're fairly easy to access, program and edit. Basically you pick a pedal and choose an effect, tweek it, then you can save it to ANY of the 3 pedals then when you need it, just step on it. You have 8 banks of 3 pedals each, press a button to go to the next bank of 3 pedals. 8x3=24 effects pedals with saved settings but find I really only use bank #1 of 3 pedal/effects. Heres my preferred use in order of importance; tuner/volume pedal, pedal#1=clean which about 20% of the time I will rock the volume pedal all the way forward untill it 'clicks' and boom,-instant wah wah. Works great to boost mids just to cut thru without rocking it back and forth(WAH WAH sound, but then that is fun too). pedal#2 chorus, pedal#3 wah with delay and use the guitar volume pot to mimic keyboard swells which works great to fill out space in a 3 piece band. Thats really all I use but the no-hands-required tuner/volume pedal alone is worth its weight in gold. Good tip; put it in your effects loop for a good clean sound and excellent dynamics. I found it doesnt like the front of the amp, maybe just me or the gain of a great Ampeg SVT3 is too much but it clips if you plug into it and then into your amp. Take your time, try EVERYTHING and you won't be disapointed. ROcK IT!!!!

9531	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Nice pics. These are my goto for acoustic guitar.
If you have one, keep it 'n tweak it, and if you're on the fence about getting one; get it! I know there are literally thousands of VSTi plugins that that have more bells and whistles in one oscillator than the mK has in total, but for the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, plus a cool piece of hardware. I'm not saying that it's an all-in-one or everyday synth, but it's definitely a cool piece of kit to have in your arsenal. Lastly, if you're looking for an easy talkbox solution (a la Roger Troutman), I suggest pairing your microKORG with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rocktron-Banshee-2/dp/B0014Z37H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rocktron Banshee 2</a>.

5743	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I just bought a new Taylor K66CE 12 string guitar and tried several other capos before I bought this one.  None of others worked very well.  This one works perfectly all the way up the neck with no buzz or distortion.  I'm very please with the performance of this capo and would highly recommend it.
Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.
1) The AT cartridge doesn't sound as good as the Denon on prime vinyl. It has a smaller soundstage (less "open air" around the instruments). Also, The highs have a decidedly more metallic sound on cymbals and hi-hats, etc. Silibance issues are also more pronounced-not totally harsh but again more prominent than the Denon, which when the vinyl is worthy is a joyous listening experience. I'm sure this will lessen on the AT as I get another 50 hours or so on the cartridge, and even when the silibance is more pronounced there's no truly annoying inner groove distortion to go with it.

You could use one of these to pry open a car door if you need to, then get your guitar and play some Djent or Metal.

One or both may not fit into your guitar case, meaning you have to remove to store and reattach when taking out.
1590	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	its a convience but this adapter provided a lot of static when I used it in my amp. Tried a different adapter and it worked fine. I'l; use this one as a backup.
In addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.

3299	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mid-range (price and quality) mic for performers. Much better than the SM58, and good enough for regular professional gigs.

981	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are high-quality and appear to be solid. I have had no problems, and it is very intuitive to have two cords connected since you have to use an in and an out with midi anyway.

I am a longtime semi-professional drummer, and I've tried most every drum head out there.  Evans is, in my opinion, the only company you need to bother with. While the others rest on products that haven't changed in decades.  Evans continues to develop new ways to make drums sound amazing.
and of course it's quite compact.

You can include 5 pedals, the board lets you plug one electric adapter and the cables internally connect to the rest of the effects
These are very easy on the fingers and have a great blues sound. Throw the empty string packaging in your  guitar case so you'll remember what to buy next time its time to change strings.

3225	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I bought this stand after bringing home after giving up on a traditional sub-10 dollar stand for my Flying V. Everytime I set the guitar on that stand, the strap would get tangled up or it bacame a balancing act. After "solving the problem with duct tape" on the bottom portion of that stand and then immediatly noticing how crappy that looked for my $1K instrument, I searched for another stand. The GS100 had plenty of good reviews and was on sale w/ free shipping so I took a chance on it. Turns out it is exactly what I was looking for--the 'legs' do not interfere with the guitar strap (which is good because mine is permanently attached from using the 'washer' strap-lock method) and since the guitar just hangs there from the neck support, there is no balancing act required. I also like that it seems to 'display' your axe rather than just support it. And and others have mentioned, it folds up rather nicely if you need to take it with you.

After manufacturing this machine for 20+ years you'd think Alesis would be kind enough to supply ALL of the information to make our purchase go smoothly. Nowhere does it state in the description that the footswitch jacks require MOMENTARY switches. These switches are not uncommon but they are not commonly made in a two button configuration to reduce cord clutter. After fumbling around with a Johnson latching switch I realized my mistake.

No USB.  This machine was released in the late 2000s as an update to it's predecessor, the SR-16.  It really seems like oversight that they didn't include a USB port for midi communication and firmware updates.  It's not a big problem but should have been a no-brainer

5899	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	No doubt, this pedal produces Distortion sounds. It's probably adequate for messing around with or as a first DS pedal (and the price is certainly economical), but I would not say that it produces high-quality distortion for rhythm playing. Yes, I know it's a classic- it's just not for me. It may be useful for some lead guitar, but the sound is very 'fizzy' and thin sounding- not a rich, complex tone by any means. I purchased the Boss DS-1X instead- we'll see how that sounds.
8145	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Sexy red finish, spring loaded action, heavy steel and smooth rubber on the string side.  I needed a delicate capo for my baby and this was perfect.  It even matches my Guitars finish.  I am very happy with my purchase
I really like the 0.60mm size for most of my guitar playing although I do have some larger and smaller sizes for specific songs/styles of playing. The Amazon price for these picks is comparable to what you'd pay at a Guitar Center or other music store but with free shipping, it's just easier to get them right here.

8773	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These Acetal picks are great. (Delrin, Celcon, etc., are brand names)  Very smooth surface, durable and flexible.  Not as surface-hard as cellulose picks. They yield nicely to light acoustic guitar strings, and heavier string attack isn't compromised on accents. Perhaps a bit brighter sounding compared to same thickness Nylon picks, everything else remaining the same. Much depends though on how you play. Highly recommended.

I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks.

2609	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I played a AC30 a couple of weeks before I bought this amp, and it's because I was hooked on the clean VOX sound. I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I'm living in a college apartment so I didn't want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn't have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it's the size of a man's shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn't help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The "overdrive" setting is cool too. I haven't tinkered with that one too much, but it's fun to play "Johnny B. Goode" on.
8185	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Really like these capos. My second one. They work well. This design is fine as well
In any event, the guitar is a GREAT value for the money. It has great tone and sustain, the neck is fast and wide making it easier to play, especially if you have big hands. I had a Squier Strat Standard at one time and it does not even come close to this guitar (or the Epiphone SG-310 I had prior to the LP-100) in quality OR sound. There's just NO comparison.

2510	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I've used SM57's for about 30 years and they're not bad, but there are much better mics if it's in your budget.

2420	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	So happy with this product.  I purchased a Shure headset but it was uncomfortable and not giving me the sound levels I needed.  Now I know why they say the SM58 is the most well known vocal mic... it gives you full sound and limits feedback tremendously.  The on/off switch version is GREAT for mobile DJs because this is the unit that can be used for speeches and easier for guests to toggle without worry.

1914	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	From 20 or 30' away, as I used it in a conference room, it worked very well and improved the audio recording compared to the recording function of the camcorder (which picked up all the surrounding paper shuffling, etc).  The downside to using this (or any lapel mike) was it doesn't do as well as picking up surrounding conversations - such as questions during a face to face conference room training.  In that case, I simply had to remind the key speaker to repeat the question and then answer it.  There were some big advantages over the 20' wired lapel mike I used - mostly the absence of the cable.  There there was little difference in audio quality.  I also did a brief test recording audio in separate rooms, with a closed door - and while my test was far from complete, the audio was still good.  I think some of the concerns are the claims that this can work from 300 feet.  I can't say that it does or doesn't.  The 9V batteries lasted a good 8 hours each.  It was unclear to me (probably because I didn't real all the directions) if there was a warning to change the batteries or not (I'll have to go back and check) but, for my basic needs, this worked fine and the audio quality was good.  Never had to change channels.

9848	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Nice pick for strumming and light picking.  Not for heavy metal!

269	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	nicely weighted & feels great to control.
They are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.
5277	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	Not sure what happened. I've owned these before and found them reasonably functional, at least when considering convenience and cost. BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use. I pretty much limit it's purpose for repair and maintenance work when I need to make adjustments to something but don't want to restring the guitar.
3601	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great sound and love the colors. Price is decent!

Like the other reviewer mentioned, you have to tighten the cable once in awhile, it's threaded on to cover up the back connector, (for that retro look).

The quality is fine. The price - incredible! I would gladly buy more.
2826	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Very comfortable, very good audio quality. Be warned that they're open back, so there's little to no isolation (e.g. while tracking guitar, I can hear the strings noise over the processed sound coming in from the headphones), and there's leaking (people around you can hear you, and if you use them to track vocals you will get mic bleed).

It was smaller then I would have pictured, but it still is a good product. It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off. Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in. Besides that, its highly recommendable to anyone. I will definitely pick up more for my other axes.

The outer body is a strong, hardened plastic and unlike other faux leather cases under $100, It's unlikely to rip, tear, or get crushed and damage the guitar inside. I'd feel very confident travelling with this case. The latches and handle are solid and secure. The inside is soft black fur on firm foam that holds my guitar snugly. There's also a good sized compartment to hold strings, picks, capo and even a small metronome.
8242	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I give it a 5 only because I really like the grip on the Dunlop picks.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with these picks.  Having said that, the .38mm pick is really, really, really thin.  Although I needed a thin pick for some accompaniment work on the acoustic guitar, these picks barely makes a whisper.  I'd have been happier with something a little stiffer.  They're not really meant for picking out melodies.  There's almost no feel to the pick on the string.

5803	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a good sturdy "home" case.  I bought it for my Nighthawk and the fit is not exact, but the slop is not excessive.  It is nice and snug on a Les Paul.  Decent padding and stout enough structurally to be stackable.  Not a trustworthy "travel" case ~ definitely not airline proof unless you just get lucky.  Interior compartment is standard capacity, fasteners are adequate, not outstanding.  Pretty good handle and overall the case is functional considering the price point.

Pad response.  I find that I really have to pound on the pads to get higher velocities from them, and it shouldn't be that difficult.  They should have included a setting for pad sensitivity so this could be tailored to the user's playing style.  Perhaps the pads will get "broken in" over time as I continue to play on them
4003	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	It's a very cute little capo. It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small. But it works.
 I bought a plastic one at first...NOT GOOD.
4289	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The stock Hilo strings that come with the otherwise great Fluke Flea don't do much for me. I don't like the way the feel or sound (too plinky, or something). I swapped those out for these Martins and they sound much more full and slightly louder in volume. It feels good fretting chords on these. The clear look also stands out on the Flea's black plastic/black fret combo. That's an immediate reaction. We'll just have to see over the long run how these strings work.
I've owned this pedal for over 5yrs, using it as a sustain for my keyboards.  I play almost daily and gig maybe twice a month.  It's held up beautifully and looks/works just as well as the day I bought it.  Works with any keyboard I've used thanks to the polarity switch.  This thing is completely solid!  You can stomp on it and stand on it with no problems.  I don't think I'll ever use any other sustain pedal for live gigs.
With the M600, I can finally understand why mahogany soprano ukuleles were so so so popular back then. The factory strings really muted out the sweet and docile tone, while the Aquila strings overrode the tone with its own bright bouncy sound. However, with the M600 everything is balanced and nice. I can really hear the wood sing!

* The Chinese examples of the sunburst model that I have seen have a slightly golden-orange tone to the sunburst pattern, more like the traditional sunburst color in American guitars. The Indonesian examples I have seen have a much more over all orange look. Basswood does not have a lot of visible grain. The example guitar shown in the official Epiphone product photos, the photos you see on most web sites like Amazon and Musician's Friend and so forth, are probably a little optimistic when it comes to visible grain and the golden hued quality of the sunburst finish.
One of my least favorite pedals was the Boss DS-1.  Sure, it was inexpensive and extremely durable, but it sounded lousy.  It was a noisy, brittle, fake sounding tone, and I didn't find a likeable sound no matter the settings or what guitar or amp I was running it through.  Long story short I had it modded into a particular Marshall overdrive circuit and its now fantastic as it sounds nothing like the stock models.

The Paige a very different design and I really like it.  I recommend that you consider that option as you can leave it on the guitar and slide it onto the headstock when not in use.  Some folks don't like them with guitar stands that hang the guitar by the neck, but I find you just have to be careful in how you place the guitar in the stand.

This bag is for hand carrying to different places, but do not use it on airplane or any other travel that requires checked baggage etc.  I traveled to Vegas with this case and it suffered extensive damage and marring; however, it did protect its contents well.

3197	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I struggled a bit installing a Furman Power Conditioner/Surge protector and a Soundcraft Ui16 into this rack.  The installation requires that you install your rack mounted devices in between the case and a supplied rod and then use the bolts to make the connections through 3 consecutive holes for each bolt that your device requires. It got a bit tricky because the rod does not easily line up with the holes on the case and holes on my devices, so it took some doing.  However, once done, it appears to offer solid connections and device security.  So overall, I would say it was worth the installation effort.
1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the "Easy Ukelele" app I mentioned above.

When I wanted to make changes to one of the presets, the instructions were of minimal help. Although it attempts to explain how to do a task, the instructions are generic, fragmented, and wordy. From the time I opened the box until I finally figured out how to make simple changes, I have spent three weeks in trial and error and handwrote a dozen pages of my own notes, tables, and instructions, just so I can use the SR16 adequately. I have not even attempted to create anything new and cannot imagine the nightmare it would be. This has been a frustrating experience, to say it respectfully. The reasons I plowed through all this frustration were 1) customer ratings and comments, 2) the lack of a reasonably priced competitive drum machines, and 3) the sounds were actually good enough for my limited use (Im a guitarist).
I bought these at a local music shop.

The onboard overdrive isn't nearly as good as Vox's tube overdrives on the big amps, but I just use the clean settings and use my effects, which it does perfectly.
As to the sound, it's great!  A 3/4 scale guitar is not going to project loud, but it's tone is very pleasing.  I would recommend getting light strings (11-47 or thinner) for a beginner.  The guitar stays in tune well, I have not had a problem with the tuners as others have claimed.  The neck and frets are first class.  The size is perfect for a child.  All in all this guitar is great.  For the money, or even for several hundreds more, you will not find a better guitar.  I highly recommend it.

Do your research before purchasing any MD player.  All in all, this is a good value and the ideal microphone for those wanting to record onto a Sony MD.
2621	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	Sound quality: 3 out of 5. Half decent, but not worth $29 in my opinion (even though I bought it for $12, which is about the right price for these).  The bass output is noticeably less than my JVC HA-S700 and sounds muffled compared to those.
767	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Works great and looks good.  I originally purchased this as a small snake but it ended up as patch cords.

Back to the LP 100, The set up on arrival appears to be good, but I may tweak this when the new strings are on. If your not sure how to set up a guitar please take it to an expert and have them set it up for you, most Guitar Centers will do this for a small fee.
8538	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I always use Evans drum heads, they have never failed me and I'll never look back.  I bought this head for my DW 10inch snare that I use and it takes a pounding.  I beat the hell out of my drums as I play extremely hard and after over 3 months of pretty continual use it's still in great shape with really no damage due to the dual ply.  It holds a great tone and tune for months of use, so if you need one get it you won't be disappointed.

7666	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I like the way these sound on drums and cymbals. Some other brush-type products don't make much sound on cymbals, but these do. You do have to be careful not to break the rods though.
BBE makes a point of contrasting this Sonic Maximizer with "exciter" devices that add harmonics to the signal. We agree. We use an Aphex Exciter (which is great), and the BBE Sonic Maximizer is quite different. So let's be clear that the BBE Sonic Maximizer is NOT a replacement for the Aphex Exciter or vice versa. We use both of them together -- with the Sonic Maximizer following the Exciter in the audio chain. The Aphex Exciter's "Big Bottom" makes thin ballads more robust while the BBE Sonic Maximizer brightens the sound. A great combination.

Is not only metal you have all the rainbow colors here for any type of distortion!
8776	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Overall, I've usually liked celluloid picks because they get a slight "stickiness" to them as they warm up or get damp from finger moisture. Whatever the cause, they are less likely to slip from your fingers while playing than some picks made from a different material. That being said, these tortex picks have a nice feel and I like the gauge of the orange picks. For the moment, they are my go-to pick for playing at home and my guitar students like them. I ended up putting in an order for a larger amount, because, as you probably know, you can never have too many picks.

These designs are already on the brilliant side, so I didn't want to overpower the uke with Aquilas.  Tried the Martins and glad I did.  I was taken with the clarity and warmth.  Less volume, yes, but that's what I wanted.  The Aquilas will fill the room, but there's a certain brash muddiness that I don't like.

4561	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	There's virtually no tension on these! Pressing down is almost effortless. I've used other silk & steel strings, but wow these strings are soft So if that's what you're looking for, you found it. That said, the sound was solid but not quite my cup of tea Didn't feel very articulate, bit muddy on the bass, bit thin-sounding on the treble side, volume low, but that's about what you'd expect for such soft strings. Might try the plain Soft strings next.

3281	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I had the distinct privilege of utilizing this microphone during a live performance. As a vocalist, it does not get much better than to hear your own voice reproduced exactly as you hear it in your mind; and that is exactly what the 87A provides.

The price is a bit steep but if you are like me--an individual after that tone that says "this is me," then don't be scared of the price tag!
5040	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	When I ordered this cable, I was looking for something that would kill the signal not only when you plug or unplug the guitar, but keep the circuit broken all the time the guitar is unplugged. The way this cable functions is the button is pressed when you unplug the guitar or plug in the guitar and the circuit is broken. As soon as you release the button, the circuit becomes active again, along with any noise.
8032	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic. I read a lot of articles and many of them recommended this one for beginners. I'm very happy with my purchase.
why didn't i do this years ago? because i'm cheap, that's why. i thought amazon would direct me to a low-cost pearl in the sea of otherwise cheap music accessories. sometimes you get lucky. but imo, a decent capo cannot be found in the discount bin. spend the extra few bucks and get this little feller. it's worth it.
8082	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Funny thing happened last Night, Power went out for a couple hours, Nice that the harp don't need No Electrics to use, aint too many things you can say bout that, I kept myself Entertained while the power was out.
1230	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I needed to upgrade my system. A shame they don't make them in the USA anymore.
2788	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Like Eddie? Well this is a good alternative to the cost prohibitive Big boy nameplate. I found EVH pots online, dropped in some hot humbuckers, with coil tapping options. I think this combo is as good as the "real deal". I don't care for Floyd type tremlos, so this works better for me. A roller nut and I,m always in tune. A great guitar for this price, even without any upgrades. This thing screamed, right out of the box! One warning for beginners, the neck is very narrow. Good and fast, just anyone with "fat" fingers may find it tight,especially those trying to hit only one string at a time. That is hard enough when learning and taking the great journey that is learning to play the gi-tar.
These should be sold as beads,  or charms,  that look like "real harmonicas"
I would buy more if I needed them.
4) The pedal design is very responsive to the foot when playing, jumping around, and stomping. Some of the plunger switches on other types of pedals can get stuck, break, or fail to engage/disengage when you step on them. The Boss switching is much smoother in my experience.

We bought our first set of these, the Zenergy5 with five chimes, as a bit of a lark. They rapidly became a favorite, which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time. The chimes sat on an end table, and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them.

3154	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Very Good!
5813	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use this just about every day. It's the most convenient capo. It does throw your guitar out of tune a bit more than Shubb or G9, but it's more quick and convenient, which is crucial for me. I'm often working with kids and leading services at my temple with my guitar, and it's great to be able to place it with one hand and not disrupt the flow of what I'm doing. No one notices or cares if I'm thrown slightly out of tune. If I'm playing a coffeehouse, everyone is doing their patter while tuning between every song anyway. I have used some of the other capos mentioned in that situation.
4287	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	Vater sticks are computer matched by pitch and weight AT the factory. For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.
9029	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful!!!
3743	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are great strings for my Strat. They sound and play fantastic. Probably great for a Tele, too.

The benefit of other capos is that you can decide how tight to make it, but this one you cant change its clamp, its a really strong grip and if you don't angle it well it can make your guitar be not quite in tune, but its solid, reliable, and quick to use that its far better than any others for me in Concert.

I would buy this kit again in a second, and I may very well buy another one.
I tried the 1.00 and 1.14 mm ULTEX picks for the first time maybe two years ago, and I have to admit, I think these are my new favorites. They have a nice feel, sort of that same almost organic feel of a regular Tortex. They're also very stiff, and because of that I'm generally using a thinner pick now. The best part is that it takes me quite a bit longer to wear them down, although it does still happen eventually.
For playing electric I like a pick that is flexible with some give.  Dunlop's 0.6mm nylon picks are what I prefer.  Looking for something new, I decided to try the 0.1m Big Stubby, the thinnest one available.  The Big Stubby has a pretty good feel, the depressed area for the fingers does help to maintain grip, and beveled edge helps reduce drag on the strings.  Although the Big Stubby is a very good pick, I still like the feel of the Dunlop nylons better.  The stiffness of the Stubby makes playing a little less comfortable.


These Yamaha pedals have been around for like 30 years and are still the same great quality made in Japan stuff I have come to expect from the tuning fork guys.
2714	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs... an all around tough mic....great for all your needs...I highly recommend them..
7056	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great accompanying drums for a guitar duo. Realistic sound. Takes some fiddling to find appropriate beats. Love the fills.
The last thing I'll say is the PG48 XLR is a good entry level microphone regardless of who makes it. Given its proper setting and application it's more than adequate to make public announcements or to sing to a group of 50 or less. In such settings there's no need to go the more expensive route, even within the Shure family. Just don't expect to be able to play in a rock band with it, because it's not that kind of microphone.
602	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Superb quality as expected, if you're familiar with this brand then you know what it's all about, couldn't ask for more.

6621	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product. Exactly as described.
I put one on the old head, just to see if it would give me a little more time before discarding.
6406	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased an ESP LTD guitar that came stock with a JB in the bridge and I absolutely love the tone.  It's bright and aggressive, perfect for hard rock and metal.  I particularly like bright tones so this works very well for me.  I will say that the output is a bit much for cleans (gives it a compressed, slightly muddy tone), but it works great running into moderate or heavy gain.
8098	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have used Martin Silk & Steel since I started playing, both 6 and 12 strings. My only complaint is that they don"t "live" as long as some other strings, but sound, price and playability(if that's a word)  are excellent.
5828	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good.

I was looking for a "Cheap" way to add mics to my Karaoke set up to save my more expensive mics for weddings (As you know, Drunk "Singers" tend to drop Mics) the quality is amazing and i will be ordering more in the coming weeks. There is ONE downside however, the XLR connection to the mic is PLASTIC. That is why i took one star off.
Pros:


7082	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful look, fits my hand well and works the way it's supposed to.  Great slide!!
Cons:


I love how these mics give me a good clean base recording. Using my favorite DAW (Reaper) I can easily liven the sound up with my own reverbs and such. The SM57s will give you a great image; you just apply your own colors.
2011	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a great responding microphone, I have been putting it to severe testing for about three months. I have been playing with this stuff for about 15 years, so I have developed kind of a good ear for audio. In my opinion this microphone is absolutely no muddy. For me it's got a great response of the audio spectrum. In vocal mode, I have singed normal, loud and louder and it feels like it has a deep response, like if someone was pulling the mic back so that it does the vocals don't hit the bottom. in other words, this type of quality mic, will be able to handle louder volumes and louder sinnging, with out a popin sound and feeling like when you sing without a microphone. I also used it to microphone a set of hometheater front speaker and it sounded great on my powered PA loudspeaker, which means this is a very dynamic and good for bunch of things microphone, since it's good for both vocals and instrument or electric guitar amp microphone. I got this outstanding microphone here at amazon.com, new for $69.99! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality mic, without braking the bank.

4056	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	What this pop filter has over most others is the extra little hinge between the gooseneck and the filter itself.  This makes it WAY easier to position properly.  The "stabilization arm" or whatever also doubles as a nice headphone hook if you have the filter installed on a vertical mic stand.  These entry-level pop filters all seem to cost about $10, and at that price point this one has the nicest features.

2) Acoustic Sound Treatment: This is what this foam is for. It will catch sound frequencies (specially high and mid frequencies, but definitely not the bass) when they try to bounce on the walls and will absorb a little, and scatter a little in order to reduce the echo or reverberation effect. This will in turn make your studio/room sound "dead" which gives your ears a chance to hear your mix a lot more accurately, and without the room adding it's own sound effect to your creations.
4509	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Bought on sale at less than $100. Could not be happier & I am not easy pleased.

Still, this cable is awesome at what it does.
It was "free" with the Tribute, but it just makes me question the quality standards of Epiphone - although the Tribute Plus could not be a nicer, better made guitar.
9170	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a dream. Stop worrying about picks, just get a ton of them and keep them in a drawer.

Over the past few months I have been coming to realize a lot of these items relevant to music is you get what you pay for and I bring this up to say that I feel that you get more than what you pay for with these strings for the price. Honestly I am going to be moving on to try better strings, but you can't go wrong with these ones.

Just don't abuse it and you've got a nice looking case that will last for years.

3612	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Arrived quickly.  Work well.
7228	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This cable is less noisy, with no annoying clicks and scratchy sounds when you move. It seems to reduce the hum as well and is flexible but not overly limp. The ends are secured well. One thing which won't matter to most people but does to me is that my cat, which has destroyed several power cords and cables, doesn't like to chew on it due to its woven covering.
I like this case because it is small, simple, and very well-padded. I know that I can keep this with my gear and I've got an array of mics ready to go without fumbling with boxes or milk crates. The denim seems very durable, and the stitching is solid.
363	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
The bass, treble, and gain controls are simple but give you a lot of room to define your own sound. The gain on the clean channel sounds great. The dirty channel provides a great fuzz tone on its own.

5239	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use, holds 12 reeds, and each slot is numbered, which is great for those of us that do a "reed rotation."  This case is compact and nicely made.
In my earliest days, I liked them because they didn't break like the Fender brand and whatever-else-I-was-using did.  Granted, it was poor playing technique causing the problem, but the standard nylon Dunlops held up, where as others did not.  Also, the .73mm has been the perfect thickness for me, too.  It gives enough for easy rhythm, but I'm able to play lead easily with it.  I like the .80mm just as much, and use it when I'm playing an acoustic or a more lead-focused set, but the .73mm is my personal classic and therefore my default.

378	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great Midi Cable
Note, too, that wood tip sticks tend to chip on the tip, eventually dulling the attack on cymbals. A trick I use is to coat the tips with a single coating of clear nail polish. This hardens the tip sufficiently to prevent chipping.
I bought 4 as gifts. Tested one. So bad I tested all four.

5507	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great capo for nylon or steel string.
I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that.
As this is the first time I've used these, the longevity issue remains to be seen, however having used the 6 string version of Earthwoods for several years now, I'm not too concerned...I suspect they'll hold up well (although only time will tell).
2482	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is the real Shure instrument mic.  I don't understand how 58s are regarded so highly, because I have never used a 58 without it sounding very muddy.  If you completely cut the bass on a 58 then it can sound cool.. but still not accurate.  The 57 grabs the sound you hear.  It is still a bit bass heavy, but not overwhelmingly so, and definitely not in a way you can't fix by tweaking your EQ.
My only concern is how well the material will hold up to cold weather, which I won't know until later this year.
1. You have to make your own grip if you need one, which you probably will. They don't slip out as easily as say, a Fender plastic pick, but nontheless will move around if you're being harsh on it.
8390	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I teach guitar and most of my students want to flat pick at the speed of light even if the fingers of their fretting hand can't keep up, so I give them one of these. Matter of fact, I bought one of these Dunlop .38s 40 years ago and have use them ever since.
3348	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I really like this little light. I also got the American DJ Pinspot hard gel color caps, they really add a nice touch. The body does get a little hot while it is working but for the amount of light it is producing that is to be expected.

The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical.

I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of "what if" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.

4890	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	The Capo works well but it is really not suited to the younger player. I got it for my 11yo who plays classical guitar and he had a very hard time putting on and taking off the capo. The spring did not get even marginally softer after a year of use. This could be a plus if you are an adult but I've replaced it since with a screw tightening version.
I've read on other sites that the screw for setting the overhang is a soft tinned metal,  so take care not to over tighten it, I hear they are hard to find(?)  I would think any parts store tho would have something that would work.  Doesn't take much force to hold in place, I just snug it and I don't tighten it.  I've also read that they are fragile(?), but I have no experience with anything breaking, I've only had it a couple weeks.  Not sure what part of it would break tho due to any design flaw that I can see.

I've used a cheap set of  harmonicas when I started but found they didn't cut it like the Hohners. My mom bought me my first G Hohner and I blew out a reed on it. So I had to replace it with another. I bought a second hand guitar and it had a Hohner A in it's case with it(what a find). I like the Hohner Marine Band a lot. A little expensive but they're worth it.
Another issue that caught my attention was the controversy of this pedal is the charging requirements:12vAC (which is hard to get if you are running an all DC power brick).  Many individuals say that they hate using the power supply or C batteries, well my answer to them is either 1) by the charger or 2) get a T-rex Chameleon fuel tank, (which has a 12vAC option and a special cable, designated for the Line 6 DL4 and many other Line 6 models. I know this is an expensive option but the T-rex chameleon fuel tank is very useful piece of equipment that will power most all of your effects which means you can kiss those boxes of batteries goodbye.  It also helps kill the very annoying buzz that ensues when too many units are running at the same time through your signal).
Works well with Windows 7 32 and 64 bit OS.  My only minor gripe is that the minimum number of samples is 128, which makes for roughly a 7 ms total latency.  The built-in soundcard on my HP laptop works down to 64 samples (32 using Jack in Linux), BUT cannot touch the sound of the MobilePre.  Note - using Reaper permits using a WDM Kernel Streaming driver instead of ASIO, which allows a little better latency.  Still, sound travels roughly 1 foot each millisecond, so the total latency is like have an amp about 7 feet away, which is barely noticable.
* Epiphone has more than one factory making these guitars. One is in China, the other in is Indonesia. The guitars made by each are very close in every detail, but not exactly, perfectly the same.
It is nearly twice as heavy as the ABS Gator case. It wraps the guitar body perfectly all the way around & the neck girdle locks it in. There is nothing around the headstock to bump the machine heads so you won't knock your guitar out of tune putting it away or taking it out. There are also several inches above the headstock so it will take a longer guitar or you can make a custom pocket.

3422	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great price for a classic string set. These are my first set of Boomers in at least a decade or more, they really are great strings and made right here in the USA. Having played flats for several years, these have a bit more tension than other rounds which i like, you can set your action very low without fret buzz. In addition the highs are much more subdued, even right out of the package and you don't have to wait for the twangy brittle zing to go away. As they break in, the lower mids become more pronounced, they have a nice warm sound but still retain enough on an "edge" to cut.

Secondly for the price you pay this cable seems amazing, granted I've only gotten to practice with it for about three hours, but it seems to pass a signal really well.  It appears to be well constructed: solid tweed cover (Which I much prefer to the old rubber coating), longer rubber reinforcement jacket near the plugs than the other low-end guitar cables I've had, and a Velcro tie to keep the cable together when wound up is a nice touch.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and will be sure to update this review if I end up having any technical problems with the cable.

There's no such thing as "tone" of a cable though, so if you think your lava cable or monster cables "sound" better, either brighter or warmer depending on who you are, then you're drinking the kool-aid. Inherent capacitance of a cable CAN affect tone, but if you're getting tone-sucking capacitance in a six-inch cable, then it's broken and you need to get a new one anyway.

Now, I can learn the timing of strumming and pick strumming without worrying about the chords so much (yet). I'm moving ahead slowly with this system and have started playing the songs in the course and this success has created within me a desire to continue. We also have one for my left-handed son (7) and his left-handed guitar. He is learning right along side me. We are really enjoying doing this together. The Chord Buddy has made this easy and affordable. Once we complete the course the plan is to move on to more lessons so this isn't the end-all but it is the best way I've seen to get started. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to start out. Tip: Be sure to get a "new" Chord Buddy that no one else has pulled out and replaced the tabs already.
2) because they take their time getting off the head (dampening resonance)they are quieter. much quieter then solid sticks. this is why most people get them i think.

i've never been satisfied with the performance of those other capos. they would be too tight, causing changes in tune. or they would be too loose, and wouldn't cover the entire fret very well. i would get fret buzz or dull tones. so i broke down and spent a bit more on a kyser.

After 30 years of hauling gear that was huge and heavy, how refreshing to get such MASSIVE sound from this small amp! I had total faith she'd sound amazingly good, and as soon as I began to play I smiled big time. A 10" speaker putting out virtually any tone with such clarity makes this a fantastic practice amp, and one could even gig with it in a small lounge type setting, perhaps run a line to the board.

This is a very special, very rare part of a Roland synth setup, and I was very excited.  However, at ~45 years old, most of it spent in a basement with a leaky window in the Northeast, the faders barely moved.  I looked at replacing them - not hard on old through-hole stuff like this, but I was a little concerned about finding the right part.  On a friend's recommendation I bought a can of this and put the TINIEST amount into the fader, moving it around.  The faders became fresh and movable, almost immediately! Some dead zones which had caused weird panning, and all the scratching, were instantly gone.  So - this stuff is fairly expensive for a can, but considering the amount of work it just prevented, this is a miraculous product.

At 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics.

back to the device, the sounds are as analogee as you could hope for, the tones when dropped an octave, are so thick, dense and awesome, that it is just amazing. there are some really nice sounds out of the box that are impressive, with a couple that are surprising and enjoyable, like a whistle kind of sound and other chirpy sounds that are, as my sister and I say...the future, as imagined in 1972!!!! that said, this thing will probably be what most people looking to make their own electronic music, indie/diy stuff, and anything in between. I am a big fan of tangerine dream, the blade runner soundtrack, as well as other vangelis albums, so there is some stuff in here that gets me to where I want to go. I just got it, but the more I tinker, the more I am happy with what sounds and tones I find.


6443	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I wish this place wasn't so far because I'd love to see what their store has to offer. LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE this capo. And it's pink.. :)  It is a very strong and sturdy piece for any guitar. I use it on my acoustic and my electric. Thanks Russo and staff! <--- Fast Shipping
4649	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.
2364	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	So far, I'm very happy with this Microphone. Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band. Although a longer cable would be nice, it's great a cable and was included in the package.
2012	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	There are 4 mics to consider in the $100 price category: Sennheiser e835, Shure SM58, Audix OM-2, and AKG D5.  I've been doing sound for 10 years.  Each has its own faults.
6582	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Fits my ESP electric guitar perfectly. Adequate padding for casual use. Zippered compartment holds my tuner, picks and accessories.
NOTE: if you plan to plug this mic into a 1/4" input make sure you get a transformer and not just an adapter.  XLR and 1/4" inputs have a different impedance, without the transformer your gain (signal level) will be very low!
UPDATE: After a few weeks of playing this, my finger-picking technique has improved tremendously.  The Backwoods is so resonant and has such a nice projection that even very subtle moves remain audible.  I don't consider myself to be a skilled guitarist, but I sound better than ever when playing this - I liken it to how sub-par singers will sometimes use a lot of reverb on their vocals to cover up imperfections.  I can play softer and with more precision, but still remain audible.  It's been a great guitar to practice with and it's shaken up my sometimes monotonous practice routine.
3500	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought this just to occasionally lay down 'bass loops' on the fly at my acoustic gigs. I play a bass pedal keyboard, but sometimes the song calls for a part that is too quick (or too specific) for my feet.  Like most of my fx pedals, I use it just for one specific sound. Serious knob-twiddlers could get much more out of it, but it does what I need it to do.
930	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	ok
2412	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The industry standard for live performance, the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason. These are the only microphones that I perform with, and the on/off switch makes it easier so I don't have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicing...I just turn the mic off.
163	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Good product
1462	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	They work great. They are a HOSA product, they are high quality. The only exception might be the 1/8" connector might not want to fit into a tablet or phone with a case on it because the barrel might be too big, but hey, that is just the way it is.

8281	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Best sound available - I have used both Remo & Evans over the years (since 1970) but ALWAYS find Evans heads to be easier to tune, better sounding, and a more durable solution.
7150	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use this 9v tip negative zero hum AC adaptor on my Dano and Boss pedals (i have 2). You can tell the difference between this adapter and the noisy ones from RShack or the cheap multi adapters.  I've had this product for 3 or 4 years.
1026	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Yeah, cheaper than the rest and great quality. I don't know if it makes any difference in the sound but it cuts the money going out towards gear. Lightweight and still tough.

6164	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This amp is great. The only thing that could make this amp better would be if they could somehow have made it tube driven while retaining the full low-level sound. I have a Marshall tube half stack and I find myself playing the microcube much more often. Not only do I keep my hearing, but I also get more versatility. Currently the micrcube is the only amp I play in my dorm room. This amp is perfect for beginners and just as perfect for the more experienced guitar player wanting to have some quite practice time. Great amp!
even the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down.
7231	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Worked perfectly out of the box!
But by the time I was done, I had a good-looking, good-sounding, easy-playing instrument that I'm sure my friends will all want to play once I get a case and strap for it and start getting it out of the house.  If you buy this banjo for close to list price in a music store and all of the above work has already been done, you will feel good about your investment.  If you buy this banjo mail-order or from a discount place that doesn't set up their instruments, be prepared to do some work or pay someone to set it up.  That goes for ANY banjo or guitar that costs less than a good used car, however.

127	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This seems to have much better sound than the even cheaper plastic recoder it replaced.  It is well made and has good sound for the price.  (Key words here are "for the price".) Don't expect it to compare to and "real" wooden instrunment.  It does it's intended job well - teaching kids the basics of music but I gave 4 not 5 stars because it still hast that "plastic" sound quality but I doubt any inexpensive plastic recorer would be better
9859	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	high quality hassle free design.  Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  Very happy with this purchase.
6243	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you don't put it on right. When used correctly though, it does it's job just fine.

Now that's a Fun king wah wah!!
4702	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I own three units capable of tremolo: Boss TR-2, Line 6 MM4, and the Boss SL-20 Slicer (like a tremolo on steroids). Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo. If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.
Pros:

2179	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	This guitar initially was perfect for my granddaughter, even her professional instructor thought it was a nice instrument. Fast forward a couple of months, the neck has developed a convex bow making it completely unplayable. I've taken it to a guitar technician for inspection and he declared it is unrepairable due to the neck bow, and it is a manufacturer defect.
7576	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Love my Cool Rods. Well made and about the size of 5a sticks. Quieter than drumsticks but louder that brushes. I bought these mainly for practicing but I could see using them in venues that don't need too much volume. I haven't had them long so not sure how long they last. If you are a hard hitter go for the Hot Rods or Lightning Rods.
3308	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This mic is perfect for me. If you like to have the mic right up to your lips this is for you. Much better than even the SM58. I got mine from a local store and when I got it I hooked up our church's SM58 and the new beta. Made sure each channel was dialed in exactly and even my picky(and cheap lol) wife could tell a dramatic difference to the highs and lows of my voice. I sang to songs to demo them. This is Amazing Grace by phil wickham and I Write the Songs by Barry Mannilow. Both songs just blew me away. The difference in the high longer notes and key changes was fantastic. And just to make it even better the low notes that I struggle with came across wonderfully too. If you know how to work the proximity effect with your setup prepare for applause. Google that if you don't know what it means! If the extra 60$ is bugging you get a demo unit or a like new used. If you can sing it's worth it.
1107	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Really nice supple cable. Good ends. Looks to last.
10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one's being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog's away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more "full, balanced and warmer." In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that "classic vinyl sound" than the AT. Choose whichever "flavor" suits you best. You won't go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart's stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and "authority."
These are great strings in the mid-range of string quality and prices.

770	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Made very well, has a good strain relief on TRS plug.  Solid construction.  Good fit and finish.  Am very happy with these cables.
9619	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Does what its intended to do. Although the back part of the clip slips a little with a "V" taper on the rear neck and better on flatter or rounder ones. A bit concerned with the tighter  tension so I'll keep an eye out for detuning in the future.
Addendum: Though I referenced this in my review, the other great feature here is that it can be moved from guitar to guitar with little effort..just loosening the strings to reach in and removed the endpin jack. It's also nice not to have to alter a good guitar.
3594	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Godly made guitar
Your choice of cable can make a big difference in your tone. After more than 40 years as a serious guitarist, my advice is do not skimp on cables.  Avoid buying those cheap ones. That goes for guitar cables, speaker cables and microphone cables.  The investment in good ones yields dividends not just in tone and low noise, but also in reliability over time.  Cheap cables fail much sooner, so you have to factor in the cost of frequent replacement, not to mention the hassle or embarrassment of dealing with a malfunction. In my experience, Spectraflex cables hit the sweet spot where price and quality intersect.

4705	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets.

4631	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	as described no issues  excelent intro guitar for the money..highly recommend
I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).

To add so Disco Fun. My 5 kids are extremely happy and really enjoy dancing every week. Next year I want to conver our travel trailer so we can take the disco on the road !

I've tried every drum machine ever made, and I always come back to this one.  The sounds are clunky and dull compared to more modern machines, but for a quick jam, you can't beat it.  It's quick and easy to dial in a beat and a tempo, and the two foot pedals make a live performance almost plausible.  If that's how you play, I recommend this highly.  If you want to program an entire song and let it play for a set duration, there are better choices.  But for laying down a beat in a minimum of time and still having the capability to mix it up with two patterns a some fills, this is the one to get.  Let me add the I bought and returned the updated SR18.  It sounds better, but I found the beats less useful and some were downright weird.  Pretty much the same experience with the BeatBuddy, though I still have it and use it when I have the time and patience.  I wish Alesis would just update this one, give us better sounds and a few more beats, but retain the ease of use.
Update:December 2012

7636	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I recently got into harp playing a few months ago, to learn a few folk songs(dylan, Young, Pety, etc) and use it to accompany my guitar playing. When I picked up my first harp, I picked up this holder to use with it. After using it for a little while, I found out that it does fit my neck good, and stays in place, but some of my harps, like my Hohner Special 20s and others do not fit to well or rest to well in the holder. They set to far back. My Lee Oskar harps fit better, because they are a little bit wider. Thats just my observation. Mine has the big black wingnut on it. I also bought the Hohner 10 hole holder, which I think fits me better, but its made in China, where as this one is made in Germany. Oh well trade one thing for another.

I used this drum machine for recording the tracks on this  YOUTUBE video

Installation was simple also, straight on. Finish is great; however, metal washer for the strap ends could get damaged depending on what type of tool you use to install the locks on the strap.

6625	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Amazing bag for such a great price. Holds LP style gits perfectly. Seems sturdy with good craftsmanship. I'm happy.
If you're a professional recording engineer or musician, that's one thing. You can probably justify spending a lot more. But if you're in the semi-pro category or just an audiophile who wants the hear the music as it was intended to be heard, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these monitors.

3408	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	You can't go wrong with Boomers.  They are bright but not harsh, and are consistent in manufacture, pack-to-pack.  I've never been let down by these strings, for either my basses or my guitars.  The red silk on these grips the machines well (and looks cool), and once they have been broken in they stay in tune.  These strings are equally at home on a Precision or a Jazz.  If you play a lot of mellow, upright-bass-style jazz, they might be a bit bright for you, but for 90% of what most people play, these strings deliver.  If you are looking for good bass strings, and you are comparing lots of brands and don't really know which ones to get, try these.  I've been playing guitar and bass for 25+ years and GHS Boomers are my favorite, by far.

The sound is also a little different than what I was used to. I was hoping to get something brighter that will cut through a crowd of banjos and out onto a busy loud dance floor. They do that just fine! They have a high overtone in them that is very bright and almost tinny. It's not a sound for everyone, and I wouldn't go for it myself if I just wanted to quietly strum in an empty parlor. For hillbilly hoedowns, though, it's just fine, even though it took some getting used to.

6360	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought this pickup as a replacement for a stock pickup in a very low-end guitar to give it some character.  It is a great improvement, and the pickup really shines when used when the amp has some crunch on it.  The pickup is pretty high-output compared to everything else on my other guitars, so it's a bit difficult to rein in the sound and clean it up, but, as I said, it does crunch/gainy tones very well, and it's very reasonably-priced.  The only reason why this pickup doesn't get 5 stars from me is simply because there are better pickups on the market--much pricier pickups, to be fair (Lundgren, BKP, etc), but I'd have to reserve a 5-star rating for them.

The picks last for a really long time, and I would recommend getting several thickness' for different applications. But for sitting in a room playing around, with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick
That still may be a little high for those who want the look and sound but can't afford a Hofner. I can highly recommend the Epiphone Viola Bass as a good sounding and easy playing alternative to the original!
If you're looking for an affordable and dependable amp with tonal qualities that you can not only bear but enjoy this is a great amp to purchase.

The guitar this model is probably closest to, in spirit and purpose, is not the Gibson Les Pauls but, rather, to the old Gibson Melody Maker guitars from the 60s. That said, this is a hell of lot more guitar for the money than any Melody Maker ever was, and adjusted for inflation, relative to what a Melody Maker would have cost you in 1968, for example, it is almost like Epiphone paying you to play it.

A vast assortment of sounds are possible; there are 50 pre-sets so I can "plug and play" and there are a virtually infinite combination of user-preset options available.  The manual is thorough, but there are videos on-line that provide excellent tutorials for those who aren't fans of reading tech-speak.  This is a great way to improve timing and coordination, using as a substitute / second drummer.  Foot switch options let the user start and stop without needing to use hands to start-stop. Second foot switch provides A/B functions.

Young students don't really need to tie a classical string.
I'm loving it tho, I would buy it again.
It works very well for attenuating the sharper "P", "T", and "S" sounds that cause spikes when doing voice-overs. This is a well made unit that connects firmly to the microphone stand with a screw clamp (see my picture in "Customer Images" of this unit connected to our&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-USB-Microphone-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blue Microphones Snowball USB Microphone (White)</a>) and has an flexible neck so it can easily be positioned as needed.

5252	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Compared to Schallers, they seem kind of, uh, less-than-solidly made. But from a design aspect, they're a better idea than Schaller. They don't grind around the strap pin like Schallers, and are much easier to install. One potentially big problem: the pin can easily be disengaged by pushing the button. If you tap the butt or horn of your guitar against something, look out...

I love the additional length (most 7As are 15.5", but these are 16") and the wood is just slightly lighter than a couple other major brands' wood. I'm often loooking for less volume so this works for me.

6453	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Overall just a good, solid capo. Keeps my guitar in tune while in use. Sounds good. Easy to put on and take off. A must have for any acoustic guitar player.
9222	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I just started playing acoustic guitar after 30 years of playing drums (easier to play around the campfire).  The guitar I bought used came with a single pick.  A Tortex .50. Great deal and amazing pick for strumming.  Def buy again

756	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Hosa makes great cables - no exception here.  High quality, has withstood the rigors of mobile/wedding DJ use.
It has very prominent muddy lows, which give it a kind of charm, but I find it lacking in the high notes. The tuning pegs aren't the best, and seem to loosen slightly pretty often. Lastly, which is mainly my fault for choosing it, but god, the black glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet. I guess it shows how much time I've put into playing it, but its not like you can clean and polish a guitar with anything.
7372	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that I use with my bass.  The 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non-intrusive smart looking setup.  I'm pleased.  I've owned them for a few months now.  No issues at all and they look good.
4523	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Maybe a little too light for smaller guitars.  I suggest going with lights.

5668	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This is lightweight, small, and does the job perfectly.  HOWEVER, it is very difficult to one-hand change this thing.  I thought I was just not doing it right, but then I used a friends capo and it was a completely different kind of mechanism.  Again this is great and works perfect, I just wish it was more of a light squeeze and move, rather than a forearm workout squeeze tool.
- I also like the even-more-affordable PG48, especially for a cheap bass guitar cabinet mic.  It's frequency response drops off a little later (losing 10db from 100hz to 50hz instead of starting higher at 200hz).

2183	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Perfect!
Both of the cymbals I own are significantly different. The 16" has a higher pitch, opens rapidly on attack and has rapid decay. It's perfect for accent-type crashes or marking the one (or four depending on the style of music you play) coming out of a fill.  The bell is fairly small and the cymbal itself is not nearly as versatile as its 18" sibling.
7754	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I will not play with normal drum sticks unless I am forced too.
Like any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away. At the price offered at the time of this writing (approx. $9), it's worth buying 2 (so you can play along with someone else)
But a funny thing happened when I plugged in the MD-2 Mega Distortion: it actually kinda rocks!  While the tone of this pedal probably isn't a complete reinvention of the DS-1, the "bottom" control gives it considerably more bass.  In fact, this might be the only BOSS distortion pedal that gives you the low end control of a MT-2 Metal Zone without getting stuck into the niche tone of a "metal" pedal.  While pedals like the MI Audio Crunch Box, Marshall Guv'nor, and others are referred to as "Marshall-in-a-box" pedals, the MD-2 actually does a brilliant job on smaller combo amps of simulating the "whomp" of a large cabinet pushing air with bass notes.
7302	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I JUST received this yesterday.  BUT, I have been using the SR16 for over 15 years and used the HR16 before it since the 80s.  As some have said, right away you can hear the improvement in the sound, not that the SR16 sounded bad... but this sounds great.  I have yet to build my own patterns with this but I see all the familiar buttons to do that, so I suspect it will be very similar to the SR16, which was easy to use, though certainly time consuming to build the patterns, but thats ok.  I have gone through about 10 of the patterns so far only because I plugged in my guitar and jammed on each one.  Here are the early thoughts:  Number 1, if you are a guitarist who has to jam alone a lot, you are going to absolutely love this thing because of the fact that you can get some really nice drum and bass going on at the same time.  The pads that give you the drums also give you the notes for the bass for you to program that.  Each of the patterns I whipped through took me into different guitar ideas and such, same as jamming with a live drummer and bassist would do.  It was fun... and, you know, if you ever have to spontaneously just play SOMETHING for someone it kinda sucks when there is only guitar unless you are a world class guitarist.  With this, you get the drums and bass along with you and it makes what you do sound more interesting.  Number 2, I think the existing patterns are pretty cool for jamming, but they seem a bit busy for recording... so look at this drum machine as a tool in that its greatest use out of the box is jamming... and then you get the bonus of having the ability to program it for song demos.  I have a real drumset and mics and processors and let me tell you trying to record good sounding acoustic drums is a nightmare.  In the end the better sounds of a good drum machine, while not always as organic as you'd like still lead to a better sounding demo most of the time compared to live drums in a home demo situation.  Number 3, reiterating Number 1, if you are a guitarist or keyboardist... really... the ability to have bass involved as well as drums is AWESOME.  I thought the bass would just be a nice little bonus.. its done better than that to make it more than a little thing.  I read many reviews on here of people downplaying the bass feature saying they would record their own bass.  I agree with them... when recording, you would.  But... for simple fun and jamming... this rocks.

I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it's been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a Gibson. What's also amazing is that it's still around a $150. It's well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you. It's still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you.

4. Cheaper than Eric Johnson pick, which is just as good or just a tad better.
4651	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I was expecting these to sound a lot worse. The difference in intonation, volume, projection, and sustain when I go from mediums to lights is noticeable to me, so I was expecting the same going from lights to extra-lights. I was wrong. It is way more subtle, at least to me, and the bendability that is gained from the lower tension is great for lazy finger blues and such.
8917	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Love these comfortable picks, easy to hold, mold around your fingers and help the sound I'm going for. Love the pack.
EDIT: I ended up swapping this for a Dimarzio Gravity Storm neck - the new pickup isn't as bass-heavy and has more overall clarity, which is something I wanted.
2898	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I'm not that old, but i knew good quality when i was a kid. i bought a pair of Austrian made in my early teens. After 20 years the headband wore down and cracked, so it was time for a new pair. These came in and sound just as good as my 25 year old pair of Austrians (even though these are made in china). If you want and insanely good sounding set of cans for (well) under $100, this is a sure bet. Some pairs are still made in Austria, so check your box. You may get lucky. Lastly, lots of reviews talk about items moving around in the packaging, but mine was packed, all in place.

Decent price. Nice value. Perfect fit for the bowl shaped resonator backs Ovations have as proprietary.
4915	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Simple design, elastic draw cord and spandex fabric.  But it works perfectly.  Using it on a Yamaha full size keyboard.  It is not necessary to go over the top of the music stand if you don't want to; you can just cover the keyboard itself, and it still works/ looks great.  You could make your own copycat design for cheap, but would probably need a special (serger) sewing machine, several hours time, + source the supplies.  This is way easier and worth every penny.  Great fit on 88 key Yamaha.  Easy to take off, but a bit trickier to put it on, especially for kids (think fitted bed sheet sproingage).
Based on other reviewer's comments, this cover is unlikely to fit 88-key workstations or other large synthesizers. It is perfect for my 76-key EX5, and seems like it will work well with slim 88-key keyboards.
That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.
The construction appears to be rather durable.  I haven't noticed any noise interference while using the headphones.

Most mics are great for some things and lousy for others, but this mic is basically good for everything, and will outperform even very expensive ones if you know what you're listening for. Not universal, but pretty close.
2197	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I was hesitant and couldn't decide between this and Shure's cartridge.. Then  l read a lot of people said that this particular cartridge is bright and I know for sure Shure is warmer (i've owned one before). 440mla has a more detailed sound according to many videos and samples I've heard and since my speakers tend to give out warm sound anyways, I figure I should get this "bright" cartridge (knowing that it will be toned down by the warmth of my speakers) and it happened, beautifully.. just right!
8530	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	There just isn't much to say about this... They say put your MONEY where your mouth is... I say put your PICK(s) where your mouth is..!  These clip to your mic stand, they securely hold about 8 to 10 extra picks, and they are right in front of you when you drop a pick, or break a pick... And if you play out, on stage, for any length of time, there will be a time when you loose a pick.!  For just a few dollars you can a few extras close at hand, when you need them.. You won't have to stop the band, or go look for one between songs... Or worse, pull one out of your pocket and drop your hotel pass, or car keys, on stage.. ( How embarassing to have to explain to the hotel front desk that some girl took your room pass while you were on stage...)  NOT that I ever had that happen, L.O.L......

8906	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the "grippy" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up! Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming, they are not too thin and not too thick. I use the .60mm, .48mm, and .38mm. sizes.

At the gigs I have played, I am using the Gramma, but so far I hear no difference when A/B'ing it's use.
8805	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	I had to send this back. Its a great concept but not well thought out. When you put your mic system in it fits snug with the foam pads. If you plan on using the short antennas then you can leave them on the unit. I use the range extension antennas that are longer and they won't fit unless you remove and put on each time you use. The other issue I have with this design is that when you unzip you can't completely remove the ends of the case. So when you are using there really isn't a good way to have it set on table. With a little adjustment on design this would be a really cool simple case to have. Unfortunately it didn't  work for me. I'm a huge fan of Gator products too. Hope this helps!
2376	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	very good
4114	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are my go-to drum sticks.  The wooden acorn tips tend to flake and aren't as durable as the nylon tip, but I find they are great for smaller venues when you want to play a little more quietly.
The second complaint is kind of a catch-22....I think there should be a model that does NOT feature the lock and key. It's a nice touch and idea, but in the case of this rack, when you're putting the covers on or off for transport, you have to tilt it away from you to get the bottom tabs of the covers in or out of their slots. Takes a little more time, effort, and care than you'd want
1344	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	the sound is really bad, wondering if I had a defective cable , for the price I not even bother to return.
8991	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Visually this capo bothers me (the clear-ish bit of plastic protecting the back of the neck is ugly), but it works perfectly. It is pretty solidly built, and I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I'd be interested to see how mine holds up to time, but I do have a friend who bought from this brand several years ago and it still works well. It seems like a pretty solid capo that does the job and is attractive other than that neck guard.
  These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion
like the option of NC or NO.  saved my gig just tonight when one of my Midi controllers lost it mind an needed NO instead of normal NC.
Then again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can't really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection.  That just doesn't mean you'll want to use it all the time.

There are no bad effects of this stand on my guitars.  They sit nicely on it, mostly supported by the neck, but the legs offer the base of your guitar something to lean on as well, meaning its not as much tension as a normal neck-support stand.  And that's probably good.
9188	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is an underrated Boss unit. It's better than the Metal Core, and great when you're going the pedal route for a heavy sound into the clean channel of an amp. There's a lot of room for tweaking so you can dial in a good sound.
4144	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Works great


526	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	Although the cable functions, I am not happy with the quality. My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig.

2019	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I'm really impressed with this little lav mic system. For a $120 bucks it performs exceptionally well. I've had no issues with range and or battery life or sound quality. Is it perfectly crystal clear? No, and anyone who expects that without dropping hundreds on a high end lav mic system is delusional. However there are easy things you can do in post production to make it better. I edit on Adobe Premiere Pro and all I do to clean up the sound is use the "denoiser" effect and set the noise reduction to -8 and voila, done. It takes literally 5 seconds and the result is perfectly acceptable broadcast quality sound for the projects I work on.
This mic is terrific. I have used 3 mics not including this one. SM58 and Beta 58 which are good quality mics. And an Audix 02 which I disliked greatly.

8324	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This was a gift for my bass player from his dad. I was merely the purchaser to get it here by Christmas. This thing is awesome. We spent some real time with it in the studio the last few sessions and I have to say the effects sound great and the simplicity is nice. My bass player has never used pedals before and given that this has simple stomp box functionality and multi-effect flexibility, it is a good fit for a novice pedal user. I could also see value in it for a professional wanting a simple set up to take to gigs with them.
There is no on/off clicking when depressed.

6063	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I know, I know, many people hate on this pedal, calling it "stale", and "generic". The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.

I was expecting to receive a dinky pedal about the size of my hand. This is a sturdy large pedal, even wider than my guitar wah pedal. I bought this for use with my Yamaha Reface.  This is a great buy for amazon Primer's.
9454	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've never used these before and decided to give them a try.  After playing a couple of different guitars using these, I think that I will enjoy them. They matched up very close to the same size and shape as the Fender flat picks when I compared them. The Tortex .88mm thick (green) pick seems a little stiffer than the Fender medium celluloid picks, but they also seem a little softer. They have a very slight surface texture that may help keep it where it belongs in my fingers. When playing my acoustic guitar, it seems that I get a slightly softer tone than with the medium celluloid, and I like it. UPDATE: I bought some of the .74 mm thick (yellow) picks and they are slightly more flexible than the green as expected. Very nice softer tone.

I've bought this kind for my husband before as well in black. They work great for changing keys without having to completely retune the guitars to another key in the middle of a gig. I have several musician friends wanting me to order this capo for them in different colors now. The seller sent the exact item pictured and the shipping was quick. The price was pretty good too considering how much our local music store charges for a capo that doesn't stay. This one grips the strings tight enough not to shift while playing. Easy to put on and move as well. Would definitely purchase again.

If you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look.  More importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality.  It has to feel right.  In addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate.  For that I recommend the Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (ASIN B0002F73YY), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease.  I have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position.  Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again.  This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!

I found these strings to be utterly disappointing. Dull sounding with a very stiff and unresponsive feel.  For "light" gauge strings, they required an awful lot of torque to get them up to concert pitch.  So much so that it raised the action noticeably.  If my Taylor had been strung with these strings when I was shopping for a 12-String, I would have passed this outstanding guitar over.

The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree.
As for myself, I've tried to apply some legitimate banjo technique to this guy -- playing it with metal fingerpicks gives it a much brighter sound, and you definitely don't want to strum it like a guitar. Banjos don't have those lowest notes, so keeping to the higher strings makes it sound more like a regular banjo, but honestly you can make some kind of cool sounds with the low strings too. It's worth exploring, even if the lowest strings will betray you as a banjo impostor.

8475	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My favorite so far!  The 3 dimensional shape of these have really improved my picking.  As a beginner, the flat sides of a traditional pick sometimes cause me to attack the strings not very smoothly.  These have totally cured that problem thanks to the very thick and rounded profile.

However, if you have invested in a good, quality sound system and perform either live or in the studio this will be the weak link in your system.  As with most things in life, you get what you pay for and I was sadly mistaken when I thought a $14 switch would perform inline with my band's sound system.

2176	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I've changed my entire review to try to clarify some things about microphones and "phantom" power.  "Phantom Power" is a term that describes a power source required for "Condenser" type microphones.  It is usually 48V @ 7mA which is active on the cable that connects the microphone to the amplifier.  I suspect it is called "Phantom" power, because there is no indication that it is there, except that a condenser microphone won't work without it.  Sometimes, a condenser microphone will have its own power source, usually a battery, to provide the electrical power for the microphone circuitry.
229	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Just started to learn through independent study and online videos. This pedal makes me sound so much better than I am. It's a lot bigger than the picture; that's a good thing. It looks professional. I'm keeping it when I upgrade to the motif series of keyboards.
On the other hand, I am not used to using 24 gauge conductors and probably wouldn't if this cable was longer than 18 ft. That would probably be my only knock and it isn't really a knock since it is appropriately sized for the length.

4) Now consider that the Jemini and Satchurator are $199 and $129, respectively. Nice pedals? Yes. Worth up to four times the DS-1? After using both for a few months, I'm not entirely convinced of that. Since I'm a pedal collector, they're staying put in my house.

I particularly like the right angle plug. It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars. That's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar. This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it.

It's the same sound as the original orange DS-1; that classic solid-state distortion that's a little noisy, heavier than the SD-1 or those Tube Screamer type pedals. It can push overdriven amps quite well, though with more gain than an average overdrive pedal, and can stack with overdrive pedals. Great pedal if you're looking for that punk-meets-noise/college rock kinda sound from the 90's. Basically the 2 effects pedals that were popular for 90's rock were this, or the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi (NYC). I'm trying not to say it nails that grunge sound like every other reviewer on here, and doing a quite good job.

After I spent some time with the SH-2 on clean, I switched on the SH-4 and went all out with the distortion on my Boss Metal Zone pedal. The first thought I had was that this sounded like high definition distortion. The sound just popped out as clear, detailed and dynamic. Power chords sound that much more powerful. Chunky and fat. Tone and sustain are increased for single notes. Bends squeal and hang on forever. I also experimented with some classic rock and blues sounds and they sounded much improved as well. The SH-4 LOVES distortion as it seems to grab every little sound and is eager to go as fast or hard as you want to. It also gives a unique custom sound which is what I've been looking for.
It's really powerful and noise free as a soloist artist.  Not sure how it would be in a full band but I love it, except for that short cord forcing me to buy an extension cord for it.  Great product, great price and fast delivery.
3782	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a neat little invention.  You put it at the head of the guitar and you have a few extra picks right there.  Since I don't like to sing and play at the same time I am never near a mic stand when I drop a pic.  This is perfect for me so I really like this little gadget.  If you want something that holds a few pics and you move around like I do then this is the thing for you.
7090	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I had an Alesis drum machine back in the mid 90's. It was basic, and looked fairly similar to this one. I never really figured how to take full advantage of all its features, but there were enough pre loaded beats to be useful. Over 20 years later, I seem to have a newer and better version of the old one. It sounds great. I just don't have a lot of patience, but the basic functions are easy enough to figure out.
Should you ever choose the Shure M92E over the AT311EP?  Yes.  When you have records in only fair to good shape and they are not perfectly clean the Shure M92E would be a more prudent choice since it tames at least some of surface noise present in worn or dirty discs.  So when should you choose the AT311EP?  When you have clean records in excellent shape and a system capable of doing something with the extra high frequencies it can pass.  The Shure by virtue of it's less pronounced high frequency voicing will sound better with less apparent surface noise when playing noisy records. The Shure is also going to collect a bit less dust from deep in the grooves since it doesn't go as deep where the real trash collects.  I've noticed the slightly narrower stylus on the AT311EP tends to collect way more stuff from old neglected records because it goes deeper in grooves where dust is next to impossible to remove with traditional record cleaning pads and carbon fiber brushes.  I can't get to some of that dust and gunk on used records from a second-hand store by using a Discwasher pad cleaner but the AT311EP stylus sure can.  When you have an excellent to near mint clean groove you can turn the treble up and the AT will sound far more airy without surface noise or distortion.

This left me with two main choices: the Epiphone EB-0 or the Gibson SG Standard Bass. (Epiphone also makes an EB-3, but only in long scale.) I found both of these in a local music store and was able to try them out side by side. Given the huge price difference (you can buy five Epiphones for the price of one Gibson) and the fact that the Epiphone lacks a bridge pickup, I expected the choice to be obvious and immediate in the Gibson's favor. I was mightily surprised, however, at how well the inexpensive Epiphone held its own against the higher-end instrument. While the SG Standard Bass certainly can produce a brighter and more diverse range of tones due to its dual-pickup design, the Epiphone's tone is quite pleasant and a pretty good approximation of the heavy, warm roar characteristic of the classic '60s short-scale Gibson basses. (Listen to Jethro Tull's song "Nothing Is Easy" for the sound of a vintage Gibson EB-0, or Cream's "White Room" for the EB-3.) The feel and playability of both instruments are excellent; the differences are not all that significant, though some may prefer one or the other. The Gibson's fretboard is slightly wider, but I preferred the narrower Epiphone.

It's not a great sounding pedal on its own, through the front end, as it doesn't have amp-like distortion dynamics. That's how I'd tried it when I first got it. What I do now is push a slightly driven preamp signal THROUGH THE EFFECTS LOOP. It's FANTASTIC for this. The not-quite-tube like dynamics actually benefit my sound in this setup as the preamp is doing all the tuby stuff. The DS-1 pushes and thickens my signal in a very musical way, adding just the right amount of signal complexity and boost to enhance the output stage.

I use these mics for home recording and I couldn't be happier. I have miked everything from drums, guitars, vocals to woodblocks and even drills/power tools. These mics are fantastic for a closed mic sound as they reject a lot of background noise (so they also work great for playing live). This means they are absolutely fantastic for drums - it's very easy to record multiple tracks with minimal "bleeding" coming through on other tracks. I mic all of my drums with these, except I use a Beta 52 for my bass drum, and currently I use lower-end overheads (these are the weak link in my setup). The SM57s aren't fantastic for cymbals.

I thought the pedal was a fair approximation of an overdriven tube sound (again, when used with a tube amp!) but keep in mind that comparisons like this never survive side by side comparisons (I mean, really, combo modeling amps don't REALLY sound like a Marshall stack when played next to a Marshall stack) so when I say it approximates an overdriven tube sound, that's as accurate as I can be about it - it sounds enough like an overdriven tube amp to my ear that I am happy with it. Your results may vary. One thing for sure is that the price is hard to beat, and as others have noted, Boss sound effects pedals will last long after you have gotten tired of them and sold them at the garage sale.
The Guitar is pretty, sounds good, action is high.  I mention the action as high, as when your banging away on bass if its a low action you will get buzzing, this one has no such issue.  The only 2 gripes I have with the Bass itself is 1) its passive, so to use it with my pc or playstation (Rocksmith) I will need a preamp, 2) the picture of all 3 types have a thumb rest.  It is 100% the reason I bought this kit over the Dean, and its no there.  Oh well its home now, so itll do.  Just disappointing that its no as pictured.  Again it plays nice, sounds good on the tiny amp, wife had no complaints when jamming so Ill chalk it up to a win.

Bottom line, it needs a real problem situation to prove it's usefulness, and I've had none so far.
First, while they may not be as quick to place as the "clothespin" type of Capo, and therefore maybe not the first choice for LIVE performances (where you need to change setups quickly), they WILL give you far more secure control of the strings once in place. You may need to "arrange" the strings a little before clamping it down, in case they've splayed out a little (and they may). Once clamped down, it's NOT MOVIN'!

pedal..  This is the best pedal on the market for the price by far.
8912	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I just ordered a 72 pack of these because its the only pick I've used for over 30 years, but for some reason I tend to lose them as soon as I put one down. Of course, I find them everywhere in the house eventually. I don't like an extremely light pick, but I don't like a really thick one either. Unlike many players, I don't use the pointed end, but instead I use the rounded edge. I find this way much easier to control my string attack not just for tone but for speed as well. I tend to wear out all picks fairly fast, but these last longer than picks made of other materials, especially plastic. I wear these picks out at the rate of about 3 a week, but a plastic pick won't even last through one gig. I consider a pick to be "worn out" when the edge wears down and no longer "bites" the string (also when there's no more logo on them). I also do a lot of hybrid picking using my fingers for things such as double stops, and always when playing slide and I find these picks very easy to palm. As I stated earlier, I've been using the .60mm orange picks for over 30 years, and I wouldn't use any other.

3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.

3385	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I have only used the DM-80 kick mic from this set, and it's just ok for kick (doesn't hold a candle to something like the SM52 or similar). But the DM80 is, and I know this sounds weird, fantastic for live vocals. I randomly tried it one night at a bar gig in an impossibly muddy-sounding room where even my Shure Beta 57 wasn't cutting through on vocals, and it instantly stood out. You have to scoop the mids and boost the highs a bit (but not as much as you'd think) and suddenly the average male tenor voice just jumps out. The mic also defies proximity effect and has a pretty wide on-axis pickup pattern, which is great for singing with your eyes shut (singers tend to wander from the mic when they do this) and for vocalists who think it's sexy to get their lips all up in the grill, which usually makes a 58-style mic go boomy. I got a lot of weird looks from people in the audience who know vocal mics, but I also got a lot of compliments on how present the vocals were in a room that is notorious for being terrible for understanding lyrics.

6585	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	At age 59 I decided to try guitar synthesizer world with very limited knowledge. I bought GR-33 Roland. I was in love with the unit use Gk-2a. I turned 60 Time became an issue .sold GR-33 bought almost $500 more GR-55. within one month realized what a disappointment. It was too many sound in each group you had to constantly edit . Sold half price only 4 month old just the unit, buyer was a bass player who told me people don't need your pickup GK-3. I guess what they use is Gk-3B for bass. Buyer got a good deal because I by mistake send my Roland cable . but he told me to try GR-20 . He was right easy really no need for manuals. I used a goodin guitar. I mostly play nylon string. It is well built but input jack 13 pins was acting. BE Aware If you have goodin brand new buy an extra unit circuit board with both 13 pin and 1/4 jack because if your 13 pin acts all Godin reps only want to sell guitars not repair or parts. The local  guitar repair shop decline to install a new 13 pin input jack and told me godin them self can't fix it .So far I tried to give some of my experiences to those that are new to this . I install around 12 of these type Pick ups, the last one was an Axon 101 pick up. THIS PICK UP WON'T WORK ON YOUR NYLON STRING GUITAR. That is why I mentioned Godin because you can play 13 pin with nylon string. If you are into guitar synthesizer to play moon light Sonata Piano sound using your Guitar think again. but it is very handy if you are one of those people who likes to right his/her own piece. If you are young and eager go for it . Axon is better although no longer is made specially when the latency is an issue the sound board is no match for Roland controller . This is a good pick up with a part for Les Paul type bridge. but I rather use guitars with single saddle . you see a tiny L shape  part which is 1 mm. this is the most important part of your installation . IT IS 1 mm The distance between string and GK-3 pick up. closer you play one note receive two notes farther sensitivity problem. Therefore , if you use this jack on Les Paul remember IT IS 1 mm how you do it is your creativity. Those people on You tube use a guitar which set by experience technician. Don' expect you do it that easy Detail is the clue, it is exciting. Piano is challenging. my last installation was with Axon controller .I put GK-2a on Les Paul. Axon 101 pick up on Fender full attention to radias and use the L device. after you are done installing put on 20X magnifier to see push the L between string and your pick up . It should go in and out touching the pickup and string without lifting the string. super important. The GK-3 is good. After installing 10-12 of them I am convinced the 1mm and 20 mm distance between saddle and GK pick up are essential.. Keep that in mind, Like I said not that many choices you have. unless you want to install some other Technic such as GHOST graph tech which you can buy it in Amazon. However before making any decision look at your ability to install. Do it professionally cost money. After all this. This GK-3 is the easiest way to get in. Remember your guitar must use steel string magnetic. Now my vote which is a BUY.  Good luck and Happy new year.
5169	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Simplfied my rig and this was the final piece of the puzzle. I'm a bassist and acoustic guitarist that plugs directly into the amp with no effects and recently switched to clip on tuners from my pedal tuner. I bought the 10 foot, right angle cable and use it for my guitar and I love that at the flick of a switch I can kill the signal and tune my guitar. With the right angle it sits very well in my guitar stand too. The preamp on my guitar isn't very handy and doesn't have a mute switch or a tuner installed just a volume and a tone control. This cable gives me the mute capability with the push of a button. Bonus, switching guitars is a lot easier and I'm not at the mercy of the sound guys to mute me.

A key advantage is its unidirectional cardioid pattern allows you to isolate each drum or cymbal with minimal-to-no bleed if you closely mic them.  The frequency response is 70~16,000 Hz, making this mic ideal not only snares, toms and cymbals, but also alto and tenor saxophones, trumpets and other instruments. And because it can be used close to sound sources, you can also mic amps with it.

Anyway, I know something about good tone and these strings are not bad at all. They feel good, also.
As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE.

I generally keep Overture Ultras on my violin which are are fairly close in price to these (love the sound of Helicores, but they're really loud if you're just a living-room player and are double the price).  Tried the Preludes for the first time a month ago as a set came with my daughter's new 1/2 sized violin.  I tried to be open minded, gave them over a week to stretch in properly....and they still sounded awful.  Tinny quality, very little resonance, and just sounded lousy compared to my daughter's 1/4 violin.  Finally gave up and switched out the Preludes with a set of Overture Ultras with the wound E string.  Night and day difference.  Now I am fully aware that different strings can sound differently on different instruments, but I was seriously underwhelmed with the Preludes.

I couldn't get it setup, the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp, and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint, the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished, and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price, this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it, at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector, I'm not out much on the purchase price. I'll add it back to my own collection, and upgrade the electronics.

4462	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Previously, I had bought a Schaller lock for an Epiphone ES339.  The screw that came with the Schaller lock was too skinny and couldn't get a bite into the wood.  And I could not use the original Epiphone screw because the head of the screw would not fit into the Schaller lock.  I then installed these Dunlop strap locks on the same guitar with good results.  I also installed these Dunlops on an Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and an Epiphone Viola Bass guitar.  For the Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and the ES339, I did not need to do any drilling and the new screws got a good bite into the wood.  But, on my Epiphone Viola Bass...when I was installing the provided screw near the neck...the screw hit something solid which might have been the truss rod.  I had to cut-off about 1/3 of an inch on the screw to make it fit.  Again, I could not use the original Epiphone screw because it just doesn't fit the Dunlop lock.  As others have mentioned, the Dunlop locks "stick out" about 1 1/8 inch from the guitar when the strap is attached.  It looks a little weird, but I'm sure I'll used to it.  I plan to get a couple more of these same locks to put on my other guitars.

There is not tension adjustment, which I would have to say is a negative. A Capo does have the ability to wear on your frets over time if you constantly use it and you don't have tension adjustment.
Despite having the widely considered inferior bolt-on, this bass has some great sustain.  In fact, my only complaints about the insturment were that it was awkward to play while sitting down.  It wasn't THAT bad, for those of you who've played a "V" sitting down, but it did take getting used to.  My only "real" complaint then is, as another reviewer stated, the guitar is head-heavy and will tip down a bit if you let go of the neck momentarily.  Once my neck swung down and smaked the floor!  But its built tough, and there wasn't a ding or a nick.

If you're serious about your sound, I recommend going as high as you can stand in the string gauges. But if you just want to make your guitar a bit more playable, try these out.
3586	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed "off"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).
I think they are just barely noticeably more comfortable to play and fret, not really anything special but they are still great sounding and playing strings that I would expect from ernie ball

Effects aren't too bad.  Trem is pretty good, reverb a notch behind, and I'd stay light on the Cube's flanger and chorus.  Forget the "digital tuning fork" - it's just a button that generates a tone to tune to.  Any kind of separate tuner is far more useful.

I was using a Shure Sm7b that I borrowed. I was looking to have guests I my podcast but am unable to afford purchasing 3+ $350 mics (Shure SM7b).

The jumbo cases were rarely in stock, and cost about 40% more on top of the regular prices, presumably owing to that relatively few guitars are jumbos, compared to dreadnoughts.  I was in a local music store, and we'd tried just about every case they had.  I was about to bite the bullet and give SKB $144 for their case.  On a whim, I slid the guitar into this case.  Nearly perfect fit, with room for my strap, tuner, capo, a spare set of strings, etc. -- and saved a LOT of money!  In the past, Gator cases had been a bit thin and brittle, but today's Gators are an outstanding value.

They work GREAT for reduced volume levels.  Meaning that if you want to reduce your volume of playing and still be able to HIT the drums, these will work dramatically.

The world is full of guys who will zero in on all the details they find inferior about this guitar by noting the rather obvious fact that this is not a Gibson Les Paul Standard costing $3,000.00. There are some people who will complain that this guitar has a bolt on neck. True, the set necks of the more expensive Epiphones and Gibsons are nicer. But, considering the fact that every Fender Stratocaster ever made had a bolt on neck, is this really a big deal? Would Jimi Hendrix have played "Purple Haze" better if his Strat had a set in neck? Probably not.

The only real disadvantage is it doesn't grip as hard as other capos and you have to retune as well.

6731	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these, and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market.
Then, I got my first pick from an experienced guitarist friend which I found to be way too stiff, exactly what I was afraid of. So, I started shopping aorund and found some Dunlop sampler packs. Tortex? Way too smooth. Max grip? Way too grippy. I tried and liked the .46 Dunlop standard but after a while it introduced finger fatigue because it was so bendy, and individual notes didn't ring out so well. I tried a bunch of other picks too. Some are too small. Some are so smooth that they take loads of finger strength (thus, fatigue) to grip during vigorous playing.
Solid build quality, seems very durable.

5614	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	This capo is inadequate for my needs. It has trouble producing enough tension and is fiddly regarding intonation.  Prefer Shubb.
I had to get rid of the adjusting screw knobs and grind down the screws to lower the bridge enough for the strings to be at the right height from the frets.  You also need to cut the grooves in the bridge for the strings. Used my old bridge as a pattern.
Truth be told, this was a key factor in my decision to purchase the mK as I wanted it for live vocoding. Software/VST vocoders are great, but they tend to be process hogs, especially in live situations, so for this reason alone, I insisted on the hardware route. Upon setup, the first thing you need to do is replace the freebie gooseneck microphone that it ships with. A lot of the reviews that I've read say that the mK's vocoder sucks, which if you use the gooseneck, I somewhat agree with, however after popping in an inexpensive dynamic mic, the quality difference is absolutely amazing. Also, depending on your intentions, the supplied vocoder patches are pretty lame, so you will definitely want to create your own, either manually or with the software editor, especially if you're going for the traditional robot/Cylon effect. On a final, yet critical note, since the mK only boasts an 8 band vocoder, I strongly suggest running the output through an EQ to enhance the mids and highs.
On the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof. You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.

No paint comes off, no dents in the pad where it touches the strings (even though I have a higher voice and just use use capos most of the time to make it easier for me, even when the original singer doesn't use one), there's not a mark on any guitars I've used them on, and they're super quick to use one handed. I've even used one on a uke with success. Super well made. Buy one.

7462	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've been looking for an Acoustic Guitar pick up for live use for a very long long time. I've tried K&K, LR Baggs dual source, lyric, m1 active... and this is the closest to a Mic'd guitar sound with without feedback.  Here's the pick up in action (youtu.be/MhM7zNuSerk)
It fits the ABT60 Baritone Acoustic only guitar, but its a snug fit around the body. The neck support is decent and there is about 2" of space about the headstock.
3466	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Good reeds - very high percent of the box are quite playable.
83	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Really good set of cans...very good overall...all genres.  These things need power to perform at there best, amp hungry.  They are not my Ultrasone PRO 550 or PRO 750...but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone.
2356	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great Mic! Does a perfect job. I'd strongly recommend to get this on/off switch version. It is more expensive, but it gives you the control to kill the sound, especially when echoing is a problem (trust me, it will happen).
2873	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	AKG. Done.
The lone surviving Shure P-Mount cartridge is a fair cartridge and I've used it before, but it is not as airy as the AT311EP.  I gave the AT311EP 5 stars because while there were better P-Mount cartridges available at a sane price there now are not any better ones.  So a 4 star cartridge by default becomes 5 star in absence of the better models that are gone. The next step up is the Grado Black and for the casual non-audiophile listener like me with consumer grade components, while very nice, a Grado would be overkill.  The AT311EP is a steal right now costing less than dinner and a movie.  Unless you spend $75 you just can't do any better in a P-Mount than this.

What you don't get on this guitar that you might get on a higher priced guitar is as previously mentioned - a glue-on neck (this one is bolted on) fancy large inlayed fret markers (this has the usual dot markers common on many guitars) and binding on the body.

The 4 stars only because it gets in my way otherwise a 5 because it is well built and easy to use.

These probably wouldn't work to well if your gear constantly gets banged around, I'd probably upgrade to the heavier duty model.

If you play a gig that calls for lower volumes, but you still need natural dynamics and feel, especially if your brush technique is weak, these are a great choice.

5930	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I own a Les Paul case for my Gibson Les Paul Studio. The quality of the epiphone is close to that of the American made one, hands down almost the same exact case. One note, I bought this case for my epiphone Les Paul PRO Custom, I put the guitar into it and it did not quite fit. It was off only slightly which was the foam. Easy fix though I put the guitar in the case closed it and placed the case on its side for about a week. This quickly fixed the snug fitting issue with no problems. I highly suggest to purchase one of these if you own an epiphone and want to protect your baby. This case is well worth its value.
Update: I use this capo and the 6 string version daily.  It has held up perfectly and I am really happy with it.  I would immediately buy it again if I lost it... which would have to happen because it will never break!

But, to all but eliminate the nagging issue of having to buy 2 copies (or more) of certain records and even then, more often than not, not completely solving the IGD problem, I surely would have saved the price of the AT cartridge considering the 150 LP's and counting I've done so far.

The plain strings are smooth and crystal clear. These are truely the old school strings, but I had forgotten just how great they sound and play. In the time I've had my latest Les Paul, every string has sounded a might off...Enter the Gibson Vintage Reissues....That "off" sound is history. Articulate, is the first word that comes to mind. Simply the finest string one can use and I was glad to return to them. I have no idea why I didn't get back sooner! For an older player that has tried nearly all there is out there, I came back to the Gibson strings as they simply are the best there is. Period. I'll neve use another string on my guitars again. Glad I came back to the real deal. Everything else just comes up short compared to these strings...

6539	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	The back straps are connect by metal hooks which dig into your skin when carrying it. Anyone with a Epi knows these things can get heavy so the metal hooks being weighed down on your shoulders is painful and can snag your hair if its shoulder length or more.

1550	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Works well so far
there are some great drum pad sounds, and a much better electronic drum selection. to compare this to the akai wouldn't be fair since that is waaaay more for hip hop and r and b, while this one is more for rock and dance and stuff, they are kind of geared to opposite people. if you play guitar and are into music like that, this is the better choice, plus if you are into electronic music, there are some cool sounds too, though most people making that music have tons of options with computers and software like fruity loops and all that stuff. so this is the upgrage for guitarists and bedroom musicians that want to create music with better sounding drums. I am re reading the manual I got offline and while it is more or less easy to create a pattern, I am reading it again to really get the most out of it, since there is a lot you can do with it.

2948	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Sure, this is not the Sure SM58.  But it is so close in sound quality.  The SM58 is a bit warmer but I found it requires more "e q"ing.  I'm a singing drummer and recently bought this because I was sick of sticking a mic in front of me and having to play like a robot.  I put this on (the build quality and fit are both awesome), plugged it in, and sang.  It sounded great even before adjusting the levels.  It is a bit dry without effects though.

These are also a great tool for teaching you to gauge your pick properly.  You will learn to easily and consistently get those squealing harmonics, as well as to improve your precision.  I've even reached the point where I use them for heavy strumming and funk without breaking strings.
3566	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Recommended. Good sustain after extended use. Nice ring response to the pick; still a fair tone response to bare fingers. Slurs could be better, but, it is a 12 string. Good price. Best, no shredded callouses after a long session.

It blew my Logitech X-530 5.1 Speaker System's subwoofer away (but considering that it's an upgrade from a 70watt roughly 6" sub to an 400 watt 15", I'm not too surprised it's much louder and harder hitting).

I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version), two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's, and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again, I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)
5726	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Great folder.  Appears to be well constructed.  I would have liked the pockets to be even deeper than they are, but I have a LOT of music for a swing band that I store here (about 200+ songs, many of them multiple pages).  With that much music, the spine would need to be a little wider to allow the folder to lay flat while filled.  However, for normal amounts of music (a couple hundred single-sheet songs), this would be great.  Very nice look and finish.

1. The guitar has incredible action. This means how high the strings are set from the fret board and how hard you have to press down to play notes or chords. You don't need to press down hard at all, and anyone, even kids, should have no problem playing notes. Acoustic guitars are usually set with a higher action making them a little harder to play. It was pretty much in tune right out of the box.
Happy Customer!
2808	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	If you're looking at this starter set, you're probably in a similar position as I was.  And you're looking to start playing bass guitar, but aren't so self-assured or financially inclined that you're looking to spend a lot of money on a beginning instrument.  Which brings you to starter sets in the first place.  You want everything you need at a good price while not sacrificing playability.  And to me: that's exactly what this set is.

Fancier, more expensive cables from Monster and Mogami are no more advanced in their design than this, and while I'm sure they perform measurably better (as they claim to), there is an important difference between "measurable" and "audible." You want some money left over to buy strings and beer. I'm not convinced that a $75 cable sounds two or three times as good as this.

I've always loved Tortex and nylon, so I switch between all three types.  It would be nice if they sold a mix of all three types so you could try them all.
These white nylon picks should last a lot longer. The non-pointed end is all grippy (textured), so it doesn't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick, but it does the job and I like it. The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely, but you can still pick with it if you're combining picking and strumming.

5061	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I started putting these on my guitars when my guitars started to get expensive. I now have several sets in use and no problems. I can't say if these are better than other styles because these just work so why change? Only thing that is a pain is they are hard to get through the strap when you install them. I used a hobby knife and enlarged the hole slightly on all mine. I will be buying more.
6017	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Perfect. Just what my nephew needed!  My brother is so going to hate me for this but it needed to be done. The boy has been playing "clean and quiet" in his bedroom for too long. He needs some grit under his fingers so he can get inspired. This is just the pedal to do it.
It's inferior of course to a great heavy amp distortion from a great amp head. But, if you need to play at apartment volumes it's a great solution and doesn't cost much. It excels at heavier sounds, but I wouldn't recommend for a blues guy.
even Eddie or Slashes tone is in their fingers.

These Martins sound pretty good for a while (E,A and D have a surprisingly rich tone for this guage and G,B and E are outstandingly crisp and bright) but they do need to be changed sooner. I've found that (as with all guitar strings) wiping them down with a clean dry cotton cloth after each session tends to keep the finger oil build up on the strings to a minimum resulting in a bit more longevity to the life of the strings.

2789	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	1.0	Deal or not, if you are serious... you do not buy a guitar in this price range.  And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).  But for me, brands like Silvertone and Archer... are just plain no good for real use.
2530	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I have used this mic for 4 years to record my guitar amp.  It sounds great, but sometimes you need to play around a little with mic placement to get a good sound.  This mic has been abused, and it is practically unbreakable.  Criticisms:  Mic has a very short range and low gain.  When recording voice you need to hold very close to mouth.  When recording guitar you need to have the amp very loud.  In both cases you need to turn up the input gain on your recording device.

However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work).

7455	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	These strings are cheap so thats a plus but thats about it with the sound more resembling banjo stings.  I simply could not get a good sound out these even though I tried and tried.  Everything just doesn't sound right and more metallic and too sharp for my ears.  I played for my wife who said that they sounded really bad.  They are really thin and feel cheap almost like the strings that came with my violin (a cheap violin).  Do yourself a favor and pay extra for good strings but than again if these stings would of been five or ten bucks than I would be happy knowing what I would probably be getting.  These strings would be a good starting point though so don't get me wrong.  I just have learned to like better and little more expensive strings.
For bass drums and instruments such as baritone saxophones and trombones, the DM80 does a reasonably good job of capturing the low end with a frequency response of 30~15,000 Hz and sensitivity of -73dB, +/- 3dB (@ 1KHz, 74dB SPL. In addition, this mic is excellent for micing small bass amplifiers when playing in cramped spaces where it makes sense to use something along the lines of a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fender-Rumble-30-Bass-Amplifier/dp/B00365YTOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fender Rumble 30 Bass Amplifier</a>&nbsp;to save stage space and use the PA to augment the signal.

What I particularly love is that I can park the capo on the head of my guitar (next to the tuner) when I don't need it and quickly grab it and put it on without much fuss.  The capo grips well, applies quickly anywhere on the neck, and I can use it on a variety of guitars as well as other instruments.  It even grips well on the first fret where other capos can sometimes buzz.

Definitely recommend.
There is no added hiss, hum or distortion.
Comparing generations: If you're buying previously owned model be aware that some features have changed over the years. First generation SR-16 models (1991-circa 2001) had about 1/2 of the user memory than that of the current production SR-16. Also, the first generation units did not have a headphone jack. In the early 2000's Alesis updated all the preset patterns creating a market for "vintage" SR-16 machines. Also, over the years the price has dropped significantly. The SR-16 was originally marketed as a high-end studio product with a price tag around $400. While the quality of the unit has only improved, the price has dropped as computer parts have become less expensive (also newer units are mass produced in Asia).
Of all brands,  I break Promark sticks the least often by far,  although every drummer would tell you differently.

Regarding the complaints that the TU-80 has trouble hearing a note: Most tuners have this problem to some degree, depending on the player, the instrument, and how far away the tuner is placed from the instrument. For acoustic guitarists, I suggest laying the guitar on your lap (soundboard side up) and setting the tuner directly on the soundboard. You neednt bang out the note, as doing this on the bass strings will cause the tuner to rattle against the soundboard. Just pluck the string at a medium volume, and the tuner usually will have no trouble sensing the vibration of the soundboard. Bear in mind also that some tuners have trouble hearing the bass strings. (The original Intellitouch tuner was notorious for this.) If your tuner doesnt hear the bass strings well, play the string at the 12th fret harmonic.

I own many more expensive guitars, but I find that the Les Paul 100 is a very enjoyable guitar to play. My 8 year-old daughter refers to it as my "pretty" guitar, and indeed it is very nice-looking.

We lost the five-note chimes after we had a party and our house, and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them.

I bought this to have along with the DS-1 and to use with a tube amp. I have played a Les Paul, Strat and even a cigar Box guitar through it and it sounds good after a few adjustments. The gain knob can be used as an overall volume knob while keeping the amp volume level but adds some heavy high pitched distortion which may or may not be desired, but using this pedal along with the DS-1 should cover any distortion sound one may need.

Different track lengths for each pattern.  On the old SR-16, all patterns were 2 bars; eight beats.  Boring, maybe, but useful and predictable.  It was easy to insert a fill because you knew what was coming.  On the SR-18, some patterns are 16 beats, some are 8, some are 20. . .I forget.  But there you are, jamming along and you go to the Fill function to bring you to the chorus. . .and it starts the fill 8 beats too late.  Sheesh.  With the SR-16 I got so good, I could just tap my footswitch and get a single cymbal crash at the end of a phrase.  Not possible now. . .at least, not without years of study.

Dean was very good and sent me a new tuner the first time. After the second one broke I replaced all of them with Schallers. I made a big difference in how it tunes, very smooth, and holds it pitch. The other thing that I just remembered is that I changed the nut to real bone. Other than that I think it is a great bass for jammin. The Neck does need adjustment from time to time.

Finally, if you are starting up as a band on a budget, these and the dual channel pre-amp may be all the microphones you need for some time. In fact, you may be satisfied and not want to upgrade as you get more successful. But if you do, these can be relegated to the role of spares and you will continue to get value from them that way.
The other issue is that one of the fans comes on very quickly and is considerably louder than the other fan.  The QSC tech said it was normal because the speakers were meant to be used in a loud environment and fan noise was given no consideration.  I don't buy it since the other speaker's fan is much quieter.

We lost the five-note chimes after we had a party and our house, and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them. At the end, we gave the chimes to him, which delighted him, and of course delighted us as well. The next day, we purchased the Zenergy3 three-rod version of the chimes, simply to have something different. We are equally happy with the three-tone chime.

I play in what can best be described as an insulated shed. I sing in very close proximity to my fellow band members' amplifiers. At the beginning of the night, while the mix was still at what it should always be at, this microphone was like a small slice of musical bliss. Unfortunately, by the end of the night, the instruments were turned up to deafening levels and I had to switch back to the, also recommended,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shure-Beta-57A-Microphone/dp/B0002BACAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shure Beta 57A Microphone</a>. Not because of feedback issues, amazingly; but because the condenser was picking up too much ambient sound. Even though I will probably never be able to use this microphone consistently, due to my band mates' love of noise, I really wish that I could. I highly recommend it.

3159	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent stand. The contruction is solid and the design is what is needed to protect your guitar. This stand has the same design as the hercules stands but is not quite as solid but then again, it is cheaper. I bought the stand for use a church and it has worked well. The "hanging" style of this and the hercules stands are the only way to go if you want your guitar to be safe. Do not make the mistake of trying toi save money by buying the tubular desing wherein the guitar simply sits on the stand. Even if this type of stand is solidly built the design is flawed. With those types of stands a simple bump by someone walking past the instrument or a brink wind when outside will knock over the stand and your precious instrument. I would rather lean my guitars on an amp or chair than use one of those type of stands. They are for fools only. If you can afford it, get the Hercules. It is the best stand on the market. If you want to save a few bucks, these stands are a quality alternative.
The above paragraph basically leads to - now all my ukuleles are strung with Aquilas, as most every online sources I have researched praised Aquilas as "the strings to have", and you don't really see much said about these Martin strings. (Aquila and Worth seem to be what everyone talks about on UU and other sites). I have discarded my Martin strings, and got rid of my first ukulele, the Makala Pineapple, as I had better ukes, and thought I had better strings.
8207	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I just recently tried these picks and love them so much I ordered another set.  All the picks I've used previously were smooth, and I had trouble gripping them consistently.  In other words, they would turn so the pointed end wasn't hitting the strings, and occasionally slip from my fingers altogether.  Problem solved!  These picks have raised lettering on the upper part which provide a non-slip grip, and these are the only picks I'm using now.

My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)
-(*____) Comfort: The most uncomfortable harmonica I have played, bad enough that I make sure to stay away. This is a thick harmonica, but the problem is with the coverplates protruding over the wood comb. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, creating increasing discomfort the longer the harmonica is played.

If you have a similar desire and are looking for strings in this price range, we recommend the Martin MSP4200 strings.  Remember - these will be a bit harder on the fingers than the typical nylon strings, so be patient with yourself and practice, practice, practice to build up your tolerance if you find them a bit uncomfortable at the start.

I prefer cables that have all metal connectors so that is why I did not give this cable a five star rating.  The cable works fine despite that it has molded plastic connectors at both ends.  The cable supports two channel audio (stereo) but since I use it to connect to a mono device (a one speaker guitar amplifier) I don't get (or need) stereo sound by using the cable.  I am happy with the performance of the cable for home use but would not advise using it where it is likely to encounter rough treatment .

So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.

She loves it for that and recommends it to teachers (she is actually a counselor).  And, it seems like a good value.
2896	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	When I researched headphones (in general) I looked at all aspects: quality, sound, makers, and in particular - comfort. I really just wanted a decent pair of them, and so I put my time in and "experienced" just about every pair available at a local (large) showroom. I tried the $500 pairs and the middle roads, and the cheapies...and frankly, they all fit and sounded (to me) roughly the same. I certainly expected a lot more for $500 is what I am really saying here, (like maybe seeing earth from orbit. I mean - $500? Are you effing kidding me?). In any case, I was unimpressed.
4392	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I replaced the original Aquila Nylgut on all my ukes w/ the Martin. The concert size Lanakai and the Cordoba definitely sound nicer w/ the Martin M600. Maybe a tad less volume than the Nylgut, but noticeably better clarity and sweetness.

I admit I was swayed by all the advertising for the new SP strings or the Elixirs, D'Addario, DR, and even Dean Markley, which were all fun (enjoying the small change of a new string) when I first put them on but they never got that piano like clarity that these get once lightly played (read broken in). Oh sure, they're all nicer to your finger tips... but at the sacrifice of tone. So every time I've come home to the Martin Marquis string and it's been like coming home for Christmas; it really doesn't get any better than this. You pluck the string and it makes this huge wood & brass sound. Yum. If you have a really good guitar you're going to hear it end to end.

The bass could use some extra umph, but what is there is warm and not overwhelming.  Highs are very natural and never harsh.

The SM57 is considered a staple for recording guitar amps, as well it should be... except this mic is TRUE to sound.  Without a bass cut, and a *mostly* flat EQ (I trimmed the highs by about -4dB), I can't tell the difference between the sound of my amp and the sound coming through the headphones.  I was very skeptical because a lot of reviews make it sound like this is better all-around microphone than the SM57, but less of a specifically-recording-electric-guitar microphone, and I cannot disagree more.  This is my new go-to microphone for recording electric guitar.
1551	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Good
3550	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	But not for this price and utility. Conditions for hearing music are never perfect so must you have super expensive  perfect strings?

The Tuner it came with is small, very tidy, and doesnt work on the E string.  It works on my acoustic, and electrics as it uses vibration not sound to register.  Would not tune in the bass it came with.  I like the style of it so it will be donated to my church for them to use on stage.

Epiphone's fitment chart states this is the case for the DR-212. That is 90% true. The DR-212 headstock fits with several inches to spare, the neck girdle will hold the DR's much thicker neck, DR body width is the same but it is narrower than the AJ. The bottom of the DR touches the foam but has about 1/2" around the sides allowing it to swing around like a clock pendulum. With the lid closed & shaking the case I could detect no movement so the lid puts enough pressure on the bridge to hold the DR in place. So I'll be getting another 940-EDREAD.

9299	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My go to choice in thickness and texture for an electric bass pick.  Solid and comfortable.
NOTE: You can connect a volume pedal a few different way, if you put it before your distortion pedals it acts like a gain control and cleans your signal slightly as you dial the volume down. I wanted to swell my volume up and down without affecting tone so I connected it in front of my effects in the effects loop. Second point, I have a series effects loop. This allows me to control volume and not affect anything going on in my signal chain.

I've been using this for DJ work for a while. It's not as great for the band I'm in, though. The fact that there are only the two knobs for bass and treble limit its usefulness for many instruments.

9724	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are great picks for strumming; they are a bit thin if you want to do some individual picking of notes, for that I would recommend the same brand in .73mm, those picks work great for both uses.

2212	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is the best price I have seen for a pretty good product.  I don't think the plugs are as heavy duty but should work fine.
