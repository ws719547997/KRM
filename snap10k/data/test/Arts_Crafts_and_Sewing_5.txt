9413	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	It is hard to buy yarn "online"... but I am using on hangers so I was ok with the risk.  This yarn is very soft... but not terribly fuzzy - which for my purposes is perfect.  Wrapping on hangers means I am not "washing" it... so I can't really rate that.  It is a golden rod color, well represented on my screen - hard to review as every computer and/or device will show a little differently.  I always update my reviews if any new info will be useful.  The yarn arrived quickly (I have prime) along with other items in excellent condition.
Caron SS comes in a ton of colors (off white, charcoal, watermelon and pagoda are a few of my favorites), and the price is amazing for the quality. It holds up well after washing and I have stuff I made 5+ years ago that still looks good.

2145	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	These scissors are NOT 8" long, they are a whopping 10" long. The only reason I bought them was because it said they are eight inches long. The old Fiskars scissors I have are 8" long and look like the small 5" precision scissors. I wish Fiskars would bring that style back. These scissors are made for someone who is standing and cutting, not someone who is sitting and cutting and they are TOO LONG. It puts the wrist at an awkward bend and irritates the tendinitis in my hand and wrist. I am highly disappointed in these scissors.

3. (Probably should be #1) Do NOT remove the plastic seal that covers the "joint" between the pen base & the pen tip. Admittedly, this discovery was made the hard way, but if you read the microscopic print on the pen, you find that piece of it-looks-like-packaging plastic actually provides a vacuum-type seal for the ink.

2547	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice 50 piece foam set well worth the price I would get it again
Great markers, super pigmented and wet. Not useful for adult coloring books due to the bleed through on every non-artist grade paper. The case is nice and generously sized, but a bit big for carrying every day. My only gripe is the caps. Alcohol based ink needs a good seal to prevent drying out and these markers certainly seal completely, but I can't get the caps off. I'm a 20 something female with decently strong hands but they are very difficult to remove. It's bad enough that I don't use the markers much. If I have any type of lotion on my hands I don't even bother. If you have arthritis or weak hands don't bother with these beautiful markers.

Did a simple landscape last night and was definitely very pleased with the pigments and color selection. Easy to set up and use. The red that was included seemed almost too pink for my taste (more on the cool than warm side) but after layering it was very pretty.
The shirt came out great -- just like something you'd buy. I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know how it will look after that. But it delighted my son so much that he's been downloading all his favorite graphics and photos so that we can make more shirts.

2155	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These scissors are all they said they would be and much, much more!  I've recently started back in sewing after taking some time off.  During that time my arthritis has gotten much worse and my hands were starting to feel the effects of using regular scissors to cut heavy materials such as fleece.  I started searching on the websites for arthritis sufferers and came across these.  I ordered them immediately and when they arrived a few days later couldn't wait to try them.  First of all you don't have to fumble around with trying to get your thumb in the hole and then deal with the pain of the way the thumb has to sit.  All you do is guide with your fingers and push down with the base of the thumb and palm.  When you let go the spring does the rest for you.  Now I can keep cutting without having to take a break.  I love these and now my husband wants a pair too, for his cutting needs!  They are great!

I paint mixed media on bamboo, and the bamboo soaks up a ton of paint, requiring numerous layers.  This is the only brand I use and always  receive compliments on the vibrant colors in my work. The pieces turn out really well with this brand acrylic.  I have tried other brands but they seem to be too thin, or require more layers of paint.  This is also cheaper than my local art store, which is nice.  Great product.  Plus Liquitex paints do not dry out.  They last a long time.  I've never had a tube go bad no matter how long it sat, even in warm weather.  A big plus!

9409	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I know it's just acrylic yarn, but it's the softest acrylic yarn at a low price that I've found. It's not a good yarn for beginners to use because it separates more easily than other (cheaper) yarns, but for intermediate and advanced crocheters and knitters it's great. It has a nice sheen to it and it shows great stitch definition. The wrapper recommends a size H hook, but for some projects I prefer a G hook with this yarn, since it's on the lighter end of worsted weight yarn.

I bought the red paper and I think it is plenty thick enough, but if you are expecting something like cardstock, it is definitely not that thick. Reminds me of the butcher paper used to make signs in high school for the sports games and school spirit. I'm using it to wrap presents (for the next decade I think! This roll is HUGE). There is a rough and smooth side and as noted by other reviewers, the rough is approximately like construction paper texture (but not as thick as construction paper). Smooth side is slightly glossy on the red paper. I am using Elmer's Painter's Opaque White marker to draw on the rough side of the paper and it works great! I like how it turns out. My only complaint is that Scotch tape doesn't hold things together very well. After a while it comes apart.

I do wish there was a hair more color variety in the set, especially around the yellows/browns, but I can't really complain for the price.  These are a fantastic choice for adults for coloring books or doodling, as well as for kids who want a step up from Crayola.  Well worth purchasing.

6529	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This color is quite beautiful.  The yarn is lightweight, which I prefer for my baby blankets.  It's a little silky, a bit hard to handle and therefore needs to knit up with a tight tension ...if you do that you'll have a finished product to be proud of.

6029	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	There are two types of white (one should have been silver or something like).  Instead of being able to match canvas to thread, you must match canvas to key and key to thread.  Dark grey is used to indicate green for example, rather than using green to indicate green.  The light and medium greens, on the canvas, are one shade apart.

5634	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Perfect Halloween orange
3634	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Super sharp and effective. Unfortunately in my case they were too sharp for the silnylon I was sewing and cut thru both the thread and the fabric. But for everything else this works great.
I was going to deduct a star for the awful color of my new pair, but that's superficial and I really shouldn't allow the color to bother me. All things considered, these are a GREAT pair of sewing shears! Spring-loaded, comfort grip, super sharp---all you could ask for in a pair of sewing shears. Five stars and highly recommended to anyone who sews, quilts, or needs to cut fabric for any reason. (Note: They aren't suitable for clipping, notching, or trimming seam allowances, or for clipping threads. They're just too large---you run the risk of accidentally cutting your main fabric. For jobs like that, I recommend a pair of 4-inch scissors, like the "lightweight embroidery scissors" made by Gingher.)

6268	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I used this to embroider names on fleece. It took me a lot of research and looking around to figure out the way to embroider on fleece. There is NOT a lot of info online on how to do this. So hopefully this will help someone. I put a layer of medium weight tear away on the bottom, then the fleece, and then a layer of this over the top. That's it. That's the trick. It works and it looks nice. I've had no issues yet (knock on wood). I do use the hoop and I don't have any problems with overstretching the fabric or warping or waviness. It is a little thick to put in the hoop but just open it up a bit more then you normally would for most things.
If you use high volt with low volt, it won't affect!
*Note . . .the blade does not fit the Olfa 45mm Splash handle*
As if that weren't bad enough, these scissors actually jam themselves. You have to be very careful how widely you open them, because they won't close if you open them too wide. The blades will interlock and jam. You can pry them apart, but it happens over and over if you try to use anything like the whole blade.

1402	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I was really nervous about trying this. I made part of a 50's halloween costume and knew I only had one chance to get it right. Took me hours to get everything perfect before I transferred it but it turned out as good as I hoped. The apron was actually pretty easy to do but the hat gave me a little bit more problems with a couple parts not wanting to adhere. Probably due to it being a tighter space to work with. Don't plan on washing it since it's basically a one time thing, so I can't speak on the wash and wear part.

5983	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I wouldn't use this for clothing, but if you make toys (amigurumi especially), this stuff is great!  Amigurumi is meant to be worked tight, using a C hook and WW yarn will do that for you.  It gives you a nice stiff toy that hides stuffing well.  A little goes a long way as well because you are using a smaller than recommended hook.  As I said, it's not perfect for every project, but for toys, it's the best!

6682	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the Tombow mono multi-liquid glue (green) for years and decided to try this as an alternative. The Aqua (blue) seems to provide the same strong, permanent bond and doesn't leave a sticky residue. However, if I have something that might be difficult to glue the multi-liquid (green) is the one to use. Due to the difference in price I will probably use this for most of my glueing needs and reach for the Multi-liquid for when I need a sticky glue.

Also, the yarn has a marvelous texture and doesn't fray or untwist readily, as some yarns do; it will be easy for small, inexperienced hands to use.  Finally, the price is right, and I had no problem spending my own money for this special school project.  My kids' moms deserve it!

The large angled tip is very large indeed, and the small round tip is just about right for smaller writing.  I would have liked a medium or small angled tip.  They have a nice steady flow of pigment, and a good spectrum of color.  On a smooth surface, the pigment bled fairly easily.

1	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.

I apparently am not skilled enough to get them to consistently to color a line of similar width, and the tip is too wide for fine work, which is mostly how I use the markers.  At first, I thought the color choices were weird and not complimentary, but I am starting to change my mind about that as I use them more.  If anything, I wish I had bought a bigger set at this point.

761	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My girlfriend bought this set for me and I fell in love with it. These colors made the set I was using before seem like Crayola watercolors. The vibrant colors that are left when your work drys is beautiful. The trays that are built in aren't too bad, though I tend to use my own watercolor trays. The brush that comes with it is a really good reasonably priced series. So if you like it, it won't cost you much to add more to your collection, I own from sizes 0 - 8 in the round tip model and the designers tip model and spent a little over $100 for them. Then you have the replaceable pans which makes it so much easier and cheaper to replace colors that you love and use more than others. There is also room to add 8 additional colors of your choice to this tray. There are many colors in this series for you to customize your tray with, leaving you with your perfect color palette. Additional pans run about $10 each which is another great thing considering how long a single half pan last. This is an all around excellent product that I highly recommend.

155	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I teach paper piecing classes and this vellum is my first choice for the patterns.  The students prefer this paper to other types of foundation papers because they can see the placement of the fabric pieces before they sew.  When printing, remove each page as it comes out of the printer and allow it to dry.  There is slight ink smearing otherwise.  Keep the stitch length smaller than normal to avoid stitches tearing out when you remove the paper.

I have checked at a couple craft stores in town but could not find anything even close to this brilliant, bright orange. The yarn is soft but not super-soft like yarn that is used for baby blankets. I have not had a chance to work with it yet since I am waiting on more yarn to begin a project but I have worked with Red Heart brand yarn before and have always been pleased with it. Also, I got my package fast so I appreciate the quick shipping :) I would def buy from this company again in the future.

These are great markers for the price; in my opinion they are substantially better than any marker product Crayola makes.  The colors are vibrant and lay down smoothly; you can even blend by overlaying colors (a technique which takes practice but can be very rewarding).  There is a good range of colors in this set, with several different shades/tints/hues in each color family (i.e. you get four or five shades in the red-pink family, five or six in the blue-gray family, and so on).

Great colors - goes on just about any surface - dries fast.

UPDATED REVIEW TWO MONTHS LATER......I just couldn't get by with the small brush. I ordered from Amazon "Retractable Travel Brush Set for outdoor Painting" for about $40 bucks.

My students and I both love the results we can get using these markers, especially when combined with the Prismacolor Premier colored pencils! I personally love not only the bright vivid colors in a seemingly endless amount of colors, but also that the Prismacolor markers allow the flexibility of having two distinct line widths in one marker. Very convenient! If you've never tried them out, I highly recommend getting this started 12 pack to play around with.

I am used to working small and with limits, so the 12 colors were enough.  I liked how solid the pallet is, but wished that the pots were able to fit snug in the wells.  Even the colors were loose from the pots.  A quick fix was wetting all my colors and letting them dry to the plastic pot.  I will be using cement glue to fasten the pots to the wells.  Not really sure what else to do.  But overall I am happy with this set.

I love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.

3226	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.
8390	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  Another double ended crochet hook, but in a different color! It almost seems like an early Christmas. Boing!  Another great idea... I can use this one to hang ornaments on the tree. I can put one end on the tree hanger thingy and an ornament on the other end. That will let the ornament hang lower so the baby and/or the cat don't have to reach up so far to knock the ornaments onto the floor! That's much safer than having them climb the tree or onto a chair to reach them. An added plus is that the colored hooks add to the Christmas colors on the tree! Wonder why I didn't think of this before? I'm going to be known as a Safety Mom Hero this year - YAY!!  Yep you guessed it, the hook can also be used for Tunisian Christmas projects too. Wow, I'm so excited about this that I can hardly stand it!

The red and green filters have made it MUCH easier to choose a range of colors to give better contrast in fabric choices. I have started using them in collage creation, also, when I'n stuck on what to do next. They always help determine whether to go darker or lighter. And the color cards themselves, that help choose color combinations, are great. I'm not much of an artist or quilter, but this, I think, makes me a better one than I would be without it.

Even so, I cannot complain. These are excellent shears for cutting fabrics of all types, from heavy denim to fragile chiffon, and everything in between. I use them daily, and I will keep returning to buy them every time I need a new pair. I won't even consider other shears! I might even buy an extra pair to keep on hand in case anything happens to mine. They last a long time, too! I had my first pair of shears for at least seven years, without any problems. The only reason I replaced them is because they were growing dull. But if you have a sewing shop nearby, you can simply get yours sharpened once a year, and they'll last a lifetime!

Lovely pastel colors that blend nicely, and if you get the right pattern, the colors will even work up into stripes.  That was a pleasant surprise when I was making several baby hats for charity.  the Sugar'n'cream yarn is just outstanding; it has been my yarn of choice for years to make potholders and dishcloths, and sometimes other items in soft cotton, like the baby hats.  Can't beat it!

Only problem I had was my own fault - judging the cut as to how close I could come to the seam without actually cutting it. The top of the cut looked good but the bottom blade would sever the thread.  I was trying to get a little too close on the top of the cut.  I few couple of millimeters further from the thread would have been fine.

HOW to use: Painting with them you can use water (see other reviews, can make it look "gouachy") or you can use one of the many media from Artisan.  Cleaning the brushes with soapy water is easy and fast.  Keep in mind: Once these paints dry they will not be water soluble anymore. For plein air you don't have to carry solvents just find a water source and also for keeping palette and brushes clean all you need is water and they are environmentally friendly!

8242	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	First off, these powders are awesome, however, I do have one problem with them. If you want to use these powders mixed with water in the Ranger Mini Misters, the color saturation is very low and the amount of opalescent shimmer is also very low.  The nozzle on the mini mister doesn't provide as fine a mist as the Glimmer Mist bottles from Tattered Angels so the amount of liquid that sprays out puddles very quickly on your paper.  After experimenting with these, I did have the kind of results I was looking for when for example,I added the "gold" colored perfect pearls with Tattered Angels' glimmer mist, wow - a winning combination; I was able to get the level of color saturation I was looking for with more glimmer than the Tattered Angels glimmer mist provided.  With the perfect pearls, I could never get enough color saturation that I was looking for, no matter how much powder I mixed with water into the mister bottles. I found I had much better results with this product when I mixed it with water and applied the solution to paper with a paint brush, however, you don't get the effect that a fine mist would provide. So, overall, if I had to choose between the Tattered Angel's Glimmer Mist and the Ranger Perfect Pearls, I'd go with the Tattered Angels if I wanted to have a misty effect.  Also, I did get very good results with the method Ranger recommends for using this product with stamps (stamp image on paper with an embossing pad like Versamark or Ranger Perfect Medium), then lightly brush on the perfect pearls over the stamped image, then dust away excess powder.  The two colors in this set that I liked the most were the gold and the hot pink (the hot pink looks like purple in the image here but its actually hot pink).  These two were very opalescent. For anyone who has never tried this product, I highly recommend buying just one color to use as a test, and test on a piece of waste paper first.  Also, you can purchase brushes anywhere separately to save on costs.  The brushes that came in the set are nice though.

This review is about the CLEAR EMBOSSING INK. I never gave it a thought because I thought that it would give a "Distressed" result or something. I went to online forums and brick-and-mortar stores and told them of my embossing woes. No matter what powder I used, what embossing ink, no matter the paper or heat gun, I *always* got bumps, pits, and general uneven embossing. I've always loved the embossing part and how it COULD look. I wanted as close to a glass-like finish as possible and I always got told that it's supposed to be  bumpy and uneven. I refused to accept this, I knew it would be possible, and I would find out how. That's where the scrapbook store came in. I shared with them my plight and that the only way I get what I wanted was using Colorbox pigment ink. My local scrapbook store suggested I try this Distress Clear Embossing Ink, and I did, and I wish I had found out about it earlier. By earlier I mean a year ago. My embossed images no longer have pits and bumps in them.

The normal clump-removal tools that can be found in pet catalogues are too big and clumsy to use on a cat, especially for the matted hair that accumulates between the upper leg and the body (armpit?  Do cats have armpits?).  This seam ripper works perfectly to separate the mat from the skin.

3431	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I was expecting a bright red, something much redder than this was.  This is nice, and it is metallic, and I do have uses for it.  It works well, cleans up with water, and FolkArt products have always been good for crafts - maybe for other uses, but I only use them for crafts.  It just wasn't the color I wanted.  Still, it is worth the five stars.
9716	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The thing I love about the "Gray Whale" color is that it's a very, very pale gray- it's definitely *not* a charcoal or graphite color. Instead it looks like very light pencil lines when you stamp with it, which I find perfect for applications like embossing with clear embossing powder, doing resist techniques, using Copics, etc.

1303	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have used "Pioneer Photo Albums Bund Top Loading Page Protectors with White Inserts, 12 by 12-Inch, 5-Pack" for photos and memory books for many years.  The white paper insert is sturdy; it is easy to attach either photo corners or self-adhesive photo squares that will then hold your precious memories securely.  If you have not space between photos, one-side of one page will hold six 4" X 6" photographs.  The covering is similar to an acetate film, but it is not acetate and is safe for photographs.  The three-hole border is reinforced and the holes have a small slit that allows you to use these pages in albums other than Pioneer products.

Anyway, you guys probably don't want to hear about the memories I hold dear, so without delay, let's describe this 24-pack of crayons.  Yes you receive all the colors you can imagine, and some more.  All the best colors are here ("best" as in, most colorful and vibrant).  Your students will be satisfied but they probably won't realize that once upon a time, these crayons were much stronger and sturdier than they're made now.  Now it truthfully doesn't take much to break these crayons.  They will break and shatter on the hard floor the moment they're dropped.  They were better made in my day (in the late 80's when the Bangles and Madonna were tearing up the charts).

I've gone through at least ten skeins in the past year and always pick up several skeins when I find it on sale; this has definitely become one of my "go-to" yarns. Highly recommended!
1024	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this box of crayon for my daughter for school. She is in the first grade and need a box of crayon on her at all times. The crayons holds up well and don't break easily. You get 24 basic colors, and it gets the job done. The reason why I prefer Crayolar over other brands is because you get a smooth coloring form their crayon. The only negative I would say is the box is flimsy and always rip up with in a month. Get it your kids will love it.
8811	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Maybe it's just me, but I cannot get this thing to sew a zipper properly.

1770	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	There is a wide selection of colors here, and a few sheets of each color.  The yellow doesn't bleed as much as I prefer - I'm one for a bright sunshine yellow - but the other colors do just fine.  Plenty of color, and you don't need a large piece to create with.  I started by cutting 1" x 2" strips of the whole pack, just one small corner, and had enough color for 3 pieces of art.  I just spritzed my watercolor paper generously (cardstock works too) and plopped the tissue pieces down, scrunched some, left others flat.  I could move them around and spread the color in other places.  All in all, a very satisfying way to have fun.  They WILL stain your fingers, but not permanently.  Easier to remove than alcohol ink... not for small children unless you want carpeting colored.  I don't know if it will come out of clothing, either.
3214	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love this color and this is a great kin of yarn, love it for the texture and softness and Amazon is where I prefer to get it because it is not being sold in stores anymore. Recommend.

8667	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I bought this as an extra foot for my serger. When you want to sew, you need to have the proper tools to do the job.
I have only had the serger for about 4 months, and I think I have already used it more than I ever used my old serger.  I purchased a serger threader, which makes threading it not too daunting of a task. I also use a trick I found on YouTube to tie the new thread to the old thread and slowly run the machine to pull the the new threads through.  You can search for it on youtube.  I only use the technique on the loopers, as the needles are easy to thread since you can flip the upper blade up out of the way.
But they ARE just (barely) long enough to stop and realign the cut to make it uniform over several inches. Especially when compared to other products.

5659	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This yard is awesome. It's not the softest yarn out there, but it's soft enough for an afghan to me (especially after a few washes) and the color holds up extremely well over time. Another big bonus is this yarn is the easiest to work with that I've found. Some brands are so difficult to hold onto, usually because of how soft they are, or it's the biggest pain to find the right end to work with/get the yarn to come out easily while working with it. No complaints at all from me about Red Heart Super Savor!

Somewhere along the line I picked up one of these more ergonomic handles and since then I've bought four more. There is no way I am going back the skinny metal one. The X2000s are easy to grip and comfortable in my palm. They give me a level of control that makes them a joy to use and they're built to take a lot of heavy use.

 They are different percentages of French Gray, in 10% increments from 10% to 90%, and also includes 2 black markers. I kind of wish they had included one of their blending markers, or a multiliner and maybe taken out one of the black markers.

8433	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I didn't get these for sewing, but rather to cut a zigzag edge on vacuum-sealed bags of backpacking meals so that a utensil (knife, scissors, etc.) isn't required to get the bag open while in the field.  Sharp as all get-out, heavy blades, they make such a NICE little edge that creates tear points along the bag.  GREAT price, too...even Wally World's offerings were more expensive and, from what I saw in the store, less sturdy.  The handles are plastic, but ergonomically molded to offer maximum comfort during repeated or extended use.  For the price, you can't beat these pinkers!
1415	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great transfer paper, and very easy to use. Just remember to mirror any text. ;) We used this to make custom baby onesies using white onesies. You have to cut very close to the image before you iron it on, as you can see the sheen of the transfer material. But it isn't that noticeable. Held up pretty well after one wash. Definitely will not work for dark clothes.

I don't know why some people have had such trouble with it. I've never had it come off, curl up, or anything of that sort. It goes on and stays on, and helps keep the ruler from sliding.
Initially, I did not have good results. I used a Q-tip, spread it on cautiously, washed off after 10 mins. What a mess. Smokey, clouded, smeared lenses that I couldn't wash clean, and I couldn't see through.

A word on Cotman colors: although this is considered a student or entry-grade paint, I find Cotman colors work very satisfactorily. There is a nice range of colors, and even though a lot of them, such as the cadmiums, are 'hues' and not real cadmium, they still look pretty close to the real thing (and at a fraction of the price). I've used the Cotman tube colors for years because they were less expensive and I am not selling my artwork so it didn't matter to me about any perceived quality issues. I have noticed that the price for even the Cotman paints has gone up a LOT since I first started buying them. The artist's grade are astronomical!

Let me see if I can explain this. On the back, there is an illustration explaining what each blade and handle does. As you can see in the product photo, there is a blade attached to each handle. On the back, it tells you what blades those are on each handle (which are #1, #2 and #5 blades). To the right of that, there is a list of the additional blades in the top portion of the product photo. There it lists the #2 blade again, but not #1 nor #5. At first glance, this makes you think that there are two #2 blades to be found, but instead there are two #11 blades, which it doesn't mention at all. That's a minor thing, but for newbs may be slightly confusing.

7741	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I'm not necessarily a painter but I do enjoy dabbling from time to time and when I do dabble, I reach for the liquitex acrylic. I mean is there really any other brand out there? Liquitex puts out great products, paint and brushes (but does that explain the expense? - probably). If you are a student and you have a list that says to only buy 1 tube of white acrylic paint, do yourself a solid and buy 2 of the big guys. Trust me, you'll use white A LOT! Mixes well and washes off fingers easily - carpets, not so much.

9078	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This fit my low shank Singer perfectly. I bought it because I wanted a certain kind of ruffle and this did the trick; the ruffler foot would have been way more work. If you've never used a gathering foot before, start with a scrap piece of fabric to get the feel of how to use it along with going online to find settings for the stitch length and tension as this will make a difference in how tight your gathering (ruffling) is. As far as people saying that the foot didn't come with tips or instructions... this is true. However, I have bought several different feet from sewing supply/quilting stores as well as online and I have never once received any sort of paperwork with the purchase. I guess the companies think that if you are buying this foot, you must know what to do with it. Definitely go to online resources and you will get more info and visual instruction than you ever could have in a little pamphlet.
I've always loved Fiskars scissors. I typically use them for either fabric or paper, and they stay sharp for a long while! (Even when they dull, you can buy a Fiskars scissor sharpener instead of replacing the scissors!)

2966	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	What can I say except it works as designed and very strong and durable. I would reconsider though using this in certain craft sewing items, like book or bible covers, since the dual zipper when opened won't allow an opened book to lay flat. If you get a much longer zipper it might be better, but then at the separating zipper end the zipper pull will create a bulge in the book spine area.  I didn't want to find out what damage that would make on my new bible so I just switch the zipper out and used a regular zipper instead.

I've brushed them over the front of a card, spritzed them with water to activate the sticking powder, and then enjoyed the glow they give to the project once they are dry. Haven't yet mastered stamping with the Perfect Medium and then brushing the Pearls over the stamped image--the Pearls always seem to stick not only to the stamped image but also on the paper itself, so the image isn't as crisp and clear as I'd like.

I do a gamut of sewing from quilting to sewing fake fur... they are absolutely great for being able to run along the pile at the backing to snip fake fur. I also have some nerve damage in my right hand, and tend to cup my fingers along the bigger finger loop on a regular scissors than putting fingers IN the loop; this pair is very easy to hold and I like the return spring, it makes cutting easier.

Liquitex makes their paint with a very heavy pigment load for excellent color and saturation.  Again for professional quality.  This titanium white is excellent and quite opaque and has strong tinting power.  A little bit added to a more transparent color opaque it nicely.  I think it is the most versatile white and should be in every palette.

1936	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The entire Prismacolor series has not yet dissapointed me... you will read many people who call themselves "professional artists" say that Prismacolor is a beginners set of markers and brands like Copic are better in all aspects. I have both brands and the Copic marker set I have is already starting to kick the bucket after about 10 drawings... my prismacolor markers are still going strong. The markers have double ends which is great for finer details (although I almost wish the fine point side was slightly finer) and also great for large areas you want the same color. I would reccommend these colors to any academic or mid-level artist who is on a relatively low budget. These markers have lasted me about 10 full color drawings so far and the only one that is starting to struggle is the black one (they should probably include 2-3 black markers in the set and then it would be perfect). But for under $70, this is a great set that you can count on and produce great artwork with it. I am giving this 5 stars, not because they are the "best" markers out there, but because they are the best value for the quality they are capable of producing.

I do wish the blades had covers. Or at least, that there were three covers that collated with the three handles, for when the knife is out of the case but not actively in use. There is an accident waiting to happen.

I intended to use it just in the interim until I could get my machine shipped to me but I found that I don't even need to sew it! It is a little tough to keep in place because it is so lightweight but if you just in it down until you begin ironing it will stay put.

4801	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Red Heart yarn is a good value but it isn't as soft as some other brands such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vanna-s-Choice-Yarn/dp/B003D7IOHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vanna's Choice Yarn</a>.  I still like this yarn but found it a bit scratchy after working with the softer Vanna's Choice on other projects. One thing I have noticed with Red Heart yarn is that the darker more saturated the color, the stiffer the yarn is.  However, it does soften after being washed.  The color is rich, deep, and consistent throughout the skein.  I used 3 skeins in the small burgundy lap blanket I made and 5 skeins of lavender in the bunny shawl and there was no difference in color from one to the next.  You can't tell where one ended and I picked up the next.  Working with this yarn was nice as it didn't split and its thickness did not vary.  As it is acrylic it machine washes and dries (over and over again) like a dream.

The remover will be thin and clear like medical alcohol or bleach. Both should have cardboard gasketed lids and foil caps on them. The sensatizer (tiny bottle) should be either dry and at the bottom, or thick and at the bottom. If any of the sensatizer is spilled out of the little bottle (along the threads or down the side) send the kit back for a new one immediately. The product is good if you get it undamaged, but Speedball uses incompetant monkey powered robots made from scrap pulled from the Robot Wars set to package everything so check your stuff.

I was wondering what Tempera means and my research led me to define it simply as fast-drying paint that consists of pigment and a binding agent, like egg yolk. It also makes the paint very long-lasting. Some tempera paintings still exist from the first century AD, so that finger painting my 3 year old just did may to be around a while!
5140	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great yarn at good price.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I love the Lily Sugar N' Cream yarn and have used it for years.  It's nice and soft and is great for bibs, amigurumi and other projects.  I bought this specific gray yarn for a small, crocheted BB-8 doll.  While this brand of yarn can be found at craft stores, Amazon was the only place where I could find it in stock in gray.  While the price can be better at some craft stores, they didn't have this color in stock anywhere near me.  Plus, the closest craft store is at least a 20 minute drive each way, so I'm saving a gallon or two of gas (and my time) by ordering it on Amazon Prime, so my savings in gas basically pays for the yarn.  Plus, the price of a 2.5 oz. Lily yarn at that craft store was more than what I paid on Amazon because it was not on sale when I visited the store.  So I am very happy with my purchase.

1428	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	After trying many ways to make my own labels for handmade textile items, I finally stumbled across a tutorial on how to use transfer paper with cotton twill ribbon.  I had been using a special setting solution and printing my labels directly onto fabric but the results were not crisp and saturated.  I wish I'd thought of using transfer paper sooner! My labels look FANTASTIC now! Incredibly saturated color, crisp lines, just awesome! I get so many labels out of just one sheet of paper (and a large spool of cotton twill ribbon) that it's very cost-effective.  For other crafty types, these would also be perfect for ironing onto sew-in labels (my next project).  I can't speak to how they stand up in the wash yet, but I also read that if, after they've cooled, you iron again with just a piece of parchment paper on top, you'll remove a little of the excess "plastic-ey" coating and also set the design/colors a bit more too, but I haven't done that yet....

Her set still works and she has used it A LOT for homeschooling, coloring, and art (she is an artist, so heavy use). Her younger brothers (ages 7, 8, and 11) started borrowing her set so much, she bought them each their own set for Christmas.  And I became sold on these with my first child, who is now 22. He got his first set when he was about 8, and they lasted for a good 10 years. Who knows. He most likely still has them. These are perfect for adult coloring books. Fun for writing notecards.

I understand the reasons of outsourcing, but when I am purchasing a product, I need to know the country of origin as it may directly correlate with quality and durability. In this particular case I wanted to be sure I get a good zipper for my daughter's winter coat. The original Chinese made zipper fell apart after one season and replacement is rather complicated and time consuming. For this reason I rate this product (service) with four stars. However, depending on how it will hold up, I reserve my right to change the rating.

Problems : 1) Zipper on the case is very rough to close, sticking. 2) the #2 handle requires a crazy amount of force to lock the blade in place and even then becomes loose making it unusable. 3) Some of the blades are not sharp as I would expect, beings it's a new kit. Sent this one back, the replacement set came brand new, sealed in plastic/cardboard... without the #2 holder with blade even in it. Other extra blades were not in place, bounced around. Sent back again. I cannot recommend this product due to such poor quality control.

The Artist's version is probably my very favorite, best-liked kit. The same, common design, albeit plastic, is both compact and efficient. The low Amazon price here is just phenomenal, just a little more than the W&N Sketcher's Kit in Cotman. The W&N 'Cotman' line of paints, while said not as good as the premium "Artist's" line, is still quite excellent, plenty good enough.

8660	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nifty!  The stitch guide foot has really helped me keep my stitches straighter.  Because the guide floats just above the moving fabric, it is always clearly in view, unlike the markings on the throat plate.  I did make one 'hack', which was to use different colored sharpie markers to emphasize three width marks I use most commonly.  This way I don't need to count out which mark I need constantly, merely remember I want the red one, for example; and glare on the shiny metal is less of an issue. This addition has made it a breeze to stay on track with the proper seam allowance.  The markings are on top of the guide, while the fabric moves under it, so I don't worry about the marks rubbing off on the fabric, but I also let them dry a full day before even trying it out.  The foot itself is very well made, very sturdy, and the guide does not interfere with the fabric at all, it hovers just above it, and the marked guide itself is quite substantial and I do not believe that it would become bent or twisted with normal use.

This book appeals to me immensely as I love the heavy Asian art and Art Nouveau influences  The coloring of her projects feel both soft and strong, and I love her patterns.  I like this book as her designs are substantially fine art creations.  The designs are rich yet bold with patterns that are unique.  Techniques are well demonstrated through both pictures and clear instructions.  This is not quite for the novice as it assumes that you know the basic polymer clay techniques.  However, I think it would be a great addition to anyone's library because the point is to challenge ourselves.  So many beautiful things and never enough hours in a day.

I have always wanted to learn how to paint with watercolors but I don't have any experience, so I spent a few hours reading reviews and watching tutorials, and I noticed that this set was often recommended as being perfect for beginners, so I gave it a shot, but I didn't have any expectations.

It would have taken me over an hour to rotary cut so many using a straight ruler alone. I can cut strips in 1/2 inch widths with this ruler. Since most of the quilt patterns I make use 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inch strips, this ruler will get a lot of use. It can also be used it to cut squares and triangles, depending on how the ruler is positioned for a second cut on the strips. Love also that it is 18 inches wide so I can cut more strips before repositioning the fabric. And storage is not a problem. Just lay it flat or hang it up.

Very disappointed that I wasted the money.
It is very easy to cut.  I roll out as much as I need, mark and cut with a utility knife.  A utility knife is best, since the blades will wear out quickly, cutting over a concrete floor.  Using scissors will prove inaccurate and slow.

I personally enjoyed the colour selection (sorry for my bad swatches) but I do wish that they swapped out alizarin crimson hue for a brighter red shade.

It's always a good idea to use a thimble when you hand sew. The eye of the needle may not be sharp, but it can still hurt your finger, especially if you're sewing through thick fabrics. There are many different kinds of thimbles: metal, rubber, elastic, leather, plastic, and even stick-on adhesive patches. You need to experiment with different types and sizes, until you find one that fits comfortably and doesn't bother you while you sew. For me, that's the leather Nimble Thimble, size small. Originally, I used the medium, but the leather stretched and it became too loose. I got tired of it falling off every time I sewed, so I finally bought the small one. I've never found the small size in any fabric store--they only seem to carry medium and large--so I was very glad to find it here.

 They coordinate really well with with Prismacolor pencils. However, Dark Umber is much darker in pencil form and redder in marker form. And I mixed up "pink rose" with "pink ( "rose" in french) hence the initial difference between the pinks.

Word to the wise: the instructions tell you to use your ruler and rotary cutter to cut the Invisible Grip to the desired size. I did this and found that it dulled my nearly-new 60mm blade sooooooo badly that I had to replace it. So, use household scissors (NOT your fabric/crafting scissors), cut squares or strips and apply them to the backs of your rulers along the edges. Use an old credit card, gift card, library card, etc. to press out any air from under the Invisible Grip, in kinda of a squeegee-motion.

The pic above doesn't do the color justice; I find that the photos on the RH website more accurately reflect the true colors of the yarn.

Manufacturer suggest mild soap and water.  I asked if I could use diaper wipes if I'm not near water source.  It was suggested that I do not use diaper wipes because the ingredients might break down the rubber roller.  That was a bummer and is why I only gave four stars.
The front of the journal comes with a lot of cool information (though I can't admit I use it all that often) such as a calendar of when certain food products are in season (and there are even separate calendars for the Northern and Southern hemispheres).

8639	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Quite simply put, Arches Watercolor blocks are the best watercolor paper available anywhere.  I use all the different varieties available - the cold press versions, particularly the rough surface, are a fantastic surface for any kind of drybrush techniques - the rough texture adds all sorts of possibilities for the application of paint.  If you are doing more washwork, you may want to consider the hot press variety.  It has a very smooth, untextured surface, is less absorbent than the cold press and will take marvellously detailed images. Because its less porous, it also extend drying time, so you can do more color manipulation after application.  Buying your paper in blocks is a good way to improve your work flow.  No stretching or taping paper to a board - its all ready to go in the block form - just separate the cover sheet from the rest with a utility knife, and you are free to paint!  When your work dries, any warps or buckling will work itself out as the block stretches the paper back to flat!  When you have finished a painting, simply cut the top sheet away from the block and you have a pristine, fresh sheet of pre-stretched paper.
9246	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great tool ... but it gets your hand a little too close to the heat ... I'd buy a longer one next time.

6367	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This nice, thick and bulky yarn was used to make my first crocheted piece.  While I will not say what it looked like, I will say it was easy to work with.  The weight and the finished product were beautiful.  The randomness of the colors made it appear as though I used different yarns to make the piece.  It was cheery and bright but I underestimated the amount of skeins it would take to finish the product.  I make better estimates now.  This is not a soft yarn and it is not for use in baby blankets.  It is not nearly soft enough for that.  It is good for cheering someone up.  Hard to be sad with colors like that.  Beautifully done but the price can be problematic.  Acrylic yarn and comes with care instructions for you to pass on to the person you are making things for.  Good for mittens, hats and scarves.  For an adult sized blanket be prepared to order at least 12 skeins.

The only thing I don't like is that it splits too easily while I'm working with it--my crochet hooks end up splitting the strand too easily, because it's not wound as tightly as some other yarns--but, it works up into a gorgeous crocheted sweater--it would make an extremely lovely afghan, too!

I am not that much of a fan of the cable-hence the 4/5 stars, but the needles are very easy on my hands. I did not have any issues with the yarn snagging or catching on the needle or the joins and moved smoothly over the needle without grabbing.

How does this yarn feel? Some people say it feels scratchy; I don't think it feels scratchy. It's not baby blanket soft, but it's just fine as a wrap or sleeping under. I pause my washer during the fabric softener cycle and let the blanket just soak in the softener for awhile. Maybe that's why my blankets don't seem scratchy to me?!

That means you can make little gifts or big ones to share with friends and family without breaking the budget.  This shaded yarn is just great for Christmas items, and St. Patrick's Day.  The nice thing about shaded yarn is you get an interesting look without having to deal with changing yarns or tucking in ends.  It is fun to watch the colors develop.  So, whip up a bunch of shamrocks, or a pretty holiday throw that you won't have to put away after the holidays are past.  I have been using Red Heart products for decades and have found them to be not only reliable, but available in just about any color I can think of.

Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template.

These shears leave me feeling in control, while making fabric cutting incredibly easy, cutting through even up to 4 layers of lightweight woven fabric working almost without effort. I found them to easy to use with very little fatigue afterwards.  However, when cutting a heavy twill (about the same weight as an average pair of jeans) the fabric frequently jammed up in the scissors, wedging between the blades instead of cutting.  This is highly disappointing, as I was growing to love these scissors.  Instead, I had to drag out the trusty old fashioned ones to do the job.  That has cost these scissors a full star--they should be able to cut this type of fabric dependably as well.

If you are just starting out with cross stitch this would be a good piece; a little challenging because it does have one combined thread color and backstitching, but it also has spaces left blank for the white in the frogs. There aren't a lot of colors so it isn't too hard to switch between them while working on this piece. If you are an intermediate/experienced stitcher this will be a breeze and give you a little break between doing something that has so many colors and extras.

5162	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for the project my sister was trying to complete.  Quick turnaround.
The paint is smooth coming out of the tube and holds its shape well for thick impasto techniques so that your brush strokes show nicely when you want.  If you need it thinner, just add either water or an acrylic medium to get it to the viscosity as you like it.  Very versatile.
Other than cutting fabric just to listen to the blade on my cutting mat (not really!), it does seem to be true that the fabric edges don't fray or ravel.  It does take a tiny bit of effort to get used to cutting and then measuring after you cut. But I'll take this clicky blade over a $45 pair of QUIET scissors any day LOL !!

I know the quality of the yarn isn't the greatest as I have used this yarn for another blanket which pills a lot with washing.  Other than showing wear from washing though, the yarn is very warm and easy to work with.  Considering the price, it is still a good buy and like I said, the colors are really great!
2856	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Completely ineffective. It barely sticks at all. I ended up having to safety pin my son's dress pants to hold them up because no matter how long I ironed this crap just peeled off. Useless.

The thing I like is that the foam stays adhered to the handle, even if I've used it so much the foam is starting to fall apart.  I've used them for some latex and oil-based paint and they're not too bad for that either.  No brush marks, no bristles left in the finish (which will happen, even with my expensive badger brushes). Also, they're good for laying down polyurethane with no brush lines.

1683	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This paper is a lot thinner than I expected. I was planning to try to do paper flooring with this, however, the paper is too thin and see through. And since it is white there is no contrast between sheets of paper. Actually, because it is so thin, when you overlap it looks horrible because its much whiter in the spots that overlap. You would have to make sure the flooring underneath is white as to not have this happen, but then you won't see any variations at all which makes it pointless. You mine as well just use white floor paint and call it a day.

9073	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Being a sewer for many, many  years, i had never given the "fancy feet" a second thought. Yet as i looked into new techniques and was noticing a growing trend towards really using the specialty feet and realized that i might want to as well. But the one foot i should have received but didn't was the gathering foot thus i purchased one. After a few tries i was wondering WHY i waited so long to do so - traditional Gathering is a royal pain in the patellae, the machine baste and pull method SUCKS especially when your threads break, and i won't get into the pin pricked finger tips ... This little foot does what it says it does - Gathers in a fraction of time of either hand and needle or old school machine basting. This machine foot is worth every penny.
 The colors are bright, clear. and mix well with other colors.  I am going to buy more for my Art Studio.

5929	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	First, Amazon should make the seller(s) of this yarn CORRECT the DESCRIPTION.  The solid colors are 364 yards and the multi-colors are 244 yards.  The reason the yarn is so expensive from this seller is because you are actually paying for the "free" shipping.  I just ordered this Super Saver Yarn from Joann Fabrics for $2.09 per 364 yard skein and actually received TRUE FREE shipping.  The yarn was on sale this week, but usually sells for $2.99 a skein, but Joann's does not always offer the free shipping.  I ALWAYS shop around before purchasing anything on the net. Just as in brick and mortar stores, YOU HAVE TO SHOP AROUND for the best deals on the net.  The yarn is nice, thick and the colors are great, but I would NOT recommend it for any baby items.
7637	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	The scissors are not as sturdy as Fiskars, however, they are just what was described and the price was okay.  I haven't used them all, but the ones I did use worked just fine.  We'll see as time goes by.  The stand was fine too.
As for mixed media, you can use them (let the artwork dry first) with permanent markers, like Sharpie, but you will need to stop occasionally and "clean" the marker by scribbling with it on plain paper to remove any waxy/oily residue. (For that reason, I'd never use expensive markers like Copic with them.) They work well with acrylic paint and India ink. I haven't tried them with oil paint, but I'd expect them to work well together. You can layer them over watercolors, but not the other way around. (Well, you can, but the results may be disappointing, depending on the effect you're going for.)

6272	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My wife is very pleased
 The first time I started to paint with this new medium (at least for me)I must say I was surprised by the thickness of the painting because for whatever reason I expected it to be not as thick as oil! However it is thick but you can use water, which works perfectly, or a non toxic diluent from the same brand to obtain thinner layers (diluent is not that cheap but fortunately you need only a few drops to obtain a very satisfying result). It is better to start with thinner layers because it takes a few days to dry, even if it seems a little bit faster than "normal" oil painting (at least it is my impression but it should be verified)so be patient! Once you have finished to paint, you just have to clean your brush with soap if you want it to last longer...

The engraver itself: My one complaint is that it is super loud. I'm very protective of my hearing, I don't use this thing without hearing protection. It works well, and is dead simple to use, and after about 30 seconds of practice on a piece of scrap aluminum, I was proficient enough to use it on something that I value.

It doesn't make the ruler stick to the fabric -- You still have to use pressure -- But I don't think I'd want something that made it difficult to move the ruler when I want to. This just makes it less likely to move when I don't want it to. It still can. If you're looking for something that will glue your ruler to your fabric, this isn't it. If all you want is a ruler that doesn't slide so easily, this will provide it.
6411	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is really great and I'm going to look into it to see if they sell in larger quantities!  I got a lot of faces out of this kit!  10 practice faces and 14 for 2 days of the play.  Of course because I was doing specific faces certain colors got you used way way more than others  so I still have lots of paint I can use  just for fun.  It goes on really smooth  and comes off easy!  The yellow and red did tent the skin just a little bit but it came off with a bit of scrubbing.  I will buy this again.

5707	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Red Heart yarn is the best yarn as far as I am concerned. I love making baby blankets out of Red Heart, and they have so many colors choices.

9796	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have used Susan Bates circular needles for years and prefer them to other brands that I have acquired.  They work well with any type of yarn and are very smooth, so your stitches glide across the needle.  The cords do not kink and I have never had one break, but had that experience with another brand.  Would I ever purchase this brand again, definitely!

1553	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I  found that my 20 year old Velcro strips had pretty much lost their "stick," and I ordered this in order to hang some battery operated closet lights. I was very pleased to find that this Velcro Brand INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH tape was just that. It adhered to cedar strip, wood, and painted walls as well as the lights, and was strong enough to be able to suspend the lights from the ceiling. If you must remove this because of placement or whatever, I suggest you remove it within the first hour or so. It really sticks once applied, and you may have difficulty removing it after it's been on awhile.
644	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	A nice size for portability and good range of colors. Unfortunately, the one I received was defective in that the bottle had a hole in it. I've returned for a replacement and am awaiting the replacement. Had it not been defective, I would have enjoyed using it right away as it is a good size for travel and the color range is great and the palette is also appropriately sized and divided. It is small and the water bottle and cups are proportionately sized, but again - it is a travel set so it works for everyday use.

1874	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I bought these as a gift for my son that used up his old small set after years of use. He loved these! It had so many colors he'd been looking to buy separately and more on top of that. He loved having all the warm greys that he didn't have and bought separately are expensive just to try out. As many other reviewers mentioned, the plastic trays the markers sit on are useless and thin that if not picked up very carefully pens go everywhere. For the money, these should come with a decent case or tray at the very least. I spent all I had just to get him these pens, so buying some other thing to carry them in just wasn't possible. So to tide him over until he gets himself a real case, he took some thick foam he had and sliced it in strips and slipped it into the box to hold the pens still while upright. He also taped the large flap closed so he just uses it standing up and for now it works for him.

You don't need to buy another set of ergonomic hooks, as these handles work very well. I have a set of Susan Bates hooks and these cushions transformed them from unusable and painful to comfortable, and come in sizes to accommodate your most commonly used hooks.  Have not found them for 6mm/I-10 size or larger, but the larger hooks are easier to handle than the 2.5, 3.0 etc., anyway. If your hands are as bad as mine, you may need help from someone to put them on your hooks, but once there you are set to go. I have also used them on other brands of hooks, so do feel limited Susan Bates hooks only.  The have worked universally for me.

I bought this as a starter set for on the go painting, and I wasn't expecting much vibrancy from these colors. However, the colors end up very nice and vibrant. I do edit my photos, however I don't have to touch the colors, only the brightness of the image. The only downside I personally saw was the collapsible brush. While compact, it barely holds any water and I had to buy another, larger brush.

I had to use other paint from the Plaid kit I already done to help fill the void.  Do not buy this Reeves painting or any other from Reeves.  Also half the lines showing what to paint were so light you couldn't tell where to paint.

I tried it...it works great! It's a bit difficult to switch out the engraving points. The screw holding the piece in place is very small so you have to be careful not to drop that sucker. You sort of need a special, small and strong screw driver to remove it, so be aware of that. Also, I suggest to remove it on a table with a cloth on top so if you do drop the screw you can find it... I'm calling it a screw because that's the only name for it...But that this super tiny...can't stress that enough. I'm new to this game, but I have a feeling I'll be using this thing a lot!

This brand, Portfolio, far surpassed any and all other oil pastels that I have tried! Very buttery and so smooth, on their own and when blended. Great for mixed media too, over watercolor and acrylic paints. I was sincerely so so very shocked! They are very affordable (I want to buy these in bulk now, and stock up!!!) and they are so easy to clean up. Note: When in doubt, go with water-soluable oil pastels because they are more versatile, and waaaaay easier to clean off of your hands and surfaces!! .... Go get a bunch of these, and have a whooole lot of fun!!! :-)

9292	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use and not too heavy :) Does a great job with fusible films as well as setting the surface of liquid clays before baking but don't hold it too close or too long for that use and check if the temperature of this is appropriate for the clay you are using. I use a stick/third hand device to keep my fingers at least 10 inches away from the airflow and work on top of a silpat which is on top of an air bake cookie sheet so nothing happens to my counters :D Happy crafting!

The other pocket set https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472576228&sr=8-1&keywords=cotman%2Bcompact%2Bwatercolor%2Bset is a bit cheaper which is great but the brush is TINY.  Nothing but detail work is possible.  The best thing about these sets is that the pans are all removable so I can swap around what I want in each set.  The basics are repeated but after buying the compact set I felt I wanted a few other colors, even though I can mix.  Mostly I wanted the black, violet and gray.  I think these are great paints for someone just starting out who wants something better quality but still affordable. They mix nicely and a little goes a LONG way.

5057	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Good utility yarn for blankets and afghans, and anything that will be machine washed and dried a lot. This was a good match for the older skeins of RH baby prints I had that still used dye lots. Works up at the specified gauge, and while not the silkiest to knit with, it is reputed to soften up nicely when washed and dried.
2714	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I have a terrible time keeping my rulers from slipping while cutting with a rotary cutter. I have found that the OmniEdge rulers are great and they have helped me to be more steady. But I still have a little trouble. So I decided to try this product. I have found that if I just put about 1" squares along the corners and center of my square rulers and 1" x 5ish" strips around the edges of my long rulers, I get great stability without using a bunch of the roll. It's also easier to apply, easier to get off if I should decide to do so. I also don't feel like I'm wasting it if I need to replace the squares after a certain length of time. Though, after a couple months of using this product on my rulers, I haven't had to replace any squares and they still grip quite well.

2681	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	This is a wast of money. I end up using 2 rubber bands. The ones that are flat and that works much better and are cheaper than this useless plastic. You are better off buying a bag of long rubber bands and place them on the ruler. Do this first and if you don't like it, then spend the money but I don't think this is worthy, in my humble opinion.

I first heard of Portfolio after seeing them in artwork on someone's (don't remember who) blog. I enjoy media that doesn't require a lot of fuss and mess, so I'm a big fan of watercolor pencils and crayons, brush pens and markers, but sometimes I want something with more texture. After reading more about these, I decided to try them: they're by Crayola, after all--who doesn't like Crayola products? I've used them on different  weight and textured papers and on cardboard. They glide on smoothly, disperse easily with water and you can smudge them with your fingers before or after applying water. (I use a Niji waterbrush with them.)

That's why I look for this brand and will pay a little more.

I am an artist and much of my art is sold to high-end markets. I wanted to purchase some cheaper products to practice with and to use while playing with my nieces and nephews. So I purchased several different brands to try out. Many of the lower-priced products also have much more expensive versions, made from the same company. So if the lower-priced items end up performing really well, then you can bet that the higher-end products will likely knock your socks off.

1224	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	Like a previous reviewer said about it being from x-acto. I thought it would be half decent but these chisels are not that sharp at all. I tried to carv and cut into the softest piece of wood I had and it struggled to even dig in. Very disappointing coming from X-acto. I am going to try and sharpen these and hope for the best.

UPDATE:  Box clasp broke off (like the metal is so thin, the thing snapped after very little use), and the magnet to hold the blades in place has trouble keeping bigger blades from falling off and floating around in the box.

1623	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Perfect! The only note which I would make is that the paper is not super glossy.  But, it is heavy duty for both packaging and as table covering.  We used this for a LEGO themed birthday party and it was perfect.

4209	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	If you like fuzzy yarn, and want something funky and fun to work with, this yarn is for you. I used this in a dog sweater. And it came out so adorable.

I actually do really like this.  As a waterolourist, brushes are everything and cost anywhere from $25 for the really little ones to an average of about $35-$55 for other rounds and over $100 for the larger ones.  As we know, NEVER leave it soaking tip down or store tip down, you will ruin this brush made of kolinsky red sable that cost you an arm and a leg.  What they do not show you is that you can actually wash and store your brushes tip down, just make sure you get a good grip and if you are careful your mini's will fit in the small holes point down also.

The Roundabout Leaf Tank is knit in an ivory hue with silk yarn. "The seater is made out of a spiraling strip, in the same way that leaves grow on a stem." The Phyllotaxis Scarf is perfect for a man or woman. Knit in a brown colorway with a wool, mohair and silk combination yarn, it is reversible. The scarf is knit in a tube to make its reversibility possible. "There are five spirals slanting to the right and eight spirals slanting to the left so the pair from the Fibonacci sequence is 5-8." I love the Sunflower Tam. There are two examples in the photograph. One is green and the other yellow. They are knit with Icelandic wool. "For this tam, I wanted to make a disk with two opposing spirals, like the phyllotaxis of a sunflower, daisy, or coneflower."

The nibs (or tips) are fairly firm, and if you keep a light touch with the markers, they may stay that way, however, my child presses pretty hard.  This does blunt the tips or make them a little "softer", resulting in a thicker line.  Obviously these are not ultra-thin point markers to start with; they are not going to replace your Sharpie ultra-fine or whatever, but I will say that other than on one occassion (used by a small child who did not understand "light touch") we haven't had any problems with the nibs breaking, bending, shredding, or giving off little clumps of inky fuzz.  The one exception (my poor green marker!) was due to the tip basically being mashed, so that now we get a fuzzy little hairy circle of ink on the page instead of a nice clean dot.  However, with normal, responsible use, I don't see this kind of thing being a problem.

2133	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I've used Fiskar's spring-loaded shears for several years. I'm a sewing teacher and doll pattern-maker, which means I cut a lot of fabric! These shears are excellent for sewing, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, or are worried about repetitive strain injury. They're spring-loaded, which means they pop open on their own when you unlock them. All you have to do is close them to cut your fabric, and with every stroke, they'll re-open automatically. Easy peasy! (Just remember to lock them when you're done cutting, to avoid injury.)

When I was a kid, back in the stone ages, I had to wear the erasers off of my pencils before my mother would even consider buying me a special eraser.  And even then we had those terrible tiny erasers that slipped on the top of your pencil and never really worked that well.
The first one I did came out perfectly, then I messed up the next two. You really need to follow the directions exactly and make sure the transfer is evenly hot as you peel it off. You have to remember to mirror print your design so it comes out right on your fabric. Using the transfer on really like fabric, like white or light yellow, works best.

Also, the quality of these blades seem to be slightly better than the kits with the (useless) plastic tips.  They don't rust as quickly and they're stronger.  This is a great buy for the price.  you may want to buy a few kits because it's cheaper than buying the replacement blades.  Overall, I'm very please with my purchase.

2137	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I purchased these, along with the Titanium ones, and the review is the same for both.
I got them in the mail and started using them right away and after about a foot of snipping, the spring action stopped working (they are supposed to spring open so the only work your hands have to do is close them).  So I was having to force them open and then snip, force them open then snip, repeat repeat...  So, I let out a sigh of frustration and my husand asked me what was wrong.  I showed him that they working springing open like they were supposed to.  He grabbed them from, inspected them, and then wisked them away.  Well, my Mr. Fix It hubs found the solution: he put a tiny tiny dab of WD-40 at the bolt point (you have to put the dab below the bolt point on the metal part when the scissors are in an open position) and then he repeatedly opened and closed the scissors until the WD-40 worked its way into the bolt.  He then used a paper towel to soak up any excess lubricant and tested the scissors out on scrap fabric and they worked like a miracle!!!  So I finished the 6 other items I had waiting to be snipped and they continued to work without any problem!  And even now, about a month later, and numerous projects later, they are still working like a dream!  I have since had him lubricate all of my scissor bolts and now they all work better tha before!

6177	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite batting and I rarely use anything else.  I dislike the synthetic batting and since I quilt quite a bit, this is a great option.  It's easy to work with and I've never had a bad product yet.
6733	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice little stand. Perfect to use to display a decorative plate. It is quite sturdy.
8764	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Sure makes a difference! How did I ever do without this??
7686	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use lots of liquitex paints.  As a beginning acrylics painter I need all the help I can get and these paints have not let me down yet.
I just received it, therefore I haven't tried it. However, how can I try the machine when it is missing the tip. "The included 9924 carbide engraving point ensures precise result." > NOT INCLUDED
I'm using this 3.75mm (size F) hook to make some daisy-shaped coasters with cotton yarn.  No issues at all with quality; the metal part is securely embedded in the plastic handle, and it's totally smooth (no snags).  I have these Soft Touch hooks in several sizes and use them for both yarn and thread (I have the 1.75mm, 1.50mm, and 1.25mm sizes for thread work).
2224	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Excellect. On time. Works great!
4613	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great deal!
3327	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love working with this variegated yarn either single or double strand for a colorful look. Would definitely purchase again.
4215	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Good value for sure. Bought this for various projects and crafts and has been serving me well. Doesn't fray too much when cut. Relatively soft (not coarse but not plush and velvety either). Seemed accurately represented and happy with my purchase. I probably could have found it for a little less at certain stores - but whatever the extra cost, was worth the time saved to me to purchase online.

So, I decided to make all 4 kits into matching pillows!
1274	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Is there anyone who hasn't used X-Acto knives at one time or another? My girlfriend uses them for bookbinding. I've used them for model making (wood and plastic), graphic arts, microelectronics, laboratory work, graphic arts, trimming leather... who knows how many uses there are? I think just about everyone has at least one X-Acto knife rolling around in a toolbox, art box, or desk drawer. This set, which consists of the classic No. 1, 2 and 5 handles, and an assortment of blades, has been around in one for or another since before I was a kid. Back then, you could buy it in a wooden case at the X5082 set, and you still can. What's new here is the zippered plastic storage case.
8944	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful finishing touch.
The protector cap could be in a different color, not clear, since it could confuse the user about its state, open or closed.

6441	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	This is good quality face paint that is hypoallergenic and easy to remove. I bought three for a recent public event. My one complaint is there is no way to seal the open paints in this Ultimate Party Pack once they are open. This results in waste. On the other hand, large individual pots of Snazaroo have screw-on lids so they can be saved for another time.
3808	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Best thread I have ever used. Stretch, nonstretch, doesn't matter the sticth, this is my go to. It's great stuff, and wish I could have it in every color. I have never been let down by the brand and will always spend the extra couple of bucks to get that extra quality I know it comes with.

6430	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love this paint. My first time ever using it. I will always buy this brand. I was able to paint my children's faces for Halloween and lots of paint left over. Wipes of with water. Stays put for hours.
5760	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love the gold color. I made an afghan with a purple color and it came out beautiful. I would recommend this yarn to anyone that knits or crochets.
1397	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	At first I was unsure about this product. And I admit it was user error in the beginning! Now that I figured it out it works great! I've made several items with this and they wash great. I don't like the feel of it though,  it kinda has a plastic feel on your shirts. But for images that are way to much to layer with vinyl this works great! Be careful handling it though,  bc you can scratch the design off very easily.

931	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Disapointed!!! I bought this based on reviews and reputation of the company and it was one of the worst watercolor art supply purchases so far. The color are so diluted with cheap fillers. I ended up using 1/4 of the pan just to get a decent depth of color for a wash and it was still light. The ugly graininess was super frustrating too. The cadmium yellow was like more light lemon yellow. This set may be cheap but not a value since I would go through it in 3 paintings. If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone!

1150	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Worth having all the specialized blades - I use the #2 knife for sharpening my pastel pencils.  Takes some practice, but it is definitely the way the pros do it!
4182	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Lovely colors blend nicely, strong yarn with no fraying.
- The pocket brush is a nice addition
8751	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice quality, easy to use, and convenient to have if you do a lot of quilting.  You just line it up with the edge of the fabric and your quarter inch seem is a snap.
750	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Nice portable watercolor set. I kinda know how to watercolor although I don't think the idea of a brush made of these materials is ideal. I think it's still a bargain; and a lot of people swear these brushes are wonderful. I prefer a brush with the ability to hold water and color that is similar to a real brush. Not that theres anything inherently wrong with these types of brushes I just prefer a real paint brush specifically designed for watercolors. The results these brushes provide is decent but isn't a substitute for the real thing. Although if you don't feel like carrying a water bottle this may be the way to go.
2258	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I just love them !! Very soft, very nice colors, easy to use, nice touch. Have been working with these for years !!

990	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Awesome for travel. This thing is smaller than it looks though. Do not expect a big or even medium palet. This is a little longer that a cigarette box. the brush is very tiny too. But it does the job and each square is individual so when you run out you can buy replacement cubes of color.
3132	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love it.
3782	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Used this (and several other colors) to make a blanket for my grandma for her birthday. She loved it! I wanted the colors to be kind of beachy (b/c she loves the beach) and I think I kind of accomplished that with this yarn.
7471	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Tried it out finally about three weeks ago. Highly impressed. It stops fabric from unraveling and is nice to use on hems of decorative pieces or swatches of fabric for presentation. Works with the Olfa 9654 45mm rotary cutter only I think.
6460	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Stays on, multiple uses so far and it wipes right off with a simple baby wipe.  No hard rubbing.  Used this for Halloween...for simple dress up stuff (we bought an extra book of ideas to have more fun) and even used this for Christmas for Santa's helper.  Don't think I'll be throwing it out or packing it away like we usually do with the Halloween makeup we buy in the store each year.  Seems like it will last a while.  I just put the whole thing in a freezer bag and zipped close to keep it fresh.
1346	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I needed to add pages to a portfolio so this package was what I needed but adding the screws was awkward and too high for just five pages.  I'll keep the extra screws for expanding later.  If you need to add screws, you will need to keep one finger on one side and then use a screwdriver on the other for a tight fit.
6610	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Do not use on paper, it eats right though. This is not spray mount! This is a high powered adheasive that comes out like a freaking spider man web ! It comes out in a thick gel. It sprays from a slit in the nozzle so the foamed glue is dispersed in a diagonal spray. This can be very important info to someone looking to buy this product, hope it helps. Stregnth is very impressive and it holds very well. This is no super glue or liquid cement, but it bonds most materials like plastic, metal and even fabrix pretty well.
2786	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Used this product to hem all of my draperies.
8283	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I like this set.  I think I have used all of it.  It forces you to be organized. The plastic liner did want to keep falling out, so I had to use some glue dots to hold it in.  The charcoal also wants to fall out, so I added a chamois there to hold it in, need it anyway (a paper towel would work too).  When parts run out it will be easy enough to replace them.
2708	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	when I cut material for quilting the ruler often slips causing the cut to be off.  So far this has helped to stop that.

I know a lot of artists balk at hues... so far I like these and enjoy using them in my art journals. These are high quality student paints with good lightfastness ratings and nice saturation of color. If you can find this for under fifteen and are looking for paints to try, I suggest these as a great beginner or travel set. I've included a photo of a little sketch I did, and my swatched paints and the little brush.
5726	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I give the yarn 5 stars although I had 2 problems with my order.

1014	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Classic colors and fun.  I keep plenty of boxes on these on hand for school supply lists and at home fun.  The colors are pretty and when they break my kids use a crayon maker to melt the pieces down to make new custom colors and swirled crayons!

4078	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	My spouse purchased this to finish a blanket she started 15 years ago! The colors are still exactly the same, it's nice to see consistency with a company like this. Shipping was extremely quick and easy.

7423	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This soooo much easier than scissors. Love it.
I am using this mostly for hand sewing. It is an excellent thread!!! The label says for light to medium weight fabrics-really it's suitable for most things.
1663	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	What can I say... It's a roll of craft paper, hahaha!! For the price and quality this is the right choice. I looked at several of these online trying to get the best price and this is a HUGE roll of paper and the paper is thick. Markers and paint stayed on one side with no bleeding through.

735	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I wish the red in this set was a little darker, but these colors are good for the primaries and for mixing a wide variety of colors to make up for the size. It's good for if you want to get better at mixing your own, something I needed to work on.
177	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This book is filled with all kinds of projects to knit in lace: shawls, sweaters, scarves, accessories for the house, purses, and even gloves.  The book provides helpful tips for knitting lace such as a crochet guide, blocking techniques, tips for washing.  There are projects varied in difficulty and some are charted and others are written out and charted both.  There are many beautiful patterns in this book, several of which I hope to knit.  My favorite is Sarah Hatton's Beechwood Sweater with two lace panels on the top of a pull-over.  Naturally, this pattern is written out as I don't do well with charts.  The Dulcie Tunic, designed by Amanda Jones,  is also beautiful, knit with a lace center and bottom on a pull-over sweater.  There are wonderful shawls in this book for those of us who love to knit these.  The designers are varied with many that are new to me.  However, their taste is sublime for the most part.

You will not be sorry if you are a beginner and just getting the hang of sewing the instrucstions are very detailed and explained very clearly.  I would consider myself an exper sewer and still enjoy it.  I make my own patterns and create a lot of quilts that way but this is easy peasy!
1002	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is the classic household brand, almost synonymous to the word crayons.  Superior in quality than most other names.  And yes, who doesn't love the nostalgic smell of crayons when you were a kid?

My favorite and only paint brand I use.  I will be buying again and again!
