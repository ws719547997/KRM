Yes, it goes through hard-packed dry clay, infinitely better than a shovel (or a pick), but I won't pretend it's just as easy as most other soils.  But this thing is certainly much easier on the back than swinging a pick to get through clay.

As others have mentioned compressed air will help keep it clean. After the first two nights it was completely encrusted w bugs. I brought my small air compressor out and after a couple blasts it was mostly bug free. Since then the bugs seems to fall off much easier. I can simply tap the outside cage a few times and most fall off on their own.
Cheaper to by and maintain and much, much more dependable.
If you live north of the Mason-Dixon line... good luck pounding these in to the ground, lol! We had pebbles, yes pebbles, the size of a large marble that stiopped these from being pounded in. We finally had to just excavate to the depth we needed, set them in place and backfilled.

I have used the DuPont Deer Netting for probably 10 years with complete success.  The local supplier is suppose to be Lowes, but more and more they do not have it available. The Lowes price was around $13 for the same amount. I do not use it as a fence, but wrap it around individual shrubs or groups of shrubs that have grown together, on one side of our house that the deer always come to in the winter. The first year I used plastic twist ties to hold it together (like for garbage bags), but these did not hold up. I now use very small wire, probably 30awg or smaller, that is typically used for crafts. This cost me around $2 for a large roll that has lasted me for years. I agree with some reviewers that it would not work well for fencing, but wrapped around shrubs, is is great.

I'm an experienced trapper of vermin, this was my 1st shot at moles, after conducting hours of research, watching a dozen videos and reading the poor quality instructions included with the mole traps, I set my 1st, 2nd and 3rd trap. The next day 2 out of three had been tunneled directly under by the intended targets. I excavated my failed traps and tried again, with a hair trigger and the compacted dirt bridge inside the tunnel set under the trap lever, exactly as successful YouTubers demonstrated. The next day the traps had been tunneled under - again! I was floored, and frustrated too. It takes about 20 minutes to set each trap due to the complexity of building a compacted dirt bridge inside the tunnel under the trap lever, and further compounded by the glossy epoxy coated trigger with a VERY heavy trap spring. This trap is nearly impossible to set on hair trigger and completely impossible to trigger if set on full trigger. Nearly a dozen times I had the trap snap shut, several minutes after I had it completely set in the earth and ready to go. If set to full trigger the spring tension is so heavy you could play drums on the trigger and never set it off. I've included a picture to show how light I finally set this trigger (after sanding the gloss a bit), it's the epitome of hair-trigger, and yet the vermin still tunneled right underneath!

One comment on the adjuster used to determine how much fertilizer is going to fall to the impeller and be applied to your lawn.  The setting is based upon the weight of your fertilizer package and the square footage it is supposed to cover according to the bag claim.  I found that the adjuster is really more of a wild guess than anything scientific.  Although I calculated the setting in accordance to the Earthway manual, the first 3 passes I made in the front lawn used 1/2 bag of 15,000 square feet of fertilizer.  Obviously, this was grossly too much.  I made successive reductions in the setting as I made successive passes in the lawn.  I ended up with the adjuster set to its minimum.  I feel confident that after a couple more times of fertilizer applications this year, I will have settled into what setting is going to work for my lawn.  Since there are so many particle sizes within different brands of fertilizers, it is virtually impossible to tell ahead of time what is going to work for the adjuster setting.  However, I would caution you that likely it may apply your fertilizer much more heavily than the manufacturer had recommended.  Better have plenty of extra bags of fertilizer handy if you dial in the calculated adjuster setting.  I may have to cut that part of my lawn where the 1/2 bag of fertilizer was applied so heavily twice a week!

Can be used for fertilizer or washing the cars.  Very easy to use and the teaspoon to tablespoon converter is so easy.  I just unscrew the converter from the top and insert it into the straw suction in the bottle and I'm done.  I filled the bottle with Maxicrop Fish emulsion 5-1-1 concentrate.  The water will mix automatically and dilute it so that's why I used the concentrate directly into the container.  Choose 1-2 teaspoon per gallon and wonderful results on my lawn, flowers, and veggies.  Everything is so green and healthy looking.  I think this sprayer will last a very long time.

There is no such thing as "deer proof" landscaping shrubs or plants.  By February I sill know for sure.  All my shrubs wer  completely stripped of all their leaves.  We actually lost 5 to the grazing deer.  There is plenty of foliage elsewhere on the  property, but they choose to eat the bushes.  I will update later in the season.  So far, we have some new growth and the shrubs are doing well.

Later that night I consulted a wildlife biologist I know, who knows about the native animals in this area, and he said it would not surprise him if a hummingbird did stick its tongue in the zapper, and get killed. We also discussed the possibility of a bear mistaking the zapper for a bird feeder, tearing it down, and getting shocked, possibly causing a fire if there's dried leaves on the ground. Bears regularly come into yards and pull down bird feeders. We use to leave our empty feeders up, because they were decorative, but took them down after years of bears messing with them, even when empty.

Finally, don't use glue sheets/traps inside of your Tin Mouse. Dude, that is like the most cruel thing you can do. The bloody things should be illegal. It would be kinder to just nail the mice to the driveway and back over them slowly with a steam roller. That's right. So why take on the guilt and bad karma if you can avoid it? They work GREAT without them. Don't get upsold on something that's not necessary.

I bought some extra scent packets, that stick to the bottom and they do seem to work.

It's small enough to sit on a table inside my screened back porch and I prefer using the small propane canisters, just to save space.  Even though I live in a cold and snowy area, we used the grill during the winter months as well, thanks to the covered porch off the kitchen.
On to the review.
907	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love this sprayer.
5256	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Love the new design.  They are a bit hard to open, but it is so nice to be able to scrub the mildew from the insides!
8424	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	It seems people like to review these zappers, but few, if any of them, report their geographic location. That makes it difficult to decide if this is right for you in your particular region. Let me say up front that I am in Houston. Where I live is heavily infested with mosquitoes. There is a duck pond a quarter mile away and the woods and soggy ground are rife with the biting buggers. Too bad none is attracted to this 80-Watt zapper. I use the Octenal, I have the zapper hanging from the first story eave 7 feet off the ground and horizontally 25 feet from my patio as instructed. At night, we zap an occasional moth or a fly or two. We get some mosquitoes but I think they simply blundered into the light. I leave the thing on all day and night and it does, essentially, nothing.
The mower is also an attention-grabber; whether that's a good or bad thing depends on your point of view, but kids in our neighborhood have asked questions about the mower; one kid pushed it a short distance to see whether it was difficult or not, and another said that his dad was tired of putting gas in HIS mower.
3465	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I finally decided to replace the mower blade of a hand-me-down electric lawn mower. I had to look up online what blade I needed, but eventually found it and ordered. The blade is nice and sharp and works great on my 10-20yr. old mower.
8752	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	These are NOT humane traps!  Invariably, a mouse in the trap will try to squeeze under the trap door and suffocate.  Very poor design; the old spring-wound tin cats were much better.  Do not buy these if you want to prevent killing the mice.
6235	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I don't know how some reviewers can right an essay on items.. But a simple review would say this is a great tool to have. I used this on my 1/2 backyard away from the city. I LOVE IT! I used a garden pole from home depot to put this at the back of my property and ran an extension cord along the fence.. Hundreds of bugs meet their demise every night.. If you refill the mosquito packs once a week or so you get great results. Otherwise you mainly catch the larger bugs. Very powerful, Ive watched bugs catch on fire!
With the vents on the bottom, the charcoal heats in no time at all.
558	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Yikes! These are just awful. How in the world can you design cutters like this, that work so poorly? The handles flex so much when cutting that you end up bumping your fingers/hands together with each stroke. They cut okay, on thin branches, but unless you have tiny, thin fingers, and only do very light garden trimming, I would not recommend these. Perfect example of "you get what you pay for...".
On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say "This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.
Update:  It has held up well for a couple of years.  I store it over the winter since it is designed for rain and not snow :)  and it gives accurate measurements from spring through fall.

I live on an acre and I will buy a second one to cover my property more completely. I read a lot of reviews from people complaining about the noise. I love to hear it, it sounds like the sweet sound of revenge to me. The cord is short but you will probably use an extension cord with it anyway, so not a problem

I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.
6506	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	OMG, this device works! Tried several other "fancy" mole traps, tried poison, smoke, water flooding, everything. Only this trap finally got this little sucker. It's a little bit tricky to set it up and instruction are not clear how to install it underground, but once you have learned it's really easy and effective. The track looks like a medieval torture device and works like one :). But result is guaranteed if you set it up right. Just uncover a tunnel, pale the trap deep enough do the jaws are right at the level of the tunnel, and only then cover the tunnel with the trap inside with soil. Do not compress the soil, let it be loose. Don't forget to undo the safety hook after that. Again, this is the only mole trap that works!
Now I have a pizza stone coming and I hope to be doing grill pizza next month.  If you want a kettle grill, the bottom line for quality is Weber.
So, in general, I guess the thing is OK, it does the job, but nothing exceptional.

Yes, you hear these make some noise.  That said, inside the house, you don't hear a thing (hardly anyway) and that's coming from someone who's flowtron is hung about 15' from his bedroom window.  Frankly, these are very, very satisfying since you know they are working.  Hooked mine up to a photocell to turn it on and off automatically and it works like a charm.  An easy way to clean them off is to take a air blower (mine is a battery powered one so it isn't super strong) and it blows the bugs right off.  Very easy.  As you can see in my video- these *DO* work.  Also, I don't even have the chemical that attracts the mosquitos in mine since the light clearly seems to be enough!

8378	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to use with my RV as a dedicated hose to flush the black tank and figured the black color in the photo would be appropriate and keep me from confusing it with my other hoses.  Well, I knew the chance of getting a black hose was slim from reading the description but it seemed like an ok price to pay to keep my from having to either deal with a hose longer than I needed or buy one just to chop it down to my size.  In any case, I did not get a black hose, pale green.  On the positive side, it's a quality piece of hose with good fittings (not the best but what you would expect).  Another positive is that my hose measures in at 20 feet and 3 inches - well, depends how you look at it since I really wanted a 15' hose.  Anyway, I'm giving it a full five stars because I can't find any issues with it (at least for a normal consumer, which I am not) and it arrived in my hands less than 24 hours after I placed the order.  I just wish it was black, the extra length is ok and I'm sure I will appreciate that someday.
OTHER DESIGN OPTIONS:  Unless you have a specific reason to choose another design, pruning shears should be simple and bypass in design.  The choices are more complex for loppers.
I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does, and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time. Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.

My grass type is a blend of Kentucky Bluegrass and Perennial Rye; I live in the northwest USA.  I keep my grass "high" all season.  So, with the Scotts, I have the mower set to 3 inches (the maximum cutting height).  I keep my lawn weeded, so I am mowing grass...not weeds.  I mow once a week.  I try not to overwater, and I use a fall fertilizer the entire season (19-4-4); this helps keep the lawn healthy, but prevents it from growing too quickly).

I managed to get a rat once but after the raccoons discovered the traps I laid out that ended my success.  Good tip is to put food on the trap without setting at least twice so the rat thinks it is safe to eat.  Dry cat or dog food smothered in peanut butter is best.  Then after both offerings are gone set the trap and bingo you will have a dead rat.

As hummingbird enthusiasts know, these creatures are exceptionally sensitive to chemicals. Not only shouldn't you clean these feeders with ANY kind of dish-soap, but you CANNOT clean them with bleach. This can potentially kill the birds. Likewise, hummingbirds are sensitive to mold. Here's the catch-22!! Unfortunately, as noted by other reviewers, this feeder's reservoir does not disassemble, and cleaning this feeder properly is exceptionally difficult, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
8341	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this because I needed a hose to drain off the water from my de-humidifier and this was the right length.  The quality is way to nice to be used as a drain hose but that's what I needed it for. It's heavy duty, thick hose.  It was a little bit of an issue to get it to lay flat after it had been coiled up for so long but I just used bricks to get it to lay flat and drain and it worked perfectly.  Don't hesitate to pick a few of these for odd jobs that you need short lengths of hose for.

As far as receiving it, all I had to do was to install two bolts to put the hancle on the edger.  The ease to adjust depth of edging looks very easy to do.  I did plug it in my shop to try it out and it powered up nicely.

6712	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this feeder for years with success.  Recently, I replaced it with the same model bought at a local hardware store, and the quality was terrible as the plastic fingers at the bottom of the hopper that keep the 2 parts together would crack after a few uses.  However, the one I bought from Amazon was fine.  I suspect the ones bought at the hardware store were sitting in their warehouse for a while as the their boxes looked old.  The one from Amazon looked new and fresh.

This is a solidly constructed quality spreader.  You can have a professional quality spreader at a homeowner price.  This could quite possibly be the last spreader you will need to purchase.

This is very important to me as I live in a West Nile infected place.
>> Anvil loppers have one blade, usually straight, which cuts to a flat "anvil", like a knife on a cutting board. If not sharp, they have a tendency to crush rather than cut cleanly, but are less likely to jam., bend or break. Anvil loppers sometimes do not cut completely through soft fibrous material, particularly if the blades are dull. Comparing similar anvil and bypass loppers, the anvil loppers cut thick branches easier..

This flag wasn't designed to be used on our type of box. It was impossible to mount the flag in a convenient location on the box without first attaching it to a wood block, which had to be painted to match our mail box, and then screwed onto the mailbox.

My water pressure has popped 3 different hoses. Not this one - this hose is thick, can take the pressure, and can handle being dragged around.

Because it's plastic, I'll have to take it in for the winter lest it leak next season, but so far it doesn't leak at all.

I use two 1 1/2 acre Flowtrons and they have really brougt the mosquitoes under control. Wish I had used the Flowtrons  earlier. :-)
We figured this was way cheaper than an electric mower so it was worth the gamble if it didn't work out.  So glad we took the gamble and saved a bunch of money!
Overall, this is a great quality bug zapper that I would highly recommend. Even though this hasn't done exactly what I wanted it to, it is definitely reducing the bug population around our property. I have had no probelms with this product other than the ineffectiveness of the mosquito attractant, if anythingthing changes I will update this review accordingly.

6405	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are by far the best feeders! I have had them for years and have 14 of them filled at once (lots of hummingbirds). They love the rail and 12 hummers can and will  sit, share the six holes, and alternate drinking the sugar water at the same time. Please NEVER add the red food color (it's bad for them and they don't need it).  Sugar water ratio: 4 cups water to 1 cup sugar:  Bring water to boil, add sugar, stir and boil for 3 minutes, cool. Double, triple, or quadruple the amount and store the rest in the fridge. Remember to change the water every 3-5 days depending on how hot it is. Best to start with a small amount of juice until you see how many hummers you have.  To clean, rinse in hot water/ run bottom in bottom section/fill top section half way and shake and rinse again. These feeders are very durable and strong and last forever and the hummingbirds love them.
If I had know how well these work, I would have bought one years ago. It has been out in the Texas sun all day and is showing no sign of not holding up. I simply couldn't be happier.

* Don't try to track this along the length of a slope. It will roll over. I've had that happen, found the tractor upside down and one of the arms disconnected. Fortunately it wasn't broken, just popped out. This rollover occurred due to jumping the hose and going where it wasn't intended.

220	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	With so many reviewers giving this product 5 stars, I didn't want to spoil the good run by giving less than 5 stars.  However, there are some reservations that you should consider.  Since these detractors may apply to many brands of fertilizer applicators, it wouldn't be fair to assign blame only to this one model.
However,  the line feed on my unit doesn't work correctly,  which may be why the cutting time isn't what it's supposed to be (the line only feeds about half way out to the shield,  which means I'm getting much less cutting action than I should be).

8708	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is my third attempt at finding a mouse trap that works. I tried the yellow see through plastic kind and while that worked for a few mice it stopped working (being able to be set). Plus to set it you had to touch the trap quite a bit. Then I tried the black Tomcat tilt back trap. I had 3 in a drawer. If you didn't shut the drawer just right they would tip back and close. Then after I caught mice they would chew through the plastic. I threw all of these away.  The Victor Tin Cat trap has been great! I put a piece of cereal bar in and that's it. Nothing to set. I have caught up to 3 mice at one time. To release you just open the lid. Some mice run out, some jump and some don't want to leave. I make sure I have some cereal bar in there and put it back. This is the best I have found so far!!!
8422	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	You are essentially buying a well-lit hotel for any flea that might randomly jump onto the sticky glue in the middle of the night. You'd be equally well-served by putting a piece of duct tape on the floor and hoping one of the critters chooses to inadvertantly commit suicide by plunging onto it. Dont throw away your money on this well-marketed junk. It doesn't attract fleas at all - it's literally just an expensive holder for sticky tape, with a light bulb to remind you how much money you just wasted. That it catches fleas in the quantities reported by top reviewers gives me great concern for what can only amount to a Biblical flood of fleas infesting their homes.

I purchased one of these for the hose in my backyard and have since purchased another one for the hose in my front yard because I liked it so much.

The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during non-use.

I moved it inside (even though they tell you to leave it 25+ feet away) and it has killed all the mosquitos and allowed us to sleep through the night without using the mosquito netting.

5365	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This thing produces alot of dead moths and similar flying bugs, but really no mosquitos.  Since I purchased this primarily for mosquito control, I have been extremely disappointed.  I really don't mind all these other flying bugs.  We have the so called Tiger mosquitos here, and the Octenol lure doesn't work against them.  Really you need Lurex3, but I can't find those designed for bug zappers like this.  They make them for the Mosquito Magnet contraptions, so I'm out of luck.  Probably all the reviews in here praising this product's efficacy against mosquitos are either exaggerations or they're from a geographic locations where Octenol lures are more effective.  So if you live in the Southern US with the nasty Tiger mosquitos (including North Texas), don't believe these reviews too much.  I suppose I have to go back to spraying myself with Off.
If you have cover crop trash to plough through, here's what I do.  This will kill your warranty, and I don't recommend you do this unless you're handy with tools.... Open one chain link where it attaches to the frame, so it makes a hook.  Then, in trashy soil, you can just unhook the drag chain and let it go. Set the seeder a little deeper, and you're good to plant. With the drag chain in place like they've designed it, the drag chain will gather trash and make a problem if you don't have nicely tilled seed beds. Being able to unhook the drag chain and let it loose is the answer. I don't know why the company doesn't do this, but they didn't call me and ask for advise. It works for me, though.

3754	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This hose worked way better than I had expected it to work!  I needed it for watering a strip of lawn along the edge of my driveway which is only four feet wide to my property line.  This hose provides a large volume of water in the form of a fine mist which sprays directly up from the hose and settles uniformly onto the lawn.  I could adjust the height of the mist spray very easily by adjusting the flow of water with the spigot handle on the water valve which supplied the hose.  It did not require a very large amount of water to completely fill the hose and provide adequate spray along the entire length of the hose.  The area where I was using it is also on a slight incline and this did not affect the flow of water to the highest level of the incline at all.  The hose material is extremely flexible and permits routing of the hose very easily in the desired directions.  It also rolls up very easily into a compact size and shape for storage, just like the picture shows it in the "as delivered" condition.  I am extremely happy with this product so far, and I am expecting it to be durable as well because it has a five year warranty.
As for the top, I've tried various combinations of bungee cords and belts, but so far I haven't found a system that holds the top on while its being transported in a car.

Anyway, I found a helpful internet article that told me how to tighten the loose blade (just in case any of my fellow amazoners have this same problem).  You need a 9/16 inch wrench, and a 1 inch wrench (very large, glad I had one!). You put the 1 inch wrench on the outside washer, and that allows you to tighten the nut with the 9/16 inch wrench.  You tighten it clockwise, the same direction that the blade turns.

5742	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	In my review of the 2" pulley, I stated that the key slot was undersized. In this pulley, the key slot was exactly 3/16" as it is supposed to be. Unfortunately, the key I was using was oversized, so I had to file the key again. Cosmetically, this pulley is designed to have a counterweight for the extra metal required for the set screw, my old one had a larger/heavier ring around the shaft to act as the counterweight. This is just a design difference and does not affect the operation of the pulley. I am satisfied with this pulley.

It does almost  everything the big Weber does.  But, it's smaller...  I can roast a whole chicken in it but, The chicken needs to be split in half. This is a great small grill ... Perfect for camping, tailgating, and for a family of 2.
868	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been holding off on buying one of these for years because of the price. Well the price really hasn't changed in all this time and now I wish I had bought this years ago. It does an awesome job watering, covers a ton of area and is so much easier to use than standard stand-alone sprinkler. It easily handles pulling 300ft of hose (in roughly a straight line) with no issue of bogging down. Highly recommend the investment.
Anyway, with all that said, this has the same failings as all other reel mowers. First and foremost, don't expect to get through really overgrown grass or tough weeds. Twigs will also bring it to a dead stop. Reel mowers like this work best when you're doing "upkeep". If your lawn has not been mowed in a few weeks you can do it with this guy but it's going to be a chore.

This trap is incredibly small. Arrives in a small envelope ! It is less than 1.5 inches square and 6.5 inches in length.
You glue both ends onto a PVC pipe with PVC glue and then hook up your hose. This is convenient because you can cut a pipe piece to any length you need, but keep in mind that once you are done the item is a one use thing. Since it costs about $5 this is not a big deal. Also, by doing it this way you have an in place conduit ready for whatever you want to run under the sidewalk.

It's really disgusting and the only thing I wish is that these were disposable, maybe made of thinner plastic, maybe more like cheap water bottles, because I do feel terrible throwing them away, and I do throw them away, because the idea of emptying them is just awful.

I thought it would be great for my 7,000sqft lawn, just for the workout, but after two months of mowing on the next to lowest setting on my new lawn of bermuda grass, it has made the grass so healthy and thick, i can barely push through it. Soni moved it to its highest setting to thin it out, because grass grows up or out wider, now its just wrapping rhizomes arond the wheels and dragging over patches of uncut grass.

The only disadvantage to this grill is the need to have small propane tanks.  In my area the dump will not accept them so disposal became an issue.  Fortunately I found a hose that connects a regular large propane tank, the kind you see on 'normal size' grills, to this grill.  (Check your local camping supply stores)

The reel mower will miss some weeds and long grass, also does not work well with very thin grass. The reel mower cuts by using the revolving sharp tines to push grass against a metal bar and shearing it off. Thinner grasses and weeds sometimes are just pushed to the side or down instead of getting cut.
Early reviews indicated some of the newer-style 209B feeders leaked - none of the 6 I currently use leak whatsoever - the only time they will leak is if you mis-thread the glass to the plastic base - otherwise, leak-free, even in moderate winds.

6642	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	After all these years this is still the best rat trap. This trap has the metal bait holder, which has provided far more kills than the trap with the yellow plastic bait holder. I have tried most of the newer easy to set plastic traps. While the easy set traps are nice and safe to set, they don't have a strong enough spring. The easy set traps have weak springs that cause far to many escaped rats and still alive wounded rats. This M201 Victor metal pedal trap is the one to buy. Put out about ten traps, baited but NOT set to kill for the first three days and re bait them each day. That way they won't get trap shy. Then on the forth day bait and set all ten traps to kill. You will have a bunch of dead rats. Clean and Re bait for round two. Avoid rainy days as the rain drops set these traps off.

However, I will admit it has had some spectacular crashes when the operator forgot to set the brake ramp (a separate plastic component that is included).  In one of these crashes it attempted to crawl up the side of the plastic rain-gutter extension piece in my back yard.  The crash resulted in a roll over with one sprinkler arm projected straight up and the resultant spray travelling over 25-30 feet upward in the air and arcing more than 30 feet forward over my steeply sloped side lawn.  An amazed young boy attending a party next door spotted a beautiful descending stream of water pouring along the side my house from far overhead, complete with a full spectrum rainbow.  Of course, he couldn't see the tractor "wreck" in my backyard.  With an utterly incredulous look on his face, he came over to ask whether my house had exploded and was leaking or whether it really was raining from just one hole in the sky!!!
I do like the way it makes our driveway and sidewalk look professionally done.  It really puts a polished touch to our lawncare.
953	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The hands down, best garden sprayer I have found. It can spray thick Atrazine and that means it can spray anything.

Good Stuff I highly recommend.

Both have tried to sell me "flea repellants". My dog lays behind my chair when I'm watching TV in the evenings so I bought this product to find out if there really are fleas in my house. WARNING! Watch how you handle the sticky paper that goes in the bottom of the unit. I didn't and it took me 15 minutes of fighting it to get "unstuck"! Anyway, after setting it up three nights in a row behind my chair where my dog lays, I figured that's where the fleas would be, I came up with "ZERO" fleas. I also bought a flea comb when I bought this product and I haven't found one yet. I'm giving this 5 stars because it proved a point! Even if it didn't catch any fleas.
This was an excellent purchase. The Flowtron works great, and stands up to weather. It's reduced the amount of bugs we were getting to almost nothing. It hasn't been a large boost in my electricity bill, especially since it's not running 24/7 thank to the timer I added.

If I don't catch anything in about 2 weeks or so, and I see activity, I pull it out and use something sharp to gently remove any rain-impacted dirt from the sensitive activation spot, then re-bury it. The only problem I have with it is how hard it is to set. I can't use the set tools for some reason, so I have to step on it to set it. This works but it's still very difficult.

4019	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	If I went by the home improvement stores reccomendation for the size of my lawn, I would need a riding mower.  But this is the mower I use, and it is good exercise.  I have a sharpening kit, since it requires sharpening at least several times a year.  For the average person, however, sharpening shouldn't be needed.  I wind up literally wearing it out over the period of 3-4 years, and I replace it.  I can cut my lawn in about the same amount of time as someone using a power mower, but I don't make the noise or the pollution.  There is one major drawback.  You better hope you do not get a string of rainy days when you cannot mow, because if the grass gets too high, you will struggle.  On the other hand, you can cut wet grass with this mower.  I have had problems with the handle breaking, but it has either been covered under warranty or a minor cost replacement item.  The handle is the Achilles heel of this mower, and it will break where it is bolted by the lower set of bolts.  But again, my lawn is much larger then the normal lawn that is handled with a push mower, so it gets more use and stress.  And your neighbors will notice how neat your lawn looks after cutting.  And in using a push mower, you will start looking more closely at your lawn.  Those sticks that power mowers go right over are sticks that you probably will have to pick up.

The two traps appear to be identical, except that the Eaton has a plastic 'window' in the cover that makes it much easier to see whether there are mice inside. The disadvantage of the Eaton's plastic window is that it is not very durable for outdoor use, since the plastic shatters easily once the trap is a year or two old.

This grill made all of the chicken breasts, sausages and hot dogs I needed and I would be able to use it if I had company over for even more food.  What I like most about this grill is how easy it is to clean and keep clean!!  The standard Weber was hard to get rid of the ashes and the grill was too big to clean in my kitchen sink.  Not so with this one!  This is a perfect Weber grill for a single person, a couple or a family of 3.  This grill was the perfect gift and better able to handle.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.

Second, I have some nastaglia for this product.  My grandmother had one of these and I used to mow her lawn when I was about 7-8 years old.  It was so much fun!

When I saw it with the door shut, I assumed I had caught my mouse, and drove miles away to release it, trying to be nice and humane.  When I arrived and opened the door, nothing happened.  There was no mouse.  There was only evidence of a mouse, as he had chewed all over the trap, and chewed off part of the door hinge mechanism, so that it no longer was functional.  The design was faulty as well as the opaque black color - you can't look inside to see if someone is in there!  I had to return it and bought a different one, see-through plastic and with a better trap mechanism.  I successfully caught two mice with the second trap.  Don't waste your money on this one, it is ineffective even though it is cheap.

This also requires an extension cord.  As with all electrical equipment being used outdoors, you should not skimp on the extension cord.  Make sure you use a grounded cord that is rated for exterior use. I err on the side of caution and use a contractor grade exterior extension cord, because it's important to be safe when using electrical equipment.  Some of the better ones on Amazon are made by Coleman such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Coleman-Cable-02469-14-3-100-Foot-Hi-Visibility-Low-Temperature-Outdoor-Extension-Cord/dp/B00004SQFB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Coleman Cable 02469 14/3 100-Foot Hi-Visibility/Low-Temperature Outdoor Extension Cord</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Coleman-Cable-02569-12-3-100-Foot-Hi-Visibility-Low-Temperature-Outdoor-Extension-Cord/dp/B00004SQFD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Coleman Cable 02569 12/3 100-Foot Hi-Visibility/Low-Temperature Outdoor Extension Cord</a>.

7962	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	DO NOT BUY THIS POS, I should have listened.  I bought two, two weeks apart.  The first one leaked immediately, so I ordered a second meaning to return first.  Second one worked in the first place I put it BECAUSE I DIDN"T MOVE IT, the hose was on a timer.  As soon as I tried to use it to spray the plants, the tension on the connector made it leak immediately, from both sides of the screw-on connector.  So so so so so so terrible.  Now return window is over for both! Other reviewers were right that these should not be for sale.
1295	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is so much easier to use than the kind that requires you to carry it in one hand while using the sprayer with the other. It does a great job spraying just plain water in a fine spray which is what I needed it to do. The harness is a little fiddly getting it on but once you get it on it's not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was a strap across the chest to keep it from falling off my shoulders. I had to rig something up to prevent that, so the harness could use some more attention. It's a little bigger than I needed but it still works great. It's easy to pump and the nozzle is easy to use with an easy pull trigger which is easy on my arthritic hands. I'm really glad I got it.
2857	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this root waterer because I live in Southern California and don't want to waste water.  I push the rod down in the ground next to several fruit trees I have and then turn on water.  I once killed a cherry tree by putting too much water on the roots, and the ground was so hard it didn't drain therefore causing the roots to rot.  So you have to be careful, and not over due it.  This Root feeder has a lot of plastic on it so it's not as sturdy as the original metal and glass one I had.  But if you handle it carefully, and carry it around by the putting your hand on the hose instead of the plastic body it should work just fine. It has shortened my watering time by quite a bit, no longer having to run water and let it soak down to roots.  I would recommend this device.  I have not used the feeding feature of this feeder.  It is a little shorter then the original one I owned, but you just have to bend over more.

7423	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This trap is easy to set up (if you know how and, admittedly, the directions are not too helpful) and get situated along a tunnel.  No digging is necessary as with some in-the-tunnel traps.  The real work is figuring out where and how to situate the trap.  The moles in my area are extremely small (3"-4") and I did not find the "in-the-tunnel" traps very useful.  Plus you need two "in-the-tunnel-traps" to do what one Victor trap does.  I notice a lot of complaints about difficulty setting this trap.  There is a "trick" to it that make it very easy but trying to describe it is like trying to write how to tie a shoe lace.  All I can say is that I set it by placing one side on a concrete or brick surface while using the included tools to set the trap in a manner that otherwise mimics the enclosed instructions.

So what's worse than a blade that isn't even what's pictured?  One that is completely dull.  For the $16 shipped cost, I would still have had to go get it sharpened for another $15.

5035	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.

I think this could be a lovely unit, unfortunately I'm not going to spend hours keeping cones out of my lawn just so I can use it.  The handles did feel a bit short to me when I was using it, I felt like I was leaning over it a bit to make it go, but that would be my only complaint.

This arrived quickly and assembly was a breeze. The blades are sharp and even though it weighs less than our older one, it cuts thick grass pretty well with less weight. You can't compare it to a gas-powered mower, but this does what we need it to do. It's light enough for me to lift and compact enough to fit in its designated space in the shed. We let our neighbor try it on her lawn - loved it!  Recommended.

4985	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice Product as an add on item for your Flowtron bug sapper. The best part of the design is that the outer curl has a closing clasp. So, once you snap your Flowtron Sapper into it the clasp holds it in place and the wind or a frisky animal (such as your neighborhood raccoon) won't dislodge the product. Why is that good? Well because the Flowtron's cage unit has a tendency to crack when it falls six to eight feet to the ground. We found that our squirrels and a raccoon must have thought it was a feeder and they have tried jumping up on it and the clasp keeps it from crashing down.
PS as it turns out the original air leak was due to a peice of crud stuck in the bottom check valve but I'm glad I did the rebuild anyway since I found the piston cup was cracked and about ready to fail.
At the end is 5 holes, 4 outward, (such as north, south, east, & west), and one straight downward. Once you get past the soft top layer of soil, chances are as you go deeper you will hit clay, or harder soil.
Caveat emptor.

1607	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Of all the various hose nozzles on the market, I find nothing lasts longer than this classic design.  There are no plastic pieces to break and it just seems to last for years.  I do add some grease to the threads when putting it on to both help with the seal and to make it easier to remove in the rare times when I need just a hose.  Eventually it will start to corrode inside and the stream won't be as nice and the handle will get harder to squeeze, but I'll take this design over any of the other fancier designs.

The Cherry Valley Coach Lamp Bird Feeder ships in multiple pieces. You have to assemble the hopper/ feeder with a long rod that screws the top and the bottom of the hopper to the feeder to keep it in place (I already trashed the feeder, so I do not know the length of the rod but I want to say it is about 10-12 inches long). I ordered a preowned one and the screw did not fit end to end, well, it did but it made the part that you twist open to put the seed in a little too snug, actually it was so snug that I could barely twist it to open it and fill it.

You will notice that the grass blades are cut cleaner than with most power mowers. It's MUCH easier to maneuver in small spaces than a large power mower. You really can't compare.  When you put the catcher on the back, it looses some maneuver ability, obviously. Still more nimble than a power mower. The downside. It will only cut 4" to 5 inches away from a wall, or tree, or obstacle. Power mowers cut much closer to a wall than this one.

I have some other Corona products so I was confident in ordering this saw. It is so light and the grip is so comfortable. It is very sharp in both push and pull, and my time cutting 1inch thick branches regardless of green or deadwood, was so quick I was surprised. The saw makes very smooth clean cuts. I was able to cut some 2 inch thick branches very easily, too. I'm cleaning up a couple of shrubs, and am very pleased with how they look after using this saw. Plus, my elbow and shoulder do not ache so much as they did with my old standard wood handle saw, I think the handgrip design helps a lot. Sharp, light, comfortable to use, and very well priced, including shipping. I recommend this saw.

I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.

8889	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	We're very disappointed in this product.  We have a mouse infestation and the HaveAHeart traps are the only ones we find that work successfully on a regular basis.  This Victor trap for some reason is not working.  We make sure we secure the lid really well (they got out the first time when we evidently did not have it tight enough).  Some how, they were getting in, removing the peanut butter/choc. chip delight and leaving.  So with this trap we have been housing and feeding these ingenious little critters.  We have to quit using this device since it just isn't working and we can't figure out exactly why.  We are terribly terribly disappointed because although the HaveAHeart traps are excellent, they only trap one mouse at a time.  Which means with an infestation, you are losing the battle - fast!!
I noticed this older version is lighter weight ~ 3 lb rather then the current 4.3 pound ~ still the same 26" length.
-- No separate cap for the reservoir (it would be nice to remove the sprayer head and leave the chemical in the sprayer capped by a spare cap)

I originally, last year, bought and electric one last year by CharBroil, and that last an entire 2 months.  It just didn't make sense--took me 10x as long to grill items on it.  So, this year, I was skeptical.  But, I'm glad I got this.  I use it with the instand lighting charcoal, takes about 10 minutes to get ready, and then you're all set.

In my case it was a drop-in; maybe because I already had switched over or maybe I just happen to have the right kind of Edge Hog.

Though I've never lost a bee guard yet, I got these as back-up replacements just in case.  The Pinch-Waist Feeder flower ports can be used with or without these bee guards.  But since we have a bee problem, we choose to use the bee guards to keep the insects out of the feeder reservoir base.  Before getting the Pinch-Waist Feeder with bee guards, our old feeders of a different style leaked badly and swarms of bees hung out and crawled inside the reservoirs and died.  These bee guards really work to keep out the insects and the hummies' are very adept at getting their long tongues through the bee guard grids to drink.  I love that the hummies can sip in peace without fighting off pesky insects.
So...great product, great price, and great online service. What more can you ask for?
Even with those drawbacks, its a great way to maintain a lawn without having to worry about electricity or gasoline!

When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet!

I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.

I researched several websites to be sure I was getting what appeared to be the 1200C original design.  However, I was disappointed to see the feeder is 2-3 inches shorter than the original 1200C; I am pretty picky about design specifics in tools. Unfortunately none of the websites actually stated how long the penetrating rod is, so I could not determine if this was original design or not.  The head appears 99% accurate in regards to the one we have which is at least 10+ years old. I only hope it works as well, at least penetrating the soils at our small farm.  I will update on how well it actually performs this spring in penetrating the soil.
5424	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice
A note: I was going to mount this under my desk, which is attached to my house but in the instructions it tells you not to mount it on your house. So instead I have mine mound in the back yard on the fence with a 75ft extension core running to a day/night timer under the deck.
Seems solid to me.
9282	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	It was in use for half a summer season and then it just quit.  No one could figure it out. So it hangs there non working and I use the cheap one on the deck that I have.
993	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I've used this model Gilmour hose-end sprayer and I've also used the model with the teal-colored handle.  This one costs a bit more, but it's worth the extra cash as both its construction and design is superior to its cheaper cousin.  For example, I found that the point of connection on the cheaper unit was a veritable Achille's heel ie as I walked, the hose tended work loose fairly easily and, of course, as soon as the seal was broken, I'd get an unwanted 'shower'.  That mishap didn't happen once when I sprayed my 1/2 acre lawn with the 362 Pro.  UPDATE: 2.17.17:  I paid $19 for this item 2.5 years ago & now it's going for $50??  If you want this type hose-end sprayer, check out the Chapin G362 model.  As far as I can tell, it's virtually identical to the Gilmour unit and is available for $20!!

7343	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I recieved this grill as a promotion from a cigarette company. The regulator went out, and Weber sent a new one free of charge 7 yrs ago. This grill is awesome, but if you are trying to grill in a windy area, you will need to buy an item called a "Grill Guard" my father in-law used my "Grill Guard" as a template to make his own (Piano hinge and aluminum). The people at grillguard [...] are quite proud of their product, and their pricing reflects that. But a GrillGuard should last forever. My area is so windy, I have to put aluminum foil on the small slits on the sides, at the bottom of my GrillGuard. The Weber grill gets extremely hot!!, "IF" you keep it clean, if you don't keep the steel louvered tent above the burner clean, the juices will hit the tent and after a while will almost insulate the tent, and keep the heat from traveling up to your items on the rack. If you cannot find a picture of the GrillGuard, post a comment  and I will post a Video... With a GrillGuard (ouch), and a (Clean) Weber Go-Anywhere grill, you will have the hot set-up, if you still have money to buy the meat :)

  When I use mine (I have 3 of them) plates of wood fly off that are up to 8 inches wide.  Because the velocity is so much higher than with a conventional axe you achieve higher energy therefore greater cutting power (E=MxCSquared). For limbing they are better than a chainsaw. If dropping a bigger tree I use my chainsaw and then use the Estwing axe to limb out the tree except for the biggest limbs. For smaller trees just use the Estwing axe. It will save you time and no messing around with the saw, gas and oil. It really is the best axe in the world.
375	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	There is no nozzle that I have not bought. And I truly mean none. We have extremely low water pressure probably because our house is like 100 years old and the pipes are old. Anyway found this nozzle and hey I never tried this one. It is by far the best one yet. It has increased my water pressure and is easy for me to turn right and left because I am always changing the speed of my nozzles.

1241	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	It seems like a quality product made from good materials, but the design did not work for me. I was interested in spraying liquid fertilizer and a milk solution recommended to combat lawn mildew. For these uses, it took over an hour of spraying to empty the container even on the highest setting. This rate may be OK for spraying potent chemicals, but not for fertilizer. My water pressure is a bit low, so that could have contributed to the problem. I had to return it.

Every year we are infested with flies from the animals near our property. I have had the trap up for two days and i am in shock as to how many it has caught. I'm glad i purchased the gallon size. Still undecided if i am willing to clean it out and reuse, or just throw the jar away. It is already looking pretty bad.
683	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this hose because the $10 value hose I bought at HomeDepot burst within one day of use. The fist day I used it, I accidentally left the water turned on over night, and the hose ripped open from the pressure and flooded my yard for a few hours. This hose is tough and does a good job. It doesn't kink and reels up well on my hose crank. It was worth the extra money. I have left the hose on over night by accident a few times, and nothing has happened. No, leaks, bumps or protrusions. I would highly recommend this hose.
8686	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this unit primarily for killing flies, however they are just not attracted to it at all.  It doesn't do much in the daytime but at night it comes alive.  It does a good job attracting all kinds of insects that buzz around at night.  The cats in the backyard seem to love this thing as they gather around it and wait for falling insects.  To them it's like sitting around a barbecue, all they have to do is to wait for a tasty treat to fall down.  It's funny to see them sit under it all night long. :-)
5923	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have to admit being skeptical after reading some of the reviews.  I failed to secure the cap for the gasoline tank on my Poulan lawnmower with a Briggs & Stratton engine and ran over it, causing extensive damage to the plastic cap.  I ordered it, tried it, and found it is the perfect replacement.

3462	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I'm giving this a 4-star review even though I am returning it.  The mower came in a nice, compact box and was very easy to assemble.  I had already raked up all the twigs I could find, so I ran right out and got mowing.  My grass was pretty long, and there are a fair amount of broad-leaf weeds, but this mower cut through them like butter.  I was chugging right along until it chugged back.  I know have a handle-bar shaped bruise on my stomach from the sudden breaking power as the mower was stopped in its tracks by none other than a fir cone.  No where in the instructions or online did it mention cones, and the fir cones are pretty smushy in my neck of the woods, but they were still too dense to mow through.  And they are to plentiful since my property is surrounded by fir trees to pick up or mow around.  Very disappointed as I was super excited about this purchase, but it just isn't feasible for my situation.

9486	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this product in November 2009.  in May 2010 one of the bulbs burned and I purchased replacement ones. The replacements bulbs did not work because apparently the actual socket has a problem. I tested the working socket and that seemed to work with the new bulbs but the one side where the bulb burned does not work. I called customer service and the problem is the starter for that bulb (a small device in the enclosure on top) and they said they will be sending me a replacement starter.
796	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Best hose I've bought todate.  Glossy coating helps it glide and slide though the grass.  The finish also keeps it from getting spotty and discolored from dirt, mold and general outdoors weathering.  Just the right amount of stiffness to prevent kinking.  Any kinks that might occur (rare at best) are easily shaken out from a distance. Two thumbs UP.

I have used these traps in the past with great success, but not this time.
I have found that it does not grill evenly.  However, for the price and its functionality, it is still a good buy.  My biggest beef is if there is a stout wind, it has a tendency to blow out the grill.  On those occasions, it takes much longer to get through the cooking process.  Since there is no thermometer, you have to babysit it when the wind is strong.

I wasn't getting much action until my friend Arlene told me how picky hummers are to clean feeders, so I cleaned it thoroughly with soap and water, bottle brush and tooth brush.  Then I rinsed it a couple of times to get ALL the soap off. Now the hummers love it, except that one hummer has claimed it as his territory and chases off intruders.  So I am getting a second feeder so that I can get more hummers.  I'll report back in if I buy a third.  My hummers are most active in the morning.  About 7am.  But they come around all day.

I have 8 of them and highly recommend the Flexogen.

WHY didn't I learn this sooner?  I guess the "ease" of gas, the "right now" of gas is what started me down the gas path all those years ago.

I'll update this as I live with it, but so far, so good.
I did not hear zapping during the day, even though mosquitoes are out then, so I put it on a timer from dusk till dawn.  There might not be enough contrast in light during the day to attract them to the lamp.  One comment about the cord - it's a very thick, hard plastic as opposed to being more rubbery, as with an outdoor extension cord.  I take a twist tie and help support the extension cord to the shepard's hook, when the lamp is plugged in, to help it avoid unplugging from the lamp cord on it's own. Overall, I'm very happy with the performance of this Flowtron and it is attractive looking. I keep it about 30 feet from the house and I don't notice the zapping noise being loud or a bother.
9064	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Why buy at Sears or the big box stores like Home Depot or Lowes? This is the same identical product for far less money. I buy them by the case so I always have them on hand as I mow acreage and in a dirty environment. It takes less than an ounce of dirt to destroy an engine. Protect your investment. Great buy and great protection. This is an actual Briggs and Stratton product not an after market product.
However I have never had a rubber hose with any of those problems. The rubber hoses are not stiff, they are not overly heavy, and they are easy to coil on the ground or wrap on a hose reel.

4039	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I assumed this would work for flies. It did not kill one fly. I did see 2 small moths get zapped, but nothing other than that. I was looking for something that would get the flies buzzing around my backyard, but they were not interested.

5689	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These Flowtron Bug Zappers work amazing. At first I thought the unit was broke because I heard so much zapping, but it was because the unit was just swarmed with insects. No complaints. I have the 15 watt, 40 watt and the 80 watt units. Note the 15 and 80 watt units both have a 3 prong grounded cord, but the 40 watt one comes with a 2 prong power cord. Not sure why that is, but it doesn't seem to affect the operation. I think the 40 watt size is the best bang for you buck.

2447	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good value for an industrial duty rubber hose.  Rubber is not as light and flexible as a lightweight vinyl hose, but it is definately more durable.  So be advised, this is heavy and bulky but does not tangle easily.
* Edging - works much better than I anticipated. It has an edging guide that steers you on your path and the string really does have the power to do the job
All parts of this sprayer is made with good materials. No thin plastic or loose seals.
6529	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I put this thing in my mole infested yard and have never caught one, but they all seem to have vanished.  I'm not sure all the credit should go to Victor, or if the little critters just froze to death.
7485	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great
The instructions were incredibly difficult to follow and I had to look at the box to figure out what they were trying to say.  one of the handle parts must be made for each side or should be because to use the larger bolt that has a plastic cover to let you tighten it, on the same side is impossible because the square cutout was on the same side for the two parts that look identical except for the bolt hole.  Not a big problem other than it is a strange design and I guess might make it easier to take apart or tighten.
Like I said, I received 15 years of faithful, hard use out of my old one but come on Weber, make a better igniter! I can't believe they haven't improved it after all these years.

2410	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I've several sets of these that I purchased both on Amazon and at a local hardware store. This batch will not connect either to each other or to the older sets.

2636	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Finally, a sprayer that is built to last. As stated from other reviewers, this unit is not light but if you are used to a lot of physical work then it won't be a problem. Water weighs roughly 6 lbs per gallon so if you put in 3 gal of whatever you want to spray then you are roughly going to be carrying around 30 lbs at first.  I like everything about it, the pumping action is very productive.....what I mean is that when you pump it up you can tell all the air is going into the tank and not bleeding out around poorly made seals. There is no pressure valve so you can pump it up as much as you want. It didn't come with a carry strap but since I have never used a carry strap it wasn't an issue but I figured it was worth noting in case this is important to you. I wanted an adjustable nozzle so I also bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5SOM4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 as an add-on.

The female fitting began leaking between the threaded part and the part that is attached to the hose. The hose was fastened tightly. The gasket was in good shape, but I replaced it with a fresh gasket anyway. No joy. It still leaks. The leak is within the brass fitting. It seems like it should last longer than this...

When I was trying to accept that mowing would be a weekly task, I thought that the upside would be an upper-body workout. I was a little disappointed that not much effort was required.

Since hardly any effort was required I just went on and did the job as-I-was.

Yes, you were under-powered, but I knew you were just right for me.  What a team we were.

Maybe decades ago this color issue wasn't known, hence a tradition of cheery yellow bee guards developed, but come on, Perky-Pet -- get with it. Red or colorless bee guards make a lot more sense. btw, if you have woodpeckers or flickers that like to guzzle from the feeders, they can sometimes crack parts of the guards, letting bees get in anyhow.

I agree the EZ-Que is a novel and well made piece of equipment, which sells for a lot more money than the Weber rotisserie.  The cradle/cage design is easier to load than a traditional spit, and anyone who wants to spend $130 for one is encouraged to get theirs.
But you can't clean the inside of the bottle and you can't clean the inside of the bottom feeding tray.  I called the manufacturer and they told me they recommend cleaning the feeding tray by putting rice in water and swirling it around.  I have some black deposits inside the bottle now, and can't get rid of them, so I'm throwing out the whole thing and replacing it with a feeder from another manufacturer.
The first half dozen or so uses do not provide a good grilled flavor. After some build up of juices and fat, the flavor is much better. If using on the high heat setting, I would not recommend placing on a flammable surface. The surface of the table that I used was hot enough burn you.

It a very nice grill and cooks like a "real grill". Previously, I purchased a 10. "pretender" from my local Walgreens. It was a cute little grill, but it was so flimsly and the cooking grate was almost sitting on top of the charcoal. It had no depth and my poor burgers were crispy charred. I trashed that one after the first use.

I like how easy it is to just whip it out and get the spots in my yard that somehow grow much faster than the rest of my lawn. I also have an absurd amount of thin wood branches - hundreds! - that fall down all fall and winter and if they're dry and not fresh, this cuts them easily. The harder/green branches will stick but I just step on a blade to move it back and that does the trick.

Vents allow one to completely smother the fire, thus conserving some charcoal for another round of grilling.  The grill is typical of Weber, well-made and serves its' purpose for small cook-outs.  The handle is nice for short carry trips.  The grill requires additional stabilization if transported in a truck bed or car.....say in a box or crate.  The ash stays in the bottom until you dump it.

However, in operation, the device performs well (I've not had any experience with cheapo spreaders, so have nothing to compare it to). Not sure why the rotating spreading disk is not an inch or two higher though - it seems as though a lot of the stuff gets thrown against the top of the tire, especially with lower flow rates. Also, as the hopper empties out, the flow tapers off and you have to wobble the thing to keep it spreading, resulting in slightly inconsistent rates, unless of course, you keep it topped off.

UPDATE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS:  While I think I am right about this trap, I was wrong about the Tomcat "step on" trap.  I have now used one for several months with good success, much better than my other traps.  It's more difficult to set close to a walkway, but on tunnels in the open, it does a good job.  I recommend loosening the soil where the jaws operate and pushing the trap as far down as possible with your foot.  It's safer and easier to set than other traps.

Interestingly enough, where I live, yellowjackets have figured out that any bugs stuck in the rods are a free lunch - and since my unit goes off at dawn via the timer, the yellowjackets can get in there and remove any stuck moth bodies without being zapped in the afternoon.  It's a great deal for me, since it saves a little clean up.  I have actually seen the yellowjackets wiggle the stuck insect bodies until they come loose from the rods, then they fly off with them!  It also seems like they clean up the ones that have fallen on the deck, although that may be birds stopping by in the morning and/or the wind blowing them off the side of the deck.  I'm not sure.  Whatever the case, the unit requires almost zero cleaning and doesn't clog up hardly at all.

Now the grass catcher.  Amazon sells a second party grass catcher that can attach to the mower and it gets horrible reviews. I am not sure if that is what was packaged in mine or not.  I'll admit it isn't perfect, but I do prefer to use it.  It attaches easily and catches about 75% of the grass.  I leave the 25% mixed into the lawn as mulch.  But if I don't use the grass catcher, so much is left behind I'd have to rake and I hate raking. It does drag on the ground a bit.  I tried to adjust it so it was level and just about 1" above the ground while pushing, but then the grass slides forward and out.  So I just let it drag.

On the bottom side of the tractor is a piston/spring trigger. If it is pushed up into the belly of the tractor, it stops the water flow. When you pull it out, it opens the valve and sprays water out the tubes. The point of this is to allow auto-shutoff when the tractor crawls over a "bridge ramp" placed on the hose where you want it to stop crawling. This bridge (which is provided) is yellow (see photos of it) and Is placed so as to straddles the hose. It is wide enough for the front wheels to ride up and over the bridge ramp. But the back wheels straddle it allowing the bridge to cause the piston to be pushed up as it tries to pass over it, shutting off the water and therefore the crawling action. So far this action has had mixed success for me. in principle it works. When the piston encounters the ramp of the bridge, it pushes it up and stops water flow. The problem I've had with it is this: if you aren't able to get the ramp low enough in the grass, I've had multiple times where the piston catches on the cut-out of the bridge ramp where the hose passes through. I've carefully examined why and it's because the ramp is not low enough relative to the clearance of the tractor belly. The bridge has a single fold-out thin metal rod that is meant to poke down in the sod to help hold the bridge in place and as low as possible. However, I think having thick grass or soft soil reduces the effectiveness of this rod in holding it down low close to the grass dirt level.

1997	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have had excellent luck with all of the Gilmour products I have purchased.  This one comes exactly as shown and carries the tried and true, Gilmour brass mechanics.  The unit is a comfortable size and easy to hold.  Pressure builds quickly (only 10-15 pumps needed) and the adjustable spray pattern and directional nozzle are a plus.  My only complaint lies in the handle; it feels a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the unit.  I haven't had any issues with it to affect performance, but wish the handle had a bit more structure to it.  In the end, this gets the job done, and does it well.  I used it for a natural weed killer, but you can use it for insect treatments, or pre-treating with various cleaners on siding, windows, wheels, tires, and so on.

2232	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I heat with wood and needed another replacement handle for my axe, so I decided to look at this instead. After using a 36" handle I wondered how I would like the shorter length, but I knew that I'd be happy with the Estwing design as I've used their hammers for many years. I've now had it for a few days and am using it to split wood into kindling. I am amazed at how nice this axe is, the quality of the materials and build, and how comfortable and well balanced it feels. The steel looks beautiful, the finish is perfect. It really makes the chore much easier than with my old wood-handled axe. Money well spent- and reinvested in the USA (except for the Haitian-assembled sheath).
6994	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The people promoting this trap are full of S***! and probably Victor employees. Moles just go around this and it sits there,untouched.

I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = "far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).
It is pretty easy to clean, but it would be nice if the base separated into two pieces for more thorough cleaning.

7435	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this grill to take with me to the beach.  I lit it on a deck floor and had no issues with wood deck getting too hot (I did put a large aluminum pan under the grill to catch any drippings, though nothing dripped out).  It took a while to light since the lighter was acting a bit odd, but once I got it going it worked nicely.  This grill does not do well in the wind (but weber warns you about that).  The flavorizer cooks food nicely, though there is definately a hot spot on this grill (the side opposite the propane canister).  This grill is very portable and it packs up/travels nicely.  It was a bit difficult finding propane canisters at a variety of stores since I was looking in the camping aisle.  Aparently the smaller propane tanks are in the "blowtorch" section.

4880	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is "too big", bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each "section" of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.
3870	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Have used the past month~Live on a pond and have all kinds of flying bugs and mosquitos since we have 100 hanging back deck lights that stay on most of night~Seems like this Zapper unit has greatly reduced that mosquito & flying insect population. Am very happy with it. I have it hooked to a Wuuds 32555WD Weatherproof Outdoor Outlet Remote Control Kit. Deck lights are also hooked to another Woods Remote Control. It's nice being able to control both from inside the house.

The Amazon description calls this a "lightweight" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).
1000	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love these sprinklers. The only thing I don't like is that the small button on the underside is meant to shut off the water when it reaches the ramp. It is plastic and sometimes breaks. You have to replace the whole motor instead of being able to replace just that part. The motor is costly and it requires a bit more mechanical skill than I have to replace.  It is not hard to replace if you have the right tools but I don't have the right tools....
So when you irreparably broke this summer after a triumphant life of service, I brushed back a tear and went seeking your replacement.  Certainly, through the power and wonder of Chinese manufacturing and modern engineering, I should be able to acquire a simple, better-powered electric edger in the neighborhood of $40.  Forward!
2640	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Appears to exactly match the Rain Bird head I bought probably 30 plus years ago. Looks and works perfectly. The old one was getting a bit worn (but would still be fine if I knew where to buy some parts). I'm very happy their quality and materials have held up after so long. It's so rare nowadays.
- Others have noted the lack of a hinge on the lid. This indeed can be a hassle, especially if you don't have anywhere to sit a hot, very greasy lid while you arrange food, etc.
8444	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have cats, and cats have fleas.  This is a great solution.  The lights attract the fleas, and the traps keep them.  They are sticky, and the fleas are trapped.  All I have to do is change the discs when they get full.  Have used them for several years now and they work great.  I highly recommend.  They are a lot cheaper than an exterminator having to come every other month!!

The black hose with the gold stripe appears to be a decent moderate quality homeowner grade hose. I have no issues, I unraveled the hose and left it in the sun for a day straight to help with kinks.
8002	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We bought this primarily for car camping to replace an old hibatchi.  It packages securely and compactly with the legs rotated over the lid and snapped into place.  It can be packed soon after use.  Just close the air vents and the fire dies.  The metal cools quickly and the unit can be packed away within 10-minutes of shutdown.  My only complaint is that the handles don't fold or remove to make it even easier to pack.

8481	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We have experienced the worst flea season this year that I can recall in my 83 years. We have about overcome them by using multiple treatments. These flea traps are unlikely to free your home of a bad infestation as we have had. However, they do kill many fleas and in addition to that, they are a perfect gauge to let you know how much progress you are making. If you have a bad infestation you will see dozens of fleas trapped on the sticky surface. If you only find one or two every few days, you know you are making progress. Beside this, they make an excellent night lite.
Overall, not a bad portable grill at all.
Live and learn.

*Very dangerous for young children. This is my biggest complaint and the main one for removing a star. Don't get me wrong; all grills are dangerous for young children, and you should never leave them around a grill that's in use unattended. BUT, my last grill was covered in plastic guards all around it so I could cook without worrying if any kids were beside me. With this Weber I have to keep half my focus on the children because if any of them come too close they could get burned by the scolding hot base. Even after I'm done cooking and everything has been put away and the coals have burned out, this thing stays hot for hours. My daughter, of course, wants to be where I am, and do what I'm doing, so we've had several crying fits because I had to keep her far away. And then when the meal is done and the kids want to run in the yard and play I have to find a safe hideaway for it or stand guard around it. This has become a major problem recently.
2983	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is my third Black&Decker electric lawn edger...each previous one lasted about 4 yrs and I've been told that's about average.  Researched other brands of electric edgers but always come back to this one.  I like this one best--this new model is an improvement over the last one...seems to be more powerful and easier to maneuver.  I'm a 70 yr old female & still mow/edge my lawn here in central Florida.  Edging is a necessity for a nice looking landscape and my property has lots of sculpted areas that require edging.  Using this edger & a 100 ft electric cord, I have no problem taking care of it all and always get compliments from neighbors about my lawn.  Gave it only 4 stars because I wish these edgers would last longer.

Most of the cheap chicken wire sold at Lowes and HD (like this) contain lead. A dead giveaway is if it has a sticker on it saying that per California regulations, this is to inform you that this product contains a known carcinogen or something very close to that wording. However, if it doesn't have a sticker that does not mean it is lead free. Your best bet is to spend a couple more dollars and get chicken wire made in the USA and it is guaranteed lead free. Plus, keep that money in the USofA!
2624	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's heavy but it works better than the big box store sprayers. Pump it a few times and it allows you to spray until it is virtually empty. Really like that it comes with two nozzles.

809	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Gilmour hose is terrific.  It never forms kinks and is easy to coil on a hose holder when done watering.  The smooth surface does not get dirty and feels nice on your hands.  I have had one for two years and it looks brand new.  I am hoping to get years of service.  I now have 4 Gilmour hoses around the outside of my house.  The price from Amazon is much lower than the price at our local nursery stores.  Great value.
Their onslaught was merciless but the mighty Flowtron proved nothing to be trifled with. It laughed off their futile attempts at stinging, it relished in the chance to act as a battering ram again and again against their fortress, it gleefully issued issued forth a battering cry of "BbzzzzzZZAAATTT" as it put on a show for all of us mere mortals.

We have lots of flower beds and hedges with lots of mulch and the roach population living in the mulch was starting to make its way into the house.  We are talking those big outdoor roaches.  What I like about this sprayer is that it requires no premixing.  You set the dial for the number of tablespoons/gallon required and go to town.  It distributes the product very well.

After using the unit for a month, I purchased a cast iron grill grate from Craycort (Google it). This company makes custom fit cast iron grates for many Weber products. I love it (if you buy one, be sure to also buy the grate lifter-handle).
I've found that this mower is much less fatiguing to use than the gas mower.  It's lighter, doesn't vibrate, cuts well, and doesn't have the dull, droning roar of the gas mower.

While they are mostly ineffective against mosquitoes (octenol doesn't work in my region), it works great against other flying bugs that would have ultimately ended up around my porch light or flying into my backyard pool. I have this setup in the corner of my yard on an outdoor timer.

The only down side to this hose is the weight.  These puppies are heavy. I drag the hose from the bib down the ramp and onto the boat to rinse the motor, or across the docks to rinse the crab traps or shells off the docks from the birds.  The further you are away, the heavier it gets...

It Broke as a result of a poor mfg. technique. Well, 'It Leaks' (...is technically more accurate but what's the difference?)...where the shaft of the inner core mates with the larger ruberized part that screws onto the hose. They are two separate parts apparently press-fit together! And when presurized it leaks alot...not just drip, 2 seconds, drip..it has become a small trickle. Worse, the core (and ruberized adjusting jacket) now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray. To try and make this clearer, I can no longer grasp the long ruberized jacket and twist to adjust the spray, because it spins at the faulty juncture. So yeah, It Broke. Haven't even had it 4 months.

But it does zap the bugs. I see plenty of mosquitoes are killed and moths and a few yellow jackets.  Lots of spiders are taking up residence in and on the zapper and they catch bugs too.  Unfortunately good bugs are attracted and killed as well.

The mower came in defective. The company immediately sent me another and paid to have the original returned for inspection. Can't ask for more than this.
6240	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great little grill, anyone who has cooked on a Weber will love this smaller version. It;s great for cooking for 2 or 3 people and uses less charcoal and is easy to pick up and empty the ashes.

It easily cuts the edge around your curbed lawn and with little noise or fuss.  The only drawback to an electric appliance is, of course, the electric cord.  Get over that small learning curve and you are home free with an edger that works, is not noisy or troublesome, and lets you keep the wallet a little fatter.  My wife and I are very happy that we bought this edger and we both recommend it.

I have used this for years now and find it easy to use and it attracts the most hummers.  I love this product!

9720	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live in a townhouse and have limited space in my front yard.  I didn't want to get one of those big bulky hose reels to have on display on my front patio so I found this ames one and figured I would give it a try.
I used an in-lawn rain gauge and found that at slow speed it dropped ~5/8" of water and dropped ~3/8" of water at high speed settings.  I would water the lawn twice a week on slow speed when there was no rain for the week and once a week on high speed if we received ~1/2" of rain during the week (have a professional rain gauge out in yard).  I feel this is a pretty good drop since a good oscillating sprinkler takes about 1 hour to drop ~3/4" of water.

When I came back from vacation, all the trees were ok, with only 3-4 beetles per tree.  The bucket had thousands of dead beetles in it.  I will use this every year starting in mid June in Ohio.

The difference between the brass Rainbird and the Zinc Orbit was staggering.  The Orbit brand sprinkler was made of junk Chinese potmetal, whereas, the Rainbird had high quality brass fittings with bronze and stainless steel.  The Orbit model was based on a similar design, but taking the two apart revealed that the materials were not even close.  Even the washers on the male fitting were far superior on the Rainbird model.

2618	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This sprayer works wonderfully. I love that I only have to pump it up two separate times during a spray and it will continue to spray a fine mist. The handle extension is great for reaching and pulling the spray trigger is easier as you can squeeze grip it. The cannister comes with a plastic gadget holder to put the hose end and tips into so they don't get lost.

5146	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Bought it because someone reviewed that it caught a couple of snakes  YES!  but alas, no snakes yet.  The netting is thin, it sticks to itself when you curtain it about, but once it's in place, it works well. It will NOT keep deer out, if those guys want your stargazer lilies, they will get past this netting. Birds however, they don't dive for the strawberries any longer.  YES! So depending on what you need, it is pretty sturdy, very very thin, and almost invisible when hanged, birds will be like "what the" but deer will be like "hmm, another cobweb to carry in my antlers..."

1230	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I spent hours searching for a sprayer that could shoot far. I've tried every hose end dial sprayer there is, and before almost spending $250.00 on a commercial one (that I was pretty sure wouldn't shoot far) I bought this one. It is heavy duty and I'm so happy! You cannot let stuff sit in it and I wash it thourghly after each use. I am buying two more right now for my dad and father-in-law!
4088	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I tried a different brand with a black light. Took it back to a local lumber company/hardware store. It did not even attract bugs. This one us a bug-killing machine. Constant zapping all night long. I put it on a dawn to dusk timer and it literally zapped without stop. Not sure about how well it will work on mosquitoes as I live in Oklahoma and here you need Lurex3, not Octenol. I put the packet in anyway. Understand though, I did not buy it for mosquitoes. I have a "M-Magnet" for that. I bought this for the sole purpose of attracting the flying insects that plastered my window and door, to keep them away from it so I can enter and exit without hearing the ball and chain complain that I let bugs in. This worked so well that I kept the patio light on, sat on the patio for two full hours last night, and did not have one bug buzz me. I would buy it again!
4412	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Had this for over 2 years now and haven't had any issues with it so far.  It works great as long as you don't let the grass grow too tall between cuts.  It's great for flat lawns and is easy to push.  It's a good way to get in some exercise too.  I can cut about 1000 sq ft in 45 minutes with this mower.  That is making two passes, first up and down then left and right.  Small twigs don't hold it up but bigger sticks will stop the reel.  I leave the clippings as mulch as long as the grass isn't too tall so there's really no clean up needed after mowing.  Haven't sharpened the blades yet and they are still sharp.  I wish I had gotten a wider model but this is still a great mower.

But imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered there really is no such thing as a simple "electric edger" anymore.  Nope.  They have to be combination edger/trenchers!  And heavy!  And expensive!  $100+!!!  But you will love it!  It will do everything for everyone!

I made the mistake of buying one that was 42" high and I just could not get in it because the sides were too high for me.  The ladder is shakey, virtually useless.  I even bought a $200 Confer heavy duty ladder but that was way too high and unsteady.  Then I couldn't find the stabilizing extension kit.  I wasted that money for sure.

You can't, but this will do. After the first few nights of using this bug zapper, I went out to check to see what it killed, 80-90% of the bugs killed were mosquitoes (that I can see). I'm sure there are many others that dropped onto the ground. It is not as loud as most people would like you believe about electric bug zappers. It sounds as loud as any of the birds in the trees make. I didn't even use the mosquitoes attractant that was provided and it still kill a bunch of mosquitoes.

- The mesh strainer at the bottom end of the siphon tube is very fine and appears to be best suited for liquid only content. I would advice against any content that is too thick (fairly high viscosity) or has residue (powdery mix) to avoid clogging.
2986	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this edger / trencher because I had an invisible pet fence to install. I figured out that buying this wouldn't be much more than renting one for a day at the big box store. It worked like a charm. I roughly 2 hours I trenched a line around my property the size of about one acre. It never stalled, overheated or anything. It worked through the small stones found under most grass yards. What I really like the most about it was that it trenches a very neat and clean cut about 3 inches deep. When I ran the line in the trench and just used my hands to pinch the trench shut, the yard looked like nothing was ever done to it. Very nice. Now I have it to clean up the garden bed edges occasionally to give my yard the look of a professional landscaping service. It adjusts to fit your height, so if you find yourself leaning just a bit, take your time to adjust the tool. It's worth your back not straining the whole time. I plan on using it this fall to draw lines in my beds to plant rows of small spring bulbs easily.
These are adequate. Less wonderful than I'd expect for the brand. If they were a "brand X" then I'd have been thrilled (but I would have paid a third less).

2820	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I am probably among the last to applaud the benefits of this product. It flows water and/or fertilizer to the roots and is especially beneficial when I see a tree or shrub wilting from the heat. I have one that is probably 20 years old. The water flow is very strong. Since I now have a half acre lot, I thought I would order another. The current version pales by comparison. It is shorter length and the water flow is weak. Materials are poorer as well.
This may sound like I'm going to a lot of trouble, but I'm not. Pay the extra $10 for the Gold once, and if you store it under cover it will last for.... I don't know; mine is 10 years old. I replaced the cooking grate because my wife said the original one no longer looked good, although I personally had no problem with it. This is the same with either grill; in fact, cooking grate replacement was the reason I gave up Silver, which I first but had really stopped using in favor of the Gold. $10 one time. Raised grill piece was another one-time thing, maybe 8 years ago. Still works fine. Learning how to adjust the vents and place charcoal, another one-time thing. Once you figure it out, you're good to go about forever, no additional thinking required.

I did have to go over some areas twice, but I had to do that with my power rotary mower also. My lawn is completely bordered by brick and cement and it leaves about 4" of uncut grass against all of the borders; so investing in a good trimmer is a must. And as other reviewers have stated, it will get hung up on debris in your yard, but it's not a big deal for me as I keep my grass short and clean.
Edited to add:  The stink definitely gets worse.  I ended up buying three more of these and have cleaned out the first one once.  I dry-heaved the entire time. I don't consider myself much of a baby for these things, but that was rather horrible smelling. I don't think this is a negative, as it is what attracts flies... just wanted to properly warn ppl who may have small yards.

So I went back to Apex for this 8509  - which is far from heavy duty in my experience.

Other reviews are right on the results of the mowing. You have to go back and forth on certain areas. The overall look is not as great as that after a gas mower. After a fews days, they all look the same anyway. But look at the bright side, you don't have to mess with gas, smell the fume. No loud noise. Mow any time without waking up your neighbors. Also for a lawn mower of $99, it is very inexpensive. I will keep using it if my next home does not have a huge yard.

1957	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this to use on our hobby farm for watering livestock.  The hose itself is robust and relatively kink free - in fact all I would expect.  However we are returning it because of a worsening and persistent leak at the rotating connection between the female end on the faucet end of the hose and the hose itself. It started the first time we used the hose with just a few drops of leakage but now half fills a 5 gallon pail every day while we fill stock tanks. I am disappointed because I thought I was finally going to find a reliable 3/4 inch hose and while I think I am just unfortunate to have got one with a faulty fitting, I am going to try a different hose next time.
8922	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We purchased this trap along with the similar Eaton trap; they are almost identically built.  The plus for the Eaton is that it has a clear plastic window in the lid so that you can easily see if you've caught a mouse (although you can usually hear them first).  The Tin Cat, however, is a bit sturdier.  We caught several mice in each trap; both traps are easy to open for release and easy to clean.  BUT...the mice quickly learn how to get out as easily a they get in!  My husband made a minor adjustment to the openings, and we then caught and released several more mice who apparently could not get out.  We haven't caught one in two nights, so I'm hoping they're gone!  I recommend the Tin Cat for humanely getting the mice out of your house, garage, etc.  **I would ask both companies (Victor and Eaton) to refrain from suggesting the additional use of glue strips or drowning...that's very cruel.

EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow "bee guards." Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these "bee guards" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.

November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.

3956	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Grass Gator products are durable, well designed, and work as advertised. This attachment is no exception.

The device cut everything down without any problems.
9464	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this model to replace a much earlier model that I have used for about 15 years. The old zapper finally burned up the transformer and I ordered and put this new model into operation. This unit has 2 40 watt tube style bulbs and has even better coverage than the old unit and has much more insect stopping electric power. I am very pleased with this machine and would recommend this unit to anyone needing a good ,powerful, insect killer. If this unit lasts as long as the first unit, it will be well worth the money and is a fair priced unit. I have no complaints about this unit. If you need a bug zapper, try this unit.

The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on.  I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method.  The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.

So I've got to stay on top of my yard if I don't want a "nasty-gram" from the lady who drives around and makes sure that all the grass is mowed and the shutters are painted.  The B&D Edgehog and the replacement blades are a breeze to use.  I've got about 200ft or so of paved surface to edge and I do it every other week during the mowing season (which in this part of georgia is from march to october basically).  I have only had the edger for about 7 weeks and used it 3 times.  Each time it performed really well. I did a test run of taking off the blade and replacing it as if it was this replacement blade that I ordered (but don't yet need to install as the original is still plenty sharp).

 So to accommodate so many birds I bought three more feeders. I washed the new feeders with soap & water, and filled as usual. The birds would barely touch the new ones. I thought "wow the plastic smells & tastes too strong".

They're tearing up my lawn!!!
857	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	You can't set it down without it leaking your herbicide all over itself. It turns and twists so you can't really control it as much as you'd like. It doesn't really disperse well, it sprays water to the sides and the middle of the spray seems to contain most of the herbicide, so it doesn't really mix it into the stream well. Pain in the butt to get the hose off and on, it should contain a swivel at the base of the connection.
UPDATE:  We did return this item.  Last week I stopped in at the local Cooperative to get some seed potatoes, and I saw some Earthway spreaders assembled for sale and on display there.  I think what they had assembled was a lower priced model.  Even that one had the axles off centered, so that issue, apparently, is a design flaw and not just an issue of poor QC.  That being said, the one on display at the cooperative was not nearly as off centered as the garbage that we sent back.  Ours had the axle way up in the housing of the plastic wheel.  The one on display at the local cooperative at least had the axle extending to the edge of the wheel.  These just have issues, and I suspect, as I stated above, that these, although are supposed to be made in the USA, are probably just assembled here by foreign made parts.  That is just an observation on my part, but given my experience, I hope that is what is wrong with this product, else the USA is worse off than even I thought.

5304	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have used this type of product many,many times.  It is almost invisible, which can be good or bad.  We have had a few birds and squirrels run into it, sometimes getting caught, and sometimes bouncing off (seriously!).  It is not as strong as a metal fence, of course and if you run into it while walking past with a board or something it's going to rip.  Still, at six feet tall, it provided an adequate fence for my garden that kept out the deer. I don't think it would keep the local bear out if he was determined enough, but then you never know.  It also worked as a one-use pea vine support.  It ripped when I pulled the weeds I should never have allowed to get that big.  As an affordable, easy-to-use way to fence things, it's very good.  i will be using more this week, because my daughter's puppy has decided to use the soft dirt near my rhubarb plants to dig to China.  He is easily discouraged, so I think four posts and a length of this netting will do the job.  The affordable price certainly helped, as we have been moving into a new house (to us) and there are a lot of expenses.

*The vent is metal. This might seem absurd since I complained earlier that the plastic was getting hot, but the lip on the top vent doesn't even have that much. I open and close the vent several times while cooking (depending on the food of course). With no guard on the lip you have to be cautious or you'll burn yourself. I guess I should just accept that everything with this grill requires an oven-mit.

7454	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This small portable gas grill is the perfect complement to my full size Weber Performer.  There are many occasions in which I just want to grill something like chicken thighs, hamburgers, bratwurst, korean short ribs, steak fajitas, portabello mushrooms, grilled vegetables, or salmon just for the two of us.  With the Go-Anywhere, you can quickly prepare these dishes with almost as good a result as with the large Weber.  Other things like turkeys, pork ribs, briskets, rack of lamb, or roasts are better done in the larger Weber.  I have been using my Go-Anywhere this way until I discovered it has finally deteriorated to the point that I need to replace it.  I can't complain because this grill has lasted me over 20 years!!  The only thing I have had to replace during that time is the Flavorizor Bar.  I've had to replace it three times over those years.
The perches are ideally suited for watching the little critters through a window.  Feeders with 3 perches put one perch in a spot that is invisible from inside your house, and the birds will NATURALLY pick that perch - cuz they can't see YOU either!  Also, no matter how many perches you have, you will only EVER have ONE humming bird at a time on your feeder.  The little boogers are SO territorial that they will NOT feed until they have chased any OTHER birds away!
The spray pattern is more pronounced side-to-side and does not spray as advertised on the Rainbird website on their spec sheet.  The Rainbird specs show more of an even rectangular pattern, extending wide on either side and to the front of the spray head.  Instead, the spray is concentrated more side-to-side, with little coverage immediately in front of or angled in either direction off center from the head (and minimal spray behind the head which does match the Rainbird specs).  This makes the spray excellent when mounted at the rear of straight garden beds, as long as additional heads of this kind are overlapping on either side to fill in the gaps.  This is probably the design intent anyway, but it would be clearer if the spray pattern showed more of a modified square pattern vs. the solid rectangle which may be interpreted as applying even coverage of the square without additional heads to overlap the coverage.

8090	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The refill works very well.  Whatever insects that land on it will be stuck permanently, unable to escape.  I used up my original sticker that came with the Victor flea trap and am now using refill.
212	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is a quality spreader but its a 2 hour process to put this thing together. Two bandaids plus some aggravation and it was done. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if they had just partially assembled it and put it into a slightly larger box.

3952	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered two of these and they arrived yesterday. One was already cracked and had a big chunk of plastic missing in the center area of the saucer. I chose to return both of these. I have big heavy 14"-16" planters and these were not what I thought I would be getting in the way of 'rock hard' thick plastic saucers. Even had one not been damaged, I would have been disappointed. This is one of the items I will have to go to Lowe's or Home Depot to get so that I'll know what I'm getting. I based my purchase on the reviews and this time it didn't work out. I worked in the nursery industry all my life-most of that as a grower of bedding plants. I do know quality plastic. These may say that they are 5X thicker than others but they are still flimsy.

9445	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Although the pool has a cage, which keeps out most mosquitoes, the no-see-ums (sand flies) are small enough to squeeze through on occasion, and opening and closing pool cage doors lets in some insects.

At least you can order all breakable parts. Recommend! *******Update 17 April 2017  Well the gear box went out today on my sprinkler. just quit spinning while it was working great. Had an old onr from my son in law gave me that was ten years old that the wheels were falling apart on so was plenty used. Took out the transmission and put in back in mine and its running great again. Am still happy with it but suspect thats a weak spot on the newer ones like mine.
7814	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Cheap quality.  Isn't even those that is pictured.  Hose that was received was folded in half and very very cheap materials.  Would not recommend
That means 5pm-9am on one side and 7pm-10am on the other side for me.

It pains me as a Fiskars brand enthusiast to give a 1-star rating, but honestly, these are probably some of the worst pruners I have ever used. They're not sharp, they're not well made, they're not well engineered, they're not durable, the locking mechanism is poorly designed and executed, the ergonomics are nonexistent and the tool simply does not work for its intended purpose. This incredibly typical of made-in-China garbage riding on what used to be a high quality brand name. It's a shame that Fiskars sold out. I would not recommend this product at all, and certainly not at this price point. You're paying for a name that no longer has any connection the level of quality in the product. It's just import junk like everything else now.
Inexpensive, easy to clean, will last 2 - 3 seasons.

9827	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Have one of these to replace an older model.  If you are on the short side this does not work well.  The grip is on the wrong place and my old one did not have that funky angle.  My old one was like a golf putter and you could easily swing with one arm.  This one is harder to grip and ..again.. Unless you are taller, can hit the target in an awkward way.  Why can't they make an adjustable handle???
1281	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This sprinkler is wonderful for big yards that are too expensive for installing automatic sprinklers.  You do not have to move sprinklers around to get every area - this thing does it for you.  Works great.

TIP:  Watch every YouTube video you can find regarding its use and take what you can from each of them as they all have various tips and tricks that you'll find helpful.  Keep in mind:  No trap will work every time as you're dealing with an unpredictable living rodent.  The more you use it, the better you will become at its placement and subsequent results.  BEWARE:  This trap is vicious and will break your finger if you give it the opportunity to do so.  I am not exaggerating this point.  There is a 'lock' on the top of it that you flip into place after you set it.  Use that or you may break a finger during placement.  And, DON'T forget to 'unlock' it when you have it in the ground.  It's easy to to do.
4714	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've owned several over many years and many houses and always buy this unit for each new place. Now with 2 acres of southern woods I put in 2 and will add another for the lighting as much as the bug killing. I put on electric eye plug ins so they only run at night which saves the bulbs and electric.
- Light can be replaced easily.
Just bought another. Not because the first one failed, but because I wanted a second before the price went up anymore:) I have actually found this to be very effective with all herbacides. Solid , quality product!

It seems very sturdy and very well made. It weighs the perfect amount (hasn't been blown over even in this horrible weather with gusts of wind in excess of 100mph, and yet it's still light enough for me to lift and carry as I see fit). The ash catcher is large enough to accommodate 3-4 loads before needing emptied. The propellers above the catcher are perfect for allowing air to vent for the fire (or to kill it) and they also move the ash into the catcher very efficiently. The grill part (where you put the meat) has two folding sides that you can lift to add things to the fire while you're cooking and without needing to lift the entire grate off. Lastly, assembly was a breeze (well, for my wife. She put it together with the help of my 19 month-old daughter in 10 minutes while I did some yard work).

I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address. This is what happens when you outsource your manufacturing to other countries like China.
5609	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	horrible to work with. Too thin to be useful. When it's not tangling and snagging on everything, it's ripping and tearing. Waste of money.

4262	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This mower has done all I ask of it.  It leaves behind a beautifully groomed lawn whilst being quiet and non-polluting.  Having said that there are a couple of things of which potential purchasers should be aware.  There are probably more sturdily built mowers available but the price offsets this.  Also, the American Lawn Mower Company has these machines built in China.  If you have a small lawn and you don't let the grass grow too long this machine should meet your needs and give you some exercise.
Included with the unit directions is how to repair the air pump and the pump diaphragm. This part of the unit seems to be quite complicated and I hope to never have to do this. This would also be a slight concern for me.
9539	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Easy to set-up but it leaks internally.  It's going back.  My old Ames seemed to be built better than this one.
0. USE DISPOSABLE VINYL GLOVES WHEN HANDLING THE LIVE TRAPS. Seriously, you have to do this to protect yourself and your family. Hantavirus and other infections can result from exposure to mouse droppings and urine. Most people who are exposed to the virus have come in contact with rodent droppings in their own homes. Let's not get sick because we choose to not vaporize mice who are trying to cohabitate with us.
4751	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	OK, It's a replacement Chain Saw Blade. It works extremely well and lasts a long time if you keep it out of the dirt. Now-a-days, it is cheaper to have new ones on hand as sharpening old blades costs the same or more than a new blade for the non-commercial user.
9306	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This works great. I had the previous version which had small openings for the insects to get in, but that issue was fixed in this version. It would be nice to have some sort of control built into this (timer, switch, light sensor and etc.)
9689	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is a good system at a good price.  Each section is programmed to start by time of day.  Each section can be programmed to run multiple times each day.  There are a lot of good features.  I would recommend this controller, but it does have some limitations.
1218	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It runs on its own and you do not have to go out and change it to different areas.  Just place it on the hose and it goes until it runs out of hose and then it shuts itself off.  I could not have been more pleased with the product.  It was so pleasing a few others in the neighborhood bought one similiar to mine.
Overall, I'm fairly please with this axe and in spite of the thin blade profile that can cause binding in the wood when trying to split, I think this makes an excellent camp axe. As mentioned, this is far too thin to do any serious splitting of logs but for light to medium duty or campsite duty this will certainly split small enough logs to get a good fire going. I had the Estwing E24A hatchet which is also another high quality chopping tool; however, more often than not I've had a hard time repeating accurate strikes with a hatchet. The length and shape of this axe makes accurate strikes much easier. So because of that and the fact that you can strike harder with two hands using this axe, I prefer this tool as a camp axe over a hatchet. The best thing this axe has going for it is the size and weight. If your use is to chop wood and you DON'T need a light, thin, compact axe you might get a bit better service out of a good quality axe with wider head than this one.
658	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me

6475	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Use them to control chipmunks invading my crawl space. These and peanut butter work like a charm and are much cheaper than they are at home improvement stores.

6714	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	When I bought this I though that the bottom would open so that I could clean it.  It doesn't.  There is no hook on top, just a wire that you need to twist into a loop, which doesn't seem secure.  I would not buy it again.

You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.
This grilling turner lives up to the OXO name. It easily fits on the top rack of the dishwasher, and comes clean each time. We grill several times a week during the summer, and this item is perfect for our needs.

2669	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I received this yesterday and used it last night.  I mounted it on the Orbit metal ring sprinkler base #58030. The sprinkler worked just fine.  I ran it for about 2 1/2 hours and put down about 1 inch of water.  I was happy with this amount of water in that period of time based on all my many past and different types of sprinklers I've had over the 35 years.  I can't imagine this sprinkler not working for many many many years.  My last one lasted about 30 years. No joke!  Actually had two of them.  A metal like this one and a plastic.  The plastic one last about 20 years.  I do not leave them out in the sun however and may be the reason they lasted for so long.  I refer the metal one as it's more versatile.  It'll do what the plastic one does meaning it'll spread out a good amount of water for about 15-20 feet plus it'll allow you to water beyond that range for another 10 -15 feet.  The only time I'd buy a plastic again is if I only wanted to water a small area.

3670	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Don't keep it in a place where condensation will promote corrosion of the teeth.  Even a little dull and it doesn't cut well at all.

The new, 14 inch with the red handle is a better choice.
2325	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got this to spray febreeze. The pumps the bottle comes with can get tiresome to keep spraying over a large area. So I tried this. AWESOME.

I'd recommend using this sprayer for febreeze and any other household spray cleaner
7057	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got 2 moles finally! These work well, they are the only traps I have ever tried. I watched some YouTube videos on how to set them and some tips that were helpful. These are difficult to set initially. They are very tight and I had to use a couple pair of pliers to get them set instead of the supplied setting rods. The upside is they they are powerful when snapped. Each time they went off, I got a mole.

To mitigate tangling problems with any hose, I suggest using 50' lengths and LR Nelson's Brass Quick Connectors (I also gave 5 stars).  Further,  I discourage tugging on a hose to get to that "last flowerbed."  An extra section of hose is much cheaper than what the plumber is going to charge to replace broken hose bib pipes.  I always leave a little loop of hose next to the bib and won't allow myself to pull hard enough to remove the loop.

7913	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The nice feature about this grill is that it folds up and locks closed.  Transports without making a mess.

7191	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This mole trap requires you to dig out part of the tunnel to align the jaws of the trap with the mole's tunnel and then you have to carefully cover part of them back up. That is the first type of trap that I bought and I'm sorry to have to say that I have never caught a mole with it yet (watched several YouTubes on how to set it). After using that type of trap for almost two weeks with no results (changed location every day to active tunnels and got really good at setting it), I purchased two of the Victor Plunger Style Mole Traps. The very first day after getting the plunger style traps I caught two moles with the plunger traps and one more mole the second day with the plunger trap (I was still using this Out O'Sight trap but still with no results). You don't dig out the tunnel to set the plunger style and they are easy to set and put into play. But there is one thing that you need to watch out for when using the plunger style trap. I read this in some other reviews and sure enough, it saved me from losing a mole. It is not unusual for only one of the spikes of the plunger trap to barely pierce the mole and not kill them. If you pull up the trap after it has sprung to see what you have caught, you will pull the spike(s) out of the mole and if he is still alive, he will scurry away through his tunnel. So, what you have to do is take a garden trowel, or something similar, and before moving the trap, dig out the area around the spikes to see what is going on.

4164	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My husband sold our gas mower when we hired a lawn service.  I got rid of the lawn service when we replaced our backyard lawn with a deck, but I still have a small, shady front lawn that needs care.  I don't like the noise and smells of gas mowers, so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's wonderful!  It arrived in three days and my 12 year old put it together in ten minutes.  My 9 year old immediately used it to mow the overgrown front lawn, which took him less than five minutes.  The mower is small and easy to maneuver and the blades are sharp and efficient.  I was even able to trim the edges of the lawn easily.  This is a simple, inexpensive, quick, and very effective replacement for a heavy, noisy, smelly gas mower.  Highly recommended!
btw, i use cheap aluminum round cake pans in the ash catcher - works better than an expensive model upgrade to catch and remove waste charcoal

3637	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I replaced the horrible factory head on an inexpensive Homelite with one of these and it works great. Using it with four lines on a low powered trimmer is okay but it's slow to spin up when you press the throttle. I also had to place an extra washer under the head (only one was supplied) to keep it from wobbling on the Homelite. The heavier line does a good job and barely shows wear compared to the original. I've only had it for a short time so it remains to be seen how well it will hold up.

Advice to the manufacturer:
So here's the deal - this Edge Hog basically works right out of the box. It does cut into the lawn to produce a crisp edge. If that's what you're looking for, this is the machine you need. Just don't make the mistake I made of ordering the Edge Hog when you really need a grass clipper.

The next morning I checked it out, and I can say this to all the bugs cruising around my backyard:  If you fly, you DIE!!"  I just ordered a timer for it, so I will probably run it from about 5:00 pm until 8:00 am, although I am sure it would still be zapping a few more during the day,  Great product so far!

1275	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	If you buy any Solo sprayer, you should also stock up on pump rebuild kits and be ready to spend an hour or so installing one every year from now through eternity. We bought one a few years ago, it lasted one season, then a different model (piston) and that lasted one season. The rebuild kits run $15-22 each. Seriously, either have one on hand or be ready to have your pump not work when you need it. They are fairly easy to take apart if you are handy with a hex driver & screwdriver... but they really need to use better quality rubber or silicone so they will last longer. But then they won't make so much profit on the rebuild kits!
1740	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I was swayed by the reviews.  I am really disappointed with this product.  It is not made of hardened steel.

It really does do a great job of cooking, as good as the larger  Webers, just for a smaller crowd.  We had a Mulberry tree trimmed in our  yard and I saved all the chipped up wood to use for smoke flavoring.

3991	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I carefully tested two identical hoses, and they both failed miserably.  In the range of 15-20 PSI the flow rate is absurdly low, and parts of the hose that are in the sun warm up enough that the hose softens, expands, and lets lots of water out at that place.  At higher pressure (40 PSI) more water comes out of the soft spot(s) and most of the rest of the hose still barely lets any water out.

We have a hundred feet of outdoor electrical cord. Never came close to running over the cord, just have to keep flipping it from one side or the other,depending on the direction your going in. Lots of power for edging and deeper edging if you like and the lowest level has been great for taking up sod for planting gardens and  use it to keep our property sharp looking.

The Smokey Joe Gold is for our RV.  It fits in the storage compartment and if it tips over it doesn't create a big mess.

As with all of this type of sprinkler they do corrode on the inner shaft and require some WD40 occasionally.

My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.

I held back one star as I can't speak to durability but I have very high hopes for them - not much could go wrong with such a simple tool. Just need to keep them clean, oiled and sharp.

5000	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	When I received this bracket one of the welds that held the knee brace in place wasn't holding anything. I drilled a hole and bolted it together. I purchased the Flowtron Diplomat which is a large bug zapper and this would never have supported it the way it arrived. The tiny little screws they supply to mount the bracket would never do the job in any surface so I drilled out the holes so larger mounting screws could be used.

Happy watering.
4871	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Going to use these for two projects with the sun blocking screen material not coolaroo cloth but the finer mesh that they make blinds inside and outside to block heat and sun in several weights. I also removed coolaroo from some outdoor blinds we liked and replaced with the see through screens last year. So now have the coolaroo cloth to do something with. If there's some of these left over I intend to use these to help hang the pieces over a back 20 foot long covered patio to help cut down the heat that afternoon sun builds up there. We noticed a umbrella kept the heat out when we used it one summer but don't care for the trouble the umbrella is to keep upright with any gusts of wind etc. So being able to hang the coolaroo fabric and or some of the other screen material may just do the trick. I checked the clips out and they well support and close on the fabrics just fine.

4066	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to make a cage for my wife's tomatoes and to make framed wall hangings for my son's teacher as a first-of-the-year gift.  I've bought "chicken wire" before, as I grew up on a ranch.  This has openings much larger than what I have come to expect from "chicken wire".  It doesn't seem to be as heavy gauge wire as "chicken wire" either.  It's easily bendable, so it's pretty easy to work with, however, because it's so tightly wound, it is tough to unroll at first.
5520	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Timely delivery, and was as expected.


*Nothing to hang the lid from. Why? Why couldn't they put it on a hinge so that I could pull it up like with my last grill? With this one I have to find a spot for the lid to rest. I mostly grill with the lid on so when it's time to add the coal, put the meat on, take it off, and other times, I have to find somewhere to rest the hot lid. Annoying.

2344	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Purchased two of these feeders.  Holds alot of seeds. The reason I purchased it was because it is plastic and it looks nice.  We live in PA and we get some bad winter weather and gusty winds and did not want to buy a wood one that would eventually rot from the elements.  The only draw back is that there are holes in the plastic where the three perches go for the birds to stand on, they were too small and my husband had to drill larger holes, which was not a big deal at all.


Cons:  The only con is the inner diameter of the hose is on the smaller side so I don't get as much flow out of it as I do with the big hose I have in the backyard.  I mainly use this for watering the grass, landscaping, and washing my car so the reduced water flow really isn't a big deal because its not needed...... actually, I think because of it I actually SAVE money on washing my car because I use less water with this reel.

where there are easier pickings...except, when those juicy,red tomatoes
I haven't called the manufacturer for assistance yet. I think I'll t take another shot at stopping the leak and then call them. In the meantime, I am taking two stars off for leaking. If this big plastic wonder is meant for pros, then it is miscast because the pump housing area leaks and is likely too fragile. In fact, I'd rate it a two, except that it does actually spray really well while it is dripping poison on my shirt and leg.
3822	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I was hesitant buying this. The reviews did not give me great confidence. I have used this for two weeks and I am very satisfied with my purchase. The mower does not mow dandelions and some weeds, but it cuts the grass perfect.  It takes sometimes two or three swipes for some weeds, but does cut. Small sticks do jam the mower but pull back, tip, and mow. For the price, no complaints at all. I even went and cut some of the field next to my house. This is great exercise, and not difficult to use. I am 62 and had no problems pushing it and rather enjoyed cutting the grass. Using a reel mower gives you great exercise with out being strenuous, plus fresh air, and a satisfaction of doing something the old way not using gas or electric. My lawn is about 1/5 of an acre and had no issues. Be sure to take branches and rocks out first if you have those issues.
4279	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Not sure what to say. They are stakes, the merchant describes the coding for each length so you know what you are getting, which in this case are 3 foot stakes. They have a green dye coating them which rubs off onto your hands (or gloves), but i don't see as being harmful (although if somebody determines factually that they are, i would like to know)...otherwise, they stick in the ground and vines grow up their length. I did remove one star from the ranking because of their moderate lack of durability. You can bet on them snapping at some point. However, you'll probably make it through the majority of your growing season with most of them intact. I think twelve have broken as of now (presently Feb of 2012, 8 months after i wrote this initially).

2192	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The Purple Martins like this house, but it was a chore putting it all together. Since putting it up, the rails where the birds sit all have come off. They only pop into a hole. I will try putting them back in place and putting a small screw in the bottom to expand the piece that pops into the hole.
If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.
I don't know what it is about this grill, but I'm inclined to believe it's the shape and depth which cradle the charcoal and burn it thoroughly and evenly eliminating my previous nemesis which was cold spots and blazing hot spots.
Mostly we have music and talking and folks in the pool or the waterfall running...so we don't hear the zapping...but at times we do too.  Very big smiles come on all faces!

4523	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have a small yard, so I thought I'd try this instead of a gas mower.  I have to say, mowing the lawn with this is actually kind of fun!  It's so peaceful to not have the noise and fumes and dust. Also, I figure just being able to grab this from the shed is much easier than it would be to deal with trying to start a gas mower. I don't think sticks really pose a big problem.  The smallest ones get cut up as you go, or you just run over them and they stay on the ground.  Occasionally, I'd hit one that'd stop me a little, but then I just back up, kick the stick out of the way, and go on.  My guess is that most sticks that pose a problem for this mower would not be good for your gas mower either--or they'd get thrown into a window or something.  Also, remember, if you move a stick out of the way of your gas mower, you have to re-start the stupid thing.  This you just move the stick and keep going.  I don't know how well I'd like this if I had a large yard, but I quite recommend it for medium to small yards!

I bought it and let me tell you, its one of the best purchases I have ever made!  No more dragging hoses (except for set up-but I can do that in the daylight and turn the water on later), the "tractor" does all the dragging for me.  I water my entire front yard in one go--and since I live on a corner lot that means a turn is involved, the tractor handles the lazy curve no problem at all and pulls about 75' of hose with no sliding or digging. The auto shut off is an excellent feature too.  I love the variable speeds, I use "slow" and it takes about 3 hours to do 75 feet--a good, thorough soaking.  I also like the ability to twist the rotating sprinkler bars, I can control the height of the water spray ring with this.  The tractor is steel and I'm sure it will hold up well.  the wheels are plastic, but very solid with spikey grips on it that handle my rarely mowed grass with ease. Overall worth the price.  Do yourself a favor--stop dragging hoses and let this baby do it for you!  You won't be sorry....

There is another model with a clear lid, not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a "built in alarm" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.

Today, as i was placing the Ross root feeder /waterer at  one side of what had been a near-death avocado tree two months ago, i saw a ton of new leaves.  a TON.  i knew the Ross system was getting deep (you can tell) and all i could do was try.  today - the results.
The other thing is that the mosquitos seem to come all at once in a small window of time (~8:30 - 10:30), so we just set the zapper on a timer from 7:00 - 11:00.  After that we just seem to get moths.  Four hours of 40 watt bulb usage, plus whatever power the zapping itself uses, per day seems a lot cheaper to run than those propane-powered mosquito traps.  We'll have to see if we really need to change the octenol as often as recommended.  A new cartridge at $6 a pop every two weeks can add up.  So far it's been about 4 weeks and the zapper is still working great.

My biggest gripe, is the little red snap cap (on top of the squeeze handle) fell off.  Its just a pressed on piece of plastic and its a pain to put back on.  It broke off only after 4 uses.

Now the digger being reviewed here is just what I need.  It is relatively light and for the lighter work I use it for it is perfect.  I have occasions to plant a new shrub or tree, dig smallish holes in building my rock gardens and occasionally take a notion to put in more grape vines which require holes to plant the plant and place the polls for trellises.

6764	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have a Gilmour 3 gallon Model XP30 that I bought off Amazon in 2011, 5 years ago. Its the best sprayer I ever owned!  I bought the R58C handle kit because I lost the tip on the wand end, ordered a new copper wand, decided to go ahead and replace the valve handle. Its an exact match. It was a breeze to install. Here are a few tips:  The hardest part is the plastic sleeve that slides over the valve hose fitting. Be sure and pay close attention to which is the bigger of the holes on the sleeve;  I had to measure the holes with a tape measure just to make sure. The bigger end goes towards the valve head. I couldn't get it to slide on even with a pair of pliers. I rubbed some screw wax on the hose and it slid right on with no trouble. Vaseline would work as well. Last summer I noticed a few pin holes in the copper wand. I fixed this with some JB Weld. You can get this at any hardware or big box store. Just mix up a small dab and rub over the pin hole, let it dry 24 hours and it will be a good as new (maybe not as pretty!).  Another tip is to keep the pump assemble oiled. I failed to ever do this and last summer the O ring pulled off the pump piston. I was able to fix it after finally figuring out how to take it apart. I keep it oiled and it works better. On my sprayer there are 4 oil holes at the top of the pump. The oil helps prevent that ring from catching on the sides of the barrel and pulling off the piston. The product R58C kit works great.  Hopefully I can get 10 years out of this sprayer. Ill report back then and let you know if it made it!
The post hole digger here is not one that you would want for a major fence building project.  It is NOT a heavy duty tool.  The wood is pretty light and I have to tell you that when I first bought it the blades did need a bit of sharpening.  This was easily accomplished using a bench grinder.  I have had no problem with breakage or loosening of the handles.  I keep the thing clean after use and do not leave it out in the elements. (I have a feeling that this thing would not weather constant soaking and sunlight for several seasons like many of my garden tools have had to endure due to my absent mindedness.

However, when I set it up, I was quite pleased to see swarms of mosquitos flying around and into the zapper.  I'm not sure if it's really the light or the octenol scent attracting them, but they are indeed flying into the electric grid and getting zapped.  Perhaps the dominant subspecies of mosquitos in our heavily wooded area of New England is one that likes light.  We live right next to some swampy areas so it seems like there's a neverending supply of mosquitos, but this bug zapper is literally killing thousands of them every night.  I've got to believe that it's making some kind of dent in the local population right around our house.

It zaps LOUD!
1943	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased and used FLEXOGEN water hoses for over 12 years.  It is the best you can buy, does not kink and if you get the 3/4 inch size, it delivers all the h2o you can use.  Best of all, after eight years of use, one of my hoses malfunctioned (got torn at the end).  I send in the two end pieces of hose and received a brand new one gratis!  Cannot be beat.
6893	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice quality.  I use this to hone my scythe.
3759	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	As I see with many other reviews, the hose connected to the female plug comes off rather frequently.  I only just hooked mine up today (the day after it arrived) and it blew right out.  There are two half circle metal pieces that fit into each tube and then,once folded into a full circle should fit snugly into the female hose end.  It does.  And I was able to repair it myself with no tools or glue (but time I could have used more productively elsewhere).  It still leaks a little, but it's serviceable.  Also, the brass hose connector is very shallow.  It would not fit on my male piece which was plastic.  I eventually found a different hose end that it did fit on.  I thought about contacting the company, but surely by now, with all the negative reviews surrounding this particular defect, if they were interested in either quality control or customer service, I believe I would have seen responses in the review section.  If I missed those responses, forgive me.

After you make the cut, you need a shovel to clean up the area a bit. I found that on bigger projects, you could literally pull up the grass without much problem after using a shovel to ease up the sod. It sure beat trying to attempt the process with just a shovel or manual grass edger.
4321	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The spray wand seemed nice but unfortunately it didn't fit either of my sprayers so I had to return it. The return process went well so overall I'm satisfied.
I wore food handler gloves whenever handling the trap after a kill.  Found that smooth peanut butter on both the hinge and spring pan before setting the trap worked.  The trap was placed on my wooden fence on the cross supports where the rats were last seen.
5514	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Very light weight and cheaply constructed. It will work for about one season. If that's all you want, then go for it. If you are looking for a sprinkler hose that will last for years, this ain't it.
Older hoses will get some kinks as they age.
Of the three houses we purchased, there were exactly ZERO holes misaligned.  I think those who complained of this did not follow the basic rule of assembly which is to only finger-tighten the bolts until each sub-assembly is complete (it even says this in the instructions).  This allows the pieces to move around slightly so all the holes can be easily aligned.

2662	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Great Sprinkler Head! - But the over-spray out the sides and wherever would rot my wood House-Siding or wherever I put the lil Devil! - Perhaps it was just the unit I received but the sparay nozzle that screws into the center body was loose. So I turned it all the way into the threads and it was not working like it should and only sprayed a few feet out wards, etc. So I experimented a bit and found the spray nozzle head worked best if only turned in a few turns on the ole thread! - I immediately grabbed my thread sealing tape and thank God I had some and turned the head nozzle in a few twist and was more than tight than, and than the real event began! Hehe
5048	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this with my new mower, and it works just as I expected. It doesn't pick up every blade of grass that is cut, nor do I expect, or want it to. It does prevent me from having to rake by reducing the amount of clippings falling back into the yard, and still leaves some behind, which I'm told is good for the lawn.
Some people don't bother, but I just put on a pair of cheap plastic gloves to reset the trap (which may still have the bait in it if you use the lid as a bait tub).  I use the gloves to avoid fleas and hantavirus.  I don't know if that really helps, but it just seems smarter and less disgusting than using my bare hands.
3797	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We purchased these to use as a watering system in our long flower beds that run the length of our house, rather than install sprinkler heads.  My husband put timers on the faucets to come on every other day in the summer, less in the colder weather.  These sprinkler hoses work great.  Having tried the soaker hoses, my husband was worried that these wouldn't put out enough water; however, the plants are flourishing much better than with hand watering.  Much cheaper and much less work than installing the sprinkler head system, my husband will be placing these in the rest of our flower beds around the house.  Highly recommend for this purpose!
1104	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great product. Very sharp
9256	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	As I sit here listening to the sweet sounds of those menacing, miserable little flying  blood suckers being ZZZapped, I wanted to write a quick review.  I ordered this bug zapper because I was thoroughly disgusted being tormented by mosquitoes whenever I ventured into my backyard.  I've been doing extensive yard work over the last month or so and I have been bothered and bitten so much that I was desperate to find a solution.  I knew it would only get worse and worse as the summer progressed.  Early morning and evening ( really starting late afternoon) is of course the worst time.  Which coincidentally is the time gardening here in New Orleans is even remotely tolerable due to the heat and humidity.  I started carrying OFF spray with me and it helped....as long as I sprayed it as a shield around my body every 20 seconds, choking me and inhaling God knows what chemicals into my lungs.  I also rubbed all kinds of lotions over me that promise relief.  All of that helps but really it's just a band aid on a gunshot wound.  I wanted to try to eradicate the little suckers.  I came to Amazon looking for bug zappers.  I found this Flowtron with almost 2000 (!!) reviews with an average of almost 5 stars.  I ordered the one for 1/2 acre ( I just needed for my backyard which is about 50'x 150').  It came within a few days and I couldn't wait to plug the thing in.  It comes with one cartridge of Octenol and I stuck it the bottom of the zapper.  The instructions say not to place the zapper within 25 feet of human activity but we won't be outside much in the summer ( too hot and humid) so I ignored that instruction.  The cord is short so I used an extension cord and put it at the end corner of my patio on top of the BBQ pit.  It started zapping away at dusk and never stopped.  I couldn't wait to see the all the little corpses in the morning and I was not disappointed... I had nice little pile of dead bugs!  When we do brave the outside to the patio, I'll hang it from a shepherds hook out in the yard to avoid attracting the blood suckers near us.  Another benefit is that I don't have 50 bugs flying to my house as soon as I open my backdoor to let our 3 dogs out during the evening.  I unplug it in the morning and turn it on in the late afternoon.  I'm thinking I'll put a timer on it to make it easier.
5. When installing this blade, you should have a couple of options in terms of the cutting angle. Play around with what works for you, as the ergonomics of scything are pretty personal.

2018 - Ok... updating my review.  Awesome product.  Purchase a 100 ft hose with a lot of use and still going strong.  I now need to replace a 15 year hose and will buy this same product again.
5028	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The grass seems to pile up right around the roller instead of being tossed into the catcher.  Maybe that is inherent in the design of the reel mower though?
824	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's the best traveling sprinkler. Extremely strong!
3959	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this attatchment on my Echo 210 (highly recommend) for about three months.  It is without a doubt one of the the best tools I own.  I live in a semi-wetland with a lot of blackberries and comfry.
* Make the piston rod be accessible both top side and bottom side of the tractor.
2789	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Still working well for me.
This thing kills anything that comes near it!  And when paired with the Octenol patch (one tab included) it does a very good job of clearing the deck of remaining beasties.  You just have to remember that its not expected to do this 100%.  It attracts most insects by the UV, but mosquitoes need a smell to follow, like CO2 or your breath.  Thats why you need the Octenol, which mimics it.
Works great for spraying mold off my fence/house exterior and concrete walks.  Also for spraying fertilizer on plants.
6623	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My wife saw a large rat outside out house in AZ and we started hearing scratching on the roof. Then we found a nest near her car battery when she went in for an oil change. I didn't want the rat to start damaging stuff so we decided to get a trap and try to kill it. One morning I put 4 of these in my front yard and baited them with peanut butter. When I came home from work I checked my traps. The good news is I killed the rat. I also killed the cutest baby chipmunk I'd ever seen, a bird was nearly decapitated, and a giant squirrel had dragged the trap all over the yard before dying a terrible death. As a killing machine this trap gets 5 stars but I won't buy one ever again. I'm going to try to find a non-lethal trap the next time I want to get rid of a critter.

7972	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got a good one.. I wish it was black though. I'd buy it again.
4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.
9353	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The bulb on my old Flowtron Mosquito zapper went out, so I purchased this new one not knowing they also just sell the bulb for my old model, I believe.  Amazon doesn't say what model the Dark UV CFL is for so I have no way of knowing.  I didn't hear as many zapping sounds with this Flowtron as I did with my old Flowtron.  However, when I checked the zapper after a week, I did notice a lot of dead bugs, mosquitos, inside the octenol lures.  The light blue color UV CFL does not seem to be as effective as the old dark purple color UV CFL bulb.  I'm not sure if they are compatible with both models, I do not believe they are.  Overall, it works, but as good as the older model, eehh.

Like a kid with a new bike, he couldn't wait to assemble his new grill. It went together quickly and easily, with only a short delay occasioned by the installation of the ash collector. Shortly thereafter, he started cooking with charcoal and hasn't quit. Almost every night, he cooks chicken, hot dogs, steaks, hamburgers and more on his grill. The food is always evenly cooked and incredibly tasty.

6464	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Cheap and they work. But sometimes rats are smart. Placement is key.

From the start, I put a hanging feeder in the front yard on a shepherd's hook. On the patio window, I placed a Perky Pet Window Mount feeder.  From the living room, I can see both feeders.  There's almost always someone at one or the other, sometimes both.  Hummer fans will surely understand how special this is.

6889	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Took a few tries to learn how it works but now that I figured it out I kill each mole within about 1-2 days of first seeing the tunnel. The trick is to find a tunnels they will use again and then just press the trap down over it so when they come through again and push up .... SNAP! you have a dead mole. I've killed 4 moles with this in the past couple months. Just ordered a 2nd one to help with this mole infestation.
Good hose -happy
24	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For the Franklin lover. My Godson takes this thing everywhere. I may need to buy a few more as he is already in the process of destroying this one with his love.
4376	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	easy to use
7451	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I tried using this product for about a year with no success. I'm sure this works great in loamy lawns but I have plants, not grass, and live in suburban California, which means lots of clay! It is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay. For my particular situation, i've found the Cinch mole traps to be extremely effective - they worked in a week. I did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show, but if you don't have a nice soft lawn, there are better tools to catch moles with.
- If it does leak, there may be a missing o-ring washer.
All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!
903	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've had this sprayer for two seasons now and it is still performing beautifully.  I'm able to foliar spray my trees and shrubs easily.  I'm very religious about cleaning and drying it after each use.

3761	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have a 60 foot by 30 foot garden and three of these more then cover it. They stretch significantly. Very fair price and good quality.
To summarize the quirks:

7708	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great quality Webber product as usual. All my grilling and smoking products are charcoal webbers. Great product that will last a lifetime with proper use and care
1613	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I thought I reviewed sprayers thoroughly and knew what I wanted...I was wrong! This simple sprayer is nothing but a 70's throwback and no longer belongs in our current society of ingenuity and convenience! First and foremost...it hurts your hand after using it for just a few minutes! Second...the crappy little "hold-open" clip that allows you to continuously spray...just broke off after a few months! Overall...the design is just a fail as it's antiquated and severely lacking in performance. So...I'm not thrilled with my purchase of three of these items! If you don't want to acquire hand-fatigue...and if I had to do it all over again...I would spring for a Bon-Aire fire hose type nozzle (also here on Amazon).

519	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I am a senior citizen and use these clippers to cut back tall, thick decorative/fountain grasses. These plants are too thick to use electric trimmers; however, when I cut about an inch width at a time, I am able to do a nice job with these clippers.
The other reviews pretty much sum it up.
342	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I am completely finished with this company.  let me tell you why.  I bought two new 100' hoses from this manufacturer.  they both went the same way, developing a hissing leak between the brass female end (the end that attaches to the hose bib) and the brass compression fitting that attaches to the hose, in  less than a year.  I ALWAYS leave my hose nozzles open to prevent any bursting, and in any case, you would expect the rubber part of the hose to fail.  When the first one went, Gilmour was good to their warranty and offered to replace it, providing that I cut off both ends of the hose and send them back.  So in order to have a functional hose while I was waiting, I would need to buy not one, but two hose repair ends (male and female), as well as spending the time to buy them and make the repair, as well as the cost of sending them back.  OK, I did it for the first hose (about $12 out of my pocket, plus the time), and they sent me another.  A few months later, the second one developed exactly the same problem at exactly the same spot.  And yes, they will replace it, with the same conditions.  I'd rather be able to buy a hose and have it work.  The warranty doesn't help when I need to use a hose.  Never again with this company.

The best way to keep the critters out of the house is to seal up any openings where they can enter, and just as important, kill them while they around the outside of the house, especially if the house it adjacent to a woods.
6415	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Just as expected.
3130	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	With a corner lot and a lot of sidewalks I put this thing through some heavy duty edging.  I have also used the trenching feature to make a deep line for a new landscaping to then insert a spade and dig the trench.  Also used it to dig a trench to lay some wire for the electric fence on my garden.  It worked fine for that.  So I am a heavy user.  Unfortunately it stopped working after 20 months and so being the engineer I took it apart to try to fix (voiding warranty). Found the plugs/leads to the motor brushes were burned off.  Re-soldered them back on.  The contacts are probably burning off because when I jam it into a deep batch of grass (which is a lot of the time) it causes the motor to have to work harder and the amps on the motor to spike.  After fixing the unit it worked another couple of times and now burned out again. Contacted Black and Decker and they still replaced my edger under warranty which was super nice - because I really count on this product a lot in my yard care.
8746	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Put some peanut butter so the mouse could smell it.  Caught one mouse one night and then caught another mouse the next night.  Dropped them off about a mile away.  Hope they find each other.  I read that mice can't find their way back if you take them 3500 feet away so I figure a mile should be good.  Haven't seen any signs of mice now for a while.  Glad I got this, it has more room for the mouse than those little plastic humane traps.  I had one die in that kind and it wasn't in there very long.  This is much better.  The mice didn't seem as stressed as in those little ones.  This is a good humane trap.
4863	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These work great, trying to sharpen up a worn chain is obviously not one of my best talents. If you install this it is like you have a brand new chain saw.
6698	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This was suggested as a way of getting small game like squirrels in a survival scenario for those not familiar with hunting techniques.  The traps are huge, compared to the more familiar mousetraps of the same design.  Likely to kill the animals outright unlike glue traps.  Watch your fingers.
7970	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Mine was gray.  Perfect solution to hooking a sprinkler up inside a 15 foot garden so I could leave it in place and only roll up the 50 footer attached to it when I mow the lawn outside the garden.
3549	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The Edge Hog blade cuts through the thickest grass and weeds. So far I am still on my first blade that came with the Edge Hog. I bought this one for a replacement when needed but the original blade seems to be holding up well so far.

If you place any hose on concrete and run over it,  sooner or later,  it will fail.  I don't treat my stuff that way.

5645	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these at the lake house for 13 years of frequent use.  Then about 5 years ago one of the legs rusted off.  Right after that and as I was cranking up to buy a new one, I happened upon a pristine customer return on clearance at the local hardware store for $10.  Sold!  The unit is easy to store, uses sparing amounts of charcoal, and distributes heat well. VERY durable. I've cooked for an many as 25 people on this thing and routinely cook for 6 to 8.  I gave away my gas grill and hardly use my larger Weber charcoal grill.  This is as much grill as most people will ever need, it doesn't cost as much as a used car, and the food tastes better than gas-grilled. Great value!  Would also heartily recommend the Weber 7447 Compact Rapidfire Chimney Starter to go along with it.

So, I'm hardly an expert.  So, in preparation for Sandy, I took a reciprocating saw up a ladder to knock off  the top ~40' of dead tree before cutting it up into manageable bits with the chainsaw. With the new Oregon blade it was like a hot knife cutting through melted butter compared with the reciprocating saw which was more like trying to push a bread knife through hard cheese (don't know what's with the flowery metaphors---I made the twenty words long ago).  Heartily recommended.
From basic to complex, there are lots of programming options. Take a few minutes to read the instructions. Programming the new timer is easy.
9899	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I just got this hoe today and have only used it a little bit so I can't give it a perfect rating yet but so far, I love it!  I have small hands that aren't very strong and needed one like this to weed my flower beds.  I used to have a hoe like this that was made by Martha Stewart's company and sold by K-Mart but they haven't had them for years.  I wore that one out and wasn't able to fix it but I kept looking at warren hoes for a replacement but they are way too big and clunky for what I need.  This is the perfect size to fit between small delicate plants and it seems sturdy and like it will hold up.  TruTemper is a great brand!  I'll come back in a couple of months and give this a better rating if it measures up with lots of use.  But so far I'm very happy with it.  So much so that today I ordered another one!  Edit: After using this sweet little hoe, I'm loving it and have upped my review from 4 stars to 5 stars!  It's great and I'm so glad I got another one.

8634	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	This device might have some beneficial application for someone somewhere but not so much for me.  It is a very cheap plastic bowl with a small night light bulb that screws into the top.  Adhesive paper is placed inside.  Fleas are attracted to the light and the warmth.  The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.
A few notes: If you mount it off a wall the bugs will cover the wall as well. Also with the dogs, my 2yr old boxer runs over when it is zapping a big bug for a prolonged time. She just looks at it wondering what it is. Now the 7wk old puppies love it, because the love to eat bugs. The zapper has given them an all you can eat buffet. I am working on breaking them of that.

These are pole mounted and have baffles on the poles so the squirrels actually climb nearby shrubs and jump on them. We trim the shrubs back to keep them from getting on them.

Also Amazon just threw it in the box with two bricks of pellets, the bricks are basically, well . . . bricks, they bounced around, knocked out the end handle plug and broke off the tab.  Since this doesn't effect the function at all it was just an annoyance.  The last time I had something from amazon mis-labeled I spent a considerable amount of time on the phone with a gentleman from India that  gave me two stellar choices of A. return it, B. get ten percent back.  I explained that both of these were very inconvenient and I really just wanted what I ordered, I eventually got a better deal from his supervisor.  I decide it wasn't worth the effort this time, maybe next time if I have any doubt I'll just go to the store.

6636	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For years, I've been using a larger 22" weber grill, but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal.  After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.

In frustration I got up and shook the thing while a fly was investigating and managed to get it that way.  In 4 hours it's killed 1 housefly and no smaller flying insects at all.  My nerdie cousin attracts more babes than this does bugs.  The cord is ridiculously short, especially for something that claims to need to be 25' away from the action.  How is there going to be an available electrical outlet out in nowhere like that?  I'm  going to give it one more day and a new location & then it gets returned.
Cleaning a feeder is critically important, because bacteria grows in the sugar water you use, and it turns sour and won't attract hummingbirds.  You fight bacterial growth by boiling the feed when you mix it and by thoroughly cleaning the feeder with soap and hot water and wiping it well.

This is also not designed to be as powerful as gas powered mosquito and bug killers, and as stated above will not kill many mosquitoes as it is.  So if you're going to go with one of these bulb units, definitely round up in terms of power.
But what really cripples this auger are larger stones.  Get up to about 3" stones, and the blade of this auger will just keep scraping the top of them, never dig any further, and really never dislodge them, so you'll have to switch over to a shovel, pick, or similar.  Sometimes you can lift the stone out with your bare hands, that stopped this auger dead in it's tracks.
One last thing...although I will grill two to three nights a week, my Weber Grills still look good when not in use...thanks to their Weber Grill Covers.  Consider this cover a necessary accessory.

9472	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	BUYER BEWARE: It appears Flowtron currently has quality issues with the starter bulb that starts the fluorescent tube in the most recent units.  Bought three of these from two different sources in March 2011, one source being Amazon.  Within one week, one unit from Amazon and one from another source had quit working, leaving only one of three working after a week.  The bulb simply stops lighting and that causes the grid to not energize too, rendering the zapper useless.  The third went in about 4 more weeks so after a month and a half, my small sample of three has a 100% failure rate.  Flowtron sent me some starter bulbs (a $2.50 part) and that DID fix the problem.  I'm hoping that the fix will last as replacing the starter bulbs on a new unit is a nuisance and some people might not be comfortable with the repair.  When these work though, they attract/kill more bugs (and many mosquitoes) than any other electronic insect killer I've used.  And I've tried three different brands.

Using DEET products and eliminating breeding habitats like standing water (e.g., after it rains) will help to reduce mosquito populations. Wearing protective clothing is also a deterrent. I provided more detailed information about mosquitoes since the mosquito-borne virus threat is serious and a current menace and I thought that people should not rely on this zapper to protect them from it. Anyway, I have no complaints about this bug zapper and recommend it for reducing flying insect nuisances - just not for effectively combating female biting mosquitoes.

First the mower.  Assembly was easy despite the poor instructions - basically a picture with arrows and no words.  But if you have ever assembled anything, this should take you about 15 minutes.  It is really just assembling and attaching the handle.  I did not have to adjust the blades at all, but after reading some other reviews I might adjust them slightly to the looser side.  One gripe I have had is that the initial "push" required to get it spinning is tough.  Once it is moving pushing is easy, but then you stop and turn, and back to pushing hard again for a split second.  That might be why some people have written bad reviews about the handle breaking(?).

Make sure to secure the bait using the hook or try and put the peanut butter, jerky, cheese, twine, cotton balls etc. In a place where the rats can't just lick them or take them off and walk away.

I later caught the same mouse with a mouse trap (inside again).  I guess it's true what they say on the havahart website.  If you're catching and releasing, make sure you're dropping them off a mile or two down the road or they'll find their way back.

I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.

Today while spraying dormant oil and copper fungicide the handle stopped working and the tank fell off and the spray never stopped.

So I just sent them a copy of the invoice and they are sending me a RMA slip to ship it back to them to repair / replace it if that is what in fact is the issue.  So fingers crossed. I did check their website and just for reference although i do believe it's the transformer since I checked the leads and there was no power going to the fence or bulb. I  hope this helps.

- The mixing ratio design is such that underneath the dial/mixing head, there are multiple holes with different depths. These holes are actually pressing on a ball-bearing that controls how much content will be siphoned.

However you can find the same type hose at Wal-Mart or Home Depot for a similar price.
It also commonly does not shutoff when it gets to the ramp- goes a ways & falls over.

*** IMPORTANT *** I put it on an outdoor timer to come on at dusk and turn off about 2:00 am (when the temperature would drop below the point that most bugs would be very active).  This assured that the zapper would be functional during EVERY MINUTE of the optimal bug-zapping time.  I think this is the KEY to its effectiveness.  Bug zappers are not something that you turn on only when you go outside.  That won't work.  You need to wipe out the bug population (we're talking Culicidacide).  Either get a timer, or leave it on all the time (but that would shorten the life of the unit and waste energy, as zappers are largely ineffective in daylight).

But the generous 3 or 4 stars I was going to give was until yesterday. Last night, in the early evening, while it was still light, I watched in horror (from my kitchen window) as a hummingbird repeatedly made passes at and brushed up against the zapper, actually pushing his beak into the zappers protective cage. I know how long a hummingbird's reach is (with beak and tongue) and at that moment I realized if it tried to "lick" the light (or if it was trying to eat a bug* that was hovering close to the light) it could be electrocuted. As soon as I realized this I ran out, yelling and clapping to distract the humming bird, and thank God it flew away. But before I got out there I could see it was right up against the zapper, trying to find a way to get to the light. I immediately unplugged the zapper.
It cooks very evenly and having tackled everything from shrimp, tuna steaks, burgers, and chicken I haven't burned anything on it yet. The propane tanks are cheap and easy to find locally so that's a plus. To enhance the grilled flavor I use some soaked wood chips placed in tin foil and the flavor turns out just as good as larger grills I've had in the past; I think the smaller space in this little Weber concentrates the flavor so it cooks the smokey taste into the food quickly.
3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.
If you are replacing the wand on an older Gilmore Sprayer, also get the Sprayer Replacement Valve R58C.

I previously bought the Stinger bug zapper (the indoor/outdoor one) which actually works a lot better than I thought it would but this Flowtron one definitely cleans up what the Stinger doesn't get. It obviously has a much larger coverage area but honestly I still run both zappers. I've found that this Flowtron one is my mainstay except when it rains. There's been a few questions about this so here's my input...it does withstand a normal rain without any harm to itself or tripping the GFCI. If it's wind+rain or if torrential rain like we sometimes get here in Texas then it'll shut off and trip the GFCI. All I have to do is wait till it air dries (half a day) before turning it back on and it doesn't have any fits on start-up. In the meantime I run my Stinger which is protected from the rain underneath my patio roof. The FlowTron is completely exposed to the elements.

As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren't as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you're brushing it.  The vents constructions seems fantasic, they are easy to open and close, yet stay put when you need them to.  Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures.  I love this grill to death, and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it ("see, i told you this thing is friggin' awesome!").  Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future, I will still use this grill every time I'm only cooking for 1 or 2 people.

It not that big of a deal - I use a leaf blower to periodically clean the device. I think it has to do with the type of bugs.

REMEMBER YOU NEED TO CHECK AND EMPTY THIS EVERY DAY because there's no food or water inside so they will end up cannibalizing each other.  If this happens you get super bad karma for life.  PLUS the mice will come back in your dreams and eat your brains!  (plus the trap is nasty to clean up after that)
2595	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Far better adjustments, smooth action, solid feel and apparent quality, than all the many others I have used.  Only have a few dozen hours on it so time will tell about durability, for under $20 I'm very happy so far, even sounds better, inspires confidence it will just WORK.  (I paid $17)  I would only ask for a bigger easier to grasp/twist adjustment screw head.
This little grill is awesome.  It's easy to clean in any sink if you want to, it's simple to operate, very efficent in it's use of charcoal.  (Kingsford Match Light Mesquite...Mmmmnnnnn)


You can also select odd/even days, or how many times a station comes on in a day, used for gardens, drip systems, new seed or sod. So, if you only want zone 1 for your garden to run multiple times in the summer heat you can and only have all other lawn zones run one time per day.

6905	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Let's see...I've tried the talprid worms, the plunger trap, the mole cat, the poison peanuts....all worthless.  I was fed up and called in the mole pros who used these traps.  During the span of Jan-July, they killed 7 moles on my 0.4 acres.  On labor day, I power raked, aerated, and reseeded.  About a week later the moles started tearing it all up again!!  I couldn't financially justify bringing them back so I learned to use these traps myself and took out 4 of the critters since.  11 of them in less than a year!
This product, however, works quite well. Now I have to push the mower faster, but that is MY problem. lol
Need we say more? See above (my fingers hurt from typing.) Hope the pictures do it justice.

The spray action and pumping works very well on this unit and as with all sprayers it should be rinsed out thoroughly when done spraying. I like the Solo sprayers and recommend them.


2597	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I am very disappointed with this. The metal pin that is supposed to hit the bottom two clips to change direction often gets stuck. It hits the clips "too softly" I guess and it just sits there, if you force it with your finger it will switch again.  The result is that often the sprinkler gets stuck in a constant position. Essentially, not useful.

6519	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	About 20 years ago, an ex-girlfriend gave me a Smokey Joe Charcoal Grill. We used to do a lot of camping and she thought it would improve the campground facilities grill. Well, it did that for certain. In addition, I've gotten a lot of household use out of it. I always use charcoal as a fuel. I always let the coals get into just the right gray condition then apply the meats, etc. I always grill with the cover on. It takes a sense of timing to know when the dinner is done, but that comes with experience. Yum! I've prepared some really memorable barbecues on this thing! Lamb chops are my favorite! Steaks can be outstanding. Chicken, oh yes! The trick is getting them done to perfection and I'm getting pretty good at it according to my guests.
806	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
I will absolutely buy a new one when this finally goes and if you're cheap like I am, turn your top damper when done cooking and reuse larger pieces of charcoal by putting in coffee can after cooled and always wipe grate down with oil.

754	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I always recommend this brand. They stand behind their warranty. The hoses are well built, but if you have a problem with it, and it breaks, chop off the ends, send em in and they send you a new hose. No problems. I've only had to do this once for the 3 or so hoses that I've purchased. They are well built, sturdy hoses.

7525	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased 3 of these from Amazon. They do work. So far, I have caught 2 moles in my yard and 1 in my neighbor's using the surface technique. One of the traps though has a dangerous manufacturing flaw. The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.
9231	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So, quick lil PSA, we have a small organic farm and usually these zappers and frowned upon because they kill a lot of the beneficial insects too. You need those beneficials to keep a lot of the bad guys in check. So, installing one of these can actually make your problem worse.
One of the drawbacks to this unit is that over time the grates around the bulb will become clogged with bugs.  You will have to follow the instructions to carefully clean out the unit every few days or so to keep it working at maximum efficiency.  The more the light is covered up, the less bugs will be able to see it.

The flip up grill top has been very nice for a few of the long smokes I've done.  Yes, it makes a great smoker too.  I've cooked on it about 4 times now, and the ash pan is a long ways from full, so haven't used that yet.
7107	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	In years gone by, when the fly population in the house got to be annoying, I would tuck a piece of old-fashioned fly paper near the kitchen window where it wasn't too obvious, and it worked. When it was ready to be thrown away, I could cheaply replace it. This year, though, we tossed our old heavy drapes and put light new shades in the dining room. The flies all wanted to hang out in the dining room window, and I could not place flypaper right where our eyes would be drawn while we ate. Gross. So I figured I would try this fly trap.
UPDATE: I'm upping my rating from one to three stars. Flowtron IS responsive if you leave a message with a call back number. The RMA procedure was quick and easy (kudos to Amazon on that). The replacement unit is up and zapping. It's killing everything that flies into it. Don't know yet how much of the casualty rate consists of mosquitoes.

6000	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I have ordered and used these feeders for probably 10 years or more. Feb 2016 I ordered a new one for the current summer. My old feeder continued to work through the summer and just broke last week. No problem! I have a back up just in time for the August swarm of hummingbirds. Got the feeder out today and guess what? It is defective. The two tiny plastic catches on the back won't engage. It is like the cylinder is too long or something.  And it is too late to send it back to Amazon saying it is defective. So I will have to eat it. NOT HAPPY. nuff said. Unhappy customer wants a new feeder free. Oh, and there was no screw to apply the rest beneath each port.
I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.
It's a great hose, even in the winter.

I bought one more 1/2 acre and a 1.5 acre. The Bk-80d (1.5 acre) is a BUG SLAYING MACHINE!!!! I believe this this is as close to being clog proof as any bug zapper on the market. Like I said earlier the bk-15d is absolutely NOT clog proof or even clog resistant, while still great not even in the same league as the 1.5 acre. I wish now I would have bought more bk-80d (1.5 acre). It is like the 4th of July every night. Don't be cheap like I was, BUY THE BK-80D!!!!!!!!

It is hard to say anything more than all the other  783 customers have said.. so I will simply say... its a good hose, it works perfect for me with no leaks, and I would not hesitate to buy it again.

Do the usual, start the fire, coals ash over and then pile em up on the sides for indirect cooking. Well, i'm cookin' some ribs so this will take awhile... 45 mins to an hour pass by... crap it's time to replenish the coals. Now I have to take this burning hot grate off, hope my food doesn't fall off in the process, hope I don't accidently burn the dog, set this hellfire piece of metal in a safe place, once it's in that safe place (usually on the concrete slab I call a patio) I realize that I forgot to put the dog in the house so now i'm fightin' the dog with my foot as I try to replenish the coals. The dog grabs a slab of ribs and takes off so I have to chase him, meanwhile my food is still on the ground, the burning coals are still in the chimney starter so while I chase the dog he runs into my grill which causes my chimney starter to fall and coals go flying everywhere. The dog gets scared, drops the ribs in the mud and runs away, running over all my food with his muddy feet. I miss grabbing one hidden coal so the entire neighborhood goes up in flames.

We are truly grateful we tried Low tech! For once.
The bottles are heavy-grade quality glass with screw-on hanger tops.  The bottlenecks are very narrow, which makes cleaning difficult, particularly if any mold has developed inside the bottle.  Also, these are almost impossible to fill  without a funnel.
In addition to this, the legs and igniter rust heavily where they attach to the body of the grill. I've had small amounts of rust on previous grill grates, but my latest is rusted down into the metal itself and impossible to remove with a wire brush. This despite the fact that I regularly make sure the grate is clean and oiled.
Highly recommend.

The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.

I highly recommend it for us older folks that shouldn't be shoveling snow in the first place. A great long lasting tool as with my experience I have had my first one for many many years. I purchased the second one for my boat..... lol
169	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this last year to replace my old Scott's spreader after a wheel fell off of it. This one is so much better than my old one. The big tires make it much easier to push than my old one, especially on my sloping back yard. The handle is also long enough that I don't have to bend over as much as I did with the Scott's (I'm 6'3"). I've owned a number of spreaders and this is easily the best one I've owned. It's expensive, but it was worth it to me and with it's sound construction, it will probably be the last one I'll need to buy.

The grill size is perfect for myself, as it will do a couple decent sized steaks, chicken breasts, even a fair amount of back ribs, though it's a squeeze. I had this same grill in the charcoal model before, and have had the gas models for probably 10 years or more now. They do the trick for fairly quick initial heat up (I give it 5 min. and it's pretty much there.) They're simple, they do a good job of cooking (until the "flavorizer" disintegrates) and the enameled body of the grill holds up very well.
My only complaint is that I'd prefer that it be made of clear plastic so you can easily tell if the trap has an occupant, but it's a minor complaint. The scratching and movement of the mouse makes it pretty obvious.

It's built like a tank & will go up & over most obstacles, through muddy puddles & works great as long as you use the recommended hose diameter & adequate water pressure.  If you don't, the unit will derail around curves.  Not recommended for small yards.  It's well made out of cast metal, so it's not a lightweight (which is a good thing 'cause it doesn't blow over in a wind).

Now for the lawn, I may try putting it around the perimeter of the lawn with stakes in the winter when the grass goes dormant.  During the mowing season it would require taking it down once a week to mow the lawn. Yes, the California rabbits feast all year round and are even worse during the winter months. Perhaps it will save me hours of hand pulling weeds every spring which are brought in with the rabbit scat.  In the summer I just sweep the scat up.
4875	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I like reel mowers and had an old Scotts mower. I sharpened the blade - get the Fiskars kit and don't go for the 'easy' fix like the screw on sharpeners - and ordered this grass catcher.

7995	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	The Flowtron BK-80D is OK but the Flowtron 15060 is better.  The Flowtron 15060 uses only half of the electricity and in my testing zapped more mosquitoes. The Flowtron 15060 uses a single 40watt black light bulb.  It also has a plastic mesh to reduce the number of moths caught.  The mesh hole dimensions are 3/8" wide and almost 1/2" high, which may be close to optimal.  I have tried 1/2" x 1/2" mesh with the Flowtron BK-80D but that allows too many moths in.  I have also tried 1/4" x 1/4" wire mesh and that works fairly well but may keep the larger mosquitoes out.  Short lengths of 3/8 x 3/8 mesh is available in stainless steel but is very expensive.  I was initially hoping that the Flowtron 15060 would have two bulbs, like the Flowtron BK-80D but decided to try it out.

Didn't get a ton of use, because I caught a mouse when I thought I had rats (the racket they were making, it was such a surprise it was only tiny mice).  But that's a big positive for these, because if the trigger is sensitive enough to go off from the touch of a little mouse, then it's definitely going to get a rat sticking its fat schnoz in there.  Other trap brands I've used won't go off when the rodents lick the bait off of the trigger.  These ones are the old dangerous finger breakers, but they work better than anything else out there.  Just learn how to handle them and you'll be fine.

To oil, I poured some expensive, high hydroxytyrosol extra virgin olive oil on a paper towel and wiped it onto the blades. (I had just run out of White Lightening bike lubricant but the olive oil was handy. No big deal at all. If you are considering a push reel mower because you don't like petroleum products, rest assured that you can use just about any vegetable oil or skin-friendly silicone instead.)

It heats every bit as well as my old large grill, but stores on a small shelf in my laundry room.  I was concerned after reading reviews about the area for charcoal being too narrow to hold enough, but I didn't have any problem at all with this.  It easily held enough charcoal to grill six hamburgers, with plenty of heat left over for s'mores afterward.
My comments apply to the Orbit, Craftsman and what ever other brands this sprinkler is sold under. Yes they are all the same, and just look different.

The igniter works great on this grill. It just requires being set up properly (takes ~1 minute to do). I take it that many of the reviewers that were having problems simply bolted it all together without adjusting the gap between the electrode and the burner.

7072	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Well, this thing is made like a tank and seems to work IF (like many things) you know what you're doing. Unfortunately, at least the moles at my house in Oregon don't make these nice, straight tunnels fairly close to the surrface like I see on so many tutorial videos. Mine run deep tunnels, and pop up to push out dirt. So, to make these work, I have to dig out a fairly large hole in the ground (think 8" x 8" at least) and try to locate the tunnel that's running horizontally. Many times I can't even find it, so I have to keep trying. Once I do find a tunnel down there, I do just like they say, build the mound between the tunnels, set this thing in there, and then I basically cover it back up with loose dirt and the piece of ground I cut out. Sometimes the trap sits there for days and days with nothing, and other times I've caught a mole in 1 day. I've caught 3 moles so far and that's helped in my back yard grass area. Up front where I have a huge barkdust area, the moles like to make those surface tunnels right under the bark, but it's not really a tunnel that you can set a trap on. I don't think they come back to those. They then tunnel down deep, so it's been tough to get those suckers.

After another season (almost full season) I still love this mower. I have begun to experience lots of squeaking. I now have to oil before mowing, but still this mower has much less upkeep than a traditional mower.
First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.
7816	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	love it, be careful leaving it outside in winter... that could damage it

2977	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The yearly ritual around our house for the backyard garden is to trim and weed out the overgrowth that magically appears every springtime. We have had gardeners do the job, but this was not looking looking too good since it was costing quite a bit when we totalled the yearly maintainance fees. I wanted a weeder/trimmer that was non-gasoline powered and cordless too. I saw the B&D Grass Hog and bought one, in hopes that this would save us some money. The set-up of the unit is easy. A few screws, charge up the battery, (it will take overnight) and you are good to go. The first thing that you will notice is that it is pretty heavy for a trimmer/weed whacker. This is due to the heavy lead-acid battery that is perched at the top of the unit. The second thing that is noticed is it's power. I was able to whack and trim the heaviest grasses and weeds. The big problem is the extremely short usage time per charge. I was only able to use the Grass Hog continuously for only about 12 to 15 minutes before it ran down and stopped working. This is not acceptable. In fact, it is a down right failure for usefulness as far as a garden tool. I cannot perceive why Black and Decker would even market and sell this item because the effective run time is so low. I am returning this unit. In the meanwhile, I have discovered that other cordless trimmers last up to 40 minutes for about the same price as the Black and Decker. If this was a final exam for the cordless Grass Hog, it would receive a grade of D.
5637	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw. Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars. At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later. Oregon's web site lists what chains fit which saws.

Within the first three hours of use, the unit had attached loads of mosquitos as well as  some other  bugs. At the rate it is "zapping" bugs I will no doubt have to clean in a few days. I took the unit out of the box and it was operating within minutes. I already had a hook attached to a wall in the courtyard. I know the instructions recommend putting the unit away from walls, however in my case that was just not possible. I never had a problem in the past with the unit being close to a wall and I don't anticipate such as problems with this unit. I never turn the unit off thus it is working around the clock to attract bugs.
9801	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It works, but there is no explanation of the adjustments or the range of adjustments???  there does not seem to be much difference...it's eith full on or full off?  but it does what I wanted for my hydroponic dutch-pot drip system.


I've been using it for about 3 months now, and it's so easy, and I don't get tired (as I did with the smaller, hand held type sprayers), so I find I use it much more often, and the weeds don't get ahead of me.

The way the bottle attaches is very cumbersome as well. It leans against the ground, and the valve is very low. It's very difficult to get the propane bottle to begin threading onto the valve because in order to depress the valve in the bottle you have to press it into the valve while turning it. Sometimes it takes forever to get the threads to catch. If you pick up the grill for any reason, the gas bottle hangs down and makes it difficult to set back down again.

If you are a homeowner cleaning up storm damage or dropping the occasional small tree, then this is a good blade for you and should last a long time. If you cut a lot of wood, then this is still a good chain for the small stuff - especially when something more aggressive would put you at risk of getting pulled off balance.

Sounds like a frightened screaming owl when revved more than about half way.  Does a good job, but way louder than any electric, and somewhat louder than most gas models.  Decent for the price if you have the system and not a lot of space.

I don't have mine on a timer but instead I thought I'd use the remote control electric outlet that I used to turn on and off our outside Christmas lights.  (Hey, it works great plus I don't have to bend down and I can turn it off and on from inside my house if I want. Also had back surgery and bending is not good for me)
Supposedly this pole can be pulled out of the feeder. Not a chance of that happening. The only way to get it out now would be to destroy this brand new feeder

6510	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	After reading reviews on Amazon and other places I decided to purchase the Scotts 20-inch reel mower.  The quality of the mower is fine with no obvious flaws in design or assembly.  At first I questioned the cut quality however realized that this was due to the some weeds in my lawn being too high for the reel to cut instead of just push down.  I checked the blade adjustment and all was well.  If you have a thick lawn or one that is mixed (like mine) then this may not be the best mower for you.  If your lawn is pretty much free of weeds and not too thick then this will do just fine.  I must admit this is easier to push than using my self-propelled mower.  What a surprise!  I love being able to mow and hear the kids playing, or my wife calling out to me - and no risk of things being thrown and injuring my children.  They can actually play nearby while I mow!  Would I buy it again?  Probably so, although I'd wait until I had the weeds and non-grass stuff under better control.
8253	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This bug zapper works great.  I have to blow the dead bugs out frequently.  It's doing a fine job.
5453	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this with the hope of being able to pick a few blueberries this year. Last year the birds ate everyone. We built a box 10x10 arbor type enclosure and surrounded it with this netting. I was concerned a bird would be trapped in the netting but so far so good. And so far I have picked a full gallon of blueberries. Very pleased with the netting.
You needn't worry about liners splitting in the winter,or that filthy green slime when you remove the cover in springtime like you do on a permanent aboveground pool.
Kinks easily
5635	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	A LITTLE LIGHT
All in all, a top notch design; makes life a lot nicer without having to constantly fight moths and flying bugs.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better bug zapper for the home/yard.

Because I have been so pleased with this particular feeder at work, I decided to get one for home to use as a second feeder.  The biggest difference with the two are their size.  One holds 10 ounces and this one holds 30 ounces. I keep the smaller one just outside my kitchen window so that I'm reminded to fill it more often and the larger unit I have placed over in my side garden. I have added a video to show a couple of my visitors.
  but  I am getting them now.  Roll  your yard  first,  then walk it to see the new tunnels,  set the traps  and set back and wait  they are dead meat with these traps.  You tube  will show you how to set the trap better then the box,  the directions say dig up the tunnel but  I do not dig a hole I push the tunnel down  pull a little bit of grass up so the trip is close to the ground so when the mole goes though he pushes the dirt up hits the trip and he gone to heaven I do it this way because a company called critter control  does it this way and  they were killing the moles in my neighbors yard.  that is why I chose the traps because they were working so good and that is what the company used.
6011	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Small but nice.  As intended.
>> A disadvantage of compound or geared loppers is that you have to spread the arms very wide to open up the jaws for a thick branch. But your arms have less power spread so far apart, and obstructions (such as other branches or walls) are likely to get in the way. If you can't back up (for example, if you are on a ladder), loppers that you have to spread very wide can "punch" yourself in the chest when you close them.

6203	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought a couple of these traps to compare to the Mice Cube that I bought at the same time. I had used a sticky trap to catch a mouse, and my kids (animal lovers) were mortified. I had to switch to humane traps, and this and the Mice Cube looked to be my best bet. The first of these traps that I opened had a broken plastic pin that kept it from opening. It's on its way back to Amazon for a replacement. I set the second trap with a dime sized spot of peanut butter in its bait tray, and placed it along a wall between two rooms that I've seen a mouse in. At the same time I placed two Mice Cubes in the same area. In the morning I noticed the door on the Kness Tip-Trap was closed. I could not feel anything moving inside, so I thought someone had bumped it. I carried it outside to an open field down the street, removed the rear cap, and a healthy brown mouse scampered out into the field. Success! I set it a second time and put the trap in the garage. 24 hours later I saw it tripped again, and using the same procedure I released a baby mouse into the field. Nothing touched my Mice Cubes that were in the same areas.

642	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We really like our seeder and are impressed with the USA made quality like what we used to find in products back in the 50s & 60s before the made in China junk flooded the market. It has a heavy gauge aluminum frame and many of the parts are durable nylon rather than cheap plastic. The wheels roll on steel bushing shafts and all the bolts are respectable grade 5 quality requiring a 1/2" & 7/16" wrench for assembly. The 1/4" drive belt is more than adequate and the 12" dia cleated drive wheel is big enough not get lost in our soil and prevents skipped seeds in the row. The seed plates are amazingly easy to change, no tools required. The seed depth and row marker are easily adjusted by loosening large wing nuts with your fingers, once again, no tools needed. The handy kick stand keeps the seeder upright so we don't have to be concerned about seeds spilling out like we would if we had to lay it on its side. I first saw this very machine advertized almost 20 years ago so it has certainly stood the test of time. I have been an organic gardener for 33 years and consider this fella a real back saver and time saver. Well worth twice the price in my mind!
899	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I used to own an orbit tractor but it died, gearbox failure.  Orbit does not offer parts.... oddly enough the orbit gearbox and Nelson units are near identical I think they are made in the same factory and they add a wedge to the front of the Nelson unit so you can't swap parts as Nelson does sell a replacement drive unit.  Nelson unit appears near identical in quality and build to the orbit unit as well....

9642	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This nozzle is solid brass and feels very stout in my hands. Orbit was nice and attached a small piece of rubber trim where the knurled area is.

I couldn't get it to not to leak air when pressurized. I thought buying this brand was the right choice it was not.

I am writing this from my deck, have been out here reading for 2 hours and not one bite!!  This product is great and is performing even better than I thought.  I am one of those people that mosquitoes love to feast on and I really don't like spraying chemicals on my skin.  I figure it is covering both me and my neighbors yards as it is rated for 1 acre.

85	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this product and the part that sprays out the water is not working and I had to contact Gilmour to be able to get a replacement part. Plus Gilmour is going out of business and will not be Bosch company I think. They said they will send me the replacement part. It was so disappointing to have a new sprayer and it would not spray the fine spray mist but it sprayed water.

3009	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased the Black & Decker LE750 in December of 2007 and it lasted 9.5 years. It would have most definitely lasted longer had I not stored it outside in the rain and SoCal sun with absolutely no cover.
3529	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Highly recommend getting one of these every summer or two.. It's worth it not to wait until it wears down to the guide holes.  I almost forgot how good the edger worked and how much quicker it goes if you have a good blade.  I think the blade I just replaced was around 4 years old or so.  I have a corner lot with angled sidewalk at the curve so you can tell my blade tends to wear going around that area.  I just wanted to comment on the design of the blade that concerned some people.  Not sure why they have the wrong picture above but the center of the blade is a circular hole.. and this is a good thing much like a circular saw blade.  If it was angled to grip the shaft you would risk causing damage to the shaft or stripping if you catch the blade on something.  There is no slipping of the blade if it's tightened properly.  I didn't even bother to use a torque wrench.  Just a quick half turn to tighten and it's good enough.  I highly recommend this product and it is worth the price even yearly (though it will last much longer) just for the satisfaction a new blade edging produces.
1713	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I get so frustrated when the other expensive fancy plastic nozzles break or leak.
3641	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These blades do a great job of doing what they're designed for. They seem to last a long time and are easy to replace on the Black & Decker Edge Hog.
847	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Well built hose end mixer/sprayer. Quality construction. Lightweight. Easy to clean. Easy to hold for long periods. Fully mixes product. Adjustable diverter allows for you to spray upward or sideways without have to get into a contorted uncomfortable position with your body. I would purchase again. Used it to spray my new trees. Easily sprayed 25' upward. Of course this would be based on your water pressure. My water was pumped from a private well. No city water pressure here.
Tried different bait, but the glue traps are more effective.

4139	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I never thought I'd buy a push mower due to my bad back.  I have a townhouse so don't have a big yard, but its a decent size for a townhouse.  I had a gas mower for many years and it finally gave out so I decided to get a push mower instead mainly b/c I was tired of having to go fill up a gas jug every few weeks, plus for the size of my yard, a gas mower is a tad overkill.
Here is what I did:
1436	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This sprinkler is great!  I can turn the "wands" to cover small or large areas.  I am thinking of buying another one, so I can have one running in the front yard while one does my back yard.
9315	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Was a bit skeptical  of any 'bug zapper'.  Bought this Flowtron after reading reviews on other brands.  Took it camping; hung it from the camper and also a tree.  Worked beautifully for a 'bug free' evening by the campfire.  Pretty entertaining, too ;)
3622	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We have a large field behind our property and were constantly worried about the mosquitos, this has taken care of all the bugs we had outside. I love this.  I put a hook up on the outside of the deck and it is perfect, I only wish there was some type of a plate that went under it to catch all the dead bugs--we put a trash can under it to catch the dead bugs.

The mower is designed to cut grass and plants like it.  If your lawn is not very flat, you probably cannot use the lowest height setting.  It can deal with even tall dense overgrown grass.  It will be stopped, but if you maintain momentum and ram at it repeatedly, any grass can be dealt with.
Initial assembly was simple, and occurred in 5-10 minutes max.  You need not be a mechanical engineer to assemble this.  Anyone will assemble this with ease, regardless of mechanical aptitude.
661	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got this for one of those long skinny shovels. The wooden handle rotted and snapped but the steel shovel blade was still good.

8809	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works pretty well. after a little trial and error, I put some DE earth on the floor (to keep the ants away from the bait), and I set the trap right on top of that DE powder, the trap was baited with some bread and peanut butter.  I set it on the floor of my tool shed, and it caught 3 mice that day, and I think that is all the mice there were, because the next day it didn't catch any.  I released the mice onto the grass outside, hoping that at least I would be giving a meal to one of the few stray cats that live around here.  That's not what happened.  What happened was a flock of nearby chickens saw me releasing mice on the grass so they immediately came running over and they killed the three mice in about 2 seconds, after that the chickens started playing a game of soccer with the dead mice, they were running after the the chicken with the dead mouse in its beak and everything.  That was quite unexpected, I didn't even know that chickens hunted mice.  So much for the humane way of setting them free.  Oh well, at least the mice did get a dignified funeral.

I will definitely reorder.
It actually did make a dent in the population. Let us not claim it was useless, because it was not. The problem with the MC was really about maintenance, cost of maintaining and ultimately durability. Both lasted about 1.5 years before they sputtered and died. The bowls with the liquid often filled up with mosquitoes and other flying insects (millions of moths) and then dried to a hard crust. Ipso facto: clean it often!! Horrendous. Secondly, the fans would become encrusted with insect bits and ultimately jammed until you scraped them. Finally, the octenol was expensive and not easily changed (little jamming door that would make the liquids spill).
3100	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this back in 2006 and ten years later it's still tearing up the ground. It's easy to use once you figure out how to use it. You adjust the height wheel, set the metal curb guide against the side of the driveway or sidewalk and start cutting away. I use a back and forth motion to clear everything, but it rolls easily on the wheels and the motor and blade make easy work of the grass roots, dirt, etc. You have to make sure you're keeping the guide against the edge, as it likes to fall off, but the edger is light enough most people won't have any problems handling it. Once you start using it you recognize how to stop the sparks from flying off the concrete. Clearing out the stuck grass is easy with the big hatch covering the blade, which also makes replacing and tightening the blade easy to get to. I found over the years I have to occasionally tighten the blade down from the vibration slightly loosening it, but again it's easy to get to. I have a string trimmer that doubles as an edger, but usually all but the very top of the grass edge laughs at it. I break this thing out and then who's laughing? Me...hysterically...while my neighbors wonder what is wrong with me. That'll do Edge Hog, that'll do.

1392	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent!!
It is easy to clean (I use a Reach toothbrush with soap and water) and to fill up.
Remember to use Safety goggles and a face mask with this item. If your soil is dry, it can get a bit dusty. I'd recommend watering the day before you use this edger. Also, I found three cables I wasn't expecting. Fortunately, they were buried deep enough! They recommend checking for electric cables before using this unit.
4922	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This replacement chain cost about one-third of what the manufacturer of my chain saw was asking via their replacement parts web site.  As it turns out, the Oregon chain was identical to the O.E.M. chain.  It appears that the original chain on my Craftsman saw was made by Oregon.  Why pay more?
2. The design of the system is as such that if the mouse pushes or gets on top of the trap, it will trip without catching anything. So the mouse has to pass through the gate (see picture) for it to work. When I was setting it up, that's what I was afraid of. Fortunately the mouse did not get on top of it and got caught as expected.

It's getting hard to find a good spring-loaded mouse trap with a metal bait holder.  Seems like most are plastic.  I like the metal bait holder type, because it holds the bait better.  I use an almond and ice the top of the almond with peanut butter.


So now it's 2015 and we put this feeder out for the first time this year. We noticed after a while that it was dripping again. I brought it back inside, drained it, took it apart, put it back together. I finally discovered that the feeder must be perfectly level to prevent dripping. If it leans just slightly off center, that will allow the nectar to flow over the containing area inside the feeder and it will leak. Since it is frequently windy where I live, the feeder tends to sway back and forth thus enabling this to leak.

8092	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It is not fancy....but By George it zaps bugs!
I took one star due to the cutouts in the spatula blade.  The only purpose I can think of for the holes is a reduction in the weight of the blade but I think the difference is far too slight to offset the trade-off of less convenient cleanup.  The inside perimeter of the holes can hold stubborn bits of dried sauces and grease.  I need a stiff brush and then closer inspection to be sure they are clean.
4684	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My husband and I have a very big lawn, and it seems like all of the other brands of these brake or the turn lever seems to get stuck. My husband has used this now maybe 15 times, and it is still like brand new in terms of functionality. We like the size, as we can fill it up less frequently. The turn lever is very smooth, and the product that we put on our own comes out very evenly with this tool. The shipper packed this really well, and we had no problem receiving it, and we received it rather quickly. I can see us repurchasing this one again if needed, and we would consider other items from this brand.
6775	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This was the cheapest and most convenient way I could find this rebuild kit for my Gilmour 2gal sprayer. Was easy to install and replaced my broken trigger perfect.
935	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a must-have if you have a yard or garden.  Takes the guesswork out of measuring.  Excellent quality.
4829	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised, fair price, well made
8670	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The hummers love this stuff.  After about three weeks of them only sipping the flowers, a courageous female tried the feeder.  Now they all love it.  Hummers are not too common around my neighborhood, except for me and a few neighbors.


Only complaint we have is the handle. Wish its longer and adjustable so we can adjust accordingly to our height. Husband says his neck hurts after he finished edging because he had to lean over throughout the process.

2435	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's very hard to find a one gallon sprayer that is stainless steel. I don't need more than a gallon at a time, so this one works out perfect. I do need an extension on the wand. The wands are always too short!
7929	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great
4939	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I probably should have paid closer attention to the reviews but I thought they had improved the product.  Very easy to assemble and takes very few tools. Fits my mower perfectly.  Worked great for the first use but then the bottom was dragging the ground so it screwed it up.  The bottom of the basket is now tweaked and warped.  With it like that, the catcher falls off in the yard continuously.  More work than raking!
864	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Used them once and the lower handle cover kept slipping off.  Tried to glue it back on but with no success.  Useless junk so I just threw them away.

9898	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice new garden tool. gets into all the tough spots. The tip is sharp and really gets those pesky weeds.
Tip, if you want hummers to come to your home, install several feeders at least 30 feet apart, so that aggressive hummers don't drive off newcomers (some hummers are very aggressive).  When you finally get half a dozen (or more) hummers regularly visiting, you can go back to a single feeder - the aggressive hummers will have a hard time driving off the others and eventually (day or two), give up in exhaustion and peace breaks out amongst them all.
Cons- The only con is that the outer protective plastic cage HAD bars only about 1/2" apart (same with Stinger)- This kept larger moths... from being able to easily get in to the electric grid.
6782	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This feeder gets so much traffic from the hummingbirds.  It is the one I have to refill the most often.
This thing is heavy cast metal, and I consider that the only negative.

4862	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great.  My neighbor gave me an old Homelite SuperXL AO chainsaw with a dull blade.  This new blade makes cutting tremendously easier compared to the old blade, even after sharpening.
7910	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	great product
5808	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Yes we can sit on the patio again! After 3 or 4 nights even the days are more pleasant. Warning, this really does a job on the insect population, use carefully as this will cut down on pollinators if used during light hours!
8770	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I don't know anyone who hasn't seen/used a Weber kettle grill. If you haven't, you need not look any further.  This is without a doubt, the most versatile grill I have ever used.  It comes with an infinite number of accessories to aid in your backyard culinary adventures.  I highly recommend the rotisserie set-up; guaranteed to be the best turkey you've ever had!
5156	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Used it to reinforce wire fencing, that the deer were jumping through.  Worked!

7555	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Used to have a Mosquito Magnet but the Flowtrons are so much more effective. I found it necessary to replace the bulbs each year, and these replacement parts work perfectly

6784	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Bought these to have on hand as I really like these sprayers! Have not installed them yet.

1016	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	So far so good, wish one of the speed settings was faster.  Appears to be of good quality, though plastic parts are a bit of concern.

6284	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Wanted a small Grill that me and my wife could use just for us on the deck.  Did not want an open one.  This little jewel is big enough to make a meal (steaks, potatoes, corn) and it does a great job.  I would highly recommend this for someone that wants a closed small Grill.
4849	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Effective and entertaining.  I hang it from a tree in front of my patio.  I still get attacked by bugs but probably not as many.  Last night was like a fireworks display.  Almost wish I got the larger one.  One moth about the size of a bird couldn't get through the plastic outer grid. I might open up a couple holes in the outer grid to "help" the larger critters get in.
3586	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This baby will replace a small chainsaw, really does a job on small branches. Under 3 inches.
So overall, it is fine for the price and with a little TLC, it should work for anyone. Be sure NOT to putt stress on the connector as I can see where that might fail. Generally, with flat hoses that have round connectors at the end, problems are going to naturally arise.
822	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	OUTSTANDING.  I NEED TO SPRAY THE TREES IN MY YARD, AND THIS WORKS GREAT.  I PUT THE "BUG KILLER" IN THE CONTAINER, ATTACH THE HOSE, TURN IT ON AND "FIRE AWAY".  IT HAS A DIRECT STREAM OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET.  ITS JUST WHAT I NEED.
292	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Gilmour makes the best products.  perfect weight and strength for a serious gardener.
Now to the important part: the bugs. Our reasoning for having it was to use it to lure bugs away from our home, and boy does it work. We used to get bugs coming inside, and they'd be covering our screen doors and window screens. Since we installed this, there are no bugs on on screens except maybe the occasional moth and that's rare.
4362	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this because the description said it would fit the reel mower I have. Had I not thrown out the packaging, I would have returned it.....it's not right.
4357	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	does what I want and does it decently. It is just a wand but it works as advertised and is worth the price.
2224	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got the Estwing E-45A Campers axe a couple days ago and I am very pleased with what I received.  The axe was on backorder for a couple weeks but I was informed of the status of my order several times during my wait.  I am very glad I purchased this axe.  I have used a half axe about this size about 45 years ago and found them very handy when camping and at Boy Scout Camp. Full sized axes were just too big for most scouts.  If they used them they worked themselves to death and would stop.  Then you couldn't get them to help again.  Of course this was when scouts could use axes and sheath knives.  I still have a couple full size axes but wanted to see if these were still as easy to use as I remember.  This is a great tool and is of the highest quality.
5196	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These valves work great! They reduce my 100+PSI water supply down to 15-25 PSI, and are fully adjustable. I initially bought three, and after installing them, bought three more! The quality and durability are great, I highly recommend this product.
  11) Now, step down with your heel between the two pieces of scrap wood. You want this dirt to be very firm.  I do this, then also tap down with the end of my flat blade tool to get it extra firm.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
4728	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use my saw to trim around our one acre lot. We have several trees and shrubs. I like to keep a spare chain for those times when I may cut into something that dulls the chain. I have found Amazon has the best price and the fastest service. The shipping by Amazon is amazing. I don't see how they get it here so soon.

6403	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Was a little hard to install but got two moles within the first week.
3299	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a perfect replacement for the battery operated grass clipper.  It arrived quickly, well packed and fit perfectly. What more could anyone require?
7203	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Item arrived quickly and well protected. This has been a great choice for our RV needs, it is a real good unit and easily set up or stored. I really like it.
The instructions say to keep the product 25 feet away from any structures, and I had trouble trying to figure out where to hang this thing. It had to be hung a certain distance away from the ground in addition to being further away from the house than I initially expected. I bought a shepherd's hook and planted it on the far side of my yard. That's where I hung the zapper.
59	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	it's a great quick fix-it item, but one has to be carefull and do not overtightnen the screws. They snap off the threads and then the coupling is unusable. In higher quality couplers all parts are made of metal (brass). Of course, metal is much more durable and reliable.
The mower is great.  As I recall, it was easy to put together.  It saves us the cost of gas and oil, it's easier on allergies than a gas mower is, we don't have to smell smoke and fumes from it, and it's quiet--not quiet enough that you want to have a lengthy conversation while pushing it, but quiet enough that our nine-week-old can ride in his stroller next to it and not be upset.  The cutting is similar to a haircut--the grass just gets sliced and falls down; there aren't noticeable particles hanging in the air for a long time afterward.
5235	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good. As shown!
July 29 2009: A house fly was bugging me bad in my home the night before last. Knew that if I was patient, the annoying little bug would find his way to my 15 watt flowtron at some point just like many before him. Sure enough, as I went to sleep, he fried- well done. Have used very little insecticide this summer in my home with this thing working 24/7 nonstop and consuming only 15 watts of electricity. Wish I had thought of using one of these things sooner. My jumpy male cat has gotten more use to it now. Would go with a 40 or 80 watt model for heavy duty outdoor use at night. The 15 watt size is perfect for my indoor purposes. Still haven't cleaned it. It's right trouble free. There is a bit of an odor when a house fly or large bug gets zapped. That's no problem relative to getting rid of the bugs.
7211	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Exact replacement for my Poulan Pro chainsaw-PP5020AV.  I have worked this 2nd replacement very hard and it holds up well.

Edit April 2016 - new replacement burned up.  Electrical smell. Such a waste.  The motor contacts are the weak link and are simply unable to handle the full load amps and burn up.
2425	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Not "Industrial Duty" kinks very easily and not as stiff as one would expect.  Kinkguard sleeve broke after first use.  Started leaking after one year from the hose end.  Only Pro is it works well with hot water.
3306	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Ryobi is cheap, so you get what you pay for.  Why doesn't somebody make one of these with a material that will last?
The only issue is it doesn't have a stand. Due to the access port for easy lamp removal on the bottom it will not stand on the ground (it's designed to be hung on a hook). I got around this by sitting it on a bowl which the bugs fall into. But I'm going to make a stand (prototype in wood then perhaps 3-d print) to make it a little more stable and less like to be knocked over by pets. Very effective.

722	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I like the concept of this design and find that it accomplishes a lot of the watering that used to take a lot of my time moving sprinklers around for! It has saved me tons of time this summer. I just place this on a hose route with my 100 ft hose and let it slowly crawl over a large area of lawn and it gets watered over hours and hours of crawling.  It is adjustable diameter water pattern which makes it quite versatile for accommodating many different sized areas. I have a large lawn area and flower beds and I can set this to go near the flower beds and get both that and the lawn area adjacent in one pass.
4639	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	If you use these enough the fiberglass handles gradually bend, so that the ends of the handles are touching before the wood is cut.  You can replace the blades but the handles wear out long before the blades.  They are probably fine for the average homeowner and they work well when new but only will last a lifetime if they are used sparingly.
7137	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought two of these at a large, orange home improvement store two days ago after reading reviews on Amazon.  Same price as here, by the way. Set them that evening, in the dark, using the technique advocated by other reviewers here... that is, gently tamped down a small section of a main, straight run until level with ground, cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in, set tap, and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground.  One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!
I received my Flowtron fast, about 4 days faster than they said I would with the free shipping. I was a bit concerned when I grabbed the box off my front porch because it was shipped in its box. Not placed in a bigger box with padding, granted it would be a very large box if they did. Although because if this lack of protection the box was dented. I pulled it out and nothing was wrong with it, good so far.
7448	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have enjoyed using this and it has been very beneficial.  I did notice an increase in our bill and still deciding if this is the sole reason.  We bought refills of the mosquito attractant and changed it out every 3 weeks.
3721	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Ordered just to get another spool for modification to .080" line. To modify, use a .080" screw to change one of the holes in the top of the spool.  Twist in the new .080" line.  Manually rewind the line unto the spool (not hard & it doesn't take long). Put the end of line in the slot after winding so it doesn't unwind. B&D must have had the razor blade concept so successul for Gillette in mind when they made their weed eater. As in, price the weed eater cheap, and then sell a lot of line spools. They could just as easily used .080" line to begin with, but then the line would last too long.

3948	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I haven't had to clean it because dead bugs haven't collected on it, but I know it's working because I hear it zapping constantly in the evening and the number of bugs had decreased significantly. My neighborhood is rather boggy the spring and summer and has been particularly bad this year due to more rain than usual. The mosquitoes are normally awful and I get chewed to bits even in the house with double screens. This year, they're indescribable. Since I started running this light from dusk to dawn, I've hardly been bitten, even out on deck on the evening. I wish I had gotten one of these years ago.
Other notes about my yard and the Scotts 2000-20:
5933	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	fast service and shipping.  Works well to cover pvc cage covering 4 large blueberry bushes...  Kept the birds out and about 30 quarts of berries save for me to eat. Wish I could come up with a good way to attach it...

I just got off the phone with Weber Customer Service - She said I should send them a photo with a tape measure showing where it was not 22in.. My wife found a point 23in & my iPad snapped the picture & I sent it while we where talking. She is sending me a new base FedEx by Thurs. of this week. Nice huh? Wow!
It's very sturdy feeling, if not industrial looking.  Twisted onto my house easily and worked PERFECTLY!  NO leaks.  IMMEDIATE shut off.  IMMEDIATE spray.  What's old is new again!  Great nozzle.  I'll never go back to one of those "fancy - 10 spray style" plastic nozzles.  Never.
6066	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have had this feeder for years now and, in my opinion, it is by far the best feeder.  I love that it has a little circular bar for the hummingbirds to rest.  I don't know if they really need this but I like it as it also gives me a chance to look at them when they are fairly still.  I just watched the two videos that are here on this Amazon page and have to say that they have some good ideas on cleaning with vinegar and rice.  The bottle is difficult to clean but I take the time needed as I do not want to cause a hummer to get sick due to my neglect.  What they don't show in the video is to clean the flowers.  I pop them off and clean them very well with an old tooth brush as black mold can hide here.  I also clean the bottom holder very well.  I put a sturdy paper towel in there with hot soapy water and then use a slender nut pick to move it around and get everything clean.  I hope that you will enjoy this feeder as much as I do.
After seven days on, I only run it at night now.  We can sit outside and have beverages, dinner, whatever, and not get eaten alive.

623	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Can't get too excited about a hose, they all make you nuts till they get broke in a bit and get some sun to wear them down. We are in Colorado, so when the hose is cold it is till a monster to get rolled out. Plus the water temperature going through still is burrrrrrr.  Gonna give it some sun time and we will get along better.  I have purchases the Xhose & the Xhose expensive black version in hopes to have a good hose for the deck. DON"T get them!  They all explode and can hurt you like me!  Stay with this type. Safe & will last for years!!
Fantastic mouse trap.  Ordered a few more because we get 1-2 mice stuck in our basement every year and it's better to catch and release them instead of letting them die down there (no food for them).

I showed him these on Amazon and he said  "That would be perfect for me when I need to clean up.  Can you order me one please?"  I got 2 just in case I liked it too, and I do.  I like that its made of metal and will hold up.  It has an adjustable spray from soft to wicked hard spray.  You just cant find these in stores anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon!
Hope this helps.  Did I mention I love this hose?

9331	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I estimate that this thing has reduced the bug population in my backyard by at least 80%.  We used to have beetles and moths crawling all over our back door and window, and usually one or two would get in each time we let the dog out at night.

Unfortunately, this edger won't work where grass grows directly next to my fences and one wall of my house, so I had to invest in some electric shears for that portion of the job, but that's a separate review.

450	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	After going through several plastic nozzles, I decided to buy one of the older style brass ones. This one has performed well since I purchased it 10 months ago in Feb 2012. I like the rubber coating on the exterior for grip and paint protection. It gives a fairly even spray at all settings and is easy to adjust on the fly.

UPDATE July 25, 2013  The plastic plate which controls the flow of fertilizer on the bottom of the hopper decided to become very stubborn this spring.  I took the hopper assembly apart and smeared some vaseline around on all the contact areas of the plate.  It seems to have fixed the issue.

4688	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Man I think this has to be the very best cutting tool u will ever have, as of 2000 I got me a set the loppers and shears.  My fokes went threw a new pair seem like monthly so one day I saw a nice look setup and went for it. 15years later....They are still going strong today. I've cut stuff down 2-3ins +!!! If U can get into the cut and work it side to side and keep biting down it will cut down most anything that will fit in between the blades. Now let me clear something up for the low balling reviewers this tool can gap yes. But!! It's not due to the blade bending!!! It's the nuts that's holding the tool together!!!! They loosen up with time. If u over tighten the nuts u cant even open them. U need to first all loosen all the nuts a bit, then take a hammer tap the two blades tightly together, then re tighten the nuts. Snug is all u want. What's happening is the bolts that's guiding and holding it together are loosening up to much letting the blades gap. The two blades separates leaving the gap looks like it's all bent up but it's not! I've taken mine apart and I see the bolts where was once square on the inside heads are now about rounded off but, the blades are perfect, it cuts perfect! For something 15 years old.. left outside in the weather, beat, dropped, and use to cut oak trees down with I have to say y the hell would u past on a manly set of cutters?? Fix your gap and get back to work!!!

Overall it is a nice looking feeder and looks like it would hold A LOT of seed. I am glad I purchased a preowned one, although its been thrown away since Amazon was nice enough to issue a refund for the damaged feeder, after seeing what it looks like, and learning its assembly, I can't say I wish to reorder this particular feeder. Definitely not worth $30+ in my opinion. Considering it is cheap plastic that broke in transit, I don't think this feeder would last very long due to its clear lack of durability. Plus we get a lot of squirrels who love to invade feeders, I doubt this feeder would survive their daily invasions!
2995	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have used both electric and gas powered edgers in the past.  I prefer the gas ones since you don't have to drag a cord behind you.  The electrics never seemed to have enough power, either.  However, this unit is different.  Seems to have plenty of power and really isn't bad to use.  You still have a cord, but the handle design keeps it out of your way and behind you.  Very reliable and does a good job edging.  The first pass took a while since there was a lot of stuff that needed cutting.  After that, subsequent trimming is very quick and easy.  Glad I purchased this.
2220	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	VERY GOOD PRODUCT. STRONG
1114	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a great way to keep a big lawn watered. We haven't installed a sprinkler system yet but needed to plant some new grass. This kept it watered and is actually kind of fun to watch-my Grandkids thought it was "magic"!
Oh, and the fact that I can pick the thing up with one hand and walk it to where I want to use it.  I sometimes even carry it through the house to the back yard rather than opening the garage door and walking around.
So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.
1645	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We accidentally purchased two of these and only have one hose. I figured that since it was so cheap I would keep the extra one as a backup if something happened to the first one. A year later and only a few tiny spots of rust, the nozzle is in great condition. I love this nozzle as it is the type that I grew up with!

The soil where I live is full of roots and rocks and this does a really good job with them.  If the roots or rocks are large, they will still have to be chopped out with a shovel or something, but this cuts right through small roots (less than 1/2") and dislodges rocks that are smaller than golf ball size.
175	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have now used this on 4 applications and find that it is everything that is depicted.  Have not noticed any missed spots using this spreader although I make sure that it does not run too low on material.  The adjustment on the handle is a real boon as it can be adjusted for tall people.  I highly recommend this spreader.

Some 50 years ago my dad took a regular hoe to a blacksmith who ground it down to this shape for doing close up weeding next to plants; I inherited it however, rust and handle wear have made it time for a replacement.  (I now use some lubricant spray on my tools to help avoid rust/etc.)

Update: I have been cutting on weekends since October with this same chain and it is still sharp. I am astonished!

4845	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I do like the grass catcher.  However it does not catch all the grass all the time.  Some grass will fly over the back.  But it does catch 80% or so of the grass cut.  That is me walking at a normal pace.  It is easy to attach to a reel mower, no special tools are needed to attach it.  I would not hesitate to buy this product again.

The low cost, no fuel or oil, smaller space, and nimble ease of use significantly outweigh the negatives.
894	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I'm a new home owner and I bought a cheap 50' hose to spray weed killer on the lawn. A hose is a hose, so why waste money? I learned quickly what misery a bad hose is. It was kinking in a dozen places before I even unwound it the first time. It was stiff, awkward, hard to move around, constantly kinking. I spent more time troubleshooting the line of hose than using it.
4842	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Makes cutting faster and easier. This chain will grip, bite and pull into the wood a little more and produce larger sawdust fragments. Overall I find this method of cutting and style of chain to be much better than the default chains that come with most saws. I strongly recommend this chain if you do a lot of large sized cutting. Just be sure you are used to your chainsaw and chainsaw cutting before upgrading to this chain.

This mower requires patience and some learning. With this mower, YOU cut your lawn (not the machine). I know that sounds like something you'd hear from some Japanese Samurai but it's true, really. You'll need to learn the technique of working this mower best. This mower WILL cut tall grass but you will need to make multiple passes. To get a perfect cut, you may need to mow at several angles. If mowing is a chore to you, don't get this mower. If your lawn is like your garden or if you enjoy being outside and working on your lawn and garden or if you're looking for some light exercise, get this mower.
I've been using the Scott's Classic for a couple months and it really isn't any harder to push than my old gas-powered lawn mower.  It weighs less than half of what my old lawn mower weighed, and I can clip along just as fast if not faster than I could with my old mower.
8150	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	works as intended
6273	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This little unit does a great job of what it's designed to do.  It obviously isn't a do everything grill for major block parties, but will do a nice job on a meal for two, without burning up a ton of charcoal.  The design doesn't permit charcoal to be added easily while cooking, though it can be done (you have to take the food off), and the distance from coals to grate is fixed.  My only real objection is that it doesn't draw enough air for hardwood charcoal (Mesquite, at least) with the cover on; it does fine with briquets.  In sum, does a nice job of simple grilling on a small scale.  I've owned a couple over the years and had no quality problems, nor have others I've known who owned them.
7616	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I am a landscaper and I bought this 2 years ago. It got me through 2 years before dying but it wasn't exactly a great two years. The pneumatic tires are really nice but if I put more than 50lbs in they would go flat. The nuts on the adjustment bar constantly come loose which means the flow of dispensing changes all the time. I would have to tighten them once or twice per property. adjustment bars are very exposed and made of soft metal. They get bent very easily which causes difficulty opening the gates. The frame is solid, the axle and gears worked great. The bin is big and solid. As a homeowner this may be perfect for you but I would highly discourage buying this for commercial use. I much prefer the units that you set the rate and pull the handle. Those are much more reliable.

1060	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	The unit leaked from the first time it was used .. does the job, but trickles all over the person spraying.

9395	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live in a very swampy area prone to TONS of mosquitos.  In fact, sometimes I haven't been able to open my front door without all lights being off and first spraying bug spray.  It's awful.  So I put this thing about 20 feet from the door and set it up to go on for an hour after dark using a timer (not included).  There are so many dead bugs on it, I'm amazed.  Really works.  And unless the mosquito population is low this year or I'm forgetting when they actually come out, it's cut back significantly on my "house entry" troubles.

I've always complained that a weed eater never cleans up those sidewalk and driveway edges.  One day I saw a pro using their gas edger so I looked one up.

4605	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	If your using this blade, you have a light duty saw So don't expect miracles.  Mine is an echo CS-400 with an 18" bar. For $15 you get a brand new fresh blade that cuts straight and can keep up with the motor. Once the blade hits the dirt or a rock a few times it gets harder to keep it fresh with a file and if you're like me, I end up sharpening one side better than the other so the cuts start to turn. Easier to just replace the chain! Keep a spare on hand.

I have a small garden center and we do some spraying when needed. I can treat an acre of growing area, switching off to different hoses for different zones along the way in a very short time.

The lawn buddy has been a lifesaver for me.  It is lightweight, sturdy (I'm over 200 lbs), wheels roll easily even on the lawn and it carries all my tools. I can either straddle it or sit sideways and it is low enough for me to reach into the garden to pull weeds, plant etc.  I purchased 3 other non mobile garden stools before I found the lawn buddy and havn't used the others since.  When I purchase larger potted plants I can put 2 or 3 of them in the storage compartment and it also holds 2 flats of flowers which makes transporting from my car to the garden so much easier. Moving a bag(s) of garden soil is now possible. I used to load these items into a wheelbarrow which inevetibly would get off balance and tip over.

Finally, and possibly worst - one of my drive ratchet pawls was installed backward. The drive pawl is a small metal bar that goes through a slot in the blade axle. One edge of the pawl is rounded, and the other is sharp. The rounded edge of the pawl should be against the interior rounded surface of the drive gear. If the sharp edge of the pawl is working against the rounded internal surface of the drive gear, it chews it up - this may be the "gear failure" that some are reporting. Properly installed, I've seen zero wear in three years on the drive gears, either on the external gear teeth, or the internal ratchet surface.

Nelson uses plastic gears for the propulsion and are prone to wearing out very quickly and are inherently weak and not able to pull much hose. Really no more than 20 feet without starting to strip, which causes the unit to stop moving forward. Nelson will gladly sell you new gears every couple of years for $35 and basically that's how they make their money.

this netting is as easy to rip apart as a couple sheets of paper.  The mistake was mine, but i need something that will hold up to a drown mas upper body strength
1563	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this Gilmour hose nozzle to replace one that looked almost like it.  The old one last almost 20 years before it finally sprung a leak, so I had to recycle it.  I'm hoping this Gilmour will last just as long.  So far, it appears sturdy and I'm happy with it.  I've been using it for about a month.  It has a basic "point-and-shoot" design.  It is not so easy to adjust the flow to a lighter, "sprinkle" setting, but mostly I just need "on/off" for my very basic gardening.  There is a magnet attached to the handle, and that comes in handy for sticking the hose nozzle to a fence rail to keep it off the ground.
3138	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Ripped through five years of lawn and soil growth on on sidewalk; had to use the 1.5 inch cutting setting.  This did not clog - we waited 24 hours after the last rainstorm.
5057	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Pretty good netting.
It has tiny orifices, and if they get gunked up, the unit will bog down.

1839	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very pleased with delivery timing, packaging, price and product
I have the greenest lawn in the neighborhood even during hot weather (start the sprinkler at 7 PM; done by 3 AM; I am using 130' of hose on the largest area and generally on slow speed, ~18' per hour travel and this is dependent on the angle of the arms; the greater the throw, the slower the travel time BUT more water is dropped.
3735	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fits 18V GrassHog Black and Decker Trimmer perfectly and allows in the field quick change out of tine spool with no unraveling, and no tools required!!  We have used them with much success ever since B&D introduced the 18V GrassHog line.  It is ONE thing we can count on !!
4759	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	better than the original
Never hang it near a door, as their is always a 10'+ swarm of insects around it.
2494	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I needed a short water hose that was for hot water.  Found it, love it!  I don't know how durable it will be, because it is dragged over concrete floors all the time.

7611	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	OK, I have been a fan of Earthway products since I bought my push planter several years ago.  I really expected more from Earthway than what we got in this order.  First, the assembly instructions were a waste of effort.  Besides that, this really is not a commercial quality spreader, IMO.  It is so flimsy.  I mean, you could probably tear it up without any effort.  It has to be handled like egg shells, and no less.  Worse, though, is that after I assembled it and gave it a try, the gauge/meter that is supposed to be Earthway settings on one side and Lesco settings on the other, well, they are nowhere close.  I think I dumped 15lbs of very expensive Lesco fertilizer into 800 or less square feet.  I walked as fast as I could thru my mother in law's yard, and it still did not spread any 12 foot spread.  At best it got seven or eight feet, and it emptied the bin like it had a hole in the bottom, like a bottomless pit.
4493	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is our 2nd pair.  We've had another pair for a lifetime and my husband and I are always fighting over it.  We have another pair but neither of us like that as well.  So we solved our problem, and just broke down and bought another pair of the ones we like and we donated the other one.

I did put some mineral oil around the outside lip of the container to avoid sugar from gluing it together, & if in the sun, my 1st one like this crackled, & the plastic release / lock broke after a cpl of years, but It was Well Worth the investment & replacing.

4830	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fast delivery and fit my Echo CS-370 perfectly!
6135	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I am in my 50's and have a large yard with many trees.  On the downside, the Scotts 20 in. push reel mower mower often gets stuck on tree branches and twigs.  But if I clean up the yard first, it does a wonderful job - and I get good exercise in the process!  I like this mower since it is so lightweight, it is easy to handle.  It is quiet and, although I also bought a grass catcher, I've never needed to use it since the grass is finely cut.  My yard looks great!
Just assume that you'll need some lubricant to slip the insert into the hose.  Don't waste your time just trying to force it on.
This fell apart before I even used it.  Kids were examining it and the handle pulled out.  You can reinsert the handle, but there was a piece rattling inside.  I unscrewed the bottom and noted that there's a retaining bushing that needs to hold the handle in place.  Reassembled and it was as good as new.  Waiting for the next snow or reseed to use.
One caveat is that these zapper seems to last about 1.5 seasons on the average and the Flowtron seems to be more robust and lasts longer than the Stinger models.
We bought two of these, one for our residence and one for our business. Neither of which are working, whilst we await our new order and $15.00 per unit extension cords- Read: Another $30.00.


Cons - It sprinkles like it says it does right from the get go. If your garden bed is not immediately adjacent to the spigot whatever is will get wet. The hose is easily molested. My occasionally overly rambunctious beagle sometimes kicks it and knocks it out of place. It is big and green. In a heavily vegetated bed this blends in quite nicely. In a sparsely vegetated bed this looks like a giant green flaccid hose winding through your garden.
Love it.

2982	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works GREAT!  No problem with the cord at all.

very easy to use and does the job needed
1312	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I love these pruning shears. They are super sharp and easy to use. They made short work of branches in an overgrown hedge I was cutting down this morning. I am very pleased to have them and know they will make my life much easier when I tackle another out of control  hedge in my garden tomorrow.
5706	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's perfect!  Just what I needed to water a 100 ft strip garden.  After I turned the hose right side up, it sprinkled water a couple of feet high all the way to the end.  Turned the other side up, it could be used to stream water directly into the ground for the same 100 feet.  One caution:  it has the female hose connection on one end, but no hose connection at the other end.  Instead, it features a clip that can be moved along the hose to reduce the length to be watered ... so one can't run multiple hoses in series.  It's definitely five star.  And guaranteed for five years, too.

I put it on an outside timer (for when evenings cool down- Not much insect activity below 55 degrees...). Adjust accordingly.
8532	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This came from Seattle so it was her next day. Few bolts and water and I was out smoothing out a fesh tilled lawn. Feels like a good quality item
6227	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for a small grill.  Use it for my travel trailer.  At home I use the larger Weber.
Bought this hose to help keep some new sod watered. Worked great until today when I walked by and noticed that water was spewing everywhere at the place where a regular hose was connected to the sprinkler hose. The metal part had separated from the hose part so all I was getting was a mess of water where the regular hose ended and this piece of junk began.
3038	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	OK for piddlers.  This would be hard to use for weak-handed people or those who want some production.  Not a good choice.
6619	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Don't buy a Feeder without Bee/Wasp Guards! You will just be inviting pests and they drive the HBirds away! THis one does not have the Guards!

The stake attaches to the feeder once you are done with assembling the feeder itself. Overall it is about 6 feet in length, and the stake is not one solid stake like a Shepard hook is, its actually 4 hollow metal sections. You have to use a rubber mallet to connect each section from end to end and then place the feeder on the top of the stake. You have to sink it down into the ground at least 8" according to the instructions so the feeder stands a little over 5 feet above ground. The stake is single pronged and not double pronged for those who are wondering.
