7533	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	back in the early 70s, this tune was recorded more on the country/folk sound and i found it to be a great song to hum anywhere. the counting crows managed to make it even sound bigger, better than i remember.  the beat is up-dated and so is my utmost like for this type tune.  this doesn't always happen but when it does, the tunes of another day come alive with a sound that pleases and opens another generation to what turned and tuned us in with the originals.  great job guys. you and this song rocks.

3618	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There is honestly a difference between a singer, and being a product. Unfortunately for divas these days like Rihanna and Beyonce', they have chosen to overexpose themselves and choose to be products, not people, and sadly the songs have became so overplayed, their voices have slowly passed away. For other divas, like Vanessa Williams, whom has been very sophisticated at the soul, and very true to her own heart, and strong at the voice, her songs have remained so timeless. Nearly 30 years after Vanessa Williams broke from scandal and heartbreak, after the Miss America Pageant, she found her own voice again through music and acting, and made herself a  worldwide staple as a diva that has never gone out of style. One of my favorite songs, her staple Saved The Best For Last, is actually one of those songs that has sincerely gotten much better with age, and the soulful melody aligned. I adore this song each time I hear it, and if you have never heard a Vanessa Williams song before, than I recommend you download this beauty.

"EP" (3 tracks, 24 min.) brings a new song, "Colleen", which is pretty much in the vein of the "YS" album. Next is "Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie", from "The Milk-Eyed Mender" album, in a slightly altered version from the album. Then comes a 13 min. blow-out version of "Cosmia", from the "YS" album, which here live sounds much more invigerated than the album version, and I can't stop playing it.

She is here to prove that, yes, Virginia, there is a life after 50, and it can be a groovin' one if you want it to be. I think I might buy the whole album. My only complaint about this song is that I don't like the way it slows down at the end, but the musical technique fits the lyrics, so I can't complain too much.

Wow!  Talk about this record being a return to form for punk!  After a mood-setting intro, on track number two "Nothing On My Back," the listener is introduced to the band's striking, distinctive, and razor-sharp guitar sound, which was equal parts traditional punk-rock reverb and equal parts pure attitude.  It is a guitar tone that is truly raw, inspired, and decidedly "old school" -- and was indeed copied ten times over by acts that would follow.  Often imitated, but never duplicated, because no one ever did it again like Sum did.

Then there's "Beth." It is a quiet song, but is gritty in its message. It isn't a metal ballad, but could have just easily been performed by Bread. There is depth, passion, and love. It is poetic, melodic, and, in my opinion, has earned its spot as one of rock music's greatest songs.

At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves.
3040	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Richard Marx has this unique ability with his voice and his songwriting to capture these really beautiful human emotions, which certainly wasn't the standard of the rather plastic and superficial music scene of the 1980's. Marx strikes again with "Endless Summer Nights." It tells the very intimate story of a summer love that for whatever reason is not going on anymore. We've all had these summer loves that stamp our lives in some way. There's this very real feeling--question really of where did it go? You wake up one morning and its' gone. There's a very proud tradition in this arena, but with cool mournful lyrics and vocal tones, Endless Summer Nights stands away from the others.

139	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, "thinking man's" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.

8138	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Generally speaking, I have an extremely low opinion of the entire rap genera, but a small few pieces I give exception to. This is one of those works. "My Dick" is nothing but pure crass comic genius. It doesn't sample the tracks of songs far greater than it, it doesn't labor to spin some BS thug life fable, nor does it try to be anything other than what it is. What it acomplishes is laying down old school rap with only one concern; busting out awesome rhymes, and doing so in fantastic comedic fashion. The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is my aforementioned bias against rap in general.

I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably "Sweet Adoration," "Can You Reach My Friend?" "Sincerely Yours" and "You Light Up My Life." Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, "Love Letters In The Sand."

The fact that there are no surf songs, electronic semi-ballads or drugged out eastern tinged epics could be seen as boring, indicating a lack of variety and an unwillingness to break any new ground. Conversely, it can be viewed as the band concentrating on what they do best, uncomplicated by external factors and delivering only the hard rock, giving only big riffs, gnarly solos and attitude filled vocals.

What I find curious, still, is that even after Cher returned to Warner Brothers in the late '90s for the biggest album of her career, that her four Warner Brothers albums from the 1970s (including "Two The Hard Way" with Gregg Allman) remained unavailable.  In my "man on the street" opinion, these albums would have sold quite well if released after "Believe" became a blockbuster.  Also, let's not forget the two songs Cher recorded with Phil Spector after her split with Sonny, and her duet with Nilsson, released on Spector/WB Records.

143	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.

6340	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	"The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World is a positive song about having the self-confidence to see your own beauty and great qualities in yourself regardless of what others may think. This musical gem also serves as a reminder to do the best you can, and to be patient when allowing in all of the good in your life. I also appreciate that the message of the song is to also know that it is important to avoid giving power to what others may say or think (also the added insight to be and see your own brilliance regardless of if others would). Last, but not least, this energetic and fun musical track sends a great message about being emotionally strong (thick-skinned), and to project your personal power with your best effort while simultaneously being aware that everything in your life is going to be just fine. My favorite part of the song with the following lyrics communicates this meaning in a strong manner:
Is "Stabbing The Drama" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album. Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, and one of 2005's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to Soilwork's older albums, but if you're a true Soilwork fan, or just have a great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.

7406	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Like everything The Temptations did this is an under rated masterpiece.  I had seen them perform this song live and to watch the group not only sing but the choreography was incredible.  The Temptations were always a top notch singing group and although "Lady Soul" never did as well as many of their early hits, to me it's a fine example of how a singing group can change with the times and still have the ambience they always had.

7682	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I like this album, though not as much as acoustic soul. I agree with other reviewers that the lyrical content of the cd is not as creative or profound as her first effort.  I was hoping for more inspirational lyrics. this time around, it seems that India has fallen in love and has to tell the world about it. There is nothing wrong with love songs but i expected more than that from her. Her praises for a man gets a little tired. Overall, this is a pleasant CD to listen to. My favarite song is "Talk to her". Anyone who enjoyed her first Cd will enjoy this one. Just don't  look for profound musings and lyrics on Voyage to India.

Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album...."Back Down", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.

Then Diana Ross begins to sing... and her voice *alone* is brilliant.  It sounds so tender with *just* the right hoarse sound.  Like a young woman who's finally had enough of having someone hold her down, so she's going to stand up and express exactly how she feels.  Like she's on stage and it's her turn to speak, or sing in this case, what's on her mind.  I actually never noticed she had a hoarse voice until recently and it's more noticeable in her early days when she was younger.  I LOVE it!

Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, "The Essential Michael Jackson" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.
Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.

It's nothing that special, but the hardcore Janet fans will want this for their collection, to see where it all started. Released in 1982, this album shows us where she started in her music career. The music isn't that bad, the production is classic Jackson production, there's actually some really funky stuff here. "Say You Do" and "You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine)" are classic 80's pop/R&B. "Young Love" is pretty funky too. There's some ballads, "Love and My Best Friend", "Forever Yours", etc. Other good tracks include "Don't Mess Up This Good Thing", "The Magic Is Working" and "Come Give Your Love To Me". Overall its not her strongest, far from it, but its worthwhile to have. It's a fun album essentially.

The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster.

Like many AC/DC fans who collect bootlegs from the band, or have rare live tracks in our collections, it's going to be hard for AC/DC to top a lot of the #1 fav live versions between 1974 and present. But this album is still great for us collectors, even those who have heard these same set-lists a million times before, with a few of the new songs thrown in the mix, but this album has a lively crowed that may not speak English too well, but they do know how to scream and humm along to the tunes, making them unique crowed interaction versions of AC/DC's classics preformed at River Plate in 2009/10?
Ain't no river wide enough
As usual with Massive  releases, "Mezzanine" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  "Teardrop" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky "Dissolved Girl,"  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica.

9491	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play "Amarillo By Morning," and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to "Amarillo by Morning."

There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.

949	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	When it came down to what Duran Duran has had in music, they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled about them in song. Still, they had crossed over nicely in the 90's with the music from The Wedding Album, and some of the songs still ignite today like they did back in the 90's. Ordinary World is absolutely no exception. The song is definitely one of their better songs that the group had came out with. I love the rhythm of the song from start to finish. It is definitely one of their better songs they had came out with. If you are absolutely new to Duran Duran's music, this is a great song to download, and if you are a hard core fan of Duran Duran, you'll fall in love with this song and that is a ordinary world.

No other American comic seems as adept at pointing out our endless national foibles yet making them seem so endearingly moronic. Hot Pockets is pricelessly funny; I almost fall over laughing every time I hear it. In fact, to avoid that today I woke up and decide to start the week off right by laying in bed five minutes longer and listening to Hot Pockets on headphones. As usual I cracked up time and again, but was fortunately unable to fall over. I did roll over a few times though. Any comedian who can make me crack up time and again at the same bit is clearly doing something right. Bill Hicks and Carlin and Chris Rock can, and a very few others. Jim's in that small group, no doubt.

_Stabbing the Drama_ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums (NBC/FNF) but the writing on the whole seems stronger. Heck, this band's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion, they write GREAT catchy metal songs, their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist. The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band's main direction for the last while, and if you take the last three albums as a class, this is the most well-rounded and best-written accomplishment of those. but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end (i haven't heard the newest one, _Sworn to a Great Divide_)

"Fade To Black" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out.
5513	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I have been a fan of this band for a while, my only problem was I didn't really want to buy all the cd's just to get a few songs that I liked, then all of a sudden this pops up on Amazon and I wait till I got it at a great price and it has all the songs I like on it , and it has a few I never knew the names of the songs but I knew the songs.

7746	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Our whole family loves Eminem, especially his funny songs.  I don't make explicit content "taboo" to my kids over 10, my feeling is that if you make something taboo, they'll want it even MORE.  So we don't make a big deal out of it (not like they've never heard the words before and c'mon, they're just WORDS).  This is another great song, by a great singer.  Period!
The album cover shows a sun appearing in a hazy red sky. The only thing hazy about these compositions are the images you get in your head. The music is certainly nothing hazy, or unorganized, or played lazily, or ANYTHING like that- this is just a straight up perfect example of jazz that at one point in time wasn't afraid to be as experimental as possible.
Although it may not appear to be the case, this Verve release was remastered (albeit a low budget remaster), and the sound quality is very good.  There are a few photos of the band and a lengthy bit of "cosmic" verse from Neville Potter.  The imagery of the words is both colorful and evocative.
And just to throw in some humor, it's fun to misinterpret a line near the end that is a popular misheard lyric- "In the UFO!"  No Diana is actually saying "In the you and I" and the Supremes providing their own vocals makes it easy to misunderstand what is actually being sung here.  BUT!  If you consider the odd sound effects that appear on at least two occasions (in the beginning and when Diana sings the line "happiness you took from me and left me alone with only memories" and the line near the end "I see a dream that's lost from the hurt you have caused") you could actually be led to believe she's singing about UFO's, haha.
Song: A
This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?
The other songs aren't bad. "I don't care" is a fun rocker in the style of his earlier ones, but the vocals don't relay the fun. "Part-time love" is the best of the rest, a pumpy little tune with a big production. Not a bad album, Rating **1/4 or 2.25

240	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  "Bonnie Pointer" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, "Heaven Must Have Sent You".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7" and 12" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, "Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, "a step back for the feminist movement."  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  "Put love's chains back on me..."
Before I heard their music, I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band; but then, on an impulse buy, I gave "Stabbing the Drama" a listen. And when I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. This C.D. isn't 100% new or innovative, but it's melodic, and that's quite refreshing in this day and age.

192	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  "Make It Last" has the same lushness of songs like "You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)" from Round 2.  "Payback Is A Dog" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  "Love Comes Easy" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  "Rockin' Roll Baby" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo "I Won't Give You Up."  Then we have a great jam with the slower "Let Them Work It Out," which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is "Could This Be The End."  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.

Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.

In the "slow side", Babyface's "I'll Make Love to you" set a record for the length of time at #1. "On Bended Knee" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and "Water Runs Dry" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic "Yesterday" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.

Part of it is definitely the humor itself.  Whether his jokes make bizarre 180's ("I used to smoke.  Yeah.  Smoking's real addictive.  But you know what's REALLY addictive?  Heroin."), or whether their humor lies in their dead ends; whether they take the "didja ever notice?" concept and snap it in half (his "Hot Pocket" and bottled water/Mexican food bits are a good example of this), or whether they're just plain crude, grouchy, silly and dumpy, they all stand up to repeated listenings.  There are a few times where you get the impression that the joke -- such as his bit on glasses -- would work a lot better if you could see the man (and, in fact, most of them are like that; Jim is almost as much fun to watch as he is to listen to), but none of them fail to be laugh-worthy because of it.  Pasty, flabby, and grumpy, though he may be, Jim Gaffigan is also a funny, funny man, and this is a funny, funny CD.

The reason why I listen to this song almost everyday during Christmastime is because it's so funny and over-the-top. It's really a very tragic song (at least the lyrics are) but it's sung to sound funny and even rather screwballish. I remember there was a music-video made for it that VH1 used to show during Christmastime. My favorite part of the song is when Dr. Elmo asks deadpan: should we open up her gifts or send them back?

3419	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Obviously this is another song I downloaded for my bunny!! It's kind of a sexier version of the song, but still a little peppy. It's funny because every time I give my bunny a bath, I always sing it to her, and she has a rubber duckies that makes that sound. It was so great to see it on the list of free songs Amazon was offering, and I played the sample, got nod of approval, downloaded, and STOMP! I got the "Where is my tubby"? look, and the rest, as they say, is history. I think Mosie (my bunny), is one of the few small pets who loves a tubby, as it's always a fight to get her out. She used to just sit in tub watching TV, and I would sing while washing her. Now, I play this and have to have duck ready to squeeze along with song, and it was fascinating to watch her make the connection between words & sounds in song, and her tubby and duck! Yes, I do catch myself singing it around the house, but it is really for Mosie, and it's amazing how much she connects to certain songs, and the different versions. Definitely glad I got this!!!
This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including "I'll Be There", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.

I had a little light bulb moment like, hey, I should hop on Amazon and buy that song! Sometimes I forget how easy it is these days to just own a song you really like. What can I say? I was born in the 70's! We had to buy everything on cassette tape or try to catch the song on the radio and press Record at the right time! Honestly, this is so much easier!

To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:
4822	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Typically I like two kinds of music, very old blues and very loud new rock. I stumbled across this song for the first time a few months ago and just loved it. While it's not old blues, it has some serious heart in it, like many of the the old blues do. Johnny Lang sings is with a ton of soul. A song about a guy who knows a relationship isn't working out, she's moving on, but he isn't ready to let go. He wants to stay together, closing his eyes to what's going on right behind his back, and not yet accept the inevitable. Great song with some deep meaning.

When Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kill-Em-All/dp/B000002H5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kill 'Em All</a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM ("New Wave of British Heavy Metal") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/On-Through-the-Night/dp/B000001F7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">On Through the Night</a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..

Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype. In fact, if you're in your car playing it to the end, you may just feel like playing the whole album again. While the lyrical content may not break any new ground, 50 Cent, whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay-Z, 2Pac, and Mase, knows how to deliver it WELL. See "Gotta Make it to Heaven" (an otherwise played-out subject matter with gangsta rappers), where he gives the topic an interesting twist, and "In the Club", where he takes topics like cars, drinks, and women and make them sound original. Fans may say that song sounds radio-friendly, but he didn't go to mainstream, mainstream went to him.

 While more extensive, this anthology is far from  perfect however.  "Lead On" and "King Of The Mountain" (the latter barely  scraped into the top 20) drag along unmelodically and are slower than  molasses.  Some of the other singles seem like rewrites of old Strait hits  ("I Can Still Make Cheyenne" recalling "Amarillo By Morning" and  "Adalida"  bringing to mind "The Love Bug").  With "Carrying Your Love With Me" and  "Carried Away," Strait even repeats himself within the same collection.

And how amazing is it that they thought to write a song about justifying infidelity.  I had no idea for decades until recently - something so hurtful is delivered so prettily and then the comeback by the female counterpart.  It's a song that give so much pleasure in a soothing, relaxing sweet way and the message of two-sided infidelity and self-excusing is something lethal that probably flies right over most people's heads hence its success.
But The Fox is a surprise. Although it is not an experimental album, fairly straight-forward, it is still a very inspired album. From the sleazy-journo ode 'Heart's in the right p;ace' to classical music 'Carla Etude' and the all-our rocking opener 'Breaking down barriers', the songs on 'The Fox' are very solid and enjoyable. There is also a lot of diversity here too. Rating 3 1/2 or 3 3/4 or something like that, worth rounding up.

141	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!
Being somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid, I admit it's a little hard to start on Amazon.  (I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper's "All Through the Night" before I got the hang of it.)  If you write down the directions, it is easy after your first download and capture.  So pay attention and "Don't do as I do, do as I say!"  Having the will and way, I am happy to take the Amazon MP3 Player plunge.  Give it a try and you will, too.

He showed everybody who he was, a tough rapper from Queens, and he actually had something to say. His only beef here was with Ja Rule, and that was actually pretty entertaining, especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem, Nate Dogg, and the G Unit family. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre, which is terrible, and whatever else he makes from this point on.

 The two new singles contribute in  mixed degrees to the Strait legacy.  Recent chart-topper "The Best Day" is  nice, but it also seems too similar to some old hits ("Love Without End,  Amen," "Check Yes Or No)."  Here our protagonist progresses through a love  for camping, cars, and finally, his ideal woman.  Much better is "Murder On  Music Row," a duet with Alan Jackson.  This mega-event pairing of two of  modern country's most traditional (and successful) artists is an  effectively acidic lament on the predominantly pop sound of today's  country....

Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.

It is one of the decades signature tunes by one of the era's signature bands. One indication of a song's greatness is the number of cover versions performed and which artists performed them. "Dear Mr. Fantasy" was covered by the likes of the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I would recommend this song to any fan of the Classic Rock genre.

4907	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	50 Cent's 2nd album "Get Rich or Die Trying" is worthy of all the hype surronding it. Finally 50 has got the backing (Aftermath/Shady), and the beats needed to make an excellent album. 50 has come a long way since "How to Rob", remember first hearing him on "In Too Deep Soundtrack" and I knew then he would blow one day. Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasn't sold out on anything. Executive Produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem, with guest appearances coming from Em, G-Unit members- Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lyoyd Banks, and the king of sick R&B hooks Nate Dogg. Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: "Patiently Waiting" Feat. Eminem, "Many Men", lead single "In Da Club", "High All the Time", "If I can't" and the relaxed banging "21 Questions" feat. Nate Dogg" and the adrenaline laced "Gotta Make it to Heaven". The 3 bonus tracks "Wanksta" (8 Mile soundtrack), "U Not Like Me" and "Life's on the Line" close off the album well. Full of tight Production, entertaining lyrics and blazing beats "Get Rich or Die Trying" is one of those albums people are going be bumping for years to come.

I think Jonathan and Darlene Edwards had the harder task, both musically, and as comedians, but they could always have the perspective in life that they had a goof, enjoyed it, made some money, and did it with purpose; you can even hear them winking in their recordings.  I do think they are funny, but in a very different way from how Mrs. Miller is funny.  My coworker was right about one thing:  Mrs. Miller was Grandma.  And you might laugh WITH her and even AT her when her back was turned, but never would you sneer at her face to face.  No, you want to give her a hug, because somehow these crazy, one-of-a-kind creations exemplify the best that comedy has to offer.  I completely disagree with those who say that laughing at Mrs. Miller's music is cruel.  I think Mrs. Miller might have understood, had she lived to witness her digital revival, that she had created something entertaining and unique, even if it wasn't taken as she had intended.  Nothing to be ashamed of there, and if her life was in some ways tragic, its legacy is not the least bit sad.

All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.

There are a few different Burl Ives Christmas CD's on the market and so I encourage you to check them out to see which one you like the best.  This is a very very good one.  The version of "Holly Jolly Christmas" here is NOT version from the famous cartoon.  This version is much slower than the famous version, but is equally good.  Whichever CD you choose, if you're going to play Christmas music, you ought to have a Burl Ives CD along with your Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby CDs.

"Little Things" is an okay song for a first single, but there are better songs than that on here. Check out the two highlights, "Good Man", where India tells a story about a man who tells his wife to remember him if he dies someday, and "Talk to Her" (which is still very preachy), where India tells men to respect their women. The latter, as well as a few other songs, features Laurnea, who's been M.I.A. from the industry for a while. Where did India find her??? Even as a backup singer, she shines like she always did.

According to my husband, this song has been around for ever (I just never heard it--I must have been living under a rock). I like gwen stefani, I find that she has an interesting vocal range that a lot of her contemporaries do not (ie Fergie, Pink). She has a distinct voice and I really like that.

5520	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This Calendar/Kirshner Lp,AKA "Sugar,Sugar" as a Reissue in 1970) Was the sophmore Lp by the Cartoon Group The Archies (Jeff Barry,Ellie Greenwich,Andrew Jokchim[Kim] and Toni Wine)..It reached #1 on the wings of "Sugar,Sugar",the single that knocked off The Hollies' "The Air That I Breathe" out of the #1 spot in the UK in 1969! There's not a bad track here..Everything's Primo stuff here! But,aside from a CD made by RKO/Unique,mislabeled on the covers as "The Archies",there has been no TRUE Reissue of the original Lp on CD with its cover..This has changed,however,with this Custom-Made CD-R! It's better than the RKO/Unique CD,especially on "Sugar"..The tapes on that CD were considerbly slower and on the track I've just mentioned,the tape source was muddied in its sound! EWW! But,here,it's been cleaned up! Also,the Original CD had Spots of Drop-Outs in certain songs,mainly on "Melody Hill"..It was Super-Annoying! But,here,again,cleaned up! I LOVE THIS!
This whole album is terrific; not a bad song in the bunch. "Say", "Missing Your Love" and "You Are" are my favorites and they should have been released as singles. I may be wrong but the only single I know that was released was "Love Calls". But I'm doing my part: whenever I make a soul compilation for my friends, I throw in a random Kem track so they know that there are other good songs on this album. -EJR

8633	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Weezer's infamous self-titled debut (otherwise known as "The Blue Album") is one of the few pieces of music from it's time that still holds up just as well today. When they made their mark in 1994, Kurt Cobain was dead and the music world had already been oversaturated by mumbling, uninspiring grunge clones. Although Weezer never quite changed the musical climate, they did, however, create a quite perfect debut, one that transcends all genres and inspires new bands even today. Few groups that materialized at this time are still around today, but Weezer remain vital, and each song on this ten track debut remains an alternative rock staple. You can't throw a cat in a crowded room without hitting someone who, whether they realize it or not, knows a good Weezer tune. So, it only makes sense that on the tenth anniversary of the release, a Deluxe Edition made it's way with all new artwork and a bonus disc full of b-sides, outtakes, demos, live songs etc. The question is, is it worth buying again?

8494	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	I love the band and the music so much that I had to download this song. However, like so many times in the past, Amazon can't deliver good/quality mp3's to me. Half (about 20) of the mp3's I've downloaded from Amazon have audio artifacts/defects and glitches. I report them to Amazon and they refund money to me and say they will fix the problem. Weeks later I'll attempt to download the song again and it will still be defective. I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router. FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AMAZON!

But don't forget the others on these performances who contributed so much.  There are the Jordonaires (who called her a female Elvis?...well, she did have the vocal group backing her who backed many of Elvis' greatest hits) on all of the cuts; Harold Bradley's electric bass also on all of these performances; Floyd Cramer's piano on "Walkin' After Midnight", "Sweet Dreams", "Crazy", "So Wrong", "Strange", "She's Got You", and "Faded Love"; Walter Haines' steel guitar on "Walkin' After Midnight", "Crazy", "Strange", "She's Got You", and "You're Stronger Than Me".  And then there are the writers of the songs that she breathed life and emotion into:  Hank Cochran's "I Fall to Pieces", "She's Got You", "Why Can't He Be You", and "You're Stronger Than Me,"; Don Gibson's "Sweet Dreams"; Willie Nelson's "Crazy"; Carl Perkins' "So Wrong"; Mel Tillis' "Strange"; Bob Wills' "Faded Love."

9440	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play "Amarillo By Morning," and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to "Amarillo by Morning."

Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself.

Of the other songs, my favorite is Hills of Alabam. No surprise, really, as this was written and originally recorded by my favorite bluegrass singer, Claire Lynch, who adds backing vocals. Claire's own version can be found on an untitled album by the Front porch string band, of which she was lead singer. The title track is also excellent, as are Here's hoping, True north, Love chooses you and I'll take care of you.
Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen.

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording.

Other cuts are also amazing.  "Learning How to Live" is a breakup song, adjusting to loss.  "Fancy Funeral" may sound a bit bizarre, but I can attest that my daddy and I had almost an exact same conversation in 2001 when my mother passed.  The sheer force of Lucinda's anger in "Come On" puts a smile on my face as a classic bashed-breakup song, "Dude, you're so fired; shut up, I'm not inspired."  "Words" has Lucinda's voice, weathered, worn & laden taking comfort in something she likes best, writing a good song.

"Fire with Fire": The soft intro to "Battery" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, "Fire for Fire".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.

What about the record you ask? Some of you may have heard the first single title Crazy, which in my mind is also one of 2003s best. Its got a Stevie Wonder vibe, a chorus from heaven, and some hooks that make it. "Song For Your Tears" is one of my favorites combining wah-wah guitars and classical piano with Philly soul orchestration and some Stevie Ray Vaughn blues to produce a lush masterpiece. Here Javier sounds like a seasoned pro.  Hey Little Sister has a contagious Roots-crafter percussion which makes the song move and seasons Javiers infectious falsetto and song runs. Although Biggest Mistake has a boy-band ballad feel to it, its still a great song that makes it an instant classic.

"Voyage To India" then meanders into sharp beats on "The One" and "Complicated Melody," which is exactly what it says - it doesn't go anywhere. But the fall is cushioned by "Good Man" and the bonus track "Interested," which keeps Arie's soulful tradition alive.

Many have attempted to copy Patsy  Cline's vocal range or stylistic ticks; Reba McEntire, k.d. lang and Mandy  Barnett being only among the more successful. But something about ballads  brought out the pain and emotional desolation in Cline's voice that few  C&W singers then or now could match. Listen to her sing the rather  trite line "I've been so wrong for so long," and hear the sorrow,  anger and regret scribbled into her delivery. Hear her line, "You  don't love me, it's plain," and tears nearly well up as if you're  hearing this with her for the first time. Compare her reading of the line,  "I've got your memory, or has it got me?" with Jimmy Buffett's  sloppy, careless version on "Fruitcakes," and you'll see who is  the better musical caretaker.

8356	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THIS ABOUT WHY AND HOW RICKY NELSON WROTE THIS SONG... HAVE LIKED IT MORE EVERY SINCE I READ IT...
I wonder why "Second-Hand Woman" wasn't a chart-topper, as it's a more lively affair with Winwood's trademark keyboards set to a disco beat.  Some racy imagery is present with the title woman being "a slot machine to take my dime" but it is quite the danceable track.  The same holds true for the near eight minute on-the-run opus "Night Train" with its funky beats mixed with guitars, particularly a solo around the six minute mark, and the usual keyboards.  A single mix of this could've done well, but alas.
Amazing harmonies, excellent guitar playing, etc! I've always loved this song but never seemed to pick it up but for .99 cents sheesh - I've paid $15 for albums that stunk.

This is an excellent song about being concerned about a special friend in need.  The track Words is another highlight on this disc.  This is a great song about the power of  writing.  Words can truly comfort a person who is lonely, and I truly believe this.  What If is a beautiful song about the dream of peace in the world.  I could visualize the  vivid images in the song while listening to it.  Fancy Funeral is another gem on this album.  This is a very solemn song about how money does not matter when someone dies.  Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone.  The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me.  Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD.  Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship.  Doug Pettibone gives this song a nice edge playing the electric guitar here.  Jim Keltner provides a sexy deep drum beat on the track Wrap My Head Around That.  I liked all the tracks on this album very much.

Any band that has potential and wants to keep their edge and notoriety needs to experiment.  They did a beautiful job with this album, and I love every song on it.  My favorites are "Stabbing The Drama" "Nerve" and the bonus track "Wherever Thorns May Grow."  I'm not saying that those who challenge them are wrong or stupid, I'm just saying that based on your reviews, you seem to want repetition and monotony.  Sorry, but true listeners don't want that.

Highlights of the album are many and scattered throughout.  It would be easier to mention the few dead ends that are hit.  While "Just Like Belgium" is fun and lively, it really doesn't stand out amongst the other more adventursome tracks, and "Heels of the Wind" seems unneccessary, almost like an afterthought.  Big departures from his previous work are the tracks "Heart in the Right Place" with its forceful, blues-rock tone and "Fascist Faces" with the backing of the Rev James Cleveland Choir.  Both tracks are propelled by the biting, metalish guitar play of Richie Zito, which make these two of the heaviest tracks in Elton's canon.

I'm glad that there are artists like Lucinda Williams who choose to challenge themselves and their fans with each new output of work.  Those that take the ride with WEST will be rewarded with a CD of solid songs and performances that rank with the best of Lucinda's previous work.  WEST seems to me to be the end of a trilogy of work that includes her post CAR WHEELS work.  If you're not a big fan of the previous two albums, you'll more than likely be disappointed with this new one.  In that case there is always the back catalog to enjoy.  I'll be interested to see what new directions she chooses in the future, and will no doubt, continue to enjoy this CD for years to come.

We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording.

The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, "Somewhere in the Middle."  In fact, the phrase "between the altar and the door" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.

80	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, "But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?"  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!

As for this disc, Sugarland knows how to craft music that is rather appealing to a mass audience.  They meld traditional country, folk rock and pop to make a sound that fits comfortably somewhere between Kenny Chesney's fluff and Allison Krause's commercial bluegrass.  The first three singles from this album, "Baby Girl," "Something More," and "Just Might(Make Me Believe)" ring true of contemporary pop country, but songs like the title track and "Small Town Jericho" show that this group does have a little more weight to them than most johnny-come-lately's.

"Leavin' on Your Mind" is an incredibly fine tune that gets the royal treatment from Patsy Cline and "When You Need a Laugh" is a real gem! "Back in Baby's Arms" has a great sound to it as do the other numbers here and songs like "Faded Love" make me wish so badly that Patsy was still with us. "Always" is a classic for sure and the album ends with two splendid songs, Harlan Howard's "He Called Me Baby" and Don Gibson's "Sweet Dreams (Of You)."

It has all the elements to make it radio-friendly, from the catchiness, to the dancing, to the aspect that makes me karaoke to this song everytime it comes on. Amazingly, this song also sounds better censored too, the language in the original seems out of place and downright weird, but the 'phhh' in this version actually adds to the song.
Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.

5959	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	There is no question that this year marks Elton John's 45th Anniversary since he & Bernie Taupin met and became one of the most definitive songwriting teams in the world. There have been so many classics that have been so strong for both of them. But of all of them from the 80's, the one that stands out intimately the most is Sacrifice from his 1989 album Sleeping With The Past. It is a very classic piano ballad that sits well, where in a era of songs that were tacky and not as strong from Elton, because of his abuse and marriage ended, it still stands absolutely tall from Elton in voice and harmony. If you're new to Elton John, this is a nice download as well as for die hard Elton John fans, and that is a sacrifice worth taking.

For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow.

CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from "Bad" and 7 from "Dangerous", and finishes off with "You Are Not Alone" from HIStory and "You Rock My World" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is "Scream", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.


This is one of those songs that you can search the Internet and find a "free" copy, but I wanted a version that the artist got rewarded for his/her work.
And after the solemnities of "Ys," apparently Newsom has decided to go a bit more lighthearted. "Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band" is an unpretentious little EP, with some new songs and new takes on older songs -- a fun little treat.

The many years have passed, all those "hard core" bands AND my peers that were so quick to judge, well, EVERYTHING, are now a bunch of has been's or losers. Now, every time I hear the song I like it a little bit more. Especially accompanying the Young Guns movies. The songs were just SO made for those vids. Now I have them on my MP3 mix.

(For the uninitiated, TAKE NOTE:  Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon.  Download the complimentary starter song they offer (You may say, "I didn't order that!" Notice it says "Free Download" to start your format.  Then, play the song from its selected option.  (See if your Windows Media Player  plays it and capture it in your library.)  When it does and you've captured it, you're in business. Then, you can download songs off Amazon.  (I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them.  Make sure you hear the version of the song you want.

8703	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	When it has came down to Sting's songwriting, he has shown a lot for his solo work, but that also worked very well with the intimacy of The Police, and the way they captured a beautiful sound. The songs from Rock and Pop still have stood the test of time, nearly 30 years after their last record Synchronicity. But out of all the songs the trio had done, the one that has stood the test of time and beyond in Every Breath You Take. It is definitely one of the most iconic songs of all time that has put words beyond what could ever be said. I like the song not only because of the rhythm, but it really takes me back to a time when music was really becoming all about fads in the 80's, but this songs goes beyond the fads, and stays true to the song. Sting may have wrote it in regards to a divorce, but the song is definitely a must download for any Police fan, or for anyone who had never heard their music before.

Ne-Yo has that same quality. Though scary for a song writer to step in front of the curtain, Ne-Yo came out swinging with this one. He deemed to be in touch with his sensitive side and though this is a break up song (broken up) it's melody makes you happy and it makes you want to fall in love all over again. It's the happy - sad song...I love it great sing along song...
The guitars are fiery and crunchy, but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears. Singer Bjorn Strid doesn't quite have a soulful voice, but it is tuneful and quite impressive. He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean. Sometimes, as is the case with tracks five and six, he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy.

There's a wonderful interplay of songs as Reggae is music of what I call equal opposites.  This is displayed constantly in the writings of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  From songs like "Burnin' and Lootin'" to "Put It On" and "Duppy Conqueror" to "Reincarnated Souls."  All 3 men were able to, at the same time, be revolutionary and spiritual, fighers and lovers, Rastafarians and Rebels as they saw one as the other and all inclusive.  The songs they wrote were both complex yet simple, deep with practial meanings and applications for everyday life for everyday people.

I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.

It has that 80's New York blues feel to it and plays with chord progressions that move in unexpected places; making a melody that is both complex and familiar. Elton's singing is at its best here. The song takes me to places when I hear it. He sings like a smooth and mellow crooner, giving a little edge just where the song needs it. I am baffled this track wasn't included in any of the greatest hits collections. It was a top ten song on the UI.K. and and top 15 in the U.S.

9147	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  "I'll Make Love to You" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions "On Bended Knee."  Only on "Water Runs Dry" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?

On "West" (13 tracks, 69 min.), Lucinda Williams sings about her usual topics of relationships, loss, loneliness, heartache. She also confronts the death of her mother ("Mama You Sweet" and "Fancy Funeral"). The opener "Are You Alright" sets the tone for the album: a slow-tempo, aching song in which she wonders what has become of an old flame. There are not many up-tempo songs on here, which may bother some people, but it doesn't bother me as in the end this is a mood album. Highlights for me include "Unsuffer Me", which is the best song on this album; the bitter yet funny "Come On"; the epic 9+ Min. "Wrap My Head Around That"; the sweet "Words"; and the title track, which closes the album. The CD I bought came also with a 2 song (11 min.) bonus CD, which brings demo versions of "Where Is My Love" and "Rescue". Nice, but not really essential.

It showcases another tremendous step forward for the band as their famous lineup in clinched with the addition of Al DiMeola on guitar and Chick Corea's first use of the synthesizer,in this case a moog. A little under half these tracks over consist of 1-2 minute varriations on the title track and tracks like White's "The Shadow Of Lo" and Chicks own "Song To The Pharoah Kings" do run on a bit longer but in terms of virtuoso musicianship know no equal of course,even if they don't make very easy casual listening. Clarke's opener "Vulcan Worlds" (a theme he'd return to the same on his&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stanley-Clarke/dp/B0000025KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stanley Clarke</a>&nbsp;album) is one of two exciting and emotionally stimulating tunes here-the theme is expressed very loudly on a very prickly sounding moog. On "Earth Juice" Clarke focuses more on his bass playing and they even return to musical ideas as expressed on the previous album on "Return To The Seventh Galaxy". While many of these songs are slower and often sweeter then the high octane music featured on their last album this recording has just as much going for it overall.
Heard the song many years ago and still like it very much.

To me, this music is what I call "happy music" as it seems to bring back only happy memories.  Level 42 has a unique sound that, to my knowledge, has not been successfully duplicated by any other group.  Must have.
I had no idea this song was on Elton John's record "Honky Chateau."  I knew it was an Elton John song, and that it was featured in Cameron Crowe's movie "Almost Famous."  I also knew I loved it.  It is both plaintive and reassuring, talking about the confusion that life can bring about and how it throws a mass of people together in society.  "Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters" is one of Elton John's all-time classic songs.

After releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today.
8883	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Vince Gill has always and will always be a great singer and intertainer when he sings gospel you can't help but listen. bravo
"Fade to Black" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a "suicide classic".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.

4872	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Yeah it's true that this was the most overrated release of 2003. But it's also true that this was the best album that he has ever made(next to Guess Who's Back). Every wack album after this proves it. In Da Club was a huge record for him and Many Men, Wanksta, What Up Gangsta pretty much kept this album afloat. Eminem makes two dominating appearances on here(Patiently Waiting and Dont Push Me). Eminem floored 50 on Patiently Waiting and Both Em and Lloyd Banks leave 50 in the dust in Dont Push Me. Back Down while overrated was a good diss record towards Ja Rule and Murda Inc but they could have kept Alex Thomas fruit basket a** off of the record though. Gotta Make It Heaven is tight as well as the three bonus tracks: Wanksta, U Not Like Me and Life's On The Line. Contrary to popular belief this album is not a classic. Blood Hound feat Young Buck is weak. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo is straight garbage and Poor Lil Rich, P.I.M.P., and 21 Question feat Nate Dogg have filler written all over them. By the way, the bonus DVD is not worth mentioning. Other than that, this album was good but way overhyped. Even though GRODT is overrated in comparison to what came after it, GRODT is one of the few G-unit releases worth mentioning. Standouts: WHAT UP GANGSTA, PATIENTLY WAITING, MANY MEN(WISH DEATH), IN DA CLUB, HEAT, IF I CANT, BACK DOWN, DONT PUSH ME, GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN, U NOT LIKE ME and LIFE'S ON THE LINE.

You're Only Lonely - J.D. Souther
"The Call of Ktulu" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer "Orion" off "Master of Puppets", but this song is definitely a great one, too.
Produced by veteran Hal Willner, WEST takes a quantum leap from her previous releases by taking arrangements far beyond where her previous music went.  Saving the vocals and guitar from demos, the songs are built up layer by layer with strings and keyboards and various session players including Jim Keltner and Bill Frisell to create music quite different from her past efforts.  The good news is that the production is not camouflage for weak material.  Williams has delivered a solid set of tunes, at times harrowing, as she pokes at he emotional scabs of broken relationships and the death of her mother.  I can see how this material will put some off, when they are looking for material closer to CAR WHEELS regional sketches.  Still, you cannot deny the solid songwriting on songs like WHERE IS MY LOVE, WORDS (a ode to her poetic muse) and ARE YOU ALRIGHT?  Other songs like UNSUFFER ME, RESCUE and the talking blues/rap of WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT move into new territory, to my ears at least, with great success.

Great song. Gary Portnoy also wrote the theme to Punky Brewster, at the time I used to think the song, like Punky (she's grown into a lovely young woman) was cute, and at times it felt a bit cheesy but as I hear it today that song actually makes me miss those cheesy days.

Its worth getting this album for that track alone, although if you are download friendly then you could shortcut that process and simply purchase the track all by itself.

It took me a LONG time to notice there's a speedy bass section playing in the background, and what appears to be a violin or string section playing a few notes rapidly for a few seconds during the above mentioned tempo change.  It's brief and easy to not notice unless you're playing REALLY close attention.  And how about the orchestration at the 1:50 mark?  It's now very demanding and seems to illustrate Diana's emotions all coming to a head and she's either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or realizing that she needs to ditch her troubled past as soon as possible.  This is ANOTHER really powerful moment.  Granted, my interpretation probably isn't the same as Diana's, but that's okay- we all interpret music differently.

4906	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	50 Cent has surprisingly went from "Most Hated" to "Most Anticipated" to "Most Celebrated". You may remember him from 1999's single, "How to Rob an Industry N", where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey (who was on his label, Columbia) while ribbing them at the same time. Not many artists found that funny, the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia (maybe it wasn't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates???). During his downtime, he made many foes, including Jay-Z (in 1999's "It's Hot", Jigga rapped, "I'm about the dollar/WTF is 50 Cent?"), and I think that he's even been shot more times than 2Pac.

72	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in "Billie Jean." That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into "Bad," opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire "Dangerous," which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.

There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of "Bridge" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful "Out of Mind," the ominous "Lady Jane," and the hard rock trappings of "Disconnected" are all great. The true standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, "Someone Else?" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps.

Although the first track'"Growth," is an interlude opening up the second chapter in Arie's anthology, this record, in many senses, is more of a continuation of the previous rather than an evolution of the artist.
273	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Growing up, I was raised on all kinds of music, none of it Motown. But secretly, I loved the stuff, and would listen to it and sing to it all the time. And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience (simply because that's the area where I live -- out in the country!) And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's "Superstition," I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do "You Make Me Feel Brand New" by the Stylistics (because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself,) people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments. If you can pull it off vocally, then you really owe it to your audience, and to yourself, to share this wonderful love ballad with the world.
7537	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This new one from foxy puts her back where she left off on Ill na na(her first cd) but in a whole new way. A lot of people thought she would fall off or come back weak on this but she came from left field with some of these tracks. This time she brought a lot of reggae, dancehall, some soca and even indian music to the plate. Some of the tightest tracks on this is where she raps with dancehall beats. Hearing foxy chant in jamacian puts her on a whole different level now and no other female mc right now can do it better. The way that she flows from rap to reggae makes it look a lot easier than it is. There is one song call "so Hot" where she shows her trini roots with a calypso style beat that sounds different to anything out now. Bk Anthem has one of the hardest and tightest beats that you can play on the set. On songs the leter she apologizes to her family and different people she hurt. On broken silence she lets you knwo what she has been goign through all this time. Fallin and 730 pust some rumors to an end liek jay-z writing some of her rhymes. She admits it saying "Yeah I did, but I blew um up the same". "Tables will turn" is anotehr tight song that I think is on of the tightest on the cd...produced by regage producer Dave kelly. In regage dave kelly is the equivalent of timbaland in hip-hop so she couldn't get any better with him. The songs I like the most are: Oh Yeah, Bk Anthem, The letter, 730, tables will turn, hood scriptures, run dem, na na be like, so hot, and teh saddest day. Overall I think foxy came strong for her third time around. I like this one better than chyna doll overall as a album. There is a lot of singles I can see droping from this.

9441	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I grew up in rural West Texas, where pretty well the best weekend evenings are spent in small dancehalls and at the dances at local festivals. The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play "Amarillo By Morning," and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to "Amarillo by Morning."
India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'. She COULD be on the same level as a Tracy or a Lauryn but the  bland R&B that dominates this album doesn't do much for both the listener or her.
Having said that, there are some drawbacks.  Fans who already own all her releases will find absolutely nothing new here.  All nineteen tracks have been previous released.  While they have been digitally remastered to sound better, I must admit I don't notice the difference.  Of course, when you are getting almost an hour and twenty minutes of music, this is being picky.

1692	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely gorgeous. Though the Kings of Convenience's first album is not "electronic" in the strictest sense (or in any sense), there's still no denying the utter beauty of this album. The first track on the album, "Winning a Battle, Losing the War," is my favorite, full of shimmering guitars and pensive lyrics; the track doesn't explodes as much as it blossoms right at the end. "Singing Softly to Me" throws in some trumpet to emphasize the call-and-response of the song, while "I Don't Know What I Can Save You From" adds a mournful cello towards the end, as if underlining the futility of the situation. The haunting melodies and the powerful lyrics get under your skin and stick in your head. An underlying melancholy lies at the heart of some of the outstanding tracks like "The Weight of My Words," "Little Kids," and the powerful closing tracks, "The Passenger" and "Parallel Lines." The album titles says it all: QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD.

7655	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	This is such a wonderful effort. It consists of mostly ballads, but Johnny Gill pulls it off on all the songs.  Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying true to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him.

What proves this band had a knack for totally absorbing into your emotional state of mind is perfectly summed up in the way Diana sings the line "I'm all alone now, no love to shield me, trapped in a world of distorted reality".  Suddenly, during this particular line, the song shifts in a VERY different direction as Diana stands alone.  What was once suspenseful tension building courtesy of both Diana Ross and the Supremes NOW feels like someone who's soul has been crushed to the point that whenever they think about their past, they feel cold and angry.  If my words aren't clear, this is one EXTREMELY powerful tempo change but the lyrics tell a story with such ease that it's easy to not acknowledge what a spectacular moment of the song this is.

And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.

It is filled with great uptempo, complex arrangments like, "Breaking Down Barriers" and"Fascist Faces".  "Just Like Belgium" is one of Elton's most upbeat romantic songs since the mid-seventies and "Carla/Etude/Fanfare" (which runs into) "Chloe" is a testament to Elton John's creativity.  However, the best song on the album and the only single, "Nobody Wins" beats out the rest for arrangment, lyrics and heartfelt tearjerking.  Amazingly, this single is omitted from all collections.  I wish someone would explain this mystery to me.

As a perfect follow-up to "Kill 'Em All" the sophomore album "Ride the Lighting" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.

6310	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	The reunion of the "very tall band" whet my appetite for the first meeting.  Musically, it doesn't disappoint.  From the very first track, "On Green Dolphin Street," Oscar plays with uncommon yet swinging economy and restraint, drawing the listener in as on few other recordings (he's clearly showing the influence of both Bill Basie and John Lewis).  And when he does finally explode with a torrent of notes, he's neither intrusive nor overwhelming.  In fact, he's all but perfect as a complementary and solo voice on this remarkable session.  And Bags is, as usual, the master of bop and blues, a peerless player of the instrument when it comes to playing a vibraharp with two mallets (Gary Burton would cut the rotators, add two more mallets, and take the instrument in a different direction).  As recently as 5 years earlier, Milt was still playing with fast-spinning rotators, but by the time of this session his distinctive sound is firmly in place.  (To a previous reviewer who made reference to the MJQ, if you really want to hear the MJQ minus John Lewis, check out "Bags and Trane.")

7719	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Last Mango In Paris is a classic Jimmy Buffett album.  After the fairly putrid Riddles In The Sand, he comes back strong with the perfect mix of satire and Caribbean rhythms.  He is at his storytelling best in songs like "Frank & Lola", "Desperation Samba", the hilariously heartbreaking "If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me", the superb title track and the adventurous "Gypsies In The Palace" (which has Harrison Ford on the bullwhip).  "Jolly Mon Sing" has taken a life of it's own becoming the basis for children's book he wrote with his daughter.  It may well be the pinnacle of his calypso songs.  Last Mango In Paris is often forgotten, but essential Jimmy Buffett album.

Stevie Wonder was deep into his Funk classics like You Haven't Done Nothin' and Boogie On Reggae Woman when he first heard Chaka Khan & Rufus and the word is, virtually on-the-spot, wrote Tell Me Something Good for her.

  That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.

The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.

He sings about letting things happen in their own time, missing your lover, wanting to be with your lover, cherishing moments, finding peace, and so on. It's a mixture of jazz and r&b/soul. I highly recommend this album to everyone.
As another reviewer correctly notes, most of the songs on this CD were written by Antonio Carlos Jobim. He remains one of the most gifted musicians and composers to this day. I also especially liked Astrud Gilberto's singing in "The Girl From Ipanema" and "Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars)." Yes, Astrud sometimes sang flat; but it is no matter here. It works beautifully to have her singing along with the music.

Look, "Voyage To India" makes India to be more of a "Black-girl" version of bland, "folk" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being "bootylicious" or partying or "her man" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on "Voyage" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not "deep".

8018	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	In my mind, this CD is what east coast hip hop should sound like.  This album had an impact in that was summed up well by one reviewer that said: "When this album dropped in '96, everybody's ears perked up a bit and heads turned."  This was one of those albums that you could turn on and just zone out to.  Tracks like "The Yearn", "Music Makes Me High", and "Get Up" were sure to get any party started while cuts like "Legal Drug Money", "All Right", "Straight From The Ghetto", and "1,2,3" were equally effective tales of ghetto life.  Then you throw in classics tracks like "Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz, & Benz", "Lifestyles Of The Rich & Shameless", and "Renee" and you have as good a rap album as you're gonna find on the east coast.  Even the intro is hot without taking all day to get to the point.  This is easily the best album released by the Lost Boyz.  It seems that Mr Cheeks leads the charge while Freaky Tah picks up the slack.  Tah doesn't rhyme much, but he does manage to spit a few bars on "Legal Drug Money", "The Yearn", "All Right", and "1,2,3".  And when he's not rhyming, he's ad libbing in the background on most songs (don't front like I was the only one that was singing along with Tah in most of those songs).  There are a few shortcomings that keep this album from achieving classic status.  Freaky Tah has a very simplistic flow that can come off as boring from time to time (but not often).  Then there are tracks like "Da Game" and "Is This The Part" that could've been left off the album and no one would've missed it.  Aside from those mishaps, the rest of the album is flawless.  It's been 8 years since this album came out (damn, that was 8 years ago?!) and you can still zone out to it in 2004.  Overall, this album is near classic with party jams and street tales that are effective in their purposes.  This CD is definitely worth your money if you're considering buying it.

3284	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I have a live version of this studio version on my '60s mix CD, along with The Box Tops' "The Letter," Friends of Distinction's "Grazing In The Grass," The Viscounts' "Harlem Nocturne" and songs like that on it. Their songs were around two and a half minutes long or so back then, so I have 23 songs on one CD. I just decided at the last minute to add the studio version to my collection, since this is such a great, classic song.
