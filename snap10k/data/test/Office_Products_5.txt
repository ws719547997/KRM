3601	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these from Amazon Warehouse deals at a discount, but I would buy them again at full price. I was looking for compact pruners for harvesting Japanese plums. Many of the "precision" pruners looked flimsy, so I took a chance on these. They are compact enough to slip into a cargo pocket and make precision cuts, but are built like a proverbial brick s***house. The large holes are actually designed to be big enough for both hands when cutting through something thick. I have very large hands, so I have no problem using these with one hand. Someone with very small hands might find them difficult to use, but I can't think of any other possible criticism. I expect them to last for the rest of my life.
The only downside is that the Moleskine City Notebook is only as good as you make it.  If you do a good job of planning your trip, it will be filled to the brim with useful and helpful information.  If not, it will be as unhelpful as you have made it.

6147	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This particular Moleskine Classic Notebook is a favorite product of mine and has been every since beginning to Bullet Journal.  While I wish I could offer it a higher quality review the biggest problem that I have faced with it is the fact that by using any type of regular pen (Not Sharpies or any other type of similar pen) there is always problem with bleeding on other pages.  The only guaranteed way of preventing bleeding through the pages is to write in Mechanical Pencil which is not the best way or practical way of keeping track of your notes or appointments in this notebook. I have included a picture sample of the issues you will encounter.

4676	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I love Moleskine, and have been using their notebooks and planners for a long time.  They are durable and look good, and have high quality paper.  The Passions series is designed for taking notes on various hobby subjects - in this case wine.  There are sections for different types of wine, each of which is filled with forms that allow you to fill in the details and take notes on individual wines.  There are also several completely blank sections for filling out whatever additional details you might like.  This would make a nice gift for the right person.  I don't think I'd actually use this, since it's a bit big for convenience (it would fit in a purse or a backback, but not in the pocket) and wine's not my thing, but for the afficionado I expect it'd be perfect.  I'd use the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moleskine-Passions-Film-Journal/dp/8862933177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moleskine Passions Film Journal</a>, though I'd prefer a pocket-sized notebook.

2120	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Like using these, bought my pack at B&N. Happy with what they are, simple product that does what it is described to do. The clip can slide off if you have the book in a bag and it is moving around, but for the most part I find that they stay put. Nice to have a 8 pack so that I have enough for all of the books I'm in the middle of reading.

These are incredibly poorly made. In fact, a couple of the tabs left behind their clear adhesive tab while I was gently removing them from the backing. They are very poorly made, small and flimsy.

I allow a maximum of two entries per day (he's not doing it every day since he's after-school time is packed and I'm usually next to him when he does fill it out), though this may change if Mother's Day come up quicker than progress on filling entries will allow completion.  I insist that he be very specific for each entry, forcing him to rethink what he will write (and he's doing everything in pencil, too.)  His entries are often very surprising and/or very sweet.

5810	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a bit pricy, but it is certainly worth the extra coin. The notebook is perfectly shaped, and has a nice pocket built into the back cover. The pocket is the perfect size for paper that has been folded in half. The cover is not cardboard (like the covers in the three packs), instead, it is a thin faux-leather that is durable and stays open easily. The paper is thin, but not terribly so. Writing with sharpies wouldn't be a good idea, but it is thick enough for most pens to stay on their side of the paper.

- I believe this is a good choice for those with a light-to-moderate schedule to track. If you have a really packed schedule that requires documenting lots of detailed info on a daily basis, I'd recommend choosing a larger or different planner. This really only allows for the briefest of hourly and daily notes. Small, neat handwriting is pretty important to have when using this size of planner, too.

8375	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I had an old solar powered version of TI-30 calculator that I purchased maybe around 1998 or 2000, which I liked and was accustomed to using. Finally a couple months ago a few of the buttons near the bottom, the decimal point and zero mainly, started to get unreliable. My work as an R&D machinist cutting into costly one-off prototype parts requires me to avoid errors as much as possible, so I bought a new battery-only TI-30Xa as a replacement. Well that is OK but it powers down pretty soon if left for a few minutes. I often like to refer back to my last result to remind/reassure myself that I have not had a brain fart, and my old solar one would stay on indefinitely as long as the lights were on.

The level of detail is very nice. I've lived in a few very small towns and most of them are actually listed on this map! The font choice is excellent as well.

It also holds a pen, highlighter and a notepad - all of which are included. The "leather" on the bag seems easy to keep clean, but the light pink could show soil marks, easily. It is canvas. The handles seem sturdy. This bag has been used for a couple of weeks of daily use without problem. The zipper pulls have attached metal crosses, but other than that there are no emblems, idols, symbols or brands visible.

It is difficult to overestimate the potency of a hand-written note in the Age of Email. It is a bit of chosen retro-referencing upon which the recipients of my letters comment with appreciation. And it doesn't take *that* much time.

974	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We mounted this on cork board under my son's twin loft.  It is practically the perfect size, in height and width.  He LOVES it!  The antique color/look goes well with the colors of his room (tan/beige, navy, and olive green).  It is perfect for a boy's (of any age) room, office, etc.  Very professional and well done.  It arrived rolled inside a stiff plastic tube, and that was in a larger cardboard rectangle.  We are VERY satisfied and thrilled.
3. There is a meeting notes section at the end. No need to bring multiple books to meetings!
Other Pros:

9403	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I like this little mouse pad. The 'hump' or wrist rest, whatever it's called, is very comfortable if I'm 'mousing around' in a small area on the screen. If I need to drag something to trash or into another folder, it does get in the way.

The fold line is so slight that you can use the page whole if you want and not fold it at all.  It also lends itself to being cut in half for single page note cards.  I've already made three sets featuring original art for Christmas presents.

There is no need for me to describe this album to you.  If you don't have a copy, you need to get one.  Having this version of the CD for a long time, I have yet to see a reason to replace it with a newer CD.  This album would obviously earn the sixth star in this rating system.
4782	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent find:
2425	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Yes, it is small, but I like that! Read the product descriptions before making the purchase if you are afraid of size. I have a planner that I take with me everywhere and this happily sits in the zipper section on said planner. The only thing I found frustrating was the spiral aspect. Because you cannot really bend the binding it is tough to write in such small lettering. But, it does what I wanted and I am happy with this purchase overall.
3. There is not a monthly view integrated within the weekly calendar. You have to turn back to the beginning of the book for that.

8892	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I have a job that requires 8 plus hours of computer use a day.  Recently, I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel, Radial Tunnel, and Ulnar Nerve (I think the term was ulcerations) in both arms.  I was in a bit of a panic when I bought this pad, so at the time I was looking for anything that would be helpful.  Purchasing this to use as a support for my right wrist was a mistake.  When I rested my wrist on the pad it made the pain worse because it pushed directly on some of the problem spots.  If you are dealing with similar medical issues, I strongly recommend purchasing a wrist brace like the one linked here:

Now that he has them, he loves them and has asked for more.  He likes that they are small enough to fit in his front or back pocket or even his wallet.  They are also holding up well to being pulled out and written in several times a day. Overall they are exactly what he needed and I couldn't be happier with the price - highly recommended!
5195	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	First, I have to say I LOVE Moleskine! The quality covers and paper and bindings on all of my Moleskine style journals are terrific. That said, this storyboard style is fast becoming one of my favorites. I am using the storyboard blocks as a pattern library for Zentangle step outs. It helps keep me organized and is so portable! With this notebook and my reporter's notebook, I'm all set for anything and they fit neatly together inside my purse. Yay!
Highly recommend.
I was delighted to find them on Amazon.  I've tried other mousepads and encounter different ones at various places (friends, family), but nothing beats these things IMHO.
I am a photographer and take my "brain" everywhere with me.  I am VERY hard on my planner and as I said if I can buy in advance I will never stray from this planner!

9501	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	There is a big dent (intentional) in the wrist part of the pad. Instead of putting my wrist in a natural position, it cranks it up too high. Completely defeats the purpose of the wrist rest, and you can't tell from the picture on amazon that this is the case.

I'm ready to set my 49G aside and move back to my old friend.  I didn't even have to replace the batteries in well over a decade of use!

6128	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Yea, it's just a notebook, but being a stationery lover, it's amazing. I'm a bit anal about paper and pens, so it took me a while to research which notebook I wanted to use for my new bullet journaling endeavors and I'm so happy I settled on this one.
This is produced by "Teacher Created Materials" and although there are no supplements with it, each book ends with several activities. as well as six comprehension ("Read and Respond") questions suitable for writing or discussion.
285	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are a classroom favorite.  Being magnetic and being able to use dry erase markers has made them very versatile.  This has been such a popular item with my students - one that they choose when they have free time - that I've had to use clear packing tape to secure the top of both.  They've lasted a long time, and they are a vital part of what we do.
4711	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use these to keep a running log of projects for my business. They are great little notebooks and are worth the price.
5477	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love Moleskine. They're a little pricey in my opinion, but the pages are a nice weight, there's very little bleed-through, and it opens pretty flat. Definitely my favorite journal.
It should be noted that you can use regular Moleskine notebooks in exactly the same way with the Evernote page camera to capture notes. So, while I think the green elastic and embossed cover make it worth it for me, you'll have to decide that on your own.
8315	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great product works great
4514	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This boarder is a bit thick which is great because it adds a lot of flair to my bulletin boards in my science classroom.

5757	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I was turned on to Moleskine journals about 4 years ago and have been using them ever since, for sketches, notes, phone numbers, etc! Their a great quality material, somewhat inexpensive, handy, pocket sized, lightweight and recyclable in the end! I just bought a (set of 3) Large Moleskine journals about a month ago and am very pleased with them, a larger step up from what I was originally using (5.5" x 3.5"), which have currently lasted 4 years of immense traveling and back pocket use! The larger set of these seems to be a lot more helpful, especially for sketching, giving you more room to work with, also with a few detachable pages and a folder pocket in the back (which all Moleskine journals have, although helpful to note). I would definitely recommend these to anyone who likes to keep recipes, pocket notes, sketches, journal entries, logging info, etc. These journals are versatile when traveling and great for anyone with a sense for good qulaity!

8245	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great card stock, excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer.  I chose cute Christmas card design, my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes!  But... I didn't like starting with just blank cards.  For advanced users I'm sure it's what everybody wants, blank slate so their imagination runs wild.  But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders, so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message.  Overall, still 5 out of 5.

7981	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Seriously, I hate this calculator. On my laptop, typing this, I can easily just touch the keys on the keypad, they depress, and without even looking, I know what is showing up on the screen. With this calculator, you have to slowly press each button, rather firmly, then look at the little screen to make sure what you typed actually showed up. When you are doing algebra, or even pre-algebra, you don't have the time to have to slowly do this. You jut want to type in the equation and check the answer. This stupid thing, I get the wrong equation entered half the time because I didn't press this or that button hard enough, and heaven help you if you press them faster than they can appear on screen. I imagine they are still using chips from the 1970s. Also, when doing homework, I want to be able to pick this up and start using it, but it shuts off after a minute, and you have to check that it IS on, and if not, turn it on! It uses solar power, which is fine, but I'm in a well-lit room using it, so why the need to shut off every minute?
Shipping and handling was quick and painless. The gel mousepad came in its original packaging!

The size is perfect for dropping in your pocket along with a small tin of watercolours and some travel brushes for some on the spot sketching, or you can add it easily to a small sketch bag. Sketching and painting small has taught me a lot about economy of composition and it gives a lot of control over the paint.
5986	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I first bought Moleskine as per the recommendation of another student in my field. I'm studying geology, and a lot of the information we learn in our pre-requisite classes remain very important through our upper classes and the rest of our careers.

The one commonality of all Baby Boomers was  the War in Vietnam. Teenagers were either waiting to go to Vietnam, in  Vietnam, coming home from Vietnam (perhaps), or doing their damnedest to  stay out of Vietnam. The War was an American invention, and so was  rock'n'roll. Teenagers denounced everything institutional and embraced  anything foreign. The British Invasion, led by the Beatles, was scarcely an  invasion at all: it was a welcoming party given by the Baby Boomers. The  Beatles were at the right place at the right time. Sure Sgt. Pepper was the  art album of the decade, but more importantly it was the Great Escape. One  could understand the assignation of President Kennedy `With A Little Help  From My Friends.' `When I'm Sixty-Four' was an optimistic ditty if your  draft number was 1,000 and they had just called 999. `A Day In The Life'  was an ideal way to reflect on America's greatest (and dead) civil rights  leader - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you were unfortunate enough to have  suffered the Tet Offensive, `Lovely Rita' (your girl back in the world) was  the only thing that kept you going. And lastly, `Good Morning Good Morning'  was a sardonic greeting shouted by police during the Democratic National  Convention in Chicago. Sgt. Pepper defined a generation? Nonsense. The  generation defined Sgt. Pepper.

For HP, this is a lucrative business proposition.

Prior to my Palm V, I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere, all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most. As a result,  I often forgot to do things that needed to be done, lost important phone  numbers, etc.-you get the idea.

ESA, delightful children's book.  My granddaughter loves this book!
3995	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this calendar.  We use it for the entire family.  I love the fact that it contains a tab for each week and the tab has a place for each name of my kids so I can note what is scheduled for them individually....It is very practical.  This is going to be my go to calendar for every year.
The only thing I don't love is that somehow the cover has already warped slightly. Doesn't really detour from use, but it doesn't allow for flat pressing of the papers inside. Also the elastic has stretched already... I've only had it about a month.
The daily entries are SUPER SHORT but will give you something to think on to help you start your day right.  It's not "deep" but like I said, encouraging.  It was well worth the purchase and I ended up buying one as a gift for a family member.  They are not "into" the Bible reading thing, BUT reported back to me how perfect the entries in this little book are, that it caused them to think.

Instead of telling you what you "should" and "shouldn't" do, or telling you there ARE no rules, Dina Wakley simply shares her own approaches to art journaling. Everything from materials to technique to approaches to composition and color is included in this book. I even enjoyed and found inspiration in the "getting started/materials" section, which I normally consider a waste of ink in most art technique books.
Now with the availability of smart phones most of the information needed can be kept on the phone and erased or transmitted as needed. However we still do not live in a completely paperless society. There for there is an occasional need for paper. Sometime paper is also quicker to note on and remove from the Notebook.
5116	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love these, particularly these models with the grid pattern pages!
However, we also know that pasting anything into a book reduces it's value- with rare exceptions. At the very least....before using this kit, check out the value of your books before permanently attaching anything to it.
It is made of good-quality materials that will maintain its shape even after having rested your wrist upon it for a long period of time. In fact, once, I inadvertently left something on top of it over night without meaning to. The next day, there were impressions made on the  pad where the mouse sits. I was concerned at first, but during the course of the morning it slowly regained its shape to normal - good as new!
My only concern is that in this age of computers there are few of us who will still take the time each month to manually record important dates along with personal data into a new notebook.  As a Palm user since their inception long before they became a phone and a day planner user for decades before that, I could not imagine going back to the days when my contacts and appointments were all on paper in a day planner that I carried everywhere.  Having all my appointments, contacts and plans for years past and years future at my fingertips in my computer and phone has spoiled me for the more thought provoking use of the actual handwritten word.  Those who journal each day (I don't) will find this a wonderful way (if they write very small) to record the days events and thoughts.  The rest of us will stick with our phones and Outlook or Palm files.

I purchased a black moleskine a couple of years ago when my favorite bookstore was going out of business, and I don't think I'll ever use another type of journal again. I write a lot and people often give me journals - but I've made it a point to actually PURCHASE moleskine journals because they're exactly what a journaler needs. They're the right size to slip into my backpack when I'm travelling to Asia. The ruling in moleskines is one of the very best details - I HATE wide ruling as I believe it wastes paper. With a moleskine, you can fit a good bit on the page - provided that you use the proper pen. I use my Marvy Le Pen collection of rainbow colors (with a couple of added Sakura Microns for the missing yellow and rose that Marvy doesn't carry) for colorful journal entries. They have a 0.03mm points and (again), don't waste journal pages.

The biggest annoyance with this calculator is that the convert key, while an important key if you're needing a fraction or similar output, is placed above the equals key, where the plus key normally is. This key should be placed above the divide key. I've used this calculator a lot, and I have never gotten used to the plus key being in the wrong place.

Continued to try it for different things other than watercolor, and found it lacking. The size is good for brief sketches in pen or pencil. Do not use watercolor, it won't work very well, copic markers bled through the pages. So overall it was a big meh.
I put small charts, big charts and HUGE charts in my new Deluxe Bulletin Board Pocket Chart Storage items.  There is a lot of give in them and it expands quite well.  (The bottom does not expand, just the middle and the top.)  There are velcro closures and two strong handles.  Because of the high number of items I have in them, they are both rather heavy.  The handles did a great job of staying intact.  I'm also pleased with them because they'll take up less space than the cardboard boxes did.  A handy item for any teacher!

Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute, so the ink could dry, but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous. The only trouble I had was that I couldn't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7, so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine (and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars).

The colors are perfect, as they'll easily match a variety of room styles and I'll be able to continue using it even after I purchase new bedding/decor. It does come rolled up in a tube, so you'll want to lay it flat with heavy books or something on it in order to stop the map from curling back up or rolling.

9695	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I have used a Fellows wrist rest for some years, both at work and at home....the kind with the cloth covering because I don't like the sticky plastic/gel coverings they use now.  I've loved it and have had NO hand or wrist problems since I started using them.  Unfortunately, the covering for my home rest had peeled free. I immediately raced out to order 2 more, just in case.  Well, forget about it.  If you can't get one of the old models, don't bother with the new version.  They're half the height of the old version and shorter to boot.  I had to put the two new ones back-to-back to get the same support with my old one, and even then they're not as softly supportive.  I'm SO disappointed!  I'd have paid $25 to get a rest as good as the old ones.  These are going back as soon as I can get to the Post Office.

6860	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	For the medium nib fountain: Super smooth, no skipping, sleek and attractive. This pen is absolutely the best. All Cross pens are, from my experience. Compared to the King pen, which is nice, and the Zenzoi million dollar pen, which is nicer, this pen has a great solid feel and the NICEST, smoothest writing. Some of the other fountain pens are fun to look at and offer flashy cases, for unparalleled ease of writing and unsurpassed quality, Cross beats them all and is worth every dollar for a pen in the "under $100" range. Not having the opportunity to compare with a Waterman or Mont Blanc yet, this has pens in comparable price range beat hands down.

However they are doing the job and they were very well priced!  The mouse pad is probably a little higher on the scale as it has plenty of mousing room on the pad and the rest is suited better to actual natural resting position.  Either way they seem to be well constructed and will last for quite a while if taken care of, not forgetting saving our poor wrists from carpel tunnel or the like! :)

My only problem is that the threads at the end of the tassel fall out under the slightest pressure.

The paper in these notebooks seems to be the same feathering, bleed through prone paper that is put in the bigger Moleskines. And don't be fooled by the picture, these little notebooks do not have the same smooth cover as the regular Moleskines. The outer cover of these is nothing more than thick black card stock.

5301	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm an Active Duty Soldier in today's Army and having a pocket notebook is something that is expected from all its leaders.  I've used many types of notebooks that were supplied to me free by the military, and I could never find one that really impressed me.  Most would either fall apart after a few weeks of use, or the pages would become hard to write on due to weathering.  Then my sister gave me one of these as a stocking gift over Christmas and I started using it when I went back to work.  I instantly fell in love with the Moleskin and vowed to never use another notepad again.  The thing that seperates this one from the rest is the hard covers and the elastic band that keeps it together.  These simple features alone keeps most of the dampness off your pages, and helps the notepad maintain its shape.  If you're looking for a solid pocket notebook at a reasonable price, look no further.

Recently, my charger has disappeared and I have been unable to locate another.  I've decided the old paper and pencil method might not be such a bad idea.  The first one I bought was way too big.  I want one small enough to keep in my bag and big enough to keep track of more than just the name, address and phone number.  This is actually a little bigger than my palm, but it is thinner.  There is room for name, address, 4 phone numbers, e-mail address, birthday, and about 2 1/2 lines for notes.  It might be a little tight for adding directions to their house, like I have in my palm, but I guess I can take up another slot for that.  It is spiral bound, so it will lie flat when open and it had an elastic strap to keep it closed.  It may be low tech, but at least I don't have to recharge it.

This bookmark is perfect for anyone who loves the Irish blessing. The bookmark itself is all green and says "May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back."

The bookmark is made of material like tagboard and comes with a black tassel and a gold bead. This bookmark is printed in China.

Thirteen of the designs spread across two pages.  In my book, the pages were not aligned well.  It seems to be a printing issue rather than an alignment issue.  I found that the elements at the center of the each side of the binding doubled slightly.  That left me with a design that could not be aligned properly. This may be particular to my book or it may be a general issue.  I am thinking a more general issue as the images were sized a particular way rather than printed improperly on the page.

The back pocket is not very useful. It works, but if you put in more than 4 thicknesses of paper or so, the notebook will get uncomfortably thick (it's the price you pay for having such a nice, thin notebook, I guess). And I say "thicknesses" because the notebook is fairly small, so you'll have to fold over a standard letter or A4 page at least once and probably twice to fit it in. If I could take off half a star for this, I would.

The notebook I eventually got was very similar to this one so I can review the similarities.  The notebook looks very nice and professional.  The pages are easy to write on and absorb ink pretty well.  The back of the book has a small pocket to put loose pages in.  The elastic strap around the front is really nice for keeping the pages secure and safe.  Also I really enjoy the ribbon that keeps me on the right page and I don't have to flip through the book looking for the last page I wrote on.  These are a little pricey but if you take a lot of notes and want to have something to keep you a little more organized I think these work great.

I highly recommend this notebook for important notes and ideas - as the price is substantially higher than simple ringed notebooks.

They are a bit difficult to put on as you only get 1 shot or will mess up your book. It seems to help the kids a bit.
If you want to get fancy, there are also guides such as a film journal, wine journal, etc; and there are notebooks based on different cities such as Paris and New York which contain maps and blank pages with tabs to organize notes about tourist sites, hotels, language help, and more.

This one measures 5 1/2" x 3 1/2". It has a garter that is nicely tucked inside the back leaf cover, to keep it close when not in use. The acid-free pages are thick, with lines and beige in color. (Why acid-free? Acid-free paper preserves documents for longer periods of time). A piece of fabric string hangs in the middle as book mark. At the back flap, inside is a pocket that expands so you put any items such as business cards, etc.


My only complaint is that the label and cord make an imprint on the cover, probably because each is also wrapped in clear plastic. I have unwrapped the ones I intend to use as gifts in the hopes that the marks will fade. For me, I don't really care, because the insides are so nice.

I would give it 5 stars if the dots used were lighter. The overall appearance of the grid carries the same weight as those of a standard moleskin squared notebook. However, because these are dotted lines instead of solid, it seems the dots are darker. Actually, there was some variation in dot darkness on some of the pages (maybe 20% are just a touch lighter). It's not distracting at all. I just would prefer them a bit lighter (or even to have a dot-square where only the corners are dotted like Leuchtturm).

6974	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I was looking for a thin, well made (metal) fountain pen and this seemed to fit the bill just right.  It is, I must admit, surprisingly thin, which makes writing with this tip a wee bit harder than I expected since you need to write with a more gentle angle.  With fountain tips, you glide across the page as opposed to press down like a ballpoint.  Well, this is thin enough and the grip is such that it takes a little bit of getting used to.  That being said, it is well made.  My truly big issue with this pen is that because it is so thin, it is too thin, by the SMALLEST of margins, to accept a standard international cartridge.  As a result, only cross slim inks will work.  So, buyers beware.  That was a huge disappointment for me, and tbh, a major design flaw.  I now cannot use my absolute favorite blue ink (a non-standard blue) since it's not made by cross and won't fit into this pen.

There inches square isn't that large (grab a ruler and you'll see what I mean), and area available for writing is even smaller than that, but neither diminishes the fun value of this sticky notes.
As other reviewers have noted, this isn't really a notepad that you can flip the cover all the way over the back; doing so would probably break the binding or screw up your cover. So the product photos are a bit deceptive in that regard. But I haven't had any trouble with the cover constantly wanting to close on me while I'm writing or anything like that, and it works out great for me. If you do want one that the cover flips entirely over, there is a softcover version of this same notepad.

It is important for the card stock to be strong but not too stiff, as one needs to be able to bend it easily on the creases. The paper stock surface also needs to appear to be of a fine quality for printer ink to be laid down evenly and not leave absorption bleed on the edges of the letters.

In addition to solid construction, there are quite a few calculator functions that should suffice unless you need a scientific calculator or another more advanced model. The keys are good sized; and this makes using them to calculate things very easy. You can expect this product to reliably add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers; and you get square root, percentage, a change sign key (to change from a negative number to a positive number), and three memory function keys as well. Great! I also like that the display uses commas when necessary.
So it seems to be a natural fit to have Evernote Moleskines. I've been eagerly awaiting mine to arrive since November, and here they are! So, what are you getting and how do they fit in with your standard workflow?

1877	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These stars are eye catching and every student will want one so they will work to get them. In this package, you get 39 stars - 12 large, 12 medium and 15 small. The medium and large stars have a white center that you can write names, areas and notes for your students and classroom. The small stars can be given to the student of the week. These are printed on heavy card stock and are durable - as long as they are not mis-used. They are brightly colored foil on the edges and have rainbow colors. If you know a teacher, buy a couple for their classroom because if a classroom is to be personalized or decorated, the products have to be paid for by the teacher.

I highly recommend it!  The price is less than on the maker's website, and it arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime.  The map has a nice heavy lamination on front and back and it arrived in perfect condition, rolled, wrapped in a custom plastic sleeve, and shipped inside a very sturdy cardboard tube with packing material in the end of the tube.  We have unwrapped and rerolled it twice now, putting it back in the tube easily each time.  Now we want to have it framed with foamboard behind it and without glass, to use pushpins to show our travels. Our only question at this point relates to the custom framing, and we will follow up here when we see how that works out.  The framer (at Hobby Lobby) thinks it should be dry-mounted, since there will not be glass to hold the map flat, and they don't have mats large enough for it, but they expressed concern about the success of dry-mounting it because of the lamination.  We are trying to get advice/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.  It appears the map is also available without lamination directly from National Geographic, so that is a possibility if we have to replace it, but I prefer buying through Amazon and love the price here.

The pen lasts almost forever, actually forever when you consider that the company will give you a new one when it does wear out.  The cartridges also last a long time, even though they look smaller than other ball-pen cartridges.
 "keys" and easy to read on the display.  If you are concerned about

This planner doesn't have that.  This is about as straight forward a record book as you could find.  It is for use by your student.  There is one page for basic identification and grade information.  There is one page to list the general syllabus for each course.  There is one page to list the texts used for each subject.  And then, there are 180 pages designed to record all your academic activities for each day.  Every possible category is listed in a way that encourages you to look not just at typical assigned seatwork but also at activities and field trips.  One page for one day.

Teenagers had been buying rock'n'roll records since Bill Haley and the  Comets released `Rock Around The Clock.' But the 60's decade was different:  never before had there been so many kids with so much cash (economists call  it `disposable income').

 Use - As I mentioned before, you need to be a little careful handling the fans.  The top and bottom of each fan has a heavier card that acts as a protective cover.  The pages of the fan slide very smoothly and are easy to work with and use.  It really has a lot of color variety.  It has a really helpful index in the middle of the fan that lists the Pantone color and the page you can find it on.  My wife was able to find a specific blue color that she used on a client's brochure in a matter of seconds using the index.  Flipping through the many pages of blue shades would have taken a lot longer.  That was a great feature and she was really happy to see it.  There was also an additional lighting indicator page that had a brown swatch that was made up of two different swatches.  If they look the same, you have good lighting.  If they look different, your lighting is bad.  It was another interesting little bonus.
Moleskine has a long tradition and the paper is a joy to write on ... For those who write for a living like I do the least amount of "drag" by the pen on paper makes for fewer hand cramps.  I use a BIC Velocity ink pen and the combination between pen and paper makes for an easy "write" experience.
For this low price, this is a wonderful and attractive phone book. The one thing that is not great is the paper is a bit thin. Other than that, I give this 4.6 stars rounded off to 5 stars. And a great book to keep on hand with handwritten names/addresses, etc.

I highly advise against spending money on graphing calculators and anything more than $10.

This calculator can do every function required for all levels of algebra, trig, calculus (limited functionality, but you'll use computers for anything advanced anyways) and statistics. In fact, I have officially used every single command on the calculator, and have never had to wish my calculator could do more.

It still has multiple lines (the best feature imo) and all the functions I need. I'm prone to losing things, but with this low price it won't be a big deal to replace it if I do. The only thing is that the cover is a little bit harder to put on compared to the TI-84, but that's not a big deal.

Originally I thought they were separated so you could put them in the middle of pages. The more I thought about it, having them on the edge makes it easier to find. However, you can split them in half by cutting along the sticker between the two magnets.

1092	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	High quality item.  I liked it but don't get it for a 13-year-old.  I thought she could use it for timing her French horn practice sessions or how long she's reading or doing homework.  She didn't see it that way and I haven't seen this since Christmas.  So.  I think good for a younger child but I messed up on getting it for her.  The packaging also refers to younger children which didn't help.
The width of the paper feed on this device is only 9 inches, so if you have a piece of paper that is larger you will have to fold it in half first or cut it, in order to feed into the shredder. If a jam- up occurs, all you have to do is flick the switch to the reverse setting and the item will pop back out.
1. according to the 5-12-5, 5-12-5, 22 groupings of the 66 bible books (7 groupings according to the Menorah pattern), Acts should be the same color as the gospels but in these tabbies it is not. Also, the major prophets (5) should be a different color than the minor prophets (12).

6361	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I heard horror stories about how difficult it is to put IKEA furniture together, but this was a pleasant surprise.  Everything was efficiently packed, and easy to put together.  You don't even really need instructions.  I had it assembled within 20 minutes and I have carpal tunnel.  Really happy with how smooth it rolls, ease of use, and storage.  You do pay a very large markup by ordering on Amazon but it was the only way I could get it here in Hawaii so it was money well spent.  I will probably order another one in a different color.  I'm using this one as an art cart for my kids, and I like that they can stick their drawings on it afterwards since it's magnetic.  I highly recommend it, even with the high markup on Amazon.
Nicely designed, pleasant blue buttons and a nicely curved white plastic body. BIG numerals. Very nice overall. Comically tiny type on the instruction sheet -- just microscopic type.

1178	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I received these Thank You cards at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, these are really plain, but still nice. They arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package so they didn't get bent or ripped on their way to me. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. They also came with a Thank You card from the company giving me a discount on future orders. Personally, I think they are pretty plain, but sometimes there is a need for a very plain card. Overall, I liked them.

I like the ivory color of the paper, too (I am not really a fan of bright white paper).

5770	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I actually picked these up at a brick-and-mortar bookstore a few weeks ago, at the same time I got a backup leather notebook for my tote bag. I love the leather with its texture, paper density, and perfectly spaced lines, but when I'm trying to break down an event sequence or character development, I HATE trying to work it  out on my pretty, non-removable pages...then I discovered these. They're just a hair smaller than my notebook, and quite thin, so I can tuck one of these straight into the middle of my main notebook, and fasten the leather cord closed around the whole kit! Now, I have an equally attractive, but less precious, space to sketch out where I'm going with a story, so more of my "main" book stays on course, and I have quickly come to adore that little pocket in the back...like others have mentioned, this paper is too thin for intense ink treatments (my uniball black and blue pens are both capable of bleeding if I try and layer a line or just pause too long) but I could care less, since my use is as a rough notes/rougher sketches space. It's pretty protected inside the other book, so I can't speak for durability, but the actual construction of the little books seems impressive to me.

5262	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I have consumed more than half a dozen of these Moleskine pocket hardcover notebooks over the past few years.  Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use "moleskine" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.

1938	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's a very pretty notebook.  I use a heavy pen (Uni-Ball Vision .5) and tend to doodle and redoodle the same lines during the work day, so I found the pages a little thin for my taste, but they're definitely not skimping compared to most graph paper notebooks on the market.

These come with 3 individual journals, which makes them rather economical for various purposes. The size is exactly as described in the dimensions section and is a very comfortable size for writing and general use. (Some of the small moleskines are difficult to write in unless you are sitting at a desk, or even then if your hands are large like mine). I have unlined Cahiers that I use as sketchbooks and they're great for that purpose. To some extent, this different cover type makes these Moleskines the ones I turn to most often when I just want to put pen or pencil to paper.
5957	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for people who love Moleskine journals but want a little thinner one.

My only complaint is that the Adventure Bible Junior Bible does not fit in it very well. The bible very easily falls out if the kiddo tries to pick it up when it is unzipped. This is frustrating, but overall it serves its purpose and will work better when she gets the older kid Adventure bible.

However, since I mainly use it for accounting purposes, this calculator does not work for me.  I went through the manual looking for a way to make it work, but found none.  I use this for check books and other things where I need a running total.  IE. with this calculator, if you wish to enter 1+2+3+4 with a subtotal and then a total, you have to hit 1+2=+3=+4= to get an answers.  So I am saving this calculator for my preteen who will need ti soon enough and I went and bought another trusty TI-30XA.

9684	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I started having periods of numbness in my right wrist as a result of computer use.

After receiving my Belkin Gel Mouse Pad, the numbness is completely gone and never comes back. It is a pleasure to use and is very comfortable. I should have gotten one a long time ago.

My 8 year old son HATES handwriting, and cursive is pure torture for him.  He saw the cover and said "handwriting without tears, I doubt it."  That said, when he practices in this workbook, he complains less.  I think it's because it's starting with easier letters and moving on to more complex ones once he feels more confident.

3) Well-Thought Design - it's clear that these notebooks were designed by an intelligent engineer that places value on (or regularly uses) notebooks. It just screams quality and care; down to the first page of the notebook, which reads: "In case of loss, please return to..." and then has 4 blank lines for you to write in your address. There's also a line below the address lines that says, "As a reward (for return)..." and another blank line for you to write in the monetary value you place on having your notebook returned to you. I simply wrote in my address on this page and sticky-tacked a U.S. forever stamp to the page. Hopefully if I lose it, a kind-hearted soul will use the stamp to return it to its wistful owner!
My hope is that this is caused by being sealed up during the long trip from China, and it will lessen in a year or two.  There must be a use for this type of chemical warfare.

I've let just text sit on a page for nearly 5 minutes and it still doesn't get absorbed, causing smears all over whenever. There is a reason why it's called a "sketchbook", to be able to quickly sketch out ideas and words without waiting forever for the damn ink to dry....

These cards are so lovely and elegant!!  I was astonished at how beautiful they are when I received them - worth every single penny - and then some.  The designs are a classy reminder of days gone by while the sturdiness and gloss of the card are very 21st Century!  I'm just as excited to send Valentines out this year as I was when in school.  As if the cards weren't enough to feel you're getting more than you paid for, the envelopes are also lined with a pattern that corresponds to all of the cards.  I ordered two boxes but as delighted as I am with these, I'm going to order more and hoard them for next year, too!  I also ordered the Old-Time Valentine stickers; however, they didn't arrive.  Amazon was quick to refund me for undelivered items but when I place my second order, I'll request the stickers again.  I think they'll make a lovely compliment to the cards.

The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might.  However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money. Depending on your budget, therefore, you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs, but that you'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math.  In any event, this is a durable calculator that works very well.
5445	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't survive without my journal.  I have bought two of these and they BOTH lasted for an entire year.  Some of the other brands that I used would have the cover come off in the middle of the year.  Great quality product.

The designs in this book are printed on both sides of white medium weight, non-perforated paper. The binding is glued rather than sewn (which is unusual for a coloring book from the UK.) Many of the designs merge into the binding and some portion of them will be lost if you cut the pages from the book. I could not break the spine enough to get the book to lay flat.  This could be a problem with designs that merge into the binding.

For example:
 Although I do point out in my review summary at the bottom of this page that the journal makes a faith-based charitable contribution per journal sold, and the product description itself is forthcoming in disclosing this, It may be noteworthy to add that the journal itself contains religious references. I, myself, am not a person of faith and I do recall being a bit disappointed with this aspect of the journal, especially since the religious references are located on the inside cover(s), and as such are not  pages one would necessarily consider removable.

By the way, our 8 year old uses a Moleskine as a journal.  She writes stories, play's, songs, and even does mind dumping into it.  We simply label each Moleskine with the year and keep them bound on an office shelf.
6998	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I own a couple usa made 1964 Cross pen and pencil sets which are the vintage version of this new set. This new set is NOT usa made like the old ones. Its chinese made, light and flimsy, and does not have the rose gold look. It looks more like 10kt gold filled. The inner barrel edges are not smooth, the two pieces of the pen don't sit evenly and required some sanding to fit right. The two pieces of the pen require careful manipulation to sit right. On the vintahe sets, the two parts always sit right together. I was disappointed when I sent in a broken vintage 14kt gold filled set to Cross for repair and they sent me this new set since they could not repair my vintage set due to lack of parts. I was disappointed. I sold this new so called "new and updated" set on ebay for 50 bucks which is 100 bucks less than the price of new. Thats how much i hated it. The person who bought it was estatic to get it for cheap, but hey, im sticking with my usa made vintage sets. Cross is not what they used to be, but i guess it just makes the vintage ones more sought after. Dont waste 150 bucks on this set. Go on ebay and get a used usa made vintage 14kt gold filled pen and pencil set for 60 bucks. You cant go wrong with the vintage ones.
In sum, this is old technology, and it appears to have been realized by resource-starved wannabes who had little more than ancient parts, old designs, and a GE logo with which to work. There are almost no choices remaining for this kind of answering machine, but don't conclude that this one is still on the market because it deserves to be.
1945	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I bought these because I bought the first one.  However, these were not the same quality tangles that the other set was.  It's like she was searching blindly for patterns to put down.  Wish I didn't buy these.

3883	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	These dishes look really cute in my kitchen and the product reviews were pretty favorable - as long as you happened to receive the sets made in the USA and not China.  I purchased two dish sets and some accessory pieces and - because of the rather steep price - assumed they were American made.  Wrong.  Sadly, several of the dishes chipped when first washed in the dishwasher and more dishes chipped from use in the microwave - clearly these are not dishwasher and microwave safe.

The interior is fine though. And I do my scribbles in both fountain pen and mechanical pencil. I have stock piled blank books for when I need them.
All the color wash sprays work incredibly well on a number of materials. I've used it mainly on paper, card-stock and grass-cloth and the color on those has become permanent when dry. After spraying with the color wash sprays you can spray a fine mist of water to blend the colors further. The colors are really rich but they are less intense than the matching alcohol inks. When purchasing note that even the 2oz goes really far as you use relatively small amounts for great effect.
Print quality is just plain superb.  And you can print graphics with the Dymo LabelWriter 330, too!

7323	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is my second GL4.  The first lasted about 10 years but the gel finally evaporated out of the pad somehow.  It has been the absolute best solution for my needs.  This new pad is equally as good.  I do notice the velcro tape which holds the gel pack to the mousepad is about an inch further up the pad than the original which was attached right at the base of the mousepad.  This results in a one-third smaller surface area than a normal mousepad when using a mouse.  Doesn't bother me as I use a Kensington Expert Mouse (large trackball).  I suppose this was done to keep the entire gel pack sitting on the mousepad itself.

My current demands require a large notebook (fantastic additional writing space), a pocket 18 month planner (weekdays on left, ruled notes on right) and a ruled pocket notebook/journal/diary to accompany the pocket planner for additional capacity when needed. Moleskine paper can't be beat (pleasant color, durable, handles fine nib fountain pens (personal favorite) and ballpoints and all varieties of penmanship. My pocket planners have become very relied upon...just have to remember where it is too often (glove compartment, coat pocket, patio, desktop, dog's mouth)! I have never second-guessed switching to Moleskine and giving gung-ho recommendations to anyone inquiring about mine. As usual, I wouldn't buy mine from anyone other than Amazon!

5629	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Ok, Moleskine has amazing products, but this is GREAT! I must confess that I am guilty of not filling this notebook often, but the notebook is not to blame for my lazyness.
As others have mentioned, the planner sometimes is difficult to close, it's as though the page punch depth and the size of the ring binding don't quite match up. It will however open flat and even bend backwards onto itself which sometimes comes in handy. I just have to be careful and coax the pages closed vs. just closing in one motion.

8243	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's been a while since I've used actual greeting card paper to make my photo greeting cards.  The first time I made greeting cards on a PC, I used HP greeting card paper, which I found on clearance.  I loved making photo cards!  Unfortunately, I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance, so I turned to other paper for my cards.  Mostly, I have made them on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Canon-Matte-Photo-Paper-8-5-x-11-Inches-50-Sheets-7981A004/dp/B0000721Z3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Canon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004)</a>.  (Note, however, I have not bought this paper since 2005, when I stocked up on it, because it was so cheap.  Thus, I don't know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not.  The box itself looks different.)  It is basically inexpensive photo paper, and has no Canon name on the reverse side, so you can print your greetings on that side.  (Just make certain you print the photo on the right side.  If not, it will look horrendous, whereas words look just fine.  Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.)  It also folds relatively easily.  If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand's name on the back, so messages can't be printed there.)  Then, just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Columbian-CO468-Grip-Seal-Invitation-Envelopes-A9-5-3-4-x-8-3-4-White-Box-of-100/dp/B000J0B3K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Columbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9, 5-3/4" x 8-3/4" - White (Box of 100)</a>.
The setting of tax rate, the +tax function, the tax- function, and the 'recall tax rate' function are nice bonus features. Many times I have customers ask 'what will be the price after tax?' and 'what is the tax rate here?'. Both of those will be very handy for those situations.  Of course, it requires programming the tax rate in the first place, but that's no big deal.
This bottle opener is a lifesaver. Just tuck it in your wallet or keep it in your purse, you will have it handy no matter where you are or what you do.

I've been using this mouse pad for over 10 years now and it is still in very good shape.  I will say that it does not work terribly well with a cheaper optical mouse, but it works flawlessly with my razer naga.  The wrist support is still firm but soft and it is in very good shape except that the material is difficult to clean.  Which is no big deal because it doesn't effect the way it works, it just looks dirty.

3740	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I'd tried this shampoo a couple of years ago while away on vacation.  I recalled that I liked it then and loved the scent...only problem was that I couldn't remember the actual name of it later when I returned home.  I occasionally did a half-hearted search for it in our local stores, but with no luck.  I did remember that grapefruit was part of the scent; so recently I did an online search for grapefruit-scented shampoos and recognized the bottle.  Then I was even happier to find it available on Amazon.  The grapefruit and ginger scent is just as nice as I remembered.  My hair is blonde with lighter salon-added highlights so it needs a shampoo that protects the color.  This shampoo is great for chemically treated hair and leaves my hair with a wonderful shine.  While it doesn't produce quite as much lather as some of my other shampoos, it makes enough to get the job done and rinses well.
I've been using this particular model of Moleskine notebook for my daily note-taking and doodling for the past five years, and I've filled three of them so far.  I like them so much that I ordered another half dozen from Amazon just to be sure I have some in reserve.

It takes a bit more dexterity (or repetition) to use them as you would a standard paper clip, and even then it frequently takes a moment or two to just get ONE clip out of the container and ready to use.

She loved the writing and the funny post it comments, she actually decided at the party not to use the sticky notes because they are so nice.

Of course, black is the new black, and Moleskine doesn't forget it. The book can be inconspicuous without being plain. The cover is made of soft "fake leather" that's easy to hold and offers just the right amount of flex.

7512	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this TI for my Business Calculus class.  We are required to have a scientific calculator that does not have graphic ability. What I have found about this calculator is that while it works well, there are some additional steps that have to be taken when doing complex calculations. Where on some calculators you don't have bracket issues, this one, you have to really think out the steps otherwise the answer will come out incorrect.  It does however serve its purpose.  Once I figured out the bracket issues, it's worked like a champ.  I would recommend this calculator for those who need one for a math class, but I would invest in another version of the TI scientific calculator for more complex math class.

9902	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm a big Dymo label writer lover and for the most part I'm very happy with all of their label options-- this one included.  The labels have a nice uniform sheen to them, print uniformly (unlike some other off brands that are kind of spotty when you print on them), they adhere well, and take more than a year before starting to yellow.  It really adds a professional look to your mailings.
My Vita-Mix came with an extra container and blade that are used for grinding, a Whole Food Recipe cookbook (full of delicious recipes), a step by step Getting Started guide, a tamper, and a video. It does seem like a lot to spend for a blender but it's such a versatile product that it's well worth the money. You can use it to make dips and spreads, beverages, soups, sauces, fondues, salad dressings, batters, pureed foods, frozen desserts, and if you have the dry container and blade, you can grind your own grains.
5358	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Pages are easy to write on and have only a little bleed-through (I only use one side of the page because of this).  The binding is solid and will lay nearly flat.

I must add that I love leaving reviews here as reading others' reviews helps me so much and I try to give back the same way. And maybe I'm just a really positive person in general, or perhaps I've just had good luck, but the fact remains that I virtually NEVER leave negative reviews for products, ever. I've written hundreds  of reviews here on Amazon and am quite sure this is only the 5th product, if that, that I've given less than 3 stars. I still can't bring myself to give it only 1 star as it WASN'T expensive, so I don't expect that much by way of quality and am not  exactly HORRIFIED that it fell apart, but I am certainly surprised that a few months of occasionally opening up, briefly using, and then properly storing away this little easel was enough to just... destroy it. Bizarre! And since I only owned one of these, I didn't try buying a second, I can't say with certainty that mine wasn't a rare defective one as there are certainly plenty of positive reviews on here... but I still wanted to share my experience because I know that many times people leave reviews after just receiving a product, or certainly within a few weeks of using it, and may not update those reviews later on. So perhaps if more reviews were left after several months of owning and using the product, there would be more experiences like mine... all I know for sure is that I try to be very reasonable with my expectations, and nothing short of a piece completely falling apart after gentle use would cause me to leave a negative review, so to anyone who's looking for an easel that will last them a long time, this may not be the one for you! However, if you just need this for a short period of time and don't want to shell out a fortune for it than this might meed your needs just fine. I do hope this review helps others make an informed choice! - Amy

The wrist-portion is firm, with the top flattened and contoured to match the bottom of your wrist.  The material in that area is a shiny black finish which seems like it will wear well.  It is very firm though, with little-to-no give in the gel, so if you want a cushy support, look elsewhere.

5726	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a neat and attractive little notebook with a nice cover, and the band keeps it closed.  For fountain pen use, it would rate only about 3 stars for paper quality, but I didn't think it was fair to do that, as most everyone uses a ballpoint or roller ball pen.  For fountain pens, I like the paper of the Clairefontaine notebooks better, although the covers aren't as nice.  Otherwise, this Moleskine is fine.

8022	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	It's worth spending a little more to get a different model.  The keys are not the easiest to press and they don't always register that I have pressed the key.  I have to be very careful to make sure each button I press registers because it can throw off your calculations.
5162	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is the first Moleskine I have ever bought. It seemed a little expensive but I bought it because I have heard great things about it.

A big note for those who purchased the 4oz Color Wash spray in the last year: Ranger discontinued several colors like Pesto, Mushroom, Terra Cotta etc. and also discontinued the 4oz size.

6838	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Best pen and pencil (set) at an EXCELLENT price!
The cover is as useful as the calculator to me because I have always been able to put it into a backpack , pursue , tote , or messenger bag and not worry about if it will work or not.
7192	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Not exactly cheap, but it is super bright and heavyweight. I took a chance and got the case. Given the shipping and everything else involved it is actually a pretty solid deal. I will have paper for several months now, and maybe even a year, but I didn't want to drive 30 minutes each way to Staples. Amazon brought it and saved me an hour of my time, and overall the price was about the same when you factor in gas and time wasted. So the convenience is a serious plus and the paper is good. It is smooth (some bargain-priced ink jet paper feels rough by comparison) and as I said, bright white. Little things like this matter. It NEVER JAMS which is something I don't think about until paper does jam, so that is a bonus. It is packaged for retail. I have no intention of selling off my extra reams of paper, but I suppose that if you did this would be a solid purchase, as each ream comes in the attractive plastic wrapper shown in the product shot.

976	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Got it for the grandkids. They need a world view. This provides it at a reasonable price.
Here are the pros and cons:
6995	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I read all the reviews about "Made in China," however, the pen has been an awesome idea for gifts.  My husband had 2 of these from 20+ years ago that he used for work and lost one of them.  I finally broke down and found one to replace the one he lost (this one) and he was like a kid in a candy store.  I placed the old one next to the new one, and I can't tell the difference.  Neither can he.  He is pleased as punch, as is everyone else I decided to give them to as gifts.  They work great for just about any occasion from high school graduation to Father's Day, or just because.  Also, I priced these elsewhere and Amazon has the best price. Also, the packaging says "class."  You know when you see the package that someone has thought enough to "send the best."  I will definitely continue purchasing these.  Great product for an affordable price. . .
7530	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect pocket calculator for use in the field. The pink color ensures that you can find it easily if you drop it outside.


1138	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These have been my favorite,  and only,  calendars since I discovered them.  All around perfect for all my calendaring needs.
765	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My rising 8th grader is doing summer review work. She completed the book but she is reading the stories in the book again because she loves the stories. She likes them because they are quirky facts that are interesting. For example: why are prairie dogs called prairie dogs? The answer is in the story.
5771	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We used these on the tables at a wedding, to use for journals to read the answers to questions for our next 12 anniversaries!
I recommend this calculator for everyone--the convenience, ease of use, low price, and compact design make it ideal for all.
The second reason this artifact from the early 80's remains popular is size.  Although the 12c comes in a compact package its keys are plenty big enough even for the biggest fingers to comfortably use.  It is lightweight, without being a light weight, and easily slips in a shirt pocket.  Try doing that with the 30b, which is huge.  The 30b and the TI Business Analyst II Plus Professional are more suited for desk use and do not carry out in the field well.  As a note, as big as the 30b is the TI looks like you're carrying around a shoebox.  I had considered getting one of these calculators for the additional functions until I picked them up and held them.
8641	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Not sure why this is so highly rated. The mousepad makes a crinkle noise that gets annoying after a while, and doesn't feel like gel. Buyers be warned, I'll be returning this for another.
5216	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Nice journal , but over priced and over hyped. You'd do much better with Lemome notebooks. Better quality all around, and less expensive.
So charming, you could scoop out a human kidney with it and still feel good about it.

binding is strong and it is easy to draw in.
2940	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I like these.  They are colorful and easy to write on.  Unlike the other reviewer I have no problem with the adhesive.  The notes have successfully stuck up to a whole week to every surface I've put it on.  I just wish the pads were bigger.  Almost half the sticky notes are covered up by the day of the week at the top.  Wouldn't be a problem if the space to write on was a little bigger.
9030	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Really comforts your wrist.
Very pleased with this!
497	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have this hung on my kitchen wall using command hooks. This has been a great way to keep clutter off our kitchen island. We have folders for build, school information, pets, neighborhood news, etc....Definitely recommend this product!
5155	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's the perfect size. I use it for notes, sketches, and everything else I can think of.  The band that keeps it closed is extremely useful and I love the pocket in the back.  The color is bright and vibrant and just what I expected. Very durable and I plan to buy more.
748	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use this calendar every year to help me pay my bills on time. I love the pockets!


7598	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The product came in with no damage and it was as expected.
535	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I really like that the schedule cards allow me to write in the times to correspond with the activities. This really helps my kiddos figure out the schedule as it corresponds to the classroom clock. These do need to be laminated if you want to reuse them, and I did need to order an additional package of schedule cards to accommodate all of the weekly activities we have scheduled. Great product.

I will add updates in the future if I have any changes in my opinion and experience with the product.

8562	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bottom-Line: The Texas Instruments "TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.
It's great quality and came with some calendar pieces that I probably won't use but they were still nice.
2272	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I wish I had found these sooner. I am reading multiple books at a time now and have been using anything I could find - post-it, scrap paper, candy wrapper, etc. They are also great for marking commonly used recipes in your cookbooks. I don't like to "dog ear" the pages, it can be unreliable. The best feature is the arrows on the backside. You can indicate right where you left off. Originally I thought they were separated so you could put them in the middle of pages. The more I thought about it, having them on the edge makes it easier to find. However, you can split them in half by cutting along the sticker between the two magnets.
9259	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I went ten years without a padded mouse rest and am I glad I went back...yes. This is inexpensive and works and looks great.
It is not a perfect match for the finish. If you get right up close to you and really look at it, you can tell it's aftermarket. That being said, this doesn't bother me at all because kind of the point of a voice-assistant is that you *don't* need to get right up close to it and really inspect it.

2633	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I take the list with me to the grocery store each week.  It's convenient having this so that all members of the household can check-off items needed.
5656	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Not exactly what I expected.  I do like the note feature,  but for the price I would have liked a few more features.  I use it daily though and it is a moleskin so. It's quality.
8705	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Soft and very comfortable for good ergonomics
5745	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Was too small for what I had planned for this.
7427	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very nice


613	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	LOVE these planners. They are very reasonably priced, hold up the entire school year and have a nice layout inside
I received this brush at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own.

6518	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is one of the best planners I have ever used. It has a decent area for Appts. And I use most of the other areas for things that I have to do that day, and week. I have used this size and the smaller version. I like this size the best because it gives you more room to write.  The only thing I wish it had was a "Soft" cover on this larger size.  It would make it a lot lighter.  As I carry it with me all the time, and it's heavy.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had the soft cover.
The CD ends with first the reprise of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and then the incredibly strong hit "A Day In The Life." If you're not familiar with this music and you like classic rock then the CD is a must if only for the last song.

5958	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I used these in Grad school.  They are great and it keeps all of your notes for each class neatly in one place. I would recommend for Students.
6155	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I need to track all kinds of important things daily. This works best for me in my current environment. Maybe when I'm back home I'll pursue a more digital format, but here in the moondust, I trust pen and paper.......and not so much pen even.....I'll be looking for a ruggedized pencil soon, because pens start to jam up a bit.
6209	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Gotta love Moleskine.
7564	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works well as expected, great price here
3842	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	What a great design!  I was searching for a keeper to compile family recipes for a wedding gift.  I had no idea this design even existed.
5368	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love them!
3672	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are really cute plates.  I just thought that they would be bigger than dessert plates.  Just heads up to anyone looking for dinner plates.

7088	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Buy the original ink tank and you'll won't be sorry. Some of the refill kits or the generic ones can clog.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************

6510	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My husband started using this planner in 2016 and now he won't use anything else. Its perfect for someone who needs to stay organized and delegate. There are no swirls or flowers, no motivation quotes or any other unwanted nonsense. Its a clear planner with space to stay organized
4149	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I completely agree with all the other reviewers.  These are wonderful little notepads, and much larger than I expected (even though I'd read that in the reviews, I forgot and was surprised when I opened them!).  The actual colors aren't EXACTLY as pictured here on Amazon... especially the light and dark purple, which in actuality are more of a light and dark violet.  In other words, the purple has more red in it than what's pictured here.  That's not a negative though, because they are pretty and fun nonetheless.  (I just mentioned the color difference in case the purple is really what you're after.)


What better way to be a good friend to someone who's been a good friend than to make them laugh!
2347	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Just love the look and feel of this bookmark!
FIrst, it is nice and thick and works very well with ink jet printers without any bleed through or feeling wet after a large graphic is printed. Far too many papers these days are thinner and (to me) feel cheap by comparison.
897	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great Map!
2131	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good book mark
3. There is a meeting notes section at the end. No need to bring multiple books to meetings!
Just FYI, I'm still using the TI-86 at work. The buttons show some wear and I lost the first line of the LCD because I dropped it in college. Nonetheless it's still chugging along.
1676	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love them. Almost identical to the Moleskine, and much cheaper. Nice paper that takes ink or pencil very well.  I use them for journals and notebooks at work. The ribbon bookmark and elastic closure band are nice touches. Moleskine doesn't have anything additional to offer that these don't. And, they're still offered by the company that's made them for almost 100 years.
4299	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I homeschool my grandson. I ordered this because of high reviews on this program for kids with sensory issues, but I don't like it. The style is not attractive, and it was not easier for him to master. After trying this for a year, I have switched to something else that. I sometimes pull this out for the content and produce worksheet so that the writing can be done in the style I prefer. In fairness, there are many homeschool parents that love this and feel it works well for their child. I think people should always choose what works in their own situation when it comes to books for teaching. Children are different, and this may be perfect for your child.  I have no problem with the way the material is presented, just with the boxy, hard to read cursive style.
222	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It is not laminated, but it has a shiny finish to it.  I love the fact that it has the numbers highlighted in different colors. I got this one along with the Dr. Seuss Package to teach our kid and decorate the play room.
Now I just have to remember to bring it with me if I think I'm going to be stopping by the store on my way home!
4693	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are the prettiest notebooks I've ever used and I will definitely buy them again. They're super thin so if you're looking for something for a class this is not the notebook for you, though. If you want something to jot down lists in, or thoughts, this notebook is perfect.
9155	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Bought this and a rounded wireless mouse and my wrist doesn't bother me any more!  It's great if your on your computer a lot!
325	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I was so happy to get this little book. It is so cute and easy to put in your purse for little notes or phone numbers. Over all I would by it again.
Also, the Flash technology makes the calculator  uprgradable, so the calculator will not "get old" in a few years.  I graudated in accounting, and I'm finding much useful functions in the  business world:  time-value-of-money, Statistics (both downloadable either  from the TI website or other programs), Benford's model, and other useful  applications.  It is a great compliment in college and in high school.
2221	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I purchased four or five of these very sturdy bookmarks that have a beaded tassel.  This one says, "Every dog must have his day."  It's a good size for either a hardback book or a paperback book and is enclosed in a plastic sleeve for its protection.
3237	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great
1542	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Very very bulky, and colors are not as bright as appears in the photo. You will not want to haul this around with you, but if you need something to stay at your desk, this would be good for you.
The name has a history in itself. It came from a nickname that British writer Bruce Chatwin ("Songlines") called his favorite notebook. The cover is made of oilcloth (vinyl-permeated cotton mesh) not leather.
4937	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great.
-There is no monthly spread before each month, just small monthly calendars towards the front of the book
6199	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have used these for a couple of years.  They are a ggreat way of keeping notes.  I add the 3M reusable flags with it, to better keep up with to do items, calendars, etc.
7788	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm a research scientist who uses computers both at home and at work. But I also like to have a good scientific calculator ready at hand for convenience. I prefer Texas Instruments calculators for ease of use and reliability. I keep a calculator in my bedroom, den, living room, car, and at work. Three of my calculators are TI30XAs. That's right, as a practicing scientist I find that the bargain-priced TI30XA calculator has every scientific function I need for most problems. On the rare occasions that I need more power I use a computer. It never ceases to amaze me that many of my scientific colleagues are so computer dependent that they don't even own a calculator. Whenever they're away from their computer, they're lost. But with several TI30XAs, I have a calculator handy almost everywhere I am. You can spend more for a calculator but it's hard to find one that out performs the inexpensive TI30XA for most applications.
2629	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I made my own "Problem Solver" form a few years back. This is similar and pretty cool.  It helps when you can't "Think outside the box" on decisions or problems.
250	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are cute signs that are helpful in class.
I give this 4 stars because it is well made and very attractive.  I have always loved Liberty Prints.  I will use this, just not exactly as designed.
5929	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love these journals. Just the right size to carry in my purse; thin, light weight, yet large enough to write good notes and thoughts. I like the plain cover so I can decorate it with my sharpies, and label them according to their use. These journals are thin enough to carry one or all three in my purse without adding weight or bulk. I also like the buff-colored paper instead of glaring white like so many other journals.
3372	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cute incentive charts with stickers. A teacher's must have. Helps me get my daugther do her chores and homework with a lot less figthing. Worth every penny. It also includes the stickers
272	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works very well.  I bought this along with magnetic pictures to make a schedule for special needs child.
Great quality touches abound with this note book such as:

5641	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A good size and a good quality product
 Noteworthy Features:
7358	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good
The half turn barrel is smooth without any issues.
I feel the non fussy, mostly blank slate welcomes my creativity, which is why I chose this planner. I used doodles, stamps and stickers to personalize my AD planner. Though the format is unique, this size works with most standard planner stickers and stamps.
1908	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My daughter loved this little gift.
I just wished it had small glass lids for the small pieces.
5131	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	suits my purpose just right.  I am decorating the covers with zentangles and giving to friends.
Has a lot of functions which saves you time when doing the fe exam.
I would buy this set again.
2205	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice bookmark
I also love that if I make a mistake I can correct it without starting over from the beginning.
2779	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Used these as fun holiday gifts to workers - everyone laughed and loved it.
6962	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.
8514	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love my TI83 I was confused about working it but I took a class at my college and found out how to use it!! <3
5515	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The covering of the spine is loosening,  but everything else is great.
I love the devotions because no matter if I'm having a good or bad day, they are exactly what I need to hear and they help me achieve a sense of calm and peace. At first, I liked this flip calendar but I personally prefer the hardcover version so I ended up purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jesus-Calling-Enjoying-Peace-in-His-Presence/dp/1591451884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence</a>&nbsp;as well. I compared the two versions and the print in the hardcover one is ever so slightly larger and contains an introduction that I really enjoyed reading. I'm planning to give this flip calendar version to my mom so at least it will get used but this would still be great for anyone who wants one on their desk at work, nightstand, or any location where they spend enough time to read these devotions.
4181	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Every time I see the cover, I smile.  Even my checks have Snoopy on them.  Very practical for my use since it is good for two years.  Great product, great price!

1366	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are LIGHTLY scented gel pens in beautiful neon pastel shades, perfect for easter cards or drawing on black paper. They quickly dry down to a matte finish and do not smudge. The tip size is about 1.0mm, I'd say. Each pen has 6 shades and the cap color tells you which color it starts off with (you can also just look through the clear barrel to tell which is next). These are comparable to Sakura pens at half the price!

1486	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This product was what I have been looking for never thought to go to Amazon to fine it.  Even with the three different colors it is great for all in the family.  works well does not leak. the covers were better than I thought they would be.  If you need a hot water bottle this is the one.
9278	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great price. Wrist support is great.
I kept the book in my backpack or purse while in Paris. In the back pocket I added business cards, postcards, pamphlets, photos I took - every scrap of paper I wanted as a memory. I also used the book as a diary of my trip, adding addresses and phone numbers of new friends and new places (cathedrals, bistros, small out of the way museums.)
8638	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Works well on my desk but after a while when you lift your wrist off the pad there is a crinkling sound like the inner padding is surrounded by plastic.  Using this on a tray on a sit/stand desk the mouse doesn't track very well even though it appears to be flat.  I'm using the Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse, 800 / 1200 /1600DPI, 5 Buttons - Black.
The Cons:
910	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	very beautiful....too cheap really, but that's great for the buyer!
6372	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this pen because I have a tremor in my right hand, and after buying numerous pens trying to find one that works well, this one works for me. The shape of the pen with the rubber part helps anyone with a shaky hand. I wish there was a way I could purchase more black refills, as I use it to write in my daily journal. The other colors are okay but nothing to get excited about. I just ordered 6 more of these, because I need to keep them in stock.
Has a back arrow key to delete entry one number at a time  Very nice  Functions like delete key

The wording I think is just right for a small child to understand and the colors are attractive. This is great for my son and I would recommend to others.
6404	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are, by far, the best Bible hi-lighters! Those who say they bleed are PRESSING TOO HARD! These do NOT bleed if you use them correctly.
2421	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect in every way.

4103	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Smith's Deluxe Knife & Scissors Sharpener sharpens my knives quickly and easily.  I don't find it unsteady to use as the other reviewer does.

8958	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	No complaints about this mouse pad, great price, soft cushion.
1. There is not a lot of space to write a bunch of things.
packages gets a lot less abusive treatment.
I have attached two pictures, one showing that the G2 pilot ink does not smudge very much if you let dry, and only faintly shows through (yes, I know my handwriting is atrocious, but that's only when I'm note-taking for myself). The second is to show the back pocket with the notes I keep on me.
The paper in this notebook accepts ink easily from both gel pens (my first choice) and pall point pens. While this won't fit in a pocket, neither will it crowd out your neighbors at a crowded conference table. I keep one at my desk at work for the notes on the things I can't trust to memory, and one stashed with my camera bag to capture information on the locations where I've taken pictures.
5764	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful, well crafted sketchbook. It has excellent quality paper, it opens and lays flat, doesn't bleed through the pages and the pages don't buckle with watercolor. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
6497	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This product is user friendly.  I love the guiding principles that are listed in the front of the organizer to help the consumer learn how to develop a plan of "action" to complete his/her goals.

6716	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This great and helps me prioritize my work day, and it fits in my large purse.
7365	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	In a way I'm jealous of some of the folks reviewing HP's calculator line who have tried virtually the whole line of HP calculators. But then in a way I'm not because I found the best one right off the bat. I did have a 22S before my 32SII, and was very happy with it, but when it came time to replace it with this one I soon found that I had made an excellent choice. And now when I'm looking for a new one (just to see what's on the market, mind you) I see that HP still hasn't topped this calculator, judging from the reviews on the new ones. I'll never sell this baby; it'll stay right by my monitor at work, ready to quickly and effortlessly run numbers for me. I particularly like the keys, which are solid and have a good feel to them. This is a quality calculator.
7105	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I used to cringe when I had to buy these! The office supply place charges three times what I paid here, three times more for 1. Absolute rip! I will never buy these anywherelse and am so mad that over the years I have wasted all of that money sending the office supply guy to hawaii and back on my money!
7117	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this paper! It is certainly bright white.  While the brightness is too much contrast and shiny-ness for me to preach from, it's brilliantly wonderful for anything else.  What I really like about it, though, is its thickness - it isn't an easily rippable, cheap paper. You can abuse these pages a bit, and they won't go mashugga on you.  And being designed by HP for their printers, of course the ink hits the page and sticks there without bleeding, smearing, running, or anything else.  Of all the papers (copier paper, other inkjet paper, letterhead, etc.) I have run through my photosmart printer, apart from the premium photo paper, this is the best.  By far. If you have an HP inkjet, you have to be using this paper.  And truth to tell, you can print a photo on it, too, and it will look pretty darn good.
899	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Mounted this map to a cork board and framed it. Have been adding pins to it every time we visit a new place. Love it!
8776	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I cut it down a bit and rubber banded it over Skyzonal Ergonomic Adjustable Computer Desk Extender Arm Wrist Rest Support/ Mouse Pad Desk Chair System Computer Armrest Wrist Rest, Black. Very comfortable.
2684	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Need to implement this more with my children.
7833	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I really, really don't like the fact that I was required to buy this calculator for a Calculus class that I never wanted to take, but this totally does what it's supposed to do.
2556	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	love that I could shop for a frame of my choice, because it fits a standard size.  looks great on the wall
9076	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It is clear that better than average materials were used on this pad.
909	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Really Nice

6332	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my needs.  Takes up very little room, but holds a lot and is a great organizer.

6816	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful fountain pen that writes smoothly. It is a little thinner than most of my pens but has a quality heft to it. I highly recommend it for users of fountain pens.
5540	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Super fast shipping. Great Quality. Better than expected. Thanks.
2196	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	A review on a bookmark?  Sure!
4480	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	As a Children's Ministry director (check out my Growing Kids Ministry blog), I have a LOT of props, posters, and paper-things.  I used to try to keep them in the cupboard or on book shelves, but of course they would end up wrinkled or smashed or lost.  I got two of these and some command hooks (hoping to post pictures later) and put them on one of the walls in my office.  One is for poster board and already made posters, and the other is for maps, those fold up paper props (like palm trees, birds, etc), and things like.  They are working great and look good too.  I try to put an updated list of what is in the bag so I don't have to rifle through everything.
6033	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This was a trial and it's pretty good but still like a heavier paper.
3606	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this for a friend to put in his yard (along with another set of a hen and chicks).  This rooster is very well made and the colors really show him off.  He would also be a nice addition to your den or other room that needs perked up.  Highly recommend.
8075	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	good

163	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	gift for granddaughter
- Trains
c) Cover - the cover of the notebook is a very sleek vinyl cover that is resistant to liquids, stains, daily use, etc. It reminds me of the material that synthetic footballs/basketballs/baseballs are covered with.
Its not as solidly made as the TI-85's I had in Calc as an undergrad, but its small, lightweight and easy to use --- worth the 28$ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel
2618	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've been using an older version of this from Knock Knock for quite some time now; it's the only way I stay organized at my desk without resorting to more than one date book.  I keep my class times listed, as well as a brief description of what needs to be done and by when, and it's been a godsend.  Whenever I have a week that isn't very busy I'll usually use correction tape to clear the dates and re-write them--no reason to waste a sheet I've barely used.
8855	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works
4682	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The paper is very thick.  It has not bled through, and even though it is watercolor paper, I am able to erase marks cleanly without damaging the paper.
296	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great for starter poetry books
1833	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love these folders. I get them whenever I see them at a great price. I just cant resist them.
I don't think I'll be making Moleskine a big part of my portable life on the strength of this admittedly well-though-out item. With some sort of provision for carrying a writing implement that wouldn't be the case.
830	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This enhanced stereo CD is by far the best stereo version of this famous CD. The only CD of this that I would rate higher is the original mono mix that only comes in the "Mono Box Set" for $160.00. You can save your money and get this, the best stereo version ever mixed!

Basic calculator, simple and easy to use and carry.
6710	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Suggestion: Fully plan out your Tabbing. It was important to me to have these PERMANENT tabs look nice inside my Bible. I didn't want 2 1/2 rows of tabs (I wanted ONE, but it wasn't possible.) So...use the measuring guide and COUNT how many tabs you'll be able to place down the length of your Bible, then count out the tabs.

EVERY color is not writing smoothly. I have to go over the same spot over and over and over just to get one simple little line. It really makes studying my bible and doing my devotionals frustrating instead of fruitful. :(
3328	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Not really what I was expecting, but is nice. My only problem is the print is very small, hubby has to pick it up off the desk to read it. A desk calendar should be able to be read while it is still on the desk, and he has good vision.
7203	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It has never given me a moment of trouble and I can still use this black and white copier to save on using my newer printer and its extremely expensive inks.  It's 21 years old and in hindsight, worth every penny.  Hewlett Packard really came through with this product.
8184	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice cards.
8374	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	If you're used to the 83/84 layout, this is the right calculator for you. Perfect for the FE and other examinations where graphing capability is not permitted.

2775	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Totally over priced.  One tiny pad of High Five and that's it. Very disappointed.
9946	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect, better than expected!

6655	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Wow. This was quite a surprise. I have a collection of Bibles and have discovered I want tabs in all of them. I have, in the past two years, used about half a dozen different types and brands and sizes of indexing tabs. Though I like some a lot more than others, they are all good -- UNTIL I just used these.

9524	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	For two years, I had the "3M Large Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest, Black Leatherette, Antimicrobial Product Protection", but after eight months, the thick, hard silicone pad started to curl at the edge forming a bowl. This made my mouse arrow bounce around and less accurate. The Belkin mouse pad is similar with its very comfortable wrist pad that barely feels like you are resting on it. The gel immediately fills back when you release your wrist.

I use Moleskines for drawing with pencil and Sakura ink pens.  They do not stress the paper and the artwork looks really good.  If I want to use color, I use colored pencils or oil pastels, nothing wet.  If I am using watercolor, I carry the Strathmore watercolor notebooks, (Visual Journals), that come in 90 lb or 140 lb weights, - "real" watercolor paper, that delivers results without the buckling.
They slide in and out of the pages well, and never fall out.
8558	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My daughter had to have a scientific calculator for her math class.  I've always used Texas Instruments, and, as expected, this product is high quality and easy to use.  The slide off case is handy when it needs to be protected during transport.
1823	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Wasn't sure it would hold up due to the way they are assembled, but so far so good!
6354	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is my children's 'school station'. This is perfect to house their items: backpacks on the top, hats, scarves, gloves in the middle, lunch boxes and umbrellas on the bottom. I love the fun color and it's maneuverability. We have this stationed right next to our coat rack so it is their hub in and out the door each morning and keeps all of their things organized and easy to locate. Highly recommend!
The stapler is all steel, so it's tough but also a little heavy. Be ready for tired arms if you have to hold it up for a longer period of time, such as when hanging insulation. While it's not that loud, it's not ultra quiet, either. Those with sensitive hearing (like me) may want to use some earplugs.

2592	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	(Kindle Edition) This is the most informative, easy to follow book about art journaling that I own (and that would be MANY!)  Dina Wakley's easygoing approach is a joy to read. She shares her creative philosophy and lists in detail all materials used on each journal page. The materials are easy to find and relatively inexpensive. Note: this book was published before her products were made available through Ranger; but you will recognize many of her drawings that are now available as stamps. By the time I finished the book, I felt as if I had attended one of her workshops in person. If Dina writes another book, I will definitely purchase it.
3500	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works great even though I don't use it as much as I would have liked but it makes presentation much nicer and easier.

7191	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Used for resume paper and this did the trick.
3086	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This product is super cute. I went through it quickly when I first received it and the fill in the blanks are very easy to think of things to write and it allows for creativity, which I love. I did minus one star because it is a tad smaller in size than I had imagined, but then again I may have a large imagination. I do write fairly big so it may be difficult for me personally to write a lot on the page. To be honest, this product is cute, well priced and came packaged well with no dents or bent pages (which would have driven me crazy- OCD!). My mother will love it because it is creative and can be personalized, so all in all, this is a good purchase.

6912	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use these every day at work. I have always found Cross pens to be exceptionally smooth writing pens and expected no less from the mechanical pencil. I was NOT disappointed. This is my GO TO set. I would recommend this set to anyone

9037	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is my second one.  The first one I used for just over 5 years before the fabric started peeling away from the rubber pad backing.
6893	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My husband got this for me for Christmas, and was very sneaky about it. I LOVE THIS PEN! It has a very fine tip, and it writes beautifully. I like that it's thinner, because it seems easier to write with. It's also very light. The ink goes so fast because I use it so much. Highly recommend!
9547	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It is hard to use a mouse pad this small after having used some larger ones. The wrist rest is nice though and this is a good travel pad when needed.

8765	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Excellent for mouse, okay for my wrist/hand.  The gel is nice but I wish it would come back to original shape after use. My wrist "print" stays there even over night.  The fabric is very good, does not irritate my skin when moving against it which was something that concerned me.  I'm an old computer user over 34 years.
9337	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very comfy on the wrist
8759	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Excellent

6312	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This notebook is everything I hoped it would be. It fits in my back pocket, the pages flip over the top, and after you've broken it in for a few days, the cover flips over to the backside and you can hold the whole thing flat in one hand. I love the little elastic strap that holds it shut, and the pocket inside that you can slip business cards and papers into, without them being inclined to fall out. The pocket has the opening towards the binding, so when you hold the notebook in any direction, the contents of the pocket are safe.
The dates run from August 2014 through December 2015 on this one, which is great for academic-year planning for those of us who teach. It does make the calendar a bit heavy and thick to have so many months included, but with my last calendar, I ended up tearing out a previous semester once it was finished to remove some bulk. The overall size of this is great, though, since it is easy to toss in not only a work tote, but also a purse.

5400	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I had been really heasitant to purchase a Moleskine because of the price I normally saw in-stores. However, I bit the bullet and bought this one for myself, and I absolutely love it. Its very simple and looks quite nice, not cheap or poorly put together at all. The pages have a nice ruled size, perfect for thoughts, lists, etc. The hardcover binding just ties it all together. I will definitely be repurchasing these for all my future journal needs.
2208	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a gorgeous bookmark, and the tassel makes it very easy to find your spot in a book.  I find myself staring into the eyes of the depicted wolf and thinking about the saying each time I look at the bookmark.

4499	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Not very heavy duty and not well made, one of the yellow pockets has ripped out of the seam a little and the kids don't touch it. I'm using it for a job chart and it has 30 slots which was good for my 29 students.
3456	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This was a gift for my daughter who loves Duck Dynasty.  She was very pleased with it.
However I have two comcerns with it:
- I LOVE the turquoise cover they offered this year. This exterior is made of a nice material which feels smooth and high-end, better than last year's "model". It's also bound very nicely.

9115	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great mouse pad. Not sure why are there negative feedbacks! Good support for wrists, highly recommend.
I found that paying extra $ for faster delivery pays off! The packaged calculator travels with smaller and lighter

7595	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my granddaughters school supplies. She loved it.
The blocks are big enough to write all of your important dates in!  I have gotten so many compliments on this calendar!
If you need to do derivates, integrals, polynomials, etc, then you should get something more powerful. If you just want a calculator to do your basic math yet allow you to check your numbers with ease, then this is a great calculator to have.
9983	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	aok, will use again, quick
6773	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	As someone who's become overly reliant on Google Calendar, this organizer has been a great addition. I particular like the "tasks to execute" and "goals/projects" sections. Great deal for the price.
9814	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This testament to the quality of this tool may be how many times I've either had it stolen. For under 20 bucks you get a stapler that will work perfectly -- not a single jam -- until you 'lose it'. Great for stapling  screen, fabric or any material into wood as well as other light surfaces.  I've used it for a variety for household repair project and I suspect it is  great for craft things as well.
8874	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	For the most part, it's very comfortable.  A big reason why I bought it was to match all my sleek metallic Mac stuff, and it looks very nice with the matching keyboard wrist rest.  There are a few flaws in the material and it's very easy to get dirty.  There's also no real seam around the edges, so I imagine this will fray sooner than other hemmed pads.  I also think the mouse pad could be bigger - I have to turn my tracking speed up to cover my 27" monitor with this mouse pad, which isn't a major deal but it is a rating factor.
6172	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These notebooks are classic and reliable.  The Squared version is even less compatible with fountain pen or gel ink than the Ruled or Plain versions, however.  Plan to use this with pencil or ballpoint.
This is a great gift for teachers, history buffs and current event nuts alike.  I know my mom just loves it!
I think this would be better for someone who is due in a week or something, because the pregnancy part has a section "How it all started" and a page about choosing names, and a page about the name selected, but other than that it's all about getting close to birth, not exactly about the pregnancy experience. Definitely nowhere for me to write that I'm craving guacamole, which I've only sort of liked before.
6247	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bought as part of a gift set for my niece's birthday.  She loves moleskin and she asked for watercolors this year, so I got 2 of these in different sizes to go with her kit.
6409	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	the markers DO bleed through the pages of the bible.  Would not recommend these - get the crayon type instead
6405	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Recommended by many Bible Journalists. Will start using them in my Bible in May
4090	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This summer, when you're out in the sun, keep this cooling gel with you. It has an instant hydrating effect on the skin, cooling you off and helping to prevent sunburn. It's a must-have for anyone planning to spend some time outdoors this summer.
701	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I love Dilbert!  But just like the Peanuts calendar this same publisher has removed 52 days of Sunday comics to reduce the calendar to 313 days for the same price as 365 last year. Shame on them, I wish that I had an alternative to buy the real 365 day version. And shame on Scott Adams for selling out to these guys.
7172	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Nowhere in the product listing is it stated that this is a used cartridge that has been drilled and refilled and repackaged. The toner cartridge I received was an "Office Depot" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.
9303	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Serves the purpose!
7998	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I can see the function symbols on this one, where the TI 36x PRO I purchased the glare of light on the function buttons prevents seeing these, unless the light is just right.
4925	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great little notebooks. Nice size
9307	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Feels and looks great!
To test the T50, I stapled a range of materials from canvas to cardboard to cedar planks.  It stapled everything without the least problem.  Staples penetrated these materials smoothly and securely, with staples very securely attached to the top of each surface, flush.  This is exactly what I expect from such a stapler and not once did I experience a jam either with the staples themselves and/or withe the stapler's parts.  Staples are easy to load and easy to eject.  Again, stapling requires some effort but this should be expected of any stapler and is in part a sign of quality construction.
6182	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is the notebook everyone should think of when they think of the definition of a notebook. Maybe the ruled version, but squares are more exotic. Every page is worth about 7.3 cents if I did my math right! That's written value only money can buy! Literally every word I write in this thing is consuming several fractions of a penny.... holy crap.
4648	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	great price, I don't print much other than black & white documents but so far works as welll as canon ink.
The paper is extremely thin, but it's good-quality, and the thinness means that you can fit 80 pages in a remarkably thin notebook. My fountain pen flows beautifully on it using the right ink (I'm using Noodler's Black right now), and it has taken well to every ballpoint and gel pen I've tried (Uni-Ball Vision rollerball pens were the only disaster--they bled worse than even a fountain pen ink that took poorly). I can't see anything on the other side of the paper unless I hold it up to the light, and I can use the backs of the pages with no issue.
8088	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The actual calculator is great, but it takes forever and wading through a bunch of menus to do something. The manual is great for advanced operations, but if you want to do something simple, it isn't in the manual. Overall, a great product, but learn from someone who knows what they are doing.
2499	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We've traveled a lot, and wanted a large map to remind us where we've been. This one is not too big, but big enough to be easy to use for this purpose. Plus, it's beautiful, hanging on the wall.
It is too bad they could not add the new advantages without scrambling up the good things they had before. Hey Texas Instruments, how hard is it to respect -- and take full advantage of -- the speed habits that you yourselves have built up in your customers?
1347	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	the item arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted
3536	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Daughter loved it
5953	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm finally getting around to using this (almost a year later), and it's so great. I was intimidated at first, but it really is such a nice notebook. The pages are high quality, and I think the line spacing is nice. Pen doesn't bleed all the way through the pages, but can sometimes be seen on the other side, but not badly. Definitely a worthwhile purchase now that I'm actually writing in it.
Overall, if you like paper planners or diaries, Moleskine is the best.  And if you want to carry it with you, this 12-notebook set is ideal.  Can't wait for 2010!
I love this. I'm not sure how I did without it.
8884	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is perfect for my office. I have a desk job and this helps with wrist pain. I am so happy I got this. I also got a keypad gel pad and it's  just as amazing
This calculator should last through high school when she needs the graphing version(function wise, not sure how long it will last or if she will lose it). It is a great calculator!!


I'm docking a star for cost. The difference in materials between this and a four dollar book simply doesn't  justify the asking price.
But it's not especially pretty. So when Amazon Vine offered me this recipe organizer from the Victoria & Albert museum -- adorned with William Morris designs! -- how could I say No? I am really happy with it.

5524	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product & seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!
3462	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These lesson plan books work very well for me! I like that I can write in lots of stuff to each box. And so cute too!
5630	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It has an alphabetized section to list your books by title, when you read them, and what you thought of them, an index in the back that you can fill in as you go along, and sections like "Borrowed" and "Lent", "Wish List", and best of all, a "To Be Read" section to keep track of your TBR pile in. This last is especially handy if the books you plan to read are scattered all over the house, office, and e-reader and not in one neat little pile next to your favorite chair!
The fit and finish of the pen is fine, no blemishes or tool marks or sharp edges.
5275	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for notes in math class. Much nicer to have a review booklet for tests and future semesters than a big pile of stray papers.
4814	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm a bit forgetful, and I've been using pocket notebooks for over 15 years to store my daily thoughts, tasks, and reminders. Recently, I stumbled on the moleskin brand of notebooks and decided to give their smallest size a try for my pocket notebook needs. What I found was the single highest quality pocket notebook I've ever experienced. There are a few, small flaws; however they are extremely personal to the way I use pocket notebooks, and most certainly not a statement of quality of the notebooks themselves.

2390	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice little book
1249	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This little book is perfect and fits right in your purse.  The magnetic closure is very strong. There's enough space to write notes when needed and it's easy to write in. The pages don't feel cheap like the recycled papers you buy for school.  There was no bad smell for me. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have one of those little pockets on the inside. Even though this is a password journal, it'd still be nice to have a pocket on one or both ends of the book for those who will be using this and carrying it with them all the time.  The bonded leather and the stitching are nice.  The book lays flat for when your writing in the book, which is very good for me.

678	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This "scrapbook-like" loose leaf binder has everything one would want in making and keeping their favorite recipes that can be passed down over the years. The sturdy dividers have reproductions of prints by William Morris, a late-19th Century artist and designer ([...]). That was one thing that made this book "special" for me! There are adequate letter size sheets for your recipes and if you need more, a free pdf can be downloaded so that they can easily be printed. Each divider has a pocket to hold recipes in progress or other items. A very useful thing! Inside the covers are measuring equivalents and such that serves as a handy reference. This is a beautiful book just waiting for your favorite recipes! After you purchase a copy for yourself, I bet you'll want copies to use as gifts!
4566	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use this pocket chart for my homeschool materials.  I have it pinned on the back of a door with thumb tacks only and it is holding nicely.  The pockets are just big enough for a 'letter-size' folder and will hold several pages.
6300	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I can consume one of these notebooks faster than a pack-a-day smoker can burn through a pack of cigarettes. I've been using hardcover Moleskine notebooks for more than 20 years and can honestly say the quality is unrivaled. It's not a journey unless I've got a pocket-sized Moleskine stuffed into the back pocket of my blue jeans. It never loses my data. There's never a low-battery warning to dismiss. There's never a need to switch off and on again to wait for the reboot. The remarkably hearty back pocket keeps my magnetic-stripe transit cards safe and separate from my wallet. The durable elastic strap never breaks loose. The bindings never quit. Neither rain, nor snow, nor sitting crosslegged on concrete for hours can kill these things. I've subjected them to all kinds of torture, albeit unintentionally. I've bent then, dropped them, sopped them, thrown them, crushed them and crammed them full of gibberish, yet every one I ever purchased still lives.

7967	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Made well and last for years.
However this years calendar is beyond horrible. It looks like it was designed by a three year old and was then outsourced to China for printing and assembly. I will explain:
The few things I don't like---the pages are printed on both sides, so if you do one you like on both sides, one side will be hidden when you display it.  The pages are printed close to the binding, and don't come out of the book easily.  I like to take a page out while I work on it, and a bit of the picture ripped as I did that several times.  The pictures are also a bit repetitive, with parts of big pictures being repeated in smaller form with other pictures on some pages.
3157	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bought for my daughter who is a Kindergarten teacher and needed resources. Product came quick, good quality and she likes it.
1. Craftsmanship - When I got the calendar in the mail, I took it out and tried to set it up. The cover and binder promptly fell off the calendar, it now has the glue backing that the pages are stuck to exposed on the top. Since the calendar attached to the plastic stand with sticky glue on the back cover, the calendar doesn't "stick" to the plastic stand anymore, since it only has the glue and pages left.
I hope this review helped you out!

6183	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This notebook will be used as a library of tangles.  Like the squared format very much and the feel of the individual pages.
I am very excited about the Moleskine devoted to books. It is designed like an address book - four pages for each letter of the alphabet.  So that means you can record information about books either by title, or by an authors' last name. You can write down quotes from the books, your own review, notes and awards. I would also suggest including the author and publishers web site in case you want to look at other books by the author.

Cons/complaints:
The paper is thick, poster like (very close to thin bristol board actually) and a very soft beige color.  It is, thank God, untextured - very smooth yet holds on to ink perfectly.  The thickness allows you to use soft traces of watercolor and diluted ink without a lot of bending.  (If you want to go heavier with liquids I suggest you purchase the Moleskine Watercolor Notebook.

Quite small, and you won't be able to fill a lifetime's worth of files in here, but for the minimalist organizer or something sweet to go beneath of or on top of a desk, you'll be quite pleased.  It's extremely sturdy, however I docked a star for this:  the bottom is just a thin plastic sort of fabric, and if you added a lot of hefty papers to this, I could see the bottom becoming loose and eventually ripping if you needed to lift it a lot.  So keep it on a surface if you intend on buying this.

I recently started meal prepping and it's changed so many aspects of my life. I used to go to the store and roam around picking stuff up that sounded good, but then at dinner time I didn't really have a plan for how I was going to cook them. It pretty much resulted in rotating like 3 regular meals and a family that was bored with my cooking. Meal prepping has saved me money, made us eat healthier and helped me be efficient with time. I use the "What to eat" pad to plan out my meals. I use my personal list of recipes for most days and then find a new one on Pinterest or in a recipe book for a couple days. I plan ahead with the timing of extracurricular activities, making crock pot meals and prep ahead meals when we'll get home late. I systematically chose a meal, look at the ingredients and then check them off this grocery list or write them in. I do that day by day so I know that I'll have everything I need and not end up with a bunch of extra stuff.

After having said all that, there is one CON to this calculator in my experience. The silver keys. The coating and texturing is kind of odd in the way they reflect light. Sure they look cool but it is also more difficult to read these keys. I cannot tell you how many times I have accidentally pressed the plus sign instead of the multiplication. Sure, during those times I was in more of a hurry and a bit on the careless side, but the design of a calculator needs to take that into consideration. It would be better if these keys were just black with white symbols instead of attempting to look fancy. Perhaps more use of this calculator will resolve that, but I don't have this problem with the 30, which places the operation keys in the  same locations. Now with that in mind, I still decide to use the 36 instead of the 30 during my tests, even though I wasn't going to be using the integral, derivative and rref functions.

1502	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Just received, it is beautiful. I was expecting from one of the other reviews that it would be a little bit more of a textured cover but it's mostly flat with just a slight concave dent on the jewels - however I just went back and read that review and their description is accurate; I just interpreted it on the side of luxury - probably because of how stunned I was by the design altogether. I really fell in love with this journal the instant I saw it in the "Bought by others" row as I was browsing. I am not disappointed!! The shape of the flap adds an elegant effect and the lines are neither too wide or too narrow. I have long been a fan of the smaller, less expensive pocket size ones, but they're just not big enough for journaling, which is why I end up putting them in a drawer somewhere and not writing in them. If I would have just bought a full size one in the first place ...... !! I finally decided to gift myself with one so that I can sit and write comfortably ... I am glad I did.
1937	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great quality notebook. It held up well to the abuse of being thrown in and out of bags and dropped all over. The paper is nice with minimal bleed - the only time I had trouble was once when coloring in boxes with highlighters. The squares are larger than I normally like but are a fairly standard size that most people prefer. I like that the squares go all of the way to the edge of the pages and are consistent throughout the book. The binding is well done and the pocket holds up well. The only feature I would have liked to see added is a pen loop but there is space to slide a pen under the elastic strap across the top of the pages.

  The bottom line is that this is a good small job gun, but if I'm going to do a lot of trim work or upholstery work, or if I had less grip strength, I'd look at the electric guns (less power, though) or the air stapler (the most power, but more investment). The main con to this gun is that it does take a lot of grip strength to use it correctly (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  BTW, I'm a 69 yr old man with small hands and have been doing handyman & DIY projects most of my life.

We picked out this one because it was so similar to our very nice large one.  The basket design on this mini is very good for the sprouts, as they don't tend to get caught in it hardly at all, so it's easy to clear out and easy to clean.  We find we use it more than the larger one--since there are only two of us--for herbs clipped from the garden, salads, veggies for stir-fries, which need to be dry for best results, and for some fruits as well.  It's a good little workhorse.

This book presents reading comprehension as a game - my son becomes a "Reading Detective", looking for the specific clues in the readings that will provide the answer to higher level questions. Kids are required to specify the sentences that provide the clues in addition to providing the answer. I like how this gets my son engaged in meta-cognition, as he tries to figure out how he knows what he knows.

1665	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Moleskine notebooks since they were first produced, sometime in the 90's if I recall correctly.  At that time, I bought a large number of them (several dozens) because I was afraid that they would stop making them since Moleskine was still a small company.  Recently, my supply ended and I bought a few more.  I was disappointed because the quality of the paper was not the same as the original.  I tried a couple of alternatives and did not like them (I hated Rhodia paper because it's too glossy and I thought that Leuchtturm's index pages were annoying).  I concluded that the best option was to use Moleskine sketchbooks because their thicker paper is nice.  However, they are pricey. Last week, I decided to try the Essentials Notebook.  I am very impressed.  The paper is better than the current regular Moleskine notebook and more similar to the original.  The binding, cover, etc., are very similar to the Moleskine.  And their price is significantly lower.  I still think that the Moleskine sketchbook is a better option in terms of paper quality but it has its disadvantages besides the price (fewer pages and it might be too much for someone who only uses it for notes).  So...I decided to start using Essentials notebooks in most cases and reserve the use of the Moleskine sketchbook for certain special projects.  Five stars for excellent value.

8604	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this calculator back in High School about 6 years ago and have not regretted purchasing it ever.  It is a great calculator, which is the proverbial truth that it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.  The only  reason that I mention this is that calculators take really large beating in  backpacks and this specific one handles those very well.  In the 6 years  that I have had this calculator it has worked flawlessly and I have taken  it with me to collage, where it is serving me very well.  I would very much  recommend this calculator to anyone that needs a graphing calculator.  It  does not matter if you are in high school or collage.  It's a great  calculator.  Further more unlike some of the other non-TI calculators and  even the TI-86 and TI-89 this one is very easy to learn and use.
1232	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I have a few of these books. This one is my favorite. The pictures are beautiful and interesting, not too big or too small. Colored pencils would probably be ideal but I like using gel pens. I will probably go through my ink pretty quickly however. On a side note, the paper is thick enough that I can use gel ink and it doesnt ruin the pictures on the other side. I do find that these help my stress. I have a condition that aggravates my heart when Im stressed that is very noticeable. But if I take time to color in these I've noticed my symptoms have gone and I feel much more calm. And its way easier than meditating!

5168	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The book is good overall, with good binding. The paper is smooth, thin and recycled, to the ink "bleeds" through  and you can write on only one side of each sheet. Once you accept that,it is OK. It seems that virgin cellulose is seldom used nowadays, and it will be hard for you to find a non-recycled diary.
If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.

I use the notebook to write down tasks, quick notes for reports, and because each page is easily detachable, I can write quick messages and pass it off to co-workers. The work environment doesn't involve any computers and using a phone to check on messages isn't convenient where as a note can be quickly put somewhere in sight.

6571	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Just got this, and so far, it looks to be a quite useful little planner. I learned a long time ago to keep a planner AND a regular spiral notebook. Planner is for appts. and upcoming stuff, spiral notebook is more of a diary type thing. Use the spiral notebook for notes when you talk to someone on the phone, attend a meeting, etc. since there are no pre-ordained dates - you just write the date at the top of the page. But I digress - Back to this little planner. I like that it has sturdy covers, and nice smooth paper that should feel good when writing on it. It has an  elastic loop to hold the thing closed - I would used a post-it arrow to mark the current week for easy finding. Also has a pen loop. I like the bright orange - it should show up easily on a desk, in the car, or at a meeting. It is 6x8 inches, which is a good size - not too small, but not bulky like Day Runners and such. It is probably NOT for people who keep all their info in a day planner, but otherwise, I like it.

You have to remove the cap, twist it, press the end to push out some lead, turn it back, replace the cap and then twist the cap EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE LEAD.

  * Monthly Duty Cycle
I prefer this calculator to the other option given in the CFA program - the HP12C.  The main reason for this preference is that I'm not a weird loser that likes RPN (or whatever it is called) number entry.  I don't apologize for offending weird losers who might be reading this because it is truly bizarre to add by typing: 60 (enter) 9 (enter) Plus (enter) Equals (enter).  Who does that crap?  I'll get my 69 the old fashioned way.
As good as you can buy today, and a really fair price from Amazon.  Can't lose.
I'm really happy with this wrist/mouse pad.  I spend a lot of time on the computers at home and at work.  I had a frozen right shoulder from not having good wrist support and from working with the mouse in the wrong position.  I was in screaming pain about about a year.  This mousepad helped by providing good wrist support which lowered the stress on my shoulder.  I wore out the first Belkin gel pad, and am now on my second.

It is a mess, one nonsense that cheated me
To date (December 2007), the bearer of this "gold" standard is none other than the HP12C HP's "golden boy" in its calculator business segment. The HP12C now a matured product, is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since '81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever. According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs, cPs was sold since ,it is probably the best selling HP (and RPN) calculator ever.

A quick tip is to use a cardboard box layered with paper or card-stock when spraying. This prevents the spray from getting on other objects or furniture and also gives a two for one as you get some interesting looking paper in addition to the item you are spraying. Another tip is that the large drops normally emerge within the first three sprays so if you are trying to avoid a splotchy look use the spray on paper first before spraying your object.

I like making vegan soups for dinner, and this size is just perfect for one or two people.  I had a Splendid brand cooker for many years but once the lock started to leak it was just a mess. I also could never cook dried beans in it, they never got soft enough and I defaulted to my crock pot to cook dried beans, but then I had to plan ahead. You can definitely tell the difference in brands this is really top of the line.  Looking at the mechanism there is really no way this can leak.  I will let you know how much I love it!

But I also wanted something that DIDN'T look like it belongs in a 5th-grade social studies classroom. This map is perfect for that.

This calendar is perfect for what I need and want.  BTW, it arrived noticeably wrinkled - Amazon needs to provide more shipping protection.
I no longer "set the mood" before listening to music, but that hasn't in any way lessened my enjoyment of what I still think may be the greatest album of its time.
Comparing the price of the  basic 12 pack of Derwent Colorsoft pencils here on Amazon to this set, it is apparent that the coloring book is a bit pricey.  Plus, this is a set of 10 pencils, without a nice solid tin box, so the coloring book becomes even pricier, doesn't it?

How many times have you wanted to say that to people you know - or people you don't know. To avoid arguments or fights - do it anonymously. If someone pisses you off that work - fill out a WTF sheet and out it on their desk.
These do about 85% of everything I do on a regular basis just perfectly.  Their exponential entry is straight-forward and the display will show plenty of digits.  These come with a hard plastic cover that slips on the backside and seems to protect it just fine.  I have 5 of these and leave one everywhere I'm likely to need one.
This is also a chemistry lab notebook and will have a periodic table (very helpful). I had one for biology before, so look for one of those if you're using this for biology. Only con is that there is a pocket in the front page that can't fit regular-sized copy paper. I had to fold papers in half if I wanted to put anything there. Not a big deal though.

859	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is, in my opinion, the most historically important album ever released.  This album revolutionized the rock and roll industry; often imitated but never duplicated, it continues to exert a significant influence on the very business of singing and recording music.  Even the timing of the album was perfect; the year was 1967, the Summer of Love, and this album captured the spirit of the times in such an amazing fashion that other recording artists immediately recognized the profound significance of what the Beatles had just succeeded in doing.  I remember seeing an interview with David Crosby, who basically said that Sgt. Pepper accomplished what he and so many other artists of that war-torn generation had been trying to achieve themselves - musically, artistically, and culturally.

As always however, you should try out any knife before you buy it to make sure that the weight, handle shape, feel etc. is appealing to you.  Make sure you spend time in the motion you would use for cutting so that you can be sure the motion is comfortable.  If you cant find the all steel knife to try, the handle is identical to the shun classic line, although the knife feels (to me) a little bit heavier.
I guess if you are using crayons it would work good,  but no painmmt or markers.

I have no idea why people are downgrading it for the religious aspect.  The listing is quite clear about it - seems as if they merely are seeking out a way to be offended.  I cannot see any reason why this wouldn't be suited to carry in a workplace. There's a brief message inside the front cover - which would hardly ever be seen, and shouldn't offend anyone if they did see it.  (Its not as if folks don't wear crucifixes and saints medals on a regular basis.)

8400	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	My son is only a freshman so doesn't need many of the capabilities of this calculator yet.

8361	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I'm a senior engineering student and use a calculator every day.  My peers have every calculator you could imagine, and it seems like like I've played with them all.  I've been using the TI89 for the past 6 years now.  I need a non programmable calc for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam....and unfortunately bought this guy for $15.  Like others have mentioned, this calc does not register every button entry when typing at normal speeds.  For $3-$5 more you can purchase the TI36X Pro which will register your clicks AND features 4 lines of text instead of 2. Not sure why this thing exists.  The weight, build quality and look of the 36X far exceeds that of the 30X.  SO if you are purchasing this for one of those tests that will make or break your career do not hesitate to spend those three extra Washingtons.


Evernote's handwriting OCR is fair to middling, and the important fact here is that it is no better with this expensive little notebook than it is with a $2.50 Clairfontaine pocket notebook of the same size with equally good paper.  Evernote should modify its software to recognize the little Tag stickers wherever they are applied, and just sell them by themselves.  I would not buy another of these pocket notebooks.
1588	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Oscillating tools are a specialty tools. I like the Porter Cable quick blade change method, it's simple, quick and holds the blades without slipping. The variable speed makes using it more versatile, and the cordless design makes for ease of use when a power outlet is not close by. There is a rubber covering on the housing that provides a slip-free grip, and a LED light for illuminating the work area.  I have used this tool to cut heavy plastic, which worked well.  Using a slower speed, it can cut plastic without melting the cut line. This is a nice tool for some applications.

6751	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Poorly designed and all togeather impractical, basically a waste of $20. The days of the week are so narrow that you can't even write a single word. It has the days plotted out by hour, which is impractical when you need to jot down a list of things that need to be accomplished. As a student Saturday and sunday are extreamly usefull days of the week, but the planner just gives them tiny sections. I threw mine away after I bought a $5 one from my college bookstore, hopefully it can be recycled and provide some use as paper towels.

5122	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've bought many folios of the A3 and A4 blank variety. I've used those for drawing in pencil. This is my first time buying lined A4s for writing. The first thing I noticed is that the paper is more orange/pink than the ivory colored blank books from a while back. I'm thinking this has to do with a change in manufacturing. I was initially annoyed at the change, I like consistency, but once I started using them, I forgot all about it. Change happens. I buy a lot of regular (non-folio) Moleskines, even though I also have a fondness for Rhodia webnotebooks, and these ruled folios now have a place in my heart. I'll continue to buy more. I think of the folios as thicker paper versions of the regular Moleskines.and I hope they keep making them. The paper's less translucent and there's less show-through of the ink but the lines have the same narrow-light gray rules as the non-folios, which I like very much. These are going to take me a while to fill up. :)
All moleskines have the handy pocket in the back for storing the few little bits you pick up here and there. The elastic band keeps it together in your bag.  I personally love the square pages (gridded).  The squares seem to fade to the back but the rows and columns are always there in case you need them.  This is also my favorite size.  I've used the smaller ones but this one seems to work best for me.  Lots of space for ideas, notes, calendar, EVERYTHING!!!

9435	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	My Walmart shredder finally died after several years of service.  Since I had a gift card for Office Max I purchased the PC60C-2.  After getting it situated on the basket properly, it whirred away.  I put a single piece of paper in - it ran for about a third of the page.  Had to turn it off and on again - about 4 times to get the single sheet of paper all the way through.  Resituated the cutter on the basket and tried it again.  Same thing - only works through a portion of the sheet.  The shredder is now packed back in the box and is being returned to Office Max this evening.  Maybe I'll go to Walmart and buy another of their cheap ones - spending $90 certainly made no difference.

7450	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good, basic calculator.  This is the perfect basic, school calculator.  The keys aren't too small or too big and register the number when pressed.  My favorite feature of this calculator ... the COMMAS are on the BOTTOM of the number, where they belong.
4372	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Makes it easy to find passages in Bible. In time the pages tear (due to thin Bible pages). I had to reinforce torn ones with tape.
5432	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Classy looking book to take notes about life, draw little sketches or to carry around so you feel like Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's a well constructed notebook that makes you feel rich owning it. Not worth the price if it is not things you want to preserve, but overall a great notebook.
6204	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this book. It works great for me, and takes lots of water well. Great for travel.

9433	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Motor burned out in less than a month and stopped working.  This thing is also pretty slow; my $30 shredder shreds at twice the speed.  This huge ugly shredder can barely handle an envelope with junk mail in it; I have to actually open the junk mails and shred things separately or it will jam.  I got really ripped off by Fellowes on this one.
And it held together nicely for the year (or better) of carrying it. I had previously never opted for the soft covers because I figured it would be too flimsy and not hold up. But it held up just fine, and it convinced me to opt for soft covers every time I've bought anything by Moleskine since.
5891	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have had the small, soft cover notebook for quite awhile now. I love it for jotting down quick notes on anything that catches my fancy. Mine is pretty beat up looking now, but the only actual fault that I have identified is that the back cover pocket has split open, so nothing can be held in there.
Beyond that, there are a few other notes:
8101	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This item was exactly as described and arrived on time. What else can I say?

Thanks for making these! I wish they had them when I was in school but am loving them now.

2151	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very good and useful.
1644	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love these as bookmarks. Holds the page without damaging it. Pretty, too. Does the job nicely and the price is right.
2036	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	excellent


494	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	great
9810	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought my first one maybe 15 years ago and have used it and subsequent identical staplers to install fiberglass bat insulation, put up ceiling tiles, route network and speaker cable, hang pictures, and who knows what else. These staplers are cheap and bulletproof. Now I have another one, and I can't imagine spending more on something else.
8248	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is a great size for a holiday letter card where you can print a photo on the cover and your letter on the inside, works easier if your printer does doublesided automatically.

7283	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	We have used this toner for years and never had a problem. don't know why this particular one left wide smear stripes all over the printed paper.
4275	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very good quality, purchased this one as gift after using same basic one for myself. The only difference was what was on the cover.
* Handy, stretchy built in book mark
The Pros:
6880	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Excellent.
3052	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Give the one-star reviewer the benefit of the doubt and say maybe Amazon's site was having an off day, but the image and description match perfectly. I'm a HUGE Knock Knock fan (I love their stuff) and I've used the Pro/Con pad for fun and decision making!
8677	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	great
1518	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my husband and he loves it.  Every car should have one of these. You never know when you might need it.  And for the price, it's really a must.
I am not a Musician, but an avid music collector.  I was thinking this might be something for me to organize so much.  But, not so much.  I have almost 2000 cds, over 30,000 songs on my ipod, I collect 78s and vinyl, and basically none of this is for any of this.  I can list concerts I have been to and note the set list.  But not sure why or how I would do that.  So I see this as a feature if I was the performer and could record dates and sets and maybe note audience reactions etc.  There are stickers galore for tabs, but none of which are relevant to something that would not be on your computer.  Actually all of this would be on your computer.  There are even tab stickers for favorite YouTube channels, Facebook profiles, etc.  I don't get it.  I mean, I applaud anything that tries to keep pen and paper alive, but there is hardly any point to any of this.
I use refills all the time, but the quality is not the same as new.  I have my cartridges refilled locally, and when they wear out (and they do wear out) I tell the refiller to keep them, and I buy new replacements (and refill those till they wear out).
7390	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great little calculators.  We have several and keep them around for times when my old brain doesn't want to do math anymore.
I've used this for:

-David Allen
939	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Awesome purchase, but the size is overwelming and definately not cheap if you plan on framing it. The color and print on it is great and legible.
- Hard covers. I don't have to write while standing up that much, but whenever I need to the covers make a huge difference.
Not much tooth on these. The paper is relatively thin, but strong. I only sketch in pencil so I can't speak to the bleed-though on these for ink pens and markers.
8331	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These were just what we needed for our classes
4430	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Slow coming, but love the calendar.
6984	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I like the weight of this pen in my hand but I thought that the feel would be sleeker than it does. The laser cut banding on the grip can be a bit rough & cutting to my fingers.

400	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	looks great, good price
2811	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am 81 years old and I have always liked the "F word" because
2681	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	coworkers loved the surprise notes

9742	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Ive had one of these binders for over 15 years of everyday use. scars, scratches, little dings, you name it. - until the day i left it on my van bumper and drove off. - i found it about 2 miles from my house with apparent damage from cars running over it. don't get me wrong i flattened a good portion of it and destroyed the binder completely. but ill tell you this - it saved my IPAD that was inside in its case... enough said.... on to buy another one.
6996	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This pen is awesome, I got two of them. The ink goes smoothly and I have no complaints so far. You must be careful with the pen because it can obtain scratches with floor's contact
But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.
4813	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Moleskine always makes high quality notebooks for me to use and enjoy.  This one is no exception.

6230	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this size! Quality of paper is watercolor 140 lb.  Great for travel.
3098	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Use this daily!
463	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Using this map for my travel map photo project. I am putting pictures of each state I have visited and hope to eventually have this map filled up. I ordered this map specifically because of the sizes of each state. I recently went to Hawaii, and noticed on many maps that you can BARELY see Hawaii, let alone to be able to see a picture of us visiting. I found this map had Hawaii pretty visible and decided to try it. I have to admit when I received the map, it was VERY BIG! Much bigger than I thought it would be. I contemplated returning this but realized if I got any smaller of a map the smaller states would be impossible to see. Texas is at least an 8x10 photo, while Connecticut is 1 inch by maybe 2 at the most. At least with that size I am able to put my picture from Connecticut on this map. Any smaller would have not allowed me to make my craft. This map is laminated and comes rolled up not folded. Great colors and able to see ALL states. Would recommend buying. Great for the price!
The CD comes with extensive liner notes--a huge plus! You get all the lyrics to the songs as well as photos of the band. There is a complete listing of who's who on the CD cover, and dates and recording locations of the songs. The notes include mention of the "15 kilocycle tone, put there--especially to annoy your dog," and the concluding "few seconds of...Beatle chatter." Listen for it!
4944	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A gift for a teen boy, it was so well liked that I actually received a snail mail thank you.

2021	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This was exactly what I was looking for to mark pages in my journaling Bible.
4050	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this product -- the way it smells, the way it feels, and the way it works for me.  Unfortunately, it now seems to be discontinued, and I've had very little luck finding a replacement.  I'd really love it if they would reinstate this product line.

628	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	GIVING VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS IS NOT JUST FOR KIDS ANYMORE!!!
5108	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I truly appreciate the Moleskine journal line, especially this victory red classic notebook.
This calculator is NOT a solar calculator, but it does take a button type battery, so you might want to keep some on hand if you plan to use this calculator often.  I always keep extra batteries on hand for anything that requires a battery.
7624	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It works great for chemistry.
2298	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	very useful
3633	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love my tovolo kitchen tool! I sent these out for gifts as well! Very versatile
1731	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Be warned:This is one page printed over and over 180 times and 2 other pages. Not worth it.
Most new users find RPN confusing and refuse to learn it. That keeps existing users like me the prime customers for new HP calculator products. Unless the keypad reverts to its previous quality this will be my last purchase. Of the many 12Cs Ive owned and given away there has never been a failure. My oldest 12C was actually made in the USA! My old HPs will probably last another 20 years; long enough to get me to the grave.
4509	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Cute, small and takes up less space than most. I like that it has 30 pockets as my class size has been over 25 for years!
3568	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	not like the originals but still like them
What is different about these notebooks compared to a standard large hardback Moleskine ruled notebook?
2215	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a Reddit gift exchange.  Very cute.  Good quality and just what the recipient wanted!  Recommended as a good gift.
6214	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My journal of choice.
5091	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've used the large planner for a few years now, and I loved it. I really like the hardcover, the pages are just the right thickness (thick enough to prevent ink from bleeding through, but thin enough to remain compact), and the elastic closure band and ribbon are nice touches. I use a large metal clip to section off the old pages (easier/faster than the ribbon), and I use the ribbon to find important notes in the back of the planner (you never actually use the notes pages for the last six months of the planner for planning, so I use those pages as a notebook).

161	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
7260	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This printer paper works great in my HP printer and my Brother printer! I ordered this one day and the next day it was here! I was amazed at how fast it got here!
8461	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great calculator. Easy to use. Lots of useful functions. The two lines are a nice addition if you are used to the single line screen.
1451	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love the nostalgic look of this.  Very sturdy and well made.

2613	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These lists are great and easy to use.  They have everything you always forget to buy at the store.  There is space to add your unique items, too.  I hope these will always be available.  I'm sure I'll be buying again.
5460	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love, love, love Moleskine and the purple is so pretty!
2720	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cute - maybe a bit pricey for what you get.
8472	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Very comprehensive for advanced mathematics calculations, but the instructions for use could be much much more clear for a beginner user.
7960	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Gettin me through classes
3177	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Omg - this is a game changer. Before this amazing product, my bulletin board borders were shoved in a bag in my closet and were taking up way more space than needed. Now everything is neat and tidy and wonderful. Highly recommended!
3794	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have been ordering Cavallini Paper Desk Calendar for years.  Excellent product, the stock paper is thick and sturdy (no folding over or bending), the prints are vibrant and colorful.  They look perfect on my desk and always attract favorable comments.  And its easy to immediately secure the date and day just with a glance.  Exactly as described. Fast Shipping.
5449	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's a Moleskine 'nuff said.  The name carries the brand and all that you would expect is here.  Fits perfectly in a cargo pocket, has a nifty pocket inside the back that is the size of whole cover.  If you know the brand you'll want this.
6522	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Have used this for years
2010	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love these. Great for Bible Study. Will probably get more.


3810	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	hard to find a craftsman tape measurer.  nearly impossible really. they don't even have these through the sears near me.
A must buy for anyone who needs a good pocket sized note/sketch book. I also suggest that you get the "Moleskine Sketchbook Large" as a companion.

1880	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These sturdy stars make cute decorations. The colors are pretty and the gold has some shine. They do not sparkle. They have no glitter but re pretty  nonetheless. These are not adhesive; you must tack, tape or hang them yourself. They are nicely mde with a good mix of sizes.
3341	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a terrific book! My plan is to use this for 1st grade (and you certainly can) but it really is a K-2 level book. Not only is it educational, but its content is fun for the kids.. I'd definitely recommend it!
6232	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect size for my purse!
It's slow!
I had a problem with the original head having a lockdown screw problem for the cutter head.  I contacted the company and they corrected the problem by sending me a new unit......OVERNIGHT!  Their customer service was far beyond what I expected, and I would recommend them to anyone in this business.
First off, 60 pages actually mean 30 double-sided pages. I know, this is pretty crappy advertising. Just know that going in to this pocket sketchboook that if you want 60 pages, you'll be watercoloring on both sides of the page. I had planned on doing this anyway, so it did not deter my purchase. The paper IS impressive. It absolutely can handle a watercolor painting on each side. I've included an example of the first two watercolor sketches I did. They are on opposite sides of the same page and were heavily layered.
8298	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bought it refurished with some wear and tear , but overall it seems to work fne.


6685	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A bit tricky to install if your close vision is not good, but once installed, very attractive and helpful.
7047	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	On time and as expected.
  True, the larger LS-85H calculator has an enclosed, "wrap-around" display, (enclosing the entire top part, all together), rather than the "picture-frame" display, (in which the numberic display is indented, and "framed" by the rest of the top of the calculator) of the smaller calculator.  (And I, personally, find the "picture-frame" display far more attractive).  But the larger LS-85H calculator stays on for approximately 3 minutes before turning itself off...approximately a full minute more than the smaller machine, and this may mean more to many users.
When I got back home, I sorted out the ephemera of my trip and created a travel scrapbook with the remaining pages of the book.
2106	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cute bookmark. I would purchase it again.
4128	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	good deal
- They have still retained their mirror finish on the exterior.
1975	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	There is plenty of space to write my plans in this book, and I like the tips offered. I am very satisfied.
5816	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We have many of these fine booklets.  I use them for errata in my art studio, my wife devotes one to each type of tree she bonsais.
8586	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good price (as always).  My wife uses this for her Statistics class, and has no trouble at all.  The buttons are all easy to read and the layout is pretty straight forward.
4289	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am thrilled with this journal. It comes encased in a clear plastic book cover to keep the outside clean. The pages are gold edged. The pages themselves are a parchment color with lines for writing. It has a place for the date of your entry on each page & has a different Scripture on each page. I liked it so much I bought one for my best friend. Beautiful buy for a gift or for ones self.
5864	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love the ruled and unruled versions of this notebook! Love the size as its only smaller than a standard everyday notebook, but this is small enough to slip into a bag. No elastic to help keep notebook closed (which would be nice) but the notebook is soft back and has a great folder in the back,so I'm very happy with it. As always shipping was fast, packaged nicely, and Amazon has the best prices for moleskin notebooks and accessories!!

4417	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are very handy for quick reference and look great. My only complaint is really my own fault, I didn't fully read the directions first.
7299	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Just received this today and it is no different from the 20 lb when you put them side by side.  Also, it is bright, but not thick so if you want higher quality paper that doesn't bleed, purchase a heavier ream...at least 30 lbs.
5665	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Dots are too pale. Wish I'd gotten the quadrille or ruled. Good quality tho.n
752	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great product
For the price -- and remember it's not a $2,000 commercial unit -- this is a great choice for the SOHO.
4. Not wirebound. The amount of opening and closing that I am doing so far might indicate that the binding might soon tear.

6840	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Great pen.  I hate the cap.  I much prefer my Cross Edge Capless Gel Ink Pen.  Even though it's not skinny like this one, it is well worth buying.
my kids keep "borrowing" it.
If you make the same mistake I did and you have daughters like my daughters, you may find yourself being handed or shown a SERIOUSLY?" note as an apparent method of communication.
4111	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Smaller than expected.
The product description on this page [at the time of this review] claims that this dish is seven inches long. It's closer to ten inches, but regardless, it has ample capacity when setting out antipasti, and as a personal snack dish it's perfect. One piece of advice, the smaller area for olive pits is perfect for artichoke hearts or pickled peppers if you are setting out a spread for guests. As a personal snack dish the area for the pits is the right size.
1359	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	3rd grade daughter LOVED these!
In summary, if you like printing your own cards and have an inkjet printer, then this Avery product is a good option.
4219	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This was a very nice journal. It had a real quality feel to it. The lines are spaced just right to give you the feeling of room while you are writing and you don't feel cramped at all. It also makes it easier to read later. I gave this as a gift to a friend who was dealing with cancer. The uplifting message was perfect and I would definitely recommend this to all.
2995	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Just as described. It's been fun to put in my books.
If you're a fan, you won't mind the choice of photos for each month.  And for the current price, you're getting a great deal.

3912	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are okay loaf pans. But they just felt a little bit flimsy, and I like sturdy bake ware that will last forever. So, I exchanged them for the Chicago Metallic Loaf Pans.
Only issue: kinda hard to open them when they are closed on themselves -- a fingernail is usually needed.
~
9070	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I gave it only 4 stars because I wish it came in other colors than grey and black. Other than that its a good supportive, mouse pad. Not rocket science to create one of these, but very few of them work well. This one does. I'm just sick of the colors.
LS-82z -- "want to be when it grows up"?  Right!  THIS calculator -- the Canon LS 85H calculator!``The smaller calculator -- also reviewed for me by Amazon -- is an excellent little machine.  But I can see how its smaller size, (and in particular, smaller keys), would be a problem for those using it on a continual basis.  Men especially, as they tend to have larger hands than women....
Because of this alignment issue, the problems with trying to get the book to lay flat, and because most coloring medium bled through the paper, I detracted a star from my rating.  The designs are absolutely five star but the execution of the printing and the paper had problems.  I still like my coloring book and will certainly color the single page designs.
6134	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	If you're looking for a tough book to carry around to jot down thoughts and other notes, this is it.
9551	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have severe repetitive motion problems exacerbated by auto-accident injuries. This and the Belkin WaveRest Gel-Filled Cushion Wrist Pad are really helpful.

9837	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works great, should have had one long ago.
4029	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is a really neat stencil that I use with my dylusion sprays. The only thing I did not like about this is that when I opened it, the plastic in one part snapped right away. It's not very strong. This worries me because it will need to be washed and wiped down but too much pressure and it snaps. I can still use it but I might skip on buying this brand until they come out with something stronger that won't break after the first use.
  -The join of the tip to the front tube is very nearly perfect.
The rest of the pen is very nice.  The polished metal parts are flawless.  The cap slides on just strong enough to be secure, but not so tightly that it is hard to open.  Unlike the plastic decoration on the cap, the plastic grip area fits perfectly.  The weight is just right, heavy enough to feel like a good pen but not so heavy that it is annoying to have in a shirt pocket.  The size is also just right.  The barrel is wider than those skinny Classic Century models, but not as ridiculously fat as so many fancy pens which are just too big.
2407	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works great
5792	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as described packaged securely I will definitely be back for more!
2127	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is a really pretty old world map bookmark, with a nice maroon tassel.  (My cats LOVE that tassel!) But one star off for only having an image on one side.

2828	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use this for my bills every month and it's awesome ! Love it !
Why did it give the TI-30 II only four stars?  For the same price, there are good two-line calcs (Casio FX-115 MS for example) which include a larger library of functions (base calculations, integrals, derivates, solve function) for the same amount of money.
4082	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have seen little difference between sandpapers.  I choose this "type" of sandpaper with the dark red binder regardless of brand because it tends to last longer.

2647	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a good reminder for those easy to postpone household jobs.
164	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Granddaughter loves this book and anything Peppa!
9084	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Sorry to say it started to flatten out within two weeks. The user no longer uses it and found no relief for their wrist.
For me, Moleskine's best feature is the soft, ink-friendly, cream-tinted blank paper. Hate the restrictiveness of lined paper? Moleskine has a blank paper option? Love to write in ink? Moleskine paper holds ink without smearing or bleeding. Hate the brightness of white paper? Moleskine brings back the elegant cream tint of papers from an earlier era.


7314	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say.  Its my paper of choice.  The 24 lb weight has been my only purchases for quite a few years now.  I always purchase when on sale, and never at the Office Depot because of their cost is higher.
Specifically, the book provides instruction and practice in drawing conclusions & making inferences;  defining vocabulary using context;  identifying story parts;  identifying the main idea and supporting details;  identifying the theme;  identifying cause and effect;  and making predictions.

I decided to buy a quality little piece that felt good in my hand and made me proud to pull it out of my bag at work or out with friends. This red little number is that, for sure.

It takes a little while to get used to cooking with good stainless steel pans after using nonstick cookware for a long time. You need to get the pan good and hot, then add oil, then cook (Google technique for cooking in stainless cookware for more info) to avoid food sticking, but they're pretty easy to clean, heat very evenly, and look great hanging in our kitchen. I expect they'll last many, many years.

7231	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I recommend this 24lb paper because you have almost no paper jams. I've only had one in 20 years since using this weight paper across three printers. I do frequent mailings and print off shipping labels. This saves headaches since it's a matter of keeping things rolling and timeliness. I used to order from HP but with one click just easier with AMAZON. Also like the feel of the thickness and bright white is great for appearance and readability.

Well, wanting to get the lined journal again for next year, I stumbled upon this Sketchbook. In fact, I bought both of them so that I could see what is so great about this one. I must say, I am incredibly impressed with it. The cover is solid and the thick yellowish paper is incredible to write on. I use it for my random thoughts -- titling them with color pencil and writing with ink -- I love the freedom to write however small or large, draw whenever I want to, box important thoughts and color freely. I love it that the paper is thick and w/o lines. I am thinking of getting another one for my trip to the Far East next year and wrap the lined one for a Christmas gift.

5870	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love, love, love these watercolor journals. The paper is great, while not super-thick, they absorb a ton of liquid and take quite a beating (they do buckle a little, but not enough to distort the image or prevent the book from shutting) but the paints are SUPER VIVID when dry. The size is perfect- big enough to do something detailed, but not so big you can't throw the book into your bag or painting kit and be on your way.

I don't know why these type of ACs only last 1 to 4 years? I live in the NORTHEAST, up till THIS year we rarely had temps over 90, until now- with all the global warming & solar flar activity! They only get used 3 to 4 months MAX per year! and I shut them off at night 90% of the time! So, they aren't even running round the clock! So, even the one that lasted 4 years ACTUALLY only lasted one measly year- if you add up the actual time it was used!!!
6379	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love the color combo and the fact that each highlighter has two ends - a sharp point and a chisel point.  Like the fact that they aren't supposed to bleed through on my Bible's ultra thin pages.  Case is very handy, too.

I like to keep one with me everyday in my back pocked.  While this has the durability to make the long haul, it is a little smaller than what I am used to and I often find myself wishing for a little more page space.  Next time I will get the next size up.
9792	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This stapler is built out of steel, and is comfortable to use. It also has a two year limited warranty on it. The description states that it's jam resistant, and I would have to agree that it jams less than my previous stapler. It's meant for flooring, screening, and general use. I've used it for light projects, and had no issues. It's pretty light and easy to carry around, but most importantly, it does its job.

4493	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great product. Holds a lot
The paper quality is good, and although I can see that I have written on the other side of the page, the ball-point ink, from a variety of different pens, doesn't bleed through enough to be a problem. The lines printed on the page are dark enough to be seen but not obtrusive. Some of my journals, in comparison, have ruled lines so light I often wander off the lines when writing. I like to be able to see the lines!

4841	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love Moleskine scetchbooks, and this one is perfect as a journal of Zentangle patterns. I also love the red cover.
--A data-retention system that doesn't work. In theory, unplugging the machine from the wall (or experiencing a power failure) should not affect the system programming or received messages, as they should be retained in Flash ROM. Unplugging the power connector from the machine itself is designed to reset the machine--a desirable feature in the event that ownership is transferred to another person. In practice, forget retaining your messages when the transformer is unplugged, because the machine certainly will.
1312	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I was expecting a pen that would write better and more consistently, but unfortunately they write muddy lines that tend to skip or stop writing altogether. The colors are also more faint than I expected. They are made cheap and leave ink all over the tip of the pen. For the price, I wouldn't recommend them. They seem more like a novelty that would be at a dollar store.
8730	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Plain, simple, and just exactly what I was looking for. I appreciate the one-piece design, the shape, and the comfort of the gel wrist pad. I use it on the arm of my recliner, and it's just the right size.

Cannot fill in with crayon, do a dot etc. Have to use something with a finer point to outline. The result is still not appealing.
Good to hear this in its entirity again, and prefer to own the CD over just a digital download to an MP3 player.  This allows me to put it on my MP3/iTunes and still play the CD in the home or car stereo.  Just my preference.

Great product.

I have noticed in the homeschool communities out there that people pass on Spectrum because they align with common core.  I get it, but my advice is to pass on the math if that is the case.  Don't exclude the entire series.  We have the whole group of books, the only one that hasn't impressed me is the Geography book.  I love it, it's very affordable which is a huge plus in our household!

8935	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It does what it should well
5796	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love these journals.  I've wasted so much money on different notebooks and paper, etc trying to nail down a note system perfect for me.  Since discovering Moleskine I've completely changed the way I compose and organize my notes for classes; the large size is the perfect size for transferring info from large index cards.  The major upside is that I no longer have to carry around a bunch of loose and thick 5X8 cards which saves space and weight in my backpack.  I use one cahier journal per chapter in chemistry, one journal per chapter in math, and keep classic Moleskine notebooks for overall important course notes.  All unruled paper, but I would buy the dot-grids if they made cahier journals with them.  I've never been more organized and less bogged down by a meticulously complex system.  They're perfect because I like to keep my most important notes on things around 5X8 size rather than standard letter-sized paper.  The only thing I struggle with is my love of Levenger circa system; I still use their notebooks for problem solving, there is nothing better for the job.  So I keep both Moleskine and Levenger; combined, they're pretty pricey but more than worth it.
For household projects, highly recommended.

6669	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are a bit thin, but it makes finding your holy book much quicker,  especially as your finger get less nimble with age. I had written my own written out on 3M sticky tabs, but after a while, they fall off. These are tape based, and so the tape goes on either side of a single page. There is a tab staggering guide so that the tabs are well aligned to make the book look neat and professional with the tabs being cascaded so all titles are able to be vued easily. I recommend these for anyone who likes to flip right to a page during Bible groups or during services.

7045	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The black molded plastic stylus that came with my Palm IIIxe was lightweight, functional ... and scratched my screen rather quickly, thanks to some excess flashing near the tip. These metal styli don't exhibit that problem. The extra weight also "feels better" in a way I can't describe otherwise. (It's not THAT much heavier, but it does feel more comfortable in your hand.) The best feature, though, is that unscrewing the top gets you to a built-in reset tool. Unfortunately, especially with third-party software, you WILL need to reset your Palm on occasion, and having a handy reset tool saves on batteries.

3733	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for travel because of smaller bottle. This particular hair spray is not as sticky as some others.
Again, I know this sounds crazy, but I have two witnesses. All this to say, buyer beware from this seller! (FYI: the calculator itself seems to be working fine and I would return it, but I needed it ASAP, so I will end up just tossing the rest of the packaging).
Slightly thicker pages

I was doubtful that a new cartridge would really solve my problem, but I took a chance.  I'm glad I did, because the new cartridge works great.  I had to vacuum and wipe out all the leaked powder, but my 6MP is now working as well as the day I first bought it.
But the absolute top feature is that this calculator was precisely engineered to give excellent tactile feedback when you enter data or functions. The keys have a firm resistance that gives just the right amount of signal so that you *k*n*o*w* you have entered the data. If you've ever used a calculator, you know that the worst thing is to miss a keystroke by pressing too lightly or not firmly enough. This error is nearly impossible with the HP 12C.
5093	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	good quality, a little hard to use the large size.

9958	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	These clear labels don't print well. The printing is uneven at best resulting in a bad looking label
7905	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The TI-36x is an absolute masterpiece for engineering and scientific work.  Long, nasty math is easy to enter quickly, is easy to edit when necessary, and is easy to make sense of in the heat of battle.  The usability of this calculator is as high as it gets.  The provided constants and variables are perfect.

6618	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Last year I used the larger version of this planner and really became attached to the layout.  This year I opted for the smaller version and I am equally happy with it, actually preferring the spiral binding over the book binding of the larger planner.  At work, we follow the Franklin Covey 4DX goal process, and this planner falls perfectly in-line with that with a section for goals, delegated tasks, and of course the never-ending To-Do list.  I would buy again.
8456	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to use on some exams where programable calculators aren't allowed. While this is no ti-89, this will pretty much do everything a ti-83 /84 does without graphing. Has a ton of very useful built in converters and solvers. I find myself using this in my Dynamics and Mechanics classes more than my graphing calculator because of how easy it is to use. Got two of my friends to get 'em too, and they both love them.

5304	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Where was Moleskine in my youth? I've been keeping diaries since I was a teenager, in all forms of blank bound books, notebooks, and online systems. Moleskine, though, is the first I've used that combines style, practicality, and flexibility in an affordable package.
5466	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Not sure how they make this paper but I love it. I use mokeskine notebooks for everything. I prefer quality ball point pens but I also use felt tip and gel pens on this and they write smoothly and unless it's a sharpie, don't really lead through. I have to be a bit careful using felt tip pens-holding them in one spot will allow some bleeding but it doesn't happen often. I use this for a cleaning bullet journal and I prefer the dotted paper. It allows you to create your own format with check lists or billets or titles or columns and using the dots it keeps your lines straight and precise. If you are OCD about paper- this might be for you.  These are like lays potato chips though... you won't just want one.

6927	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I like the feel, the weight, the balance and the smooth writing. I would give it 5 stars, except it is not fine as advertised. It is at least medium, getting very close to broad. I have to write exceptionally big to get the letters out. Forget entering into small spaces like a checkbook registry. It's way too broad for that. I'm thinking of writing to Cross to see if they can change the nib.

6004	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I love the quality of the papers, they feel soo smooth and are fun to draw on, but the paper is really yellow, so if you're not looking for a really yellow paper, don't buy this!! Other than the color, it's really good quality and the journal in general has a very professional look on the exterior.
The physical construction of the calculators are near identical. I find that the TI-36 has more snappy keys, which I prefer, because it better informs me when I have pressed the key and is better at preventing the accidental pressing of other keys. I also like the black color significantly more. Makes it look more sleek and business minded than the color that makes the 30 look like a toy.

Since this is going to be our first child, I'm not sure how relevant these sections will all be, but they seem like things that would be fun to look back at later.  I'm disappointed that there isn't much to fill in yet--I guess I'll just record my experience with pregnancy in my regular journal.

The Cross pencil is okay.  I have some issues with the retracting of the pencil lead - the tip sticks out after retracting and I have to lightly push the tip against something solid to fully retract it before putting it back in my pocket.  I've not used a Cross pencil in years, and so cannot really compare the new unit against an older one.  The Pentel Graphic 1000 is a much better instrument, IMO, than the Cross but I wanted to try having a matching pair (pen and pencil).  So far the Cross has been, as noted, "okay".  The issue with the Pentel is one of longevity; the first one lasted a couple of years or so and the last one broke after four years.  I use the pencil more than I use the pen and if the Cross pencil breaks I think I'll replace it with a Pentel, the difference in feel and performance is that wide.

3739	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We live in an upstairs apartment, and we have a small propane grill on our porch. We also have community grills. We haven't used the one on our porch in months because we did NOT want to tackle the mess. I got this brush, and handed it to my fiance. :) All he used was this brush and a little Dawn dish soap & water. He said it got all the grease and stuck on grunge off easily. Big bonus that I noticed; it did not leave little bits of metal from the brush, like other bushes we've tried. It held up well to the scrubbing. After he finished cleaning the grill, I just hosed the brush off. Then I put it on the top rack of the dishwasher. I wouldn't let it sit wet. I think it would eventually rust if left wet, but that's to be expected. All in all, a great little grill brush!

I'm among the fountain pen crowd, and because of Moleskine's paper issues have had to look elsewhere.

Overall I enjoy the Action Day planner design so would recommend the smaller version or this one to anyone needing to get organized.

It's real wax over a plastic base. That's good. It looks more realistic and feels like wax. Because it is.

Always on is better - the flicker from the "flame" looks a lot more natural.  The brightness has several settings. About mid way looks the most natural - and is where I shot the video.

It looks sexy (the buttons on right that are silver) but doesn't function all that well if your classroom or office has diffused lighting.  Still usable just find myself having to angle it every so often to see what I need.

3556	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A favorite. I get it every year for my refrigerator - the family calendar. I like this one because the days are blank - no lines, no graphics. Plenty of room to write things.
CONS
426	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Excellent map with (as expected) very high-quality printing. I was surprised at how thin (and thus easily wrinkled) the map is, but it came rolled in a tube that protected it well.
3457	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	5 stars for sure.  Big fan of the Duck Dynasty show as well as the family.  I love this calendar and enjoy Uncle Si's take on life's experiences.

7430	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I've had 2 new HP 12C units fail on me in the last couple years. The display either shows only the error message "Pr - Error", or it fails to clear a previous result (displaying "7.00", for example, no matter how often you try to clear the display). I've been familiar with how to use this model since learning it in the 1990s, but the quality of manufacture has declined. These are junk now and I won't be sending any more money to HP. They ruined a respected brand. What a shame.

7851	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bought it used. I've used it two years now and it very durable.  Not the easiest to use, but I know it's accepted by all my professors. So if I can't use the CAS this gets it done.

This notes are retro, fun, and beautiful--plus they are high-quality notes that compete with the best commercial brands out there in stickiness! I would call these the perfect gift for anyone who is a writer, an organizer, a reader, a journaller, or someone who just plain likes sticky notes. They are that nice. They come in a gorgeous tin with a clear face that will not only be a nice gift presentation but will keep the sticky notes from becoming dog-eared. There are five different notes and they are all easily available when you open the case. I love luxury office supplies (especially affordable ones) and I am very impressed with these. I hope they keep making these for a very long time!

My last one was in the machine for nearly 34 months and never gave me a problem.

After digging online and researching brannds, I came to Amazon and they had many options to choose from. So glad I found this one. It is made well, doesn't feel plastic and cheap. It works well and does the necessary functions without being overly complicated.  So glad I kept looking and researching till I came across this one and made the purchase. It came in the mail within a couple of days. Love it!!!
From a usefulness standpoint, it shows reports to the professor (how students' answered, what needs to be reviewed, etc.), and it's a great way to take attendance.  Very easy to use.
The photography is glorious. The paper stock used, is of high-quality, and each calendar page itself is very cute, and very quaint, this is not a grand calendar, in the Downton tradition, this imparts more of a cozy feeling, and it would definitely have been displayed downstairs, and not upstairs at Downton itself.

6085	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This moleskine goes with me everywhere everyday. I like the thicker paper in the sketchbok because it cuts down on ink bleeding through to the reverse. Design holds up to everyday use.

Some have complained about the top binding. I actually prefer this as I'm not trying to paint in the edges nor do I have difficulties positioning my hand for brush strokes. I find the top binding is easier to hold open while working.

5059	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love it! Perfect for journalling and quick note taking or just about anything you can think of where you would need to jot, write, sketch, etc. something down. Getting it in Red was great, it stands out and reminds me to gravitate towards it.
6504	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have just started using this planner, and I'm not quite used to it but I am getting there.

Any finance professional over 30 will know how to use this, and in a pinch, you might need to know how to use it. I know the TI-8x series has financial functions and the graphic capabilities may make those calculators worthwhile. But for most financial pros, if it can't be done on an HP12C, then you probably need a computer.

Ok maybe I exaggerated but the point is you can really tell the difference. Regular copy paper is flimsy and practically transparent. This paper is top notch my peeps. It's brighter and thicker. It makes your work stand out. I print full color detailed maps on it with an inkjet printer and it looks spectacular! I don't mind paying a few dollars more. This paper makes your work look and feel better. Other than spending a fortune on photo paper for my maps, this paper is the way to go.

4767	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These really small notebooks have pages that can be removed without tearing up other pages.  Very useful for a pocket.
The other note on this product is that the battery never wears out.  I don't care how much the CFA program scares you into thinking you need to bring a screw driver and replacement battery (or in my case two calculators) to the exam, the battery will not run out.  I used the same calculator for work every day and to study for all 3 levels and still have not needed to change that battery (5+ years of use at this point).  Take that guarantee to the bank.

This book presents reading comprehension as a game - my son becomes a "Reading Detective", looking for the specific clues in the readings that will provide the answer to higher level questions.  Kids are required to specify the sentences that provide the clues in addition to providing the answer.  I like how this gets my son engaged in meta-cognition, as he tries to  figure out how he knows what he knows.
6222	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite notebook for bullet journaling. It fits well in my purse, the cover is sturdy, the paper is a nice weight and holds up to the paper clips I like to use to mark certain pages. I've tried cheaper notebooks and they just don't hold up as well.
4681	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	but on the path. This very large (33" or 85cm when opened) and substantial at 2lb 14oz / 1.3 kgm (not the 1lb shipping weights Amazon claims) book is not for every use. Do you have a 1 foot by 3 foot flat clear space on your desk? I haven't seen that much open space on a desk since Mrs. Roberts would use a ruler across the palm of any miscreant who dared violate her tidiness ordinances.  I'm sorry! Mercy! Please mercy! Whack. Whack. Whack. Ahh, the pleasures of grade school. So, lacking Mrs. Roberts to give order to my life, I use this book with one end in my lap and the other propped against a desk or table.
This pan holds 2 1/2 quarts of food, measures 7 3/4 x 11 1/4 x 2 inches internally, and weighs 6 pounds 10 ounces. 2 1/2 quarts will typically feed 4 - 6 people when it comes to casseroles, consider the larger roaster to feed more. Except for roasts, the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the pan's evenly dispersed heat.

4685	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I was looking for a small calendar for my purse that wouldnt take up alot of room or be bulky. This one is perfect. I buy alot of moleskine books for mix media journaling art projects but this is my first calendar from them. I like that it has a band on it so it won't open while it is in my purse. It is small but there is room to write on each square for appointments etc.. I would have given it 5 stars had it come with a pen and a pen holder on the side, that would of been super handy.
Have used these for years and will continue.
2713	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these for a few years and they really do help with planning your shopping trips, remembering to make a note of items to replace after you've used them up, and to a certain extent it also helps with hitting up each quadrant of the store in an efficient manner. When we hit the store, I'll cross stuff off as I go to make sure I don't miss anything. And sometimes I'll task my partner with grabbing 2-6 things at a time from nearby sections of the grocery store while I'm taking care of other parts of the list, and then we're in and out twice as fast.

They only hold about 3 ozs which doesn't seem like a lot, until you are licking and slurping it. They are super easy to use and we made creamy fruit popsicles as well as orange juice popsicles. I also tried coconut water but it wasn't very good frozen so I dropped it in some water as an ice cube. Perfect. My daughter chimed in while eating one, "This is just the right size."

2441	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The photos do not give you the right view of this address book. It is small, like as big as your hand. Small and basic. Not much details. The only reason I didn't return it, is because my husband liked it. A positive note is that each letter has plenty of pages. Not the basic 1-2 pages. More like 4 pages each letter. So it will do as a back up for our iPad.
5252	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love the size of this notebook and the grid paper for drawing and notes.  It works very well with fountain pen ink, although you can see through slightly.  You can certainly write on both sides of the paper.  I have a big preference for the softer covers of these notebooks.

3081	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Seems like the copied over questions from a girlfriend/boyfriend book.  Some of the questions they had you answer were just weird and uncomfortable for something you would give your Mom.  The book was so small also, fits in the palm of your hand-was unflattering. It also took so long to get that even though I ordered it weeks before Mother's Day I still didn't receive it until afterwards.

917	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This map is exactly what I was looking for. It is big enough to be able to identify and mark individual countries and major cities, but does not take up he whole wall. It came rolled up and had no creases in it. I am glad I paid a little extra to get the laminated version. If you are looking for a classy map on which to mark your travels, I would look no further.

1234	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This adult coloring book contains 89 single pages that you can color plus the inside covers could also be colored, though they have a different, shiner finish.  The drawings vary between intricate, geometrically patterned animal figures and designs and those that are less so, but all could be considered challenging enough to keep one occupied for many, many days.  The many, different patterns encourage you to create and experiment with your own individual color schemes and result in finished projects that are unique to each "artist".
8716	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It is exactly as described.

1567	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These are an excellent option for inexpensive freezer pop moulds.  Of course, making pops yourself is the only way to ensure you get exactly what you want in them in terms of sugar content.  Turns out most kids are happy with something cold, so you can definitely make healthier snacks than the typical commercial freezer-pop.  These BPA-free plastic moulds do a nice job and make fun star-shape pops.  My kids liked them with just plain water because the shape was so much fun.  The stick actually snaps into the mould so you don't even need to stand them up to get decent pops.  My only issue is that the stand isn't moulded quite deep enough to hold all of the pops, so if you do want to use it, it can be a little difficult.  But overall it's an excellent option for summer treats.
I bought it to go with my new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Large-Print-Life-Application-Study-Bible-NIV/dp/1414359764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Large Print Life Application Study Bible (NIV)</a>&nbsp;in hardcover. It fit perfectly well. I wrote a review on that Bible and the link will be in the comments, if you're interested.
But if you love Dina's style and the effortless way she seems to be able to combine different elements and come out with these brilliant, beautiful pages, then you will find SO much inspiration and eye-candy in this book. It's a must for any art journal library.
6475	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Love this planner, been getting it for years.  Perfect layout for a college student, but this years' iteration suffers from a couple issues.  The bookmark band came fairly weak so it doesn't clamp down very well.  This is unfortunate because I used to also put stuff like brochures or miscellaneous papers in there temporarily and now they fall right out.  It does still keep the page and keep the rest of the book closed great though, so no problems there.  The other problem is the pen carrying strap, the last one was too large and only very bulky pens would stay in place so this is an improvement but using it too frequently causes the glue to weaken.  I'm worried it may come detached at some point.  I'll update if that does happen.
Edit: I had to throw the mouse pad away because the seal came apart entirely and all the stuff on the inside started coming out. BAD PRODUCT
3379	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very nice. It comes with a good sized stack of sheets and also plenty of stickers. My son really likes it. The paper is a little thin (just regular paper strength) but all in all it works for us and I am happy with this purchase.
There had never been an album like Sgt. Pepper's before 1967.  Before then, an album was simply a collection of songs; since Sgt. Pepper's, an album has been looked upon as more than the sum of its parts.  The Beatles were determined to break new ground, putting in an estimated 700 hours in the studio to produce the thirteen songs you find here (three additional songs were also recording during the Sgt. Pepper sessions but went on to be released separately: Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, and It's Only a Northern Song) .  The amazing stereo sound was borne of carefully placed microphones all over the studio, including the insides of instruments.  All manner of mixing, tape speed manipulation, and other elaborate technological twists were done to the recordings to make each of them sound unlike anything ever heard before.  There were no breaks between songs, so each side of the original long-playing record played without pausing from beginning to end.  In the case of the second side, you could even say that there was no end to the music; John Lennon, after adding several seconds of a high-pitched tone near the end of A Day in the Life, had several seconds of inane chatter stuck at the very end - this chatter played over and over again in one continuous groove until the listener lifted the needle (unless the record player featured auto return).  The historic evolution of the album went far beyond the individual song tracks.  The album cover, featuring a gallery of familiar men and women is famous in and of itself - as much for those individuals who were rejected as too controversial as it is for the faces you do see (many of whom had to be paid for the use of their likenesses).  Sgt. Pepper was also the first album to come with the lyrics of the songs printed on the sleeve.

9012	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This (along with the matching keyboard rest) are extremely comfortable. It keeps shape indefinitely and provides some much needed comfort, provided I actually manage to keep my wrist flat on the pad (my habit, not a problem of the rest).
My real frustration with this product is that Cross does NOT make a CONVERTER for it. And the small dribbles ink cost a fortune.

A note about cleaning- after extended use, there will be tarnishing and brown blemishes (at least on my gas range).  To get rid of these, do NOT use Bon Ami because it's too gentle- doesn't get rid of stains.  Best way to go is Barkeeper's Friend, about $2.50 at your local supermarket, or Cameo Stainless Steel Cleaner.  However, Cameo is more abrasive than Barkeeper's Friend, and WILL reduce the mirror polish of these pans.  Barkeeper's is the way to go- remember to ALWAYS rub in a CIRCULAR manner- back and forth will scratch the surfaces.

Some reviews mention the batteries being a problem to access or purchase, but this is not true.  You merely have to remove the 6 screws from the back of the calculator, pop the housing off, and the batteries are right there...they are ordinary button cells which can be purchased in any electronics department.  I guess AAA's would be easier, but then the calculator would no longer have such a slim profile.

Do note that you should not stick this (or any other nice knife) into the dishwasher.  Good tools such as this should always be hand washed and great care should be taken with storage.  Dishwashers and poor storage, i.e. throwing the knife into a drawer with a bunch of other stuff, creates more dull knives than anything I can imagine.
8972	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	too big...it is a great product but no room on my pull out keyboard tray to use this.

I have been slowly adding some of these Peppa books to her collection, as she loves to be read to. She also loves swimming so I knew she would enjoy this one. She knows all the characters, and loves pointing them all out. This book is cute and colorful, however I personally thought it was lacking a little bit as far as the variety of pictures. Each page is pretty much the same with the characters in the pool, with some slight variations. However, as you can tell from my video this book has been well loved in just the couple months that we have had it. My daughter wants us to read it to her over and over, and she carries it around with her all the time looking at the pictures. So although the pictures are a bit repetitive to me, my daughter loves it and that is what matters most. There are 23 pages total not including the cover page, and there are just the right amount of words on the pages to tell a nice story without losing her attention. Overall I like this book, it just isn't my personal favorite in the series. I still would recommend it to anyone with a child who is a Peppa fan. This was a personal purchase bought at the full retail price. I am reviewing it solely to share my experience with other potential buyers.

5356	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The thing that I like about Moleskines, this one included, is that they're nice enough to be pleasure to work with, but they aren't so fancy that you're afraid to use them. This one in particular is particularly nice on account of its sturdy hardcover. The paper is the standard Moleskine onion paper and it certainly gets the job done without bleeding through even with most fountain pens. Despite the stitched-backing this Moleskine lies relatively flat when in use. Lastly, make sure to check the dimensions before buying because the large Moleskine is actually comparable to a small notebook.

Consequently, the unit would run out of juice and not charge. Once I figured that out, I have been able to revive it without much incident.

What I love:  A spot for each person and a place to write general occasions or holidays.  A month view calendar.  A list of holidays for two years.  A place to write a year's worth of birthdays and anniversaries.  A place for important phone numbers.  Extra pages for notes and lists.  An elastic to help keep it closed.  I love that it starts in August, in time to enter school calendars before school starts.
Others have criticized the ability to remove pages from the journal. I can't speak to that, as I don't intend to remove pages. I will high-res scan any pieces that I like to frame or sell as prints. Aside from that, a razor blade or exacto knife should remedy any difficulty removing pages and I would assume most artists/crafty folks have one lying around for various projects.
I had this item on my Amazon Wish List for quite a while.  I could have bought it for myself but it's one of those things that you appreciate more when it is a gift.  In France Le Creuset collections are often bequeathed to thankful children from parents that have cooked with them for decades.  My oldest son bought this for me from Amazon as a Christmas present.  I promised him that he could have it when I was done with it (hopefully a long time from now).
Between the ergo keyboard and the wrist pad for the mouse I didn't have surgery. It's been years now and I can work and type all I want to without problem. I bought one of these mouse pads for each of my home and work computers and find it the best choice out there and one that works really great for me.

5319	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've got a lot of these.  I like them.  They're not the best for fountain pens, but it also depends on the ink you use.  I use Noodler's Black because it doesn't bleed through the pages.  For most regular pens I think it works great.  Before I got into fountain pens I used a Pilot Vball extra fine point with it and it was great.
(Note:  for real world NPVs, I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator.)
I got it right on the third try. It is a bit smaller than a paperback. There are a few pages in the front giving you tips on creating a password. There are almost 150 pages with 3 entry sections on each page and several pages in the back just for notes. There is a magnetized flap that keeps the book closed and room for a pen storage. This book has just what I was looking for and if it was sitting on a table it DOES NOT scream Password Keeper. There is only one thing wrong and the rest is so right that I will find a way to work it out, but I did take off one star because that might be very important for some people. There are no alphabetical sections. There is no tabs with letters on them and I really can't figure out why because there are plenty of pages separate into sections for each letter, so you will have to make the determination, what is the criteria most important to you. I do recommend it for all the other reasons.

2840	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	No magnet on the back .. .BOO.  I mean where do I put this baby. . these kinds of notebooks need magnets to stick on the fridge.  Super disappointed.  Now this sucker is collecting dust in a drawer.

Seems to work fine.  Has very slim clip, so might be good for people who want to clip it onto the notebook they keep.  This is the reason for it's design.  It sits flatter than another pen.
Return/warranty options on it are okay (they have to be, apparently this is a common problem) but any device that bricks within 2 months deserves a 1-star.
I have been giving these out to friends who I know will love them. In stressful situations, like in a mediation, I will slip one to an attorney who will just start to hoot out loud. I love it! Great way to bring down the tension in a room.

Surprisingly durable. A few years ago, I was in Fairbanks, Alaska and placed one of these notebooks on the roof of my car was I was fumbling with the door. I then forgot about it and drove off. A little while later, I went to look for the notebook but could not find it.  Fortunately, I always write my phone number on the inside front cover, and a lady called me to tell me she'd found my beloved Moleskine. When I picked it up from her, the numerous tire tracks across various inside pages testified to the fact it had been run over numerous times. And yet, all of the pages stayed attached and unripped. Very satisfying.
1111	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Praise this note book. Better then the ones that need to switch the carbon copy, Warning it can sink about a couple pages in.

Of course I was doomed from the start, there was nothign to figure out past the notion that  it wasn't meant to be.
3169	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I almost didn't buy this because of negative reviews, but I took a chance, & I'm glad that I did. It works fine. If you close it correctly and carry it by the handle, it works great. I lay it flat to open it, & my border never falls out. If you don't lay it down to open it, you may end up with a mess. I have 3 of these, & they hold a lot of border!!  I also like these because once they are rolled up, I can stand them between a bookcase and the wall. They are easier to hide than border boxes.

I love the shape of the pans - more true rectangular & without rounded corners.

289	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Got this in the mail yesterday and was very happy. When I ordered last week ... there was no sourcing fee. For 1.50 it's a very unique/compact/easy-to-carry notebook. It's thin enough to fit inside a purse and can be used to jot down "to do" lists or whatnot but it's too small for journaling. I've ordered several more notebooks from the publisher and can't wait for them to come! Wish Amazon would carry more of these notebooks because there are some stunning ones featuring the paintings of Renoir/Degas/John Singer Sargent. All for 1.50 or less. These make excellent stocking stuffers and I cant imagine a "girly girl" or sensitive guy would be disappointed to receive one. Im happy with the quality and will buy the William Morris address book ... if there's no sourcing fee.

260	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I ordered the ABC Sing-Along Flip Chart & CD for my five year old preschool classroom to use at the beginning of each new letter of the week. The songs are not at all cheesy and the kids even try to sing along with it even though the songs can be kind of fast. The song follows the words on the chart and repeats the words twice. The first time I used this I had each child come up and make a circle with a dry erase marker around the letter we were learning about. That was a long process in which I would not recommend unless you have a small class size or impeccably well behaved children. lol. The next week we did the song and talked about the letter, but this time I added the chart as an activity during center time. The kids LOVED having this choice during centers. Not only does this chart teach about letters, but you can also use it as a fine motor and handwriting tool as well. I would completely recommend!

I will agree with another reviewer who said that it's somewhat difficult to find or follow the names of mountain ranges. That's really my only knock against it. To be fair though, there's only so much room, and I personally care more about being able to read the roads, towns, lakes and state names than the mountain ranges.

668	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	My husband and I typically print out recipes from websites. This is a nice way to organize them into a binder.  I agree with another reviewer it would be nice to come with labels from which to choose but disagree about the sheet protectors should be provided. Although I use them, it might raise cost, and then people might complain about not wanting them. The price is good at $20. You can always buy your own sheet protectors.  I do think the binder has typical categories, but would be nice to create your own.  The binder itself has wonderful prints. You will enjoy the prints if you like William Morris of course.  If you are not as familiar with his work, the prints are from pre 20th century decorative arts. They were in arts and crafts style houses.  Not everyone is a print person, but I think these are not too "busy." I agree with another reviewer that binder is bigger than expected, but unlike them I see it as a benefit.  It is easier to prop up and I can use standardized paper and sheet protectors. Good product for a good price.

I think I'm going to get a couple more because they are great for storage and hold a lot of things. I'm using the 2 for holding art supplies.
They freeze quickly, just a couple of hours and their ready to go. The biggest thing is finding an area in your freezer to put them standing up. The lid/stick is good but adds some height in the freezer so it took a little work but we got them to stand up straight.

Project Life is a photo album/scrapbooking system with pocketed photo sleeves and the majority of the supplies are 3x4 cards and 4x6 cards to fit in those sleeves alongside the photos. It's really hard to store the cards flat, so I thought I would give a box designed for recipe cards a try. It's perfect! The 3x4 cards fit two across, and the 4x6 cards fit just as recipe cards would. You can flip through the cards easily, and organize certain sets and themes. You can also store photos in these boxes.

The Classic Century model (in all forms), sadly, is now a little rougher to operate than the old one my Grandfather had.  It's OK, but the two halves of the pen don't fit together solidly, and wiggle too much.  The polished model looks nicer with its brighter finish and neat grooves, but also costs twice as much.

*) Speed. I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations. They're right. So what? If your IRR computation is that complicated, use a spreadsheet. If you're a college student taking exams, you're better off with a graphing calculator anyway. For 99% of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough, and the price of speed is power consumption. My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement, and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways. It's a pain to need a quick answer, reach for the calculator, and then find the batteries are exhausted. This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands. I've never had this problem with the HPs I've owned.

The one thing I found a little disconcerting at first is not related to the design. It is a fact of life with the material. Food grade silicone has a lot of great features but rigidity is NOT one of them. This bottle is quite squishy and floppy as the content level gets lower. If you hold it in the center of the bottle with one or two fingers it will actually fold up around your fingers when close to empty. I figured out that it didn't really matter since you can squeeze the bottle easily to dispel air and water anytime you want to... so really a non-issue. Just don't expect it to stay rigid and standing tall as the water level gets low.!!!

It's large enough to not feel cramped on the page but also very portable. The heavy pages are cream colored, but not yellow as stated in some other reviews, it has a built in folder pocket attached to the back cover. Pages lay pretty flat when open. I have only had it a week but it seems well made and like it will stay together. Micron pens do not bleed through at all and neither does my pentel brush pen. Sharpie does ghost through but not really bleed. Alcohol type markers do bleed through so you would only be able to use one side of each page.

3649	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	No bells and whistles, just a very good basic shower head. Over the years I have had all kinds and types of shower heads and hand held units, pulsators, massagers, etc., etc.. I found myself needing a replacement and decided to go back to a basic full spray model, with a good name brand. For a small dimension head (approximately 2.5" diameter) this Moen provides very good spray with even water coverage and the direction of the head can be adjusted. Installation was very quick and easy, just a little teflon tape and an adjustable wrench. It's lightweight though the specs state it is manufactured of metal (along with the finish and non-metallic face). The brushed nickel finish looks great. If you are looking for a basic full even spray for your shower, I recommend this Moen 6300-BC.

Unfortunately, that app was godawful. I ended up getting the actual remote. It's pretty basic, so I find it hard to believe that it's really worth the price.

Sorry to be a downer here.  Don't get me wrong:  this unit may suit you for home purposes, but the quality--which I find to be at or slightly below par for digital answerers--is not at all acceptable for a business.
Confusing to use at times, especially bad during tests. For example if an answer is something like 3.5 x 10^11 (which is 350000000000) the calculator will show this number as "3.5^11" (which is 965491.57) even though it means to say 3.5x10^11. Standard calculators are supposed to use E to show this (as in 3.5E10), because the other way indicates a completely different value. So confusing.
5147	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	What can I say? I'm a sucker for Moleskine books.

8471	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	One of these calculators is probably one of the most useful things you can have in high school, especially if you are taking classes such as algebra 2, geometry, physics, pre-calculus, or calculus. No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school, they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator. These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen,  but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam. So although this calculator is from 1999 it is still a good calculator that you won't regret getting.

The HP 12C is very rugged, for this is a highly engineered product. You can, quite literally, throw it against the wall, and pick it up and it still works. You cannot do that with the competing Texas Instruments model. Battery life is long, but I find it a bit hard some times to find the replacements (check the `hearing aid batteries' section in stores).
This calendar is sturdy and well-made. The magnet easily holds up the calendar, and it's pretty heavy! But there's no sliding! And I love the feature at the top of the calendar.. there's a plastic clip that covers the first 1/2 inch of the top of the calendar and you can slip the top page of the month you're on into the plastic clip cover so that your month is easily displayed.

Normally I would use calculators on my laptop, or in the spreadsheet, or on my cell phone, but those might also be used for cheating and are most likely not allowed.

The color and style were great but having been used to a larger mug, I was not happy. I am glad to report that my attitude has changed.

Does this spell the end of the RPN/programmable calculator? I believe so. They'll have their place in history beside the slide rules and the Monroes, but such a design will never be repeated again. They've been made obsolete by the ubiquity of computers, and the modern dogmas of "cheaper is better" and "planned obsolescence". Complex programming tasks can be done faster and more easily on a computer, there just isn't any real need for them anymore.

I love giving these out as presents!
I like the stiff durability of the notebook.  My notebook gets toss around like mad, and over the years has sustained only one small split on the spine.  Considering all it's been through, that's pretty darn good sustainability for the notebook.
3023	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	great gift for stockings or work events.
727	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Terrific daily journal.  Beautiful imagery.  A real keepsake for daily appointments as well as archiving year to year appointments or specific activities.
Some inks will bleed through the quality Moleskine paper, but I usually use pencil anyway (soft pencil which necessitates using a sheet of paper under a written sheet to prevent transfer when the obverse side of the page is written on). I prefer squares to lined paper. I don't know why but I feel more comfortable writing on quadrille paper than lined. All my notepads are quadrille too.
The binding is nice, the paper quality is fantastic (both lined and blank).  I was very surprised at how great the paper was with graphite, charcoal, and ink given the price.  This is definitely a great value for students and art enthusiasts on a budget.  The size varieties are nice, ranging from pocket size to full notebook.

5113	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I started carrying these a few months ago. I like to carry the plain paper notebooks for sketching. I have found the graph paper works better for me for note taking. The pocket in the back cover is very helpful as is the tear out pages in the back.
5758	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I always keep one of these next to my bed and one in my car...they are great for taking quick notes.  Quality paper.
5020	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	What more is there to say? I use these for bullet journaling, as I've had a leather cover much like the Midori Traveler's Notebook made by someone on Etsy for me. These are great for such a set up. I suggest checking out bulletjournal.com
5034	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mechanical pencil.  It's very light weight plastic, but it seems to be pretty rugged.  So far, after about a month of use, it hasn't jammed, broken up the lead, or malfunctioned in any way.  One thing to be aware of is that there is no eraser on this pencil.  When you pull off the little clicker button, there's just a feeder tube for the lead.  The best feature of this pencil is the shape.  It's a flattened tube; it would be rectangular in cross section.  This makes it very comfortable to hold without slipping or rolling in your fingers.  It also makes it impossible to roll off of a desk, hit the floor, bend the tip, and smash the lead.  Been there, done that...
9892	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good quality product and great price!
9842	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use this often to label boxes at work.  I don't know if it's my machine or the tape, but the ink doesn't smear & lasts long.  They stay on well & on plastic, it often will come off easily if I need to remove it.  They are not waterproof, but they aren't advertised to be waterproof...just an FYI.  But most people don't need around water.  But I need to rinse them on occasion.  They will go through a few rinses before I need to replace them.  I'm glad I found these.

8348	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Does all it is supposed to and actually more than I need. Class called for this model only to get there and the prof. said we did not need this good of one.
1201	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Very beautifully made and sturdier than I thought it was going to be. I should have paid more attention to the A6, but that was more my fault than theirs. I am using it as an art journal. I was hoping to use it more as a journal though. Very good quality.
2431	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great, would buy from this vendor again.
Once I've used this for a month or so, I will try to come back and update with any more observations.

5413	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The paper is smooth as a baby forehead.  As usual the paper is so slick you have to be careful which pens you use because they can smear.  Not sure it's worth the price but it's a great use for a diary.
I do like the size of this particular journal, I can fit it in the back pocket of my jeans, through it in my bag, basically it goes everywhere with me.
508	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I hung this on my computer desk cabinet door to organize, and keep handy, files with bills due, receipts, pet records, papers to file, paper to shred, ect.  It works perfectly for my use. It's made very well and I think it will hold up very well. My desk is now uncluttered and this takes up minimal space. And, since my bi-fold cabinet door is always open, it's out of sight.  I hung it with push pins . . so far, so good.

The second star is for the width of the pad, it's just barely enough.
9491	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It got the job done and wasn't fussy at all, I would purchase again. Used it for my finance course and it worked great

4194	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's smaller than the one I had for 2017, so it fits in my purse better. There's no plastic cover on it, so I can't tuck things into it, but the cover it does have seems pretty sturdy. The spaces are big enough for me to write in - I'm happy with it.

7630	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It does just what a calculator should.
7674	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works flawlessly with a sufficiently bright display and easy to press keys. The only drawback I had was that using the calculator without looking was difficulty as there was not sufficient guide for my fingers. In the end I went back to using my computers 10-key as I could do more quicker.
I don't know why this product seems to fall apart for some. I carry the book with me all the time in my shirt pocket and it has not come apart even after several months.

2.) Ink - width, cartridge-loading, converter & bottle-loading: Ever since I first used a rollerball as opposed to a normal ballpoint, I loved the strong, black line that some of them gave. It made my work stand apart from others. Fountain pens are even better. The stroke this pen gives is a powerful, thick black (assuming, of course, that black ink is used! I'm willing to bet that for those who like, for example, blue, that this would look beautiful with blue ink. =:o).
534	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	My kids are pre-K. I ended up laminating the cards and turning them over. I simply wrote things that we do. Ie. "Opening" "Discussion" "Lunch" "Lego Building" "Music" "Snack" "Park" ... I remind my toddlers about things that are coming up and check off items as we complete them. They enjoy knowing what's going to happen-- and I enjoy knowing that I've completed everything.

2598	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my autistic son's home classroom. It holds a great many items, including the calendar and storage pockets. I did buy additional hooks for it. It's good if you want something portable (it has wheels) and you don't want to put holes in your walls.
4689	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am addicted to Moleskine notebooks.  They never let me down.
2273	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Easily one of my favorite bookmarks. Good quality for the price.
357	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this map to post in our homeschool room for reference. I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It came rolled in a tube, so there were no creases. The paper is thin, but because it's light, it stays on the wall quite well. (I use putty.) It's large enough that you can make out the individual countries in Europe. And it has quite a bit of detail as far as cities, rivers, and lakes. I like that the fonts and sizes of the type clearly show what are continents, what are countries, and what are cities. That's important for young learners.
Some notes:
Unfortunately, this thing powers down just as fast as the TI-30Xa, even in bright light. Plus I do not like the arrangement of the buttons... It has the "ON" button down in the lower left while my other TI calculators had them in the upper right, and other things have been shuffled around as well. Texas Instruments must be taking lessons on confusing customers from Microsoft; how about the automakers adopt this tactic and experiment with gas pedals on the left and brakes on the right? How would that work out? Also this calculator is lacking the 1/x button, which I happen to use very often. And the frequently-used square root key has been demoted to a "2nd" function.
4598	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this, thank you!!!

4533	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I originally got one of these when I was student teaching several years ago. It worked well, so I bought another one recently. This time it is to organize my art papers and pads by type. Most of my pads are 9x12, and the pockets can hold 2-3 books/tablets each. It is heavy, but the pockets are strong enough to handle it. The only negative is that it did not come with hooks. I didn't have any hooks small enough to go through the grommets, so I attached binder rings to the grommets and hung them from some over the door hooks, and it's working great. I should mention that the hooks were missing from the last one I bought too (we used clear packing tape that time). I don't know if they were missing or just not part of the package, but it's something to be aware of.
8651	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	it's ok
8588	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This TI scientific calculator was easy to use instantly.  Clearly written and thorough instructions that made it simple to operate.  I haven't had use for all of the functions, and probably never will, but for high school and college, this will do very nicely.

4885	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I love these notebooks, and use them often for school work and/or personal journals. The slim design makes these easy to carry with you even in a smaller bag, and I like that they're lightweight.
8749	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It keeps my wrist from hurting and the mouse glides over it with no problem.
