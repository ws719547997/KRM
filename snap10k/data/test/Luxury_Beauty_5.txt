6956	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	*Note: I've changed my original rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because I've found that after using Juice Beauty's Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer for over a month, my face has noticeably brightened and become ultra smooth and hydrated. I already liked this moisturizer and saw (see original review below) benefits after using it for just a week. After a month, it's benefits are more evident, and it's become an essential component to my daily moisturizing routine.



Don't be put off by the small size of the tube. It takes the tinyest amount to do the job. A fingertip is far too big for applying this under eyes, for instance. Experiment and see. I use a Q-tip with just a smidge on it, for BOTH eyes!
I cannot recommend this product.
6325	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very moisturizing, just takes a little bit.
9113	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!
It also works well enough IF:

7507	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works for sun spots on my arms, chest, upper back and calves (yes, ladies, if you wear shorts or knee length skirts in summer you probably get sun spots in that area). I used other Nia 24 products on my face and neck and they improved my skin texture a lot. Once it happened I became unhappy with the texture on other areas on my body. I saw other women who made the same mistake: they neglected the skin on their bodies and because of that their smooth faces didn't make them look younger.
5356	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	The size of the brush I received was somewhere between a small and a medium sized brush - not even close to an XL.
3159	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my boyfriend, they are his absolute favorite blades for shaving his face. The price is great, shipping was fast, and they arrived in appropriate packaging. Will order again!
I still usually prefer to also use my regular cleanser, but this Micellar water does the trick when I'm tired at night as I just wipe my face it and let it air dry while I brush my teeth (and just follow with my serum and cream). My skin is dry and sensitive, and it feels clean and comfortable even without rinsing and doesn't feel dry or irritated from the Micellar water. It does feel just a bit tacky without rinsing, but that feeling goes away as soon as I apply my regular serum and cream.

I also like the white tea scent.  It's lightly floral and doesn't stick around leaving me smelling like sunscreen.
3557	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Helps my skin and is very gentle.
Over, its a very nice moisturizer and hydrating facial cream, but at the price point of $365 for 1.7oz, it is very over priced compared to other facial creams and ingredients in the luxury category. And the environmental working group database did not give it high marks due to use of ingredtnts such as Fragrance, Triethanolamine, BHT, Polyacrylamide, Phenoxyethanol, and Methylparaben.
2005	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this nail polish color so much!! The color in the bottle doesn't do it justice. It's gorgeous on the nails!!

87	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Honestly, I love this color. It is a coral color and is close to the picture provided. For better and smoother spread, I highly recommend rolling and shaking the bottle. For optimal color, I recommend applying a single layer first then apply a fuller second layer. The coral color pops and is extremely juicy! This is a perfect mid summer or early fall color but can be used in an ombre for the fall.


BTW I could not wear under make-up unless applied at least 15 minutes before applying eye make-up (or it would smear off).
It's a pricey set, but a little goes a long way. This should last a while. Still, we think it's probably not going to be an everyday routine. It's good for pampering, and it might also be great for someone with sensitive skin that can't use inexpensive drug store products. The quality is very good.
8679	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	i love this stuff, however they trick you by putting it into a canister with a raised bottom so it appears there is alot more in there than reality - don't be tricky - !

It has a sprinkle method that I've used on both dry and wet hair.  I am a medium blonde with some brown tones.  The light brown was a good match.  It helps conceal a larger part or thinning areas of the hair.  The small ones are great for travel too.

Steps
2347	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Enjoy using this balm at night before bed and in the morning under lipstick.  This tube will last a while as I only need to apply a small amount for my lips to feel moisturized and appear glossy.  I really love the simple packaging and find the subtle tint and hint of rose appealing.
But to me what's best is the color itself. It's a great nude color with just that little bit of color that's not too pink or beige or brown. Instead it looks so natural and makes your lips look fuller and natural. I use it to color in my full lip and then I add the Jane Iredale LipDrink Lip Balm in Buff to top it off. That helps hydrate your lips a little bit and blends in perfect with the lip liner. Then during the day I just need to freshen up with the lip balm, the liner remains intact.
There are two things you should know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.

9937	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

- Too heavy to use under makeup as a toner
I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.
4277	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Nice idea, but certainly no less streaky than conventional cremes.  Less mess for sure and an easy application, but for me this gets one star because of the very orange color that develops.  I've tried lots of self tans, and this is for sure the most orange-y in cast.  I'm pretty fair, and so half expect this result with self tanning.  But this is by far the worst of the lot.  Definitely not a natural looking brown with this towel.

9294	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	No good for medium skin color. Makes face look dirty does not help when contouring.


Update 2: Well the second week of shaving with this razor wasn't as pleasant. It was very harsh and I got a lot of razor burn. Also my face was breaking out because I think it is took close of a shave. Its still a great razor but it may not be and every day or even every week razor. I'll try again down the road and see how it works. The first week was the best shave or my life.

6970	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	So basically I'm not a super duper girlie girl.  I'm fine with the basic skin products you find at your local drug store.  Still, when this popped up in Vine, I figured I'd give it a shot - it seemed to be bragging about being organic and I frankly wanted to know if that really  makes this little container worth about six times as much as the big bottle of what I'd usually buy at said local drug store.
3647	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	XEN-TAN Mousse Intense Weekly Tan is absolutely the most natural looking sunless tanner I've ever used. I have dark olive skin naturally and some tanners have an orange tinge that looks awful on my skin. This tanner truly gives you a beautiful bronze tan. It's also buildable for a deep tan if that's what you're going for.
3905	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This seems to do a good job strengthening nails but I didn't love it as a top coat. It wasn't bad but wasn't any better than another cheap top coat would be, as far as I can tell.  I'll probably mostly use it under polish to keep my nails from breaking. I also wasn't impressed by the "matte" part. Was hoping it would be more obvioulsy matte but it was basically just less shiney than most top coats and wore off somewhat quickly.
8516	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use a product with Retin-A nightly, and while it does a nice job smoothing out fine lines, it cause my skin to dry out and be sun sensitive. I am also dealing with outbreaks of rosacea, so I need a gentle but effective moisturizer. The Mario Badescu Moisture Magnet covers all of my requirements and is working very well.
After-Shave: The after-shave feels really good on the skin but I didn't necessarily find it super-effective. I still got an in-grown hair every now and then and it makes my face look a little oily/shiny. There's no alcohol in it, however, which is much appreciated. Alcohol can be really damaging to the skin and doesn't help that much after a shave.

9565	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've always been a bit sensitive to strong smells, so I use these sparingly.  As a fan of Calvin Klein scents (I have Eternity, CK One and Obession) I have to say that this is a bit closer to the Obsession and Eternity range.  Spicy and woodsy, it's pleasant as long as it's a light touch.
5035	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I normally use a primer before applying makeup. Primers help makeup go on easier and gives you a better "look" I was really surprised to receive the Vincent Longo primer in such a small tube-especially for the price! The directions say to just use a pearl size amount-which would make the tube last a longer.
5438	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I always try out products before I let the pre-teenagers any where near them.  I was glad it was me instead of one of the children when my face turned RED.  What was THAT about?  So red, but it didn't hurt.  I would also say that y skin feels smoother after using it.  However, my skin tone is already great to start with.  I am very lucky.  (The key for me is to never wear makeup other than a little mascara and lipstick.)  (Just try telling a 15 year old goth that.)
I'm very disappointed in the changes to the one time beautiful scent.  I can't wear this, I no longer like the scent and I certainly don't want to feel sick all day.
But scent alone does not make for a 5 star soap.  That scent also needs to last longer than it takes you to decide on which shoes to wear.  As does the feeling left behind from the jojoba oil and the shea butter.  There is just not enough shea butter in the formulation to provide staying power.  I found a loofa more effective than a facecloth for all-over use.  But as a hand soap, my skin looks and feels no differently 15 minutes after use.  More. Shea. Butter.
Overall, though, it feels nice to use.  It creates a nice foam, but you do have to rinse it quite well to wash it all off.

Shea Butter is one ingredient I always look for when buying hand creams. My wife swears by it and so do I. But you need more than just a small smidgen of shea butter in the ingredients list to be effective. This L'Occitane hand cream contains 20% Shea Butter plus Almond and Honey extracts in addition to Coconut Oil. What a great combination. Enough Shea Butter to provide superior performance but not so much to leave your hands feeling like you just slathered them in Crisco. Together these ingredients provide a long lasting, mostly non-greasy protection and moisturization for dry, chapped hands. It has a pleasant fragrance.
5248	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	So far I like it.  I don't see a dramatic difference yet though, and I wish it were not so expensive.

2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.

8697	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am a sucker for Mario Badescu products. Several years ago I researched the absolute best possible cleanser for my skin, and again and again I was directed to Mario Badescu.  I loved it, deep cleansing, and no drying. Since then I have been working my way through the line.  I typically spray rose water on my face after I clean it, I use rose water to tone and soften and hydrate. (I also spray rose water on my hair). I pat my face dry, then I apply the rose hips nourishing oil, I tend to get very dry on the skin around my eyes.  I follow up with a moisturizing lotion.  I just love how fresh and dewy my face feels without being greasy or oily.  I really love it.

8031	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing. Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer. You do not shake it on to the roots of your hair where you can see the scalp, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp. If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.

9915	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a "croap" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the "Marco method" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most "feminine" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

868	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A very nice, light mist that's very refreshing without the sometimes heavier weight of goopier moisturizers. It can be easily used before or after makeup without creating a mess, dries quickly, and leaves my skin feeling very refreshed. Also surprisingly good on things like bug bites or small sunburns as it soothes all types of skin.
Works with all shaving methods, you don't need a brush to use this cream, just rub it around your face with a "LITTLE" bit of water and it'll lather up real quick. You don't need but enough to cover the end of your pinky finger. You can then use a DE Razor, Cartridge Razor (sensor excel, quatro, whatever), or even a straight Razor (you need skill to work with a razor like that).

1120	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I actually loved this product while I was using it. It smells very medicinal and somehow 'feels' like it's killing bacteria. Unfortunately it completely dries out your skin, and is, in my opinion, WAY too harsh for acne prone skin. I've since overhauled my skin care routine once I realized that acne is caused by inflammation, and needs skin care products that CALM the skin, not strip it of all natural oils. Try using natural soaps for cleansing, and certain oils (jojoba, tamanu, etc) for moisturizing.

449	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Excellent coverage for concealing imperfections, discoloration, even scarring.  I skip concealer when using this.  The cream foundation is thick, as would be expected.  I usually use MAC foundation sticks, so this is a bit heavier than my usual routine.  It's good for when I really want to go out and put on a full face.  Use your fingers or a makeup sponge for even application.  I am typically one of those people who prefer to use a tinted moisturizer and some eyeliner and leave it at that.  The golden brown is darker than I expected.  Even with the shade charts provided on Amazon, I'm not entirely sure how to get a good color match online without seeing the full spectrum of the color palettes available.  If you fall between two colors, it's not as though you can easily order both colors just to dab a little on the back of your hand and see which one suits you best.  Especially at these prices.  I used to say you couldn't buy shoes online, it's really something you have to try in person.  Generous free return policies though have proven me wrong.  Maybe I'll be wrong about buying makeup online too.

There is a reason the cost is so low.  Yes, it is sometimes hard for someone frugal like me to splurge on something like this, but I always forget that it really does last a long time for the price.  I already have think hair but I suspect that this will help maintain that fullness and body.  Can I really evaluate it's true thickening potential, probably not, but it is still a great shampoo.  I'm a hair gel guy and some shampoos have a hard time getting that "feel" out of my hair.  JB has no problem.  I recommend the standard lather, rinse, repeat.  This shampoo has a pleasing scent that is both clean and masculine.  A little dab will do the trick.  After washing my hair feels great.
All of these are great for aging skin and moisturizing any-age skin too. There's also lots of other plant extracts.

I love that it's all natural, so I don't have to worry as much about side effects you might see with long-term use of phtalates, PEGs, TEA, DEA, pesticides, artificial dyes, fragrances, etc. I'd probably keep using it, but for the current price of $52/bottle (and fairly tiny size--it doesn't seem like it will last more than a month or two), I don't know that I can justify it just for a tiny bit of reduction in fine lines.

7817	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have really sensitive lips and a lot of products will make them dry out or flake easily. These are a lot of lip scrubs and b I've tried all the ones in Sephora! This one is AMAZING. really exfoliates and doesn't dry out or give a bad reaction.  I still always moisturize after.

4460	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful facial cleaner even for sensitive skin.  I have been using this for a week now and I love it in all respects.  Just a bit goes a long way in giving you a feel of having a facial at a spa without the cost.  My skin is soft and feels so fresh and clean.  It has even moisturized a bit and the fragrance is light and sweet.  The price isn't bad considering what other products of this caliber cost in the stores and I do think this will last much longer.  I'm happy all around with this product and I'm not usually a big fan of any facial products due to drying of the facial skin.  Not a problem with this one.


5556	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product that lives up to its hype.  The small ones help you find your color.  (then can order a larger one).
2746	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My expectations for any skin care product labeled as anti-aging are pretty modest.  I don't think there are any miracles in a jar out there, no matter how elaborate the ingredient list or how high the price tag.  With that in mind, I do like this eye cream very much.
3073	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Seems to work!  Reduces fine wrinkles on the neck pretty well. You may see some visible results in a day (we thought we saw some right after application, but that might have been wishful thinking), and certainly more visible results after a few days. Nothing to complain about.

6160	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is somewhere between a lotion and a cream.  I was afraid this would feel too thick on my face, but it absorbed very well, and felt good on my skin.  I'm not sure how I feel about the sunscreen ingredients but it's nice to have a SPF moisturizer that doesn't sit on top of my skin.  This really doesn't have a scentwhich makes me happy.  The price is good for the amount you get.  I recommend this product.
It is really wonderful, not messy, and another great product from Dermablend!

2741	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My wife reports: "I have used NUXE products before and was very pleased with the results and this is no exception. It has a very pleasant floral smell.  I don't judge whether it is too strong or not, because people have different preferences, but in my case I liked the fragrance and did not mind its strength. If you have used NUXE products you know that they tend to have stronger smells. I dispensed one pump and it was plenty for both eyes. I could even use a little less, but I always tend to put on a lot. I used in it the morning and evening, and the absorbance is excellent, with no oily residues or tightness. The texture is creamy but very light.  After it absorbs you are ready to apply make up--it makes a perfect base. I would not say that this eye cream is going to dramatically change your eye appearance, but it does moisturize very well, and in the long run it is good to take care of your sensitive skin around the eyes.  And yes, that alone is going to help you against signs of aging. It's not a miracle cream, but a good preventive and delays the signs of aging. I love it and yes I am going to use it in the future. No regrets about choosing it, and I do recommend it."
Two coats make perfect! Love in a bottle.

2863	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was apprehensive after reaing reviews about the product creasing etc... After a full and stressful day my eye makeup lasted until I washed it off at night! No creasing whatsoever. I only applied a very small amount using the Jane Iredale camouflage brush. One dip is plently. Just blend in with brush on your lid.
I was provided a sample for review.
The only thing I don't like is the cap design.  You can't stand the tube on it's head and it doesn't flip open easily.  I've found it easier just to twist the whole cap off.

I moisturize at night only once a week at most (my bad), but as an occasional night creme, the Vichy Aqualinia works great! I am largely scent-free in my laundry products to spare my friends with environmental sensitivities, but I confess I do love my facial products. This one is noticeably scented, but I don't mind it. Using it twice a day would be way too much moisturizing for me, so I've set it aside for the occasional big burst from deeper application.


The actual ingredients list for this powder is: Talc, Bismuth Subgallate, Kaolin, Zinc Oxide, Calcium Carbonate, Magnesium Carbonate, Zinc Stearate, Sulfur.


3491	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great nude pink shade. Definitely for daily wear.
It is a very thick paste compared to drugstore brands in a small tube, but it will still last you 6 weeks or so with daily brushing. It foams up much more than a regular toothpaste as well. It sort of feels like the stuff they give you at a dentist cleaning though not gritty. I thought the mint would be overpowering, but it is not. It is a strong mint, but not too strong. I imagine I will be using this toothpaste from now on.
6207	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product for the control of  Rosacea.  Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.
I apply it after I have cleansed and toned and leave on for about 10 minutes.  It comes off easily with warm water and doesn't leave any residue behind.  This peel is so gently I could easily use it every other day to keep my skin looking refreshed.  It removes the layer of dead skin without causing harsh drying or peeling.
I already have dry skin and this does not cause an excessive drying.
4645	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I wanted to try this primarily for the skin brightening, but also to combat fine lines. The ingredient list wasn't full of scary things so it was worth trying.
B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.
8918	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The facial spray by Mario Badescu smells wonderful  (if you like roses). There is so much product in this, it's cheap, and the ingredients are great. I have been using this in the morning as a toner, it makes my pores feel tighter, and I've been using it as a setting spray for my makeup. Definitely recommend.
7811	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is great! Smells yummy and makes your lips smooth. It's the best lip scrub I have found!
I have not broken out or had any other adverse effects.  My face is nicely moisturized, although I've had the same results with cheaper brands.
5450	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used many Vichy products for women's skin care, so I was not afraid to use this product as a present for a man.  Vichy products user thermal water from France in their products.  This product is in elegant black packaging that is perfect for man.  It comes in a size that is easy to store in a bathroom or in a gym bag.  I applied a little bit of the cream om my hand.  It is soft, it absorbs quickly and has a lovely scent.  This product contains glycerin which seals skin moisture.
7362	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is probably the best  brow pencil that I have ever used. I have very light brows, and this color works very well with light brown hair. The tiny lines look more natural than heavier, thicker pencils. The little sharpener is great as well. This is a well thought out make up product, and I am happy to use it.
5353	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have dry skin and I use this along with Bioelements Sleepwear before i go to bed.  It's perfect.  It makes the area around my eyes feel soft.  I haven't used it long enough to notice any change in the lines around my eyes.

It doesn't help that I'm impatient either with nails,  and I find that quick dry top coats increase the chipping and peeling. This rapid dry spray is wonderful.  I use as directed and I find that it is touch dry almost instantly, though I wait for five to ten minutes.
The smell of mustela products can be quite strong for some people and initially I was not used to the smell and did not really like it, however now that I have used them for such a long time and the fact that they really work well and are effective for my children makes me a big fan

This can be applied without a mirror unless it's a darker color like poppy, then I'd exercise more caution, although the compact does include one. It's a good all in one item to stash in a small bag for touch ups on a night out.
But something about Baxter's Night Cream AHA is bothering my eyes, causing unusual dryness and minor stinging.  This happens even though I apply the product far, FAR from my eyes and even if I just put it on the back of my hand.
This really made a difference in how I feel about myself. I no longer have to be embarrassed or cry about how little hair I have.
1509	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is my 1st time using Zoya Nail Polish.  I absolutely love the color Chantal!!!  It is the perfect nude  for my skin tone!!  I love that it is 10 free!  Feels good to know I'm putting less chemicals on my very thin natural nails.  All that being said I did find that this polish is very thick and a little hard to apply.  It took 2 coats to get a somewhat even application. Maybe it having less chemicals makes it a thicker paint, idk. So I took one star away for that reason. I will try again and see if I can get a better application next time because I am truly obsessed with this color!! I have included photos with and without the flash on so you can see the true color of Chantal.
9128	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It has cult status for a reason. This stuff is incredible. When Im getting my regular period breakout (a couple on the chin, a few near the hairline) I bust this out as my last step before bed (after moisturizer too) and wow. The next morning I always get results. Redness is gone and usually so is the offending zit. I have wildly sensitive, oily skin, but this works wonders for me.

Obviously not a necessity at all, but my house has no ac, and when I wake up in the morning, I'm immediately hot again after washing my face, so this is super refreshing to cool off with after I apply makeup.

9976	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this "Soap in the Bowl" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.

77	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best nude for olive or light skin tones.  Easy to use formula that takes 3 coats for opaque but you can choose to wear sheer and it will still look beautiful.  A true skin color nude that doesn't dissapoint.  I wear it in its nail envy formula which helps keep my nails strong and grow quickly.  (Yes, it works)  no chipping, but I still use the original nail envy as base coat.
694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This shampoo is marketed for men but I used it as well as letting my husband try it.  I color my hair and it seemed to be an especially clarifying shampoo because it rinsed some of my color away with one use.  It has a very strong fragrance of mint and doesn't lather very much.  My husband really liked it and even though it comes in a smallish bottle it lasts for a long time because it has a pump top which helps you regulate your usage.
8787	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This has made my under eye area so hydrated and moisturized. Great for at night because the cream is on the thick side.
8807	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like this as a hydrater for my sometimes oily skin! It is lightweight, non greasy and feels amazing when I use it. I love anything herbal and the scent of this product is quite lovely.  I also love that it can be used both day and night.

8398	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a truly amazing product. I have very sensitive skin that is dry to combination. I was very surprised that it didn't burn, sting or make my skin brake out in a rash. I apply at night and in the morning I wake up with me face feeling like a babies butt hehe.. Highly recommend it.
378	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This was interesting product, unlike most products I have tried.  It has a little spatula that allows you to get the amount desired out of the pot.  You then warm between your fingers and it gets very smooth and soft allowing you to easily blend on spots you would like to cover.  I thought it blended well and that it covered nicely.  I would have liked to see a pot in the lid of the pot that I could keep the spatula.  Now I have to try and get track of it.
7317	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is the perfect moisturizer, I love it and the somme system. I wish it was a little more moisturizing during cold dry months.
I prepped my skin beforehand by exfoliating, hydrating and then applying the bronzer.  It says it's been tested for "sensitive" skin which is HUGE for me because I have extremely sensitive, eczema prone skin.  The lotion is white (like regular lotion) and has a clean scent.  I was worried that the scent would give me a flare because I'm sensitive to most scents, but surprisingly it did not irritate my skin at all.  It's hydrating and easy to apply.
8936	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have this on my desk at work and I mist my face whenever I look at it. Smells nice and refreshes your face and moisturizes it for sure.
I developed some shine but only after about 4 hours.  This makeup lasts on me as long as the Vincent Longo blush does - about 14 hours in cold weather.  That's all I've got to test it in, it will be interesting to see how it will do in Georgia's hot, humid summers.

7172	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This offers just coverage in areas that have blonded out from sun in my naturally red hair. My hair looks like it's 'real' color for a few days after I use. Usually a week after treatment I notice it looks too blond again. Feels very soft after.
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!

654	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	good
9707	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It  is a great moisturizer for the face. I just received this cream this morning. It goes on easy and spreads a lot. My face feel well moisturized after about a half hour. I looked up niacin cream and found that there are studies by dermatologists that show that cream with niacin or Vitamin B3 in it is great for moisturizing, that is better than Vaseline. Also that after eight weeks use, it does reduce wrinkles. I am 71 years old and have good genes so I do not have many wrinkles, but I will use if for 8 weeks and see if there is an improvement. In the studies, they found that it  may be a good product to use to help prevent skin cancer but more studies are needed to verify this. I do have a lot of precancer spots that I have had frozen off so I am hoping that this can be proven.
1527	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the color..easy to paint on and easy to remove when ready
2977	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'd like to start by mentioning that the older reviews are for a sample size kit, not the full size kit that is currently offered. I'm not sure why the two share the same space, but the older comments may not be accurate.
9081	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	First off, I am loving all these reviews about burnt hair. If you haven't used this before- don't start on the hottest setting! Try and start on the lowest and work your way up. I have really long hair and curls normally do not stick well with any other curling iron. I use the hottest setting on my hair and my curls hold all day and then some. I don't use any product and I normally just let my hair air dry. Because I've been using this for years, I use it on the hottest setting and know how long to keep it in for. The only reason I do not rate this 5 stars is I always have to replace mine every year or two. It gets super squeaky in the spring and it hurts my ears, and it breaks really easily if you drop it (I have tile floors). But it works great....

940	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was thrilled to find this blush on Amazon, since I can't find it where I now live. The powder is fine and light, with very good pigmentation. It goes on evenly and lasts about as long as any powder blush usually does. I find the color (fair skin, blue undertones, copper hair) mimics the perfect flush for me. I'll keep buying this as long as they make it, and probably stock up if it gets discontinued.
4527	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was happy to receive this product and surprised by how great it is! Often, facial masks are either too thick or too thin and ineffective. This one was just right. first of all, it goes on smooth without an awful green or blue hue which is hard to get off. It is an off white, which leaves no residue even though it gets tight when dries. It rinces of easily and leaves your skin taut and clean but not tight. I like it on days when I have a late night and not enough sleep because it leave you looking refreshed. A really great product--the packages is slick and cool as well.

8498	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my all-time favorite facial moisturizer. It is so light and smooth. Not sure why it's called buttermilk, since there's no butter or milk in it, but, whatever. I was bummed at the small bottle size until I started using it and realized I only need a very small amount each time. So, it's lasts a long time for such a small bottle. FYI: I have very fair, sensitive skin (and very young looking 53 years old).
Because of the price, I'll only be using this for a weekly intense conditioning.  It does its job, and it does it very well.

This product has the alpha hydroxy acid as an active ingredient. This is common in exfoliation, peel products. I was unable to locate the concentration data. Presumably, for this sensitive formulation, its rather low.
I have this advice for use; pat a very small amount under the eyes. It truly doesn't take much!  Think of it as a therapeutic cream rather than a moisturizer.  If you use a large amount, it will cause the skin to be dry and peely. After application I always apply a moisturizer over it.  This isn't moisturizer-yet unwilling still need to use a moisturizer or gentle eye cream.
3590	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My husband has cystic acne and said its the BEST hes ever used even over prescription meds. He uses it 2X a day and his skin looks amazing!
1931	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was looking a finish like this for a long time. It's just what I want!!! Little bit pink and transparent.
6484	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	great

6337	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I fly a lot and my skin really dries out in airplanes. This product has been pretty perfect for toting along on flights - it's small enough for TSA standards, and when I use it in flight, the oil absorbs quickly into my skin without being sticky, goopy or shiny. It's a bit pricey to use for everyday at home, but Mario Badescu is, after all, a high-profile name in skin care. Beyond, that, it works really well for when and where I need it most.
7581	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It's okay. Not that impressed- even though it is Dr. recommended.
7806	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I got this for my husband about a minute before he decided to grow his beard out. As a result I have been using it on my legs and it works well. No post shaving irritation or bumps. I find the perfume a bit much, not that it is too masculine ( that would be ok), just that it is pretty strong. I use more on my legs than you would on a face so it doesn't last long. Overall, a very pleasant experience.
It will last all day, the only draw back, it will wash off if your hair gets too wet.  It is also best to use hair spray to keep it in place.
5799	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Sexy glossy look! Love the soft color, very hydrating
5349	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My fine lines are vanishing!
8190	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Just fabulous as are all  the Butter London Products I have purchased. Great base for polish and very interesting if you just want a sheer,clear coat.
2783	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great shaving cream, nice scent, thick texture, leathers up fast.
5285	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Favorite sunscreen ever!!  Love this stuff.
1519	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like this product.does a good job.
If you are looking for a gift, this is a nice package.  If you are looking for yourself, get the moisturizer from Batxer and get the other items elsewhere.
9460	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great lip gloss -- almost a lip stain -- but it does not dry out your lips.  I am a lipstick addict always looking for the perfect color and texture.
3378	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been buying this product for years! I never use a top coat anymore, just a few drops of this. Can be a bit messy but it doesn't visually dry to the skin around my toenails and it lasts! I have never used it on my fingers so I don't know how well the wearablilty is. I have a little bottle that has a dropper that I just refill, so I would definitely recommend getting a bottle with a dropper and having this one as a refill or just getting the dropper to use with this bottle.
6576	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this! It smells so amazing!
7875	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've recently discovered that my thick hair was starting to fall out around the bangs area.  Through the tears I decided to try different products to see which was the best for me.  I tried tinted dry shampoo, root touch up spray and Toppik.  The root touch up spray was just ok, I felt that I had to spray paint on my head.  It does cover grays roots very well!  Tinted dry shampoo was better and passable,  I did't like the feel of it though plus you have to brush a lot of the dust out. Toppik was my favorite of the 3 by far.  It covered well and blended in nicely with my hair color.  This is what I'll be using!

7529	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Not a huge fan.  I don't like the smell of this cream.  It is rich and works OK, but I prefer other products that I currently have/use.  This one I used on really dry skin and it kinda burned.  I will not use it again.
4939	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the mineral foundation.  It feels like there is nothing on my face.  Jane Iredale had really nice make up.  The only dra.wback is you need to know the color to want.  I purchased this shade because I am very fair with blonde hair.  It works well with some bronzer and blush mineral powder.  I might go just a shade darker next time.  But, really this color is perfect
2320	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite base coat ; makes my nails look healthy and pink.

7484	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have thick short hair thats not easy to manage, as its turning grey the dryness is getting worse so I've been looking for a product that softens while keeping it manageable, CHI Silk Infusion is easy to apply and works keeping my hair soft and easy to manage, it smells good too with a clean mild scent. I always add to my hair right after washing but have applyed to my dry hair still getting good results.
3280	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Ridiculously hard to use.  Practically have to chip it out of the jar and there's no way to get it evenly throughout my hair.  Even if I comb it through I find hard lumps all day.  Pretty strong hold, though.  I moved down to the PASTE pomade, which seems to be more maleable.
2864	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I don't use much make up, only lip gloss and a bit eye shadow. A makeup artist friend told me I need primer to keep shadow in place longer. This is grrrreat primer. Very light, not greasy. Goes on smooth with a bit shimmer. And it is least toxic one I could find. If you are sensitive to common makeup or can't wear much eye makeup, I'd recommend this primer for you.
You just may want to purchase Nail Envy from a local beauty supply store unless you can find a better provider via Amazon.  It's worth every penny.
1402	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Marvis-Classic-Strong-Mint-Toothpaste/dp/B000J56ZZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Marvis Classic Strong Mint Toothpaste</a>&nbsp;for more than a year now, and I really love what it does for my teeth and breath.
It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat. I've even tried holding spray and it will work but I personally have to gel my hair so hard that it's not favorable all the time. Those are the only downsides. Take it from me and my friends..it works and its amazing :)
6019	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It is useful as it described.
3377	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Don't get the hype surrounding this brand of nail polish. I put it on my toes and it didn't last three days before showing signs of wear and chips. I usually use a drugstore brand that is a 3rd of the price (cheaper), and that stuff stays put. This is just overpriced and not very durable.
SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.

2816	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my husbands favorite deodorant! He has tried them ALL and after reading about this one in a sports magazine he gave it a try and hasn't looked back.
6826	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Too drying and not effective.
The only draw back is that if you are looking for a natural ingredient paste, this one is not for you. It seems to have many of the ingredients in a few other well known brands. I wanted this for the flavor as most other brands are boring after so many many many years of brushing.
2738	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm big into skincare, but one item I usually avoid is eye cream, which tend to be heavy and dense. The idea is that the skin around your eyes is so thin and sensitive, the only way to moisturize and reduce the appearance of lines is to overwhelm it with a heavy product. It doesn't work that way on me. I find that a heavy cream near my eyes makes them swell to the point where it's hard to see.
4)  Only requires a dime- to nickel-sized dab, depending on how long and how voluminous your hair is.  More is actually not a good idea.  Causes less shine and less softness in my case.
I didn't realize the moisturizer in this set was the same as the single one I had ordered as well. Ah. Well. I guess I'm just set on facial moisturizers for life. Or maybe I can gift the other one!
9553	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This product is great if you want a natural look (esp if you're middle aged with wrinkles) its quite forgiving to your lines and doesn't accentuate them - you will need a bit of concealer here and there. It's very thick and easily spreadable but I suspect the tube will disappear fast - thinking I might go back to foundation after this is finished - you can mix it with moisturiser for a similar effect
Upon receiving these three products, I developed a system of daily use.  I apply the herbal mint toner at night before bed.  The next morning I use the daily face wash in the shower and then, after drying my hair, I apply a pea-sized amount of the oil-free moisturizer to my cheeks, nose, and forehead.  I've been doing this every day for the past two weeks, and I am pleased to say that I have experienced definite improvement around my nose, which can be so dry and flaky in cold weather that I need to apply moisturizer almost hourly.  Since using this Baxter of California system, I have never had to apply touch-ups throughout the day, and I would say that my dryness has been reduced some 75%.  Meanwhile, I have had only one small pimple since starting this daily regime, and it was closer to my ear in an area I was not regularly treating.  Thus, all in all, I would say that this is a very successful and worthwhile product, particularly if you have skin issues that other products cannot clear up.

7206	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been wearing this shade for years.  It's terrific!
8501	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like products that multitask, as I like a no-fuss morning routine.  Having SPF included in my daily moisturizer is perfect, because I rarely remember to apply SPF for normal work days.  This moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs quickly and smells pleasant.
I think that I might have a sensitivity to some ingredient in it, so my daughter is going to try it out.
Conditioner (1.6 oz)
Nice to know that it also has a high SPF.
6550	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	perfect, ty


5901	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This polish goes on smooth, dries in minutes and keeps a manicure longer than using regular polish (for me one week).
1578	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love Zoya's polishes!  I first tried them a year ago and since then they've won me over with their consistent, easy to apply formulas and wide range of colors and finishes.  If you love blue-green polishes and subtle shimmer, Selene is a beautiful polish.  It's a pretty teal with a micronized metallic pearl finish.  If you're looking for an ocean/water inspired polish, especially for a pedicure for the beach, this is perfect.
3027	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Lightweight formula is just enough moisturizer for my face so it doesn't dry out and doesn't clog the pores.
The wife tried the Phytokeratine extreme, She also loved it, said her hair had more bounce and shine.
You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.
5601	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product, great price and fast shipping!
5015	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A bit pricey but when I put this on my ancient feet, they feel young again.  Daily applications keep me sandal-ready so I don't have to hide my elderly toes and heels in socks and shoes.  Very good stuff.
Not criticizing the product, I did give it 5 stars, just not a save-all. I'd say incorporate it into the routine but vary your treatments and keep an open mind. This one is a little strong for daily. I'd say it's a good 1-2x week routine for the face.
If you are looking for a quality iron that will last a LONG time and won't leave you penniless, this is worth it. Only a few bucks more than the generic cheap equivalents, and it will work like a horse and leave you looking gorgeous.
4524	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	When I ordered this mask, I didn't realize it was a men's facial mask. I tried it anyway and I liked it. For reference, I have combination skin, that has larger pores in the T-zone and I get dry skin outside the T-zone. This mask worked great. For my skin type I need to do a cleansing/drawing mask at least once or twice a month.
6462	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very very very sensitive, oily skin prone to redness. This has replaced all other cleansers because it does what its meant to do, and DOES NOT STRIP THE OIL. My skin is balanced and clear, and as with all Mario Badescu products, this is the absolute end-all for me in terms of comfort. Zero irritation. Trying new face products is always a gamble for me, but not anymore. Im 26 and have been hunting since I was 13 for the right skincare line. Finally found it!
9669	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	very good cream
8729	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the nicest soaps I have used. It smells great and delivers a deep down clean. It also removes all smells that you don't want. It is gently though. Great buy!
AQUA / WATER
5820	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Jan Marini Transformation Cream for about 5 years now, as recommended by my aesthetician. It is truly a product that rejuvenates the skin and makes my skin look younger and gives it a fresher, more "glowing" appearance. I gets lots of compliments on my skin and I feel that Jan Marini is one of the reasons. It's worth every penny. I no longer waste my money on department store cosmetics that do nothing to stimulate the collagen, etc. Jan Marini gives proven results!
1064	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This setting powder has a big role in my every morning make up routine. After applying liquid foundation I apply this setting powder which helps my skin look more matte and smooth without interfering with the foundation color and is a perfect base for my blush. It helps to blend in my blush seamlessly. I have used different brands of translucent setting powders for a long time and honestly I do not see a huge difference between them. But if it doesn't cause irritation or my face does not look like a ghost, or make it too shiny, it's good for me :)
6511	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I consider myself a beauty guru... I have tried so many things to get my skin to look healthy. I have very dry and sensitive skin. This is the perfect extra pop of moisture or color! It adds the perfect amount of moisture. Some products are so matte that it makes your dry skin worse or shows your dry patches. This brings that perfect amount of glow to your skin without making it look super oily. This does not feel that way. If you have oily skin I'm not sure this would be for you. I use this every day to set my foundation and sometimes at night if my skin feels tight from my face wash.
Over slightly moist skin
Overall the Futur is a beautiful heavy razor that shaves great and seems built to last. I knocked off one star because the adjustable settings are almost useless for my skin type although might be great for others and it could have better grip. Still its the best razor I have used so far. If your looking for an aggressive adjustable razor then this is the best razor you can get, if you have sensitive skin or prefer milder razors then you might not want to spend so much on a razor that you will probably use like a fixed head. I don't regret my purchase one bit and as the saying goes YMMV.
1597	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this shade so much.  It's a perfect neutral taupe shade with a bit of metallic sheen. Gorgeous!
I must admit, I didn't see much change in the first week but as time went on and I became much more thorough with my routine I absolutely loved it.  I had pimples around my chin that were big, red and painful.  Now I don't have hardly any coming up at that time of the month and if I do, they disappear very fast
day 6-no more using the gel. kept my same routine and put vitamin E oil on it twice a day. it was so dark and i ended up calling a dermatologist convinced i made it worst.

5979	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have very sensitive skin and this gives me a reaction, but other than that makes my skin look great
1360	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My hair dresser told me about Toppik's Hair Building Fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  Toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  This illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  If your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  That said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  Just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  For example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  If your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde Toppik.


3762	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Gentle and effective.  I will continue to use this product.
4749	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	We love the Jack Black line. My husband normally uses the All Over wash on his hair and happily agreed to try this. It is similar in affect, in that it leaves his hair clean, freshly scented and moisturized, which he needs since he doesn't use conditioner. He washes his hair at least 5 X's a week and this does not dry out his hair. I do believe it is largely due to the removal of sulfates. The tea tree is a nice addition, promoting hair health/growth. It's hard to comment on how well this thickens since my hubby has short hair, however his hair does look great. This would be a product that he probably wouldn't buy for himself, but I would buy for him during holidays.

9249	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Skin care is of vital importance to overall health. This organic, green apple peel, is a fine product for exfoliation and skin firming.
1310	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	For a few more dollars I could've gotten a much BIGGER bottle!!!!!!!! Content amount is Not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a rip off to buy this item for that amount
4535	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really love this mask.  It's smooth, clean smelling, and produces a nice clean affect.  It does rather remind me of the Clinique clay mask I have used from time to time, only this one is nicer  (it's smoother and doesn't "flake" as it dries).  I love that you can actually still move your face when it's dry.  It's not overly drying, either. And it did help with a breakout issue. I do recommend, even for somewhat sensitive skin like my own.
I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to have smooth looking skin.
813	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	love this product, best moisturizer ever
3571	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love love love! Stops breakouts in their tracks! After day two of using the product my blemishes subsided, after a week's use, my blemishes disappeared altogether. While it's an effective product for blemishes, it is also very effective for more stubborn acne as well. I do find it to be drying so I don't use it daily. I usually pair it with an overnight moisturizer when used at night. During the day, I've used this layered with a moisturizer and makeup.

7551	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice feeling cream.  Definitely not heavy or greasy.  Since it doesn't have sunscreen in it, I use it at night and my face still feels moisturized in the morning.
6691	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	works amazingly. This is my second one. the first one broke after 5 years of use. it makes my hair so shiny...
After I'm done shaving and walk back into air conditioning with this product on my face and head it feels wonderfully icy cold. It's refreshing, with a very light citrus scent that comes from the ingredients as the product is fragrance free. Like their "Hydroplane Slick Shave" Shaved Ice is in my opinion over priced especially for 3.5 oz. The packaging is the same as the Hydroplane shave gel so why the company didn't just put out an 8 oz at the same price point as a companion product is beyond me.

So this lists that it is: Soap-free. Alcohol-free. Colorant-free. pH-balanced. Allergy-tested. Non-comedogenic. Suitable for sensitive skin. Safe for contact lens wearers.
9382	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the color
6269	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this wash! It feels gentle as advertised, but my face feels very clean afterwards. What I love most is the fragrance. I'm not sure what is in it that gives the fragrance, but it's awesome. (BTW, not at all flowery or perfumey)
Love it.
5230	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great! Amazing!!
So dab, blend and glow.
1848	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful color
894	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product to use during the hot summer months. You can use it as part of your regular cleaning or what I like to do, is use it after I come in from the garden, when I'm overheated.
The Soft Water Pomade - is less sticky, but not by much, but it does allow me to mix it with water in my  hands and smooth it throughout my hair. I still can't believe this is for guys...I mean women have pomades. Perhaps it's traditionally a guy thing. (pomades for your pompadour!)

8505	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I expected a heavier cream. With most moisture creams that promise extra help and protection, the cream is thick and sometimes greasy.  Mario Badescu's Moisture Magnet is not.  It goes on easily, I did not feel coated with cream and it blended with makeup.  I also mixed it with a self-tanner which helped smooth out the color and gave it a more natural look.
3565	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	So when I got it initally, I was horrified because it was so liquidy. But I got over it. The whole apply it to your fingertips didn't work for me. Just skip that step. lol. Wash your face. Shake this bottle up, take off the cap, tilt your head back, carefully apply drops to your face and rub it in, taking care to avoid the eye are because it is alcohol based. When I do have breakouts its bad. I get a wave of cystic and regular zits on my jawline and one freaking eyebrow. After washing and patting dry, I shake up the bottle til it looks like milk, tilt my head back, apply drops pretty much all over my face, avoid my eyes, let it dry, then apply the Mario Badedcu drying lotion directly to each of those little bastards. The next day they are still there but signifcantly smaller and not as red. A few days in, they are still there but seeing themselves out of my life. I have combination skin. I don't wear makeup so I cant tell you if you can wear it under makeup. I love applying it right before bed, (sleep on your back or it will come off) and if Im home all day, I can appy this up to 3 times a day. I have not had any issues with peeling.
6184	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Busy mom I like that I can get great quality beauty products without trying to take my kids into the beauty store
9002	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Nice long big barrel for my thick long wavy hair. Easy to use & comfortable. I wish it had an automatic turn off. Pretty sweet tool for the price.
After the cleanser is removed, the first few times I felt a sting, perhaps because my face was finally clean.  Initially I had a breakout and considered stopping use, but again I think this was my skin adjusting to being clean because it went away in about a week and did not come back, even during that awful PMS time.
8699	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This vitamin C packed product is gentle in the face and smells fairly neutral. I'm not sure it is a miracle cure though. The main reason I reduced it by 1 star was because $20 for one fluid ounce is a bit steep in my book. However, if your face is really worth it, go for it.
Highly recommend. Love love love!
5147	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this for about 10 years. This always makes my hair looks so shiny and smooth.

4087	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Awesome for removing eye makeup. I don't use waterproof stuff so I don't know how it works for that, but for regular mascara and liner, it dissolves it like gangbusters, without any greasy residue or irritation. I use it as toner sometimes, too, just to wipe away anything my cleanser might have left behind, or any residue from the cleanser.



-it hides grays between colors
After wearing it for about 15 minutes, I needed to get ready to leave my house, so I went to apply my makeup, which included lip liner and such. I always use the same liner, which is a darker shade than my pale colored lips. But this time, when I went to apply my liner, I noticed my lips actually seemed to be the shame shade as my liner. I thought this odd, since I had no lipstick or anything else on yet that day. Then I remembered the Baxter lip balm I had just applied about 15 minutes prior. It had made my lips look so smooth, with an almost hint of color to them. Not that the balm was colored, but instead it seemed the balm  made my lips have a healthier skin tone to them. This was pretty unexpected. After applying the balm, lips have a pretty nice shine to them.


4442	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this line of products by Vichy. My skin has always been delicate and prone to both breakouts and dryness. It's been especially difficult this fall so far, with my skin immediately both flaking & breaking out as soon as the weather dipped below 80 degrees and the humidity dropped. But I started washing daily with this product (and moisturizing, too) and my skin is so happy with me. Minimal flaking and only one little breakout along my chin (which is more from stress than the product). It gets rid of my mascara, too, so I don't wake up with raccoon eyes in the morning. Love.

1909	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	So cute
Wet and squeeze out the beauty blender, so it is damp.  Then dab the beauty blender into the Dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there.
The pod will look darker than the site & box but it warms into the skin with a brush & will color match.
583	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I am sure after using this product, that it is exactly what it touts to be.  That is a durable, full coverage foundation makeup.  Be sure that that is EXACTLY what you want because that is what you are going to get.
This is a little different then I imagined - comes out almost mousse like though not quite as formed. So, you spray it at your roots but it leaves a white foamy trail that needs to be worked, or combed, in - not a problem but I had imagined a clear liquid like some other root sprays I've used.
23	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm SO glad I decided to try this toothpaste! Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle!

5819	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical about this cream, even though I had read many good reviews.  After 2 weeks of use, my skin was transformed.  Nothing magical, but it evened out my skin tone, my huge pores look slightly smaller, & my skin looks more plump w/a nice glow.  It isn't greasy, which I really like.  Most creams are very greasy.  I have sensitive skin w/slight rosacea on my cheeks & this, I believe, has improved it.  No sensitivity either, like most skin care products.  I was using Kinerase for over 15 years,....but this works just as well, if not better, @ almost 1/2 the price.

3157	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Eau de Rochas is a really pleasant, light perfume.  I like that it isn't a heavy, sweet scent but is a fresh, citrus and floral type of perfume.  When I first smelled the perfume, I wasn't really impressed with it.  However, once applied it is much more pleasant and complex.  It isn't overpowering and simply smells clean and fresh.  My husband noticed I was wearing a new perfume and commented that he really liked it too.
Rich in vitamin E, carotene, phenolic acid and essential fatty acids, argan oil is one of the rarest but most valuable cosmetic ingredients. This turns hair into silk, few small drops is all I need in the morning on freshly washed hair that's still wet or damp, and it vanished instantly, never making my hair greasy or heavy. When I wash it the next day I can still feel the extra softness but it's so marvelous that I tend to use it every day. So far in my life I haven't used an oil based product that vanishes so well, this really leaves no greasy residue whatsoever and the hair feels like spun silk, even my damaged ends feel more light and wispy, sometimes I feel like I cant stop touching my hair, to someone who doesn't know how well this works I might appear to have a disorder where my arm flies up to my hair all the time....
There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

5694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works great to hide thinning hair patches. Just shake on the areas that are thinning. Works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. Also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. Withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. Washes out easily with shampoo and water. Will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. Is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. For it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. Best for concealing small patches. Causes me no irritation and don't even know I'm using it.

Not girly smelling or overly perfumed. You try Baxter once.. well you'll never go back. lol. Get this NOW.
8065	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.

Stayed on for 2-3 days and not messy.  Wish I had found sooner instead of wasting a lot of time trying to cover up back, bald line.  UPDATE:  FORGET THE SPRAY.  It is hard to use, sprayer sticks and substance not good.  Plain air spray just as good, if not better
The case is elegant looking, and the shade Whitney, I have a medium complexion, not too light or too dark.  I love this shade, I find it very flattering.  A not too dark or too light shade of pink.  It also feels very moisturizing on my lips, Iam sure due to Brazil's Cupuacu Butter, and Vitamins A & E.  It is also paraben free.

I went to a new hair salon a couple of months ago and the stylist noticed my skin (of course) and suggested Yu-Be.  She even had a couple of sample tubes for me to try.  Yu-Be is not a medication, but it does have some serious moisturizers and that's good for dry, flaky skin.  Plus, it has a little camphor in it which helps calm that ever-present itch!  The smell of the camphor dissipates very quickly so you don't go around smelling like your grandpa and his arthritis cream.  I will always keep Yu-Be in my skin care basket!
I haven't noticed a thickening of my hair volume as yet, but I've just been using the shampoo for a week. Overall, I'm pleased with the JB Thickening Shampoo but I'm still debating whether it's worth the steep price tag.

To my chagrin, I had to stop using an electric shaver; this helped but I still had some patches of dry skin in areas where I didn't shave, primarily around my left eyebrow.  In order to relieve the situation, I had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night.  Every morning, I used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle (NIVEA Men Sensitive Face Wash).  Still, I had to use a lot of Cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin.

4002	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I wanted to love this. The description sounded just like something Id like and i hoped that the toilette parfum would be light enough to wear to work and not offend anyone. Plus I have used other products from Crabtree and Evelyn and been pleased. Alas, it was not to be. I have a sensitive nose, overly sensitive probably. But this was all kinds of no. No with a capital NUH uh. The was to lavender as banana popsicles are to bananas. I adore a good fresh lavender but this was not a clear astringent lavender, it was a chemical maelstrom of lavender. It has a heavy alcohol top note, which is to be expected with a toilette water but it hung on much longer than I wanted, but the powdery middle note was just odd and it lasted much too long in that middle range of too strong to be two hours old. Then the bottom note is too much Grandmas hankie drawer for me, though it was more in the muted range I expected.

Try it you won't be sorry.
However, an important fact to remember:  on the label, it states "avoid inhalation."  If used extensively with each application, be sure to wear a dust mask.  The tiny fibers will irritate your nasal passages.

Yesterday I was out for a walk qith my partner of 30 years and a friend.  While I was walking in front of them my partner said "What did you do to your hair?"  I cringed.  I thought that he had noticed that I had put something on it and it showed.  I aksed him what he meant.  He said that my bald spot was gone.  He then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair.  He could not tell what I had done, but my bald spot was gone.  My friend touched it and said that it was soft.  If I could fool them I could fool anyone.  Even looking for it they couldn't tell.
The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.

6830	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical trying this.  I originally saw this on a yahoo article where they reposted one of Kylie Jenner's Instagram posts talking about how she uses the drying lotion to keep her skin clear.  For the first time ever....I've found something that actually does what it says it does.  You can put dots of this lotion on pretty much anything you don't want on your face and after several applications it will literally disappear. Example: I have small little wart looking things on my hair line which are basically filled with oil. My dermatologist said to get rid of them they would take a wire looking device and apply it to the spots to essentially burn them off my face.  No thanks!  I used this drying lotion on them and its been about a week and a half now and they're almost completely gone!!  What can I say??? The stuff is GOLD!  Like other reviewers said, don't shake the bottle. Let it settle and leave it.  Take a qtip and stick it all the way into the bottle.  The qtip picks up the pink stuff and the clear medicine in one swoop.  Just use the qtip to "dot" your pimple(s) and within 48 hours they vanish.  Some spots take a longer treatment and keep away from eye area.
3549	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm happy with this Mario Badescu Acne Facial Wash. You get a lot of product for your money as a little bit goes a long way. It does not foam like other cleansers. For a deeper clean leave on for a few minutes before rinsing  (salicylic acid is not high on the ingredients list, so it's not a main. Ingredient). After use my skin feels very clean and soft. I will definitely buy again.
499	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Excellent coverage and really blends in well.  It can be a bit hard, though, whether using a finger or a sponge.  I rub a little bit between my fingers before applying and that seems to work better for me.  If I get it on right, it looks flawless.
Smell: it smells like sulfur which if you have never used it, can smell like rotten eggs or a book of matches. If you are used to sulfur, it shouldn't be a huge deal. I personally have a sensitive nose, my friends call me the hound, I can tell you what you ate for breakfast. I also suffer from headaches caused by scents. That being said, the smell doesn't bother me, and no one has ever complained about it to me, but it does last a while. Some people smell the ichthammol in this, which smells like car tires or something similar. That is the runny brown stuff that may separate and sit at the top which a few people have had issues with. (Mario says just stir it up). I've never seen it separating though personally.

2920	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Another fine (but expensive) product for men from Jack Black. This has a more subdued but no less pleasant aroma compared with their heavily mentholated turbo body wash.

White setting powder does make one's skin look a shade or two lighter than the underlying foundation, but I like that effect very much.  The powder takes the shine off, and keeps it off for hours.  This product meets and exceeds every hope I had for it.  Highly recommend.

Their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly  even without getting it directly in them, just in the normal course of washing my face.  It also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but I couldn't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture.  I swear my skin would make a squeaking noise when I rubbed my finger over it after using this.
Highly recommended.

A couple of months ago I decided to try Toppik after my barber recommended it.  It has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  I've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  I never told anyone what I was doing.  People kept asking me if I had just gotten a haircut.  They knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.
The lasting power is pretty good. I seem to chip my right pointer finger no matter what except for when I had a pro apply this. I'll change this to a five-star review if I can get that finger to last more than 2 days.

I let it dry without any clothes for a few minutes then put on a large loose T shirt and large sweatpants for an hour or so to avoid crease lines and sweat marks in the product while it dries. The smell is very faint but the tan will be darker if you don't wash off the guide color. A light white lotion like Lubriderm will keep the skin moisturized and lock in the color-apply after a few hours. Shower the next day and your color will remain.
Color is actually a more red orange.

Manicures last about one week if I am not doing a lot of house cleaning. It is offered in this smaller bottle as well as a huge round bottle, have both and the smaller one is much more convenient  to lug to the nail salon. For some reason this topcoat hides any nail imperfections, such as white marks or small ridges... A must have for any lady or gent looking to have beautiful natural shiny nails. Enjoy!

1763	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have medium yellowish-olive skin tone which has been difficult to find a neutral.  This shade "Tea and Crumpets" is beautiful!  I was looking for a color that would match as closely as possible to my natural nail bed color, and I was not having any luck!  Finally I went less pink, more neutral/tan, and this is so flattering!  Contrary to what I thought, it's lighter than my skin tone, and it actually brightens my fingers.  I mistakenly thought lighter colors would darken my skin, but this is a *splendid* exception.  (nice word - splendid)  It's definitely a frost, and I find it streaks a little, but I'm not a professional, so that's fine for me.  I'm just thrilled to death I finally found a color that isn't goth or weird or screaming for attention.  I like subtle and refined, and this is it!  It's so pretty!

I applied it using the directions on Dermablend's website.  The suggest starting with a small amount of product, warming it up with your fingertips to make the product more bendable, and then tapping it directly over your imperfections.  They state you can use multiple layers by allowing one layer to dry and applying more, but thankfully one layer has been perfect for me.  Then you finish things off by applying setting powder, allow to set for 2 minutes then brush off excess powder with a brush.  Dermablend makes its own setting powder but I don't own it so I've been setting my makeup with Laura Mercier and Hourglass's powders instead, and have liked the results with both.

3067	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this off and on for the past week and my skin just loves it.  I find it best used after my nightly shower.  It really gets absorbed and seems to lock in moisture. When I get up in morning my face looks smoother and more refreshed.  I also like that it isn't sticky or thick and seems to work with my skin unlike other oils which seem to clog my pores.  The marine oil has a faint herbal scent that is sort of more masculine opposed to a citrus or flowery scent which is not off putting and which I like.  I did try using it in the morning and let is soak in my face before using my BB Cream.  But this was a bad combination.  The oil actually separated the BB Cream and probably would do the same with any foundation or concealer you might use.  I think this is because although it is light there is still a oil barrier on the surface or you face that the make up does not mix well with.  So perhaps this oil does not completely absorb but locks in moisture, preventing it from leaving.  It might be a good idea to use my facial regime/ treatment such as cleaning, moisturizing and any serums first then at this oil last to lock everything in.

These irons come with two extra springs...I didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but I'm very happy the extras are included. (We've had to replace the springs in other curling irons I've owned through the years. It was never easy to find a replacement spring). The temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & I'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. I have a favorite setting.  I marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so I'd know which setting to use. Although these curling irons get very, very hot I do not & will not use the higher settings. For goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. FYI: My hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. Thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, I don't have long layers, and I was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. Anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. I've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  I use the #7 temperature. It's the first setting on the 'Extra Hot' category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1" size.

Also, I don't recommend using this product on a daily basis, perhaps every other day.

5179	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a very nice, creamy moisturizer which does live up to its 'rich' name, and is a good cream during the winter months. Despite being thick and moisturizing, I've had no issues using it during the day (though it doesn't have any sunscreen in it) - it helps with the dry, cold weather affecting my skin and doesn't bother my makeup at all. The only thing is this is a VERY small jar of makeup. It is lasting me a good while because this is such a creamy, potent moisturizer, but be aware that this is less than an ounce of product (that 2.4 ounces is mostly the glass jar). It's a small size so good for traveling, but not for a long-term product. Hence why it doesn't cost much. Still, this is helping with dry skin and hasn't caused any adverse reactions.

2561	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The scent is light and nice, vanilla I think. The conditioner is very thick and sticks to the spatula like frosting. I used it on my dry hair, covered it with a shower cap and a towel for heat. After 20 minutes I rinsed, my hair was detangled, clean and soft. It is not greasy and does not leave any heavy deposits on my hair  to weigh it down. My hair is colored, fine and partially greying. The directions state it can be used on wet hair and even as a leave in conditioner. When I rubbed a small amount of the conditioner between my fingers it disappeared like moisturizer without any greasy residue. It is definitely a luxury beauty item and has the price that goes with it.

Smear it all over your face and neck in an upward manner and go to bed. It's as simple as that.

1397	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  It does exactly as it says.  It covers your balding spots and makes your hair appear fuller.  If you are losing hair but still have some strands of hair that this product can cling to, then this is for you.  If you attempt to put this product on bald skin, then forget it, you will look ridiculous.  This product needs some hair to cling to and believe me, it will appear fuller and no one will be able to tell. You can comb your hair after putting this on, but don't rub your head too much or else it will come off little by little.  But it beats buying a hair piece or hair transplant.
6488	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Finally had the opportunity to try this trendy new beautiful product. I am very happy with my purchase. The dual bottles you receive in this package are a good size AND the product is fantastic. Roses smell good anyways, add in those extra nice ingredients and you have a great product. Not sure about using it under my makeup, but definitely love it as a moisturizer!


6877	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I recently got the worst adult acne on my back and face I have ever had.  I apply this with a Q-Tip on the affected areas after either I tone with pure rubbing alcohol or witch hazel.  (Usually back, chest and cheeks), wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed.  The smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares!  This really dries out active pimples and "opens up" under the skin cysts. I have noticed even when I use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down, but the surrounding areas will break out less often.  Maybe it's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne?  Either way it's DEFINITELY not a cure-all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you're dealing with an all out attack, this helps tremendously.

Third.  Full method.  Pre shave.  Brush.  After shave.  Results excellent.  My closest shave ever, with an electric razor.  More like a blade shave.
2644	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	When I read the description of this perfume, I thought it sounded so yummy.  It isn't.  The only thing the description got right was that it smelled of amber.  I was excited when I opened the box and pulled out this beautiful bottle, filled with a perfume the color of honey.  I opened the lid, took a sniff, and WOW it smelled just awful!  Still, I thought, it may smell better on.  It didn't.  It reeks.  It smelled so bad I had to jump in the shower and throw my clothes in the washer to get that smell away from my nose and to avoid offending other noses.

5210	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Since I faithfully use cream on my face twice a day, in the morning under my makeup and in the evening after I wash my face, I decided to try this product. I was pleasantly surprised. It has a thick consistency with a slight scent. It goes on nice and smooth and a small amount goes a long way. I have used it a few times now and it has left my skin feeling pretty soft but not greasy. Also, I like the fact that it does not leave a film on my skin. I would recommend this product.

3570	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This has seriously cleared my acne up by like 90% for the first few days it got worse but I kept using it and now I have only a few pimples here and there. I decided to buy a few more bottles for when I run out.
355	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used many Dermablend products in the past and now and this brand only gets better!  This cover crme works great in covering marks or acne for me.

You can't go wrong with Dermablend products!

8981	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Really like using it. It heats up fast, has a good maount of heating settings and is easy to use.

(Occasionally I read comments where guys have cut themselves a lot and blaming either the razor or the blade or the soap. Yes, it may be a razor/blade combination, though I have yet to experience problems with that, but it can also be trying to use a blade beyond its useful life or not using the right angle. I did notice that my very first blade started getting a tad harsh after a few nice shaves - I just have to adjust to the idea of replacing them more often. They certainly are cheap enough.)
My only reservation about the product is all the multisyllabic chemical ingredients in this.  I hope they're safe for people and for the environment because it's one of the best leave-in treatments I've found for my frizzy grey hair.
6240	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product for the control of  Rosacea.  Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.
9559	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice moisturizer as well as a foundation/base if you choose to use it that way. It does dry a little quickly and start to smear or cake up a bit if you take a lot of time to apply it like you would an actual foundation or base, but if you apply it quickly like you would a regular untinted moisturizer, it is fine. You can wear it out alone and it provides coverage as well as sun protection while moisturizing, or you can put some powder on over it for even more coverage.

4489	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff smells so good; it's a pleasure to use. On top of that it really works. After a couple of wipes, my cotton square came out clean. My face felt clean but didn't feel tight or pulled.
Now, many people say with a new product there may be a "purging" stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter. So far my "purge" is the worst my acne has ever looked and is emerging in places I've never had acne. How can that be? One thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge, but explain the logic behind acne on parts of my face never seen? My face has been completely ravaged and I'm on my 2nd month.

2. it doesn't come with an applicator brush or sponge (for the price, I think that's ridiculous)
867	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Refreshing way to apply toner before moisturizer.  Waiting for it to dry 3 minutes just adds another step to the make up routine but if that does not bother you the product is fine. I leave a bottle in my guest bathroom for a cool down spritz for my lady friends who have their own personal summer. Keeping skin healthy and hydrated year round is a challenge and this spray seems to help.
Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.
857	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff!  Very refreshing and soothes my dry skin.  I know a lot of people complain it's just expensive water but splashing water on my face never it made it feel as good as this. I will definitely purchase again!
Personally I don't feel a few drops a day will harm me but I will keep trying more chemical free products to see what works for me. I did like the product but was disappointed in how it was labeled.  I'll have to think if I'll buy it or not.
1811	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	GREAT!!! I will use this seller again.
6221	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great moisturizer that is not to heavy or light. When I use a lot of moisturizers they ither cause me to have styes because they are too rich or they are to light and my skin has dry spots. I suggest using the scooper that comes with it for measurement reasons. Fill the concave area and scrape it flush on the top edge and it gives you just the right amount to use on face and neck. Does not irritate my skin at all.
BUT...something seriously needs to be done with the labeling.  For the life of me I could not read the tiny print on the back of the bottle.  I looked on the box, but no instructions were written on the box, got out my reading glasses and nothing seemed to work...I went with 'instinct' when using for the first time because I was tired and didn't want to dig out my computer to figure out directions.

It's good stuff, but two things of note:  it has a strong mint smell (similar to Aveda's Rosemary Mint shampoo) which put me off a bit as it clashed with my fragrance.  The other thing was the extremely tiny printed instructions that I simply could not read.  It wasn't so much they were small but the font was awkward shaped with a blue background that made it impossible to read.  Maybe I need to buy some bifocals or something.  But if you are interested in knowing ingredients and details, good luck with that....this is hard to read!

I did find a little settling, but using the application method that I outlined it is minimal compared to other brands.
I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.
3842	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Finally! An aerosol dry shampoo spray that you don't have to shake for 2 minutes and still gets clogged beyond repair when it's half full.  And it smells good, and is not super cloying?  I am sold!  I really love this dry shampoo.  It is great for touching up my blunt cut bangs when they are starting to look a little greasy but the rest of my hair looks good.  Or, a little spritz at the roots after a workout.  It also absorbs well into my hair and doesn't leave a white, ashy look where you've applied.
2162	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	For a long time I was looking around for a cheaper better shave and ran across this.

You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.
Perfume tastes vary, as do how they interact with each individual person's chemistry and while I think it's a nice perfume (for this type of scent), it isn't something I would purchase for myself. It would make a nice gift.

4918	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am very happy with this Mario Badescu Silver powder. The product can be messy, I have found using a flat makeup brush helps with the application process. Make sure to wear old clothes as the product turns back to powder during drying. The amount of product is great for the money. It works just as expected for both my son and myself, drawing out his blackheads, and my under the skin bumps. Follow the directions using an astringent to remove the powder. We have been using this twice a week for about 3 weeks now and love the results.

I beat up my hands (I'm an artist and a cook and I work constructing sets sometimes) So, my hands get BEAT UP. This nail polish really lasts. I will say it does this weird thing where it crackles in a way that doesn't chip the polish which is great even though looks a little funny. That took a long time to happen though.

She Uses it particularly in the winter when her skin becomes more dry. She paid a lot more for her Creme, than I did. I found it on Amazon, and was very pleased at the price.

But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this.

8931	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This smells and feels just the way I was hoping it would: lovely delicate rose scent and cool and silky on the skin. I love to close my eyes and spray it all over my face in the mornings. It doesn't feel greasy or oily and makes my skin feel so soft. It also has a very fine mist, which is perfect for this type of product. I use it throughout the day as well. Living in Arizona with hot sun and low humidity, my skin gets parched and this feels as if I gave my skin a cool glass of water to drink.
This hits a lot of things right for men.
The wash is a gel and becomes foamy once you start massaging it in.  A little goes a long way, so although this is a small bottle I have been using it for a couple of months now.
6988	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff works!  I've had problems with other moisturizers making my eyes water when I apply them around my eyes.  Juice Beauty doesn't do this but what it does do is a great job at smoothing out fine lines.  Besides applying it around my eyes I also put it on my hands which seem to be aging more quickly than my face (probably because I usually sun defying products on my face but not my hands).  The result was that it smoothed out my skin texture very quickly and for quite awhile even though I washed my hands several times.  Despite this they remained smoother for at least four hours.  There's a very slight smell when you first dispense the product but it fades quickly.  It also sinks into your skin fast.  It has a handy pump delivery system with a lid that clicks in place to prevent spills.  The only slight problem I have with the product is that it's difficult to dispense a super small amount but there are always other body parts where you can apply the excess.  I'm also prone to break outs but didn't have that issue with Juice Beauty.  To sum up it's effective, lasts for quite awhile, and a little goes a long way.
I am super pleased with this makeup and super happy I picked the right color the first time around. The photos I've included with the makeup are before I put a setting powder - it's just the Dermablend blended with my fingertip. One of the pictures has a shadow from my phone, but I think you can still see the difference.

Ingredient Insights;
I'm glad I didn't give up finding the perfect color because I love the natural look it gives me.
 My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.
6379	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I wish I had heard about this product earlier. Since about 11, I have been on a mission for something that helps all the red dots and bumps on my body, gently cleanses, is ok for my sensitive skin, and that I can use daily. This is it. Being a product junky and having been disappointed many times over the years, I can actually say this is hands down, the best body wash I have ever used.
8944	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is seriously a spray that you need. I have combination skin. During summer I get very oily and I need to moisturize my skin before applying makeup. But regular moisturizers make me oily thought the day, so I use this. Didn't get oily but my skin still feels hydrated. Love the scent as well. Great for setting makeup! And if you feel a bit dry throughout the day this is a great thing to use.
Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.
7292	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I have combination skin and a little redness/rosacea going on. The color warm sienna took care of the redness, but got very oily in the T-zone. So, I bought the Absence oil control to wear under the makeup. The Absence makes the color whiter, as it is white and doesn't control the oil enough. Absence is very hard to apply too little does nothing, too much, it looks white and adds flaking......I'm not too happy
5472	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works great.
I received my sample free through Amazon's vine program.  With a choice, I would have ordered scented.  My wife doesn't like the unscented. If you are fortunate enough to be able to afford this shave cream on a regular basis, or give as a gift, it's really an excellent product.  I was surprised at the close shave I received.  If your shaving schedule is tight, the pre shave only will allow a fast shave, and does an excellent job of preparing your face for the shave.
Overall, I'm happy with this for a body sunscreen and would consider purchasing it again.
Or sheer it out with a damp beauty blender and a drop of facial oil
It does feel pleasant and silky, and it does seem to allow skin to breathe.  I think it may give foundation a bit of added staying power.  However, it does not deliver the total porelessness that I would need to see in order to pay this price for a primer.
My problem with the Dermablend is this- it has sunscreen in it.  Many times when wearing this level of foundation, there is a special occasion involved.  That usually means photos will be taken.  Sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film.  It will look white, or off color in certain light as well.  You can use this at home and think it looks perfect, but in some light it can look really off.
426	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love, love, love this stuff. The color is a little darker than expected, but the coverage is just excellent. It's on the heavier side, so it's not every day makeup for me, but it's perfect for a special occasion. It covers so well and feels great going on the skin. It's long lasting, too.

7730	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this! I really like that you can put it on your lip/eye area too as it eliminates a couple steps. I use it every morning and sometimes at night (for night I alternate this, the Vitamin C serum, the Glycolic Gel, and the Rosehips Nourishing Oil depending on what kind of skin issues I'm having). It goes on really light and absorbs quickly and leaves me with super smooth glowy skin.

8986	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The best value for rose water spray! I use this to hydrate my face and it gives me a fresh glow when I mist it over my makeup. The scent is not too overpowering and does not cause any problems for my quasi-sensitive skin.
3931	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Smells clean and fresh.  Unisex. The scent of the soap is similar to C & E La Source.  No flowers (thankfully) just the aroma of the waves, salt air, and sunshine.
8636	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Yes its $20 but I spend more on miller lite in 1 happy hour and this bottle lasts a few months. It doesn't have any harsh chemicals so its great for my sensitive skin. Their gentle skin cleanser is ok but I like this exfoliater better because it seems to scrub off more dead skin cells and prevent more ingrown hairs. Sometimes it makes my forehead dry if I scrub too much so be careful. If you're looking to prevent zits- I've found stress and diet (no greasy/oily/sugary foods or dairy products!) have more of an effect than face wash in my case. Just try eating healthy/clean for a week or 2 and you'll notice clearer skin!
8078	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  It gives me so much confidence when I go out in public.  It covers thinning areas very well.  I would recommend this to anyone who is thinning and can not pay for a hair transplant.

1057	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I shared this product with an aspiring actress friend of mine who is always auditioning. She loves it! The setting powder is added after you've applied foundation to "set" it and keep your look for most of the day. Though it looks albino-white in the compact, once applied with a brush or a pad, it blends well with any shade of makeup and gives your complexion a nice smoothness that lasts. The powder sponge was OK but a professional make up brush does much better. Since applying the powder creates an additional step in your makeup routine, it may be best used for weekends and special occasions when you want just the perfect makeup finish.

2393	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Obsession has been around since the 80's, and it smells like it too. That's not a bad thing, I rather enjoyed most of the powerhouse fragrances like this, be it for men or women. Obsession is one of those fragrances marketed for women, but men can easily wear this one too. The scent is one that sticks with you like an old friend, and it is a unique, memorable one. The longevity and strength of this doesn't seem quite the same as it was in the 80's though. I'm afraid this one seems to have seen some reformulation sometime, though I can't prove it. It just doesn't quite have the same vibe it did back then. It's still a great fragrance though.

My only complaint is that it goes by WAAAY too fast and I have a ton of the pink stuff left at the bottom of the bottle but none of the alcohol liquid that sits on top of it. (So I have squired witch hazel and rubbing alcohol in it to make it last, it still seems to work this way)

Please note that this contains willow bark extract, so it has some salicylic acid in it.  Keep this in mind if you are allergic or sensitive to aspirin.  Salicylic acid is wonderful (for me, at least) for clearing up blemishes and breakouts and I feel this product helped with that.  You will probably want to wear sunscreen if using this product because of the willow bark extract; this serum does also contain some antioxidants which will help with sun damage (for example, from the black tea leaf extract and grape juice).

8105	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is just a terrific product which doesn't feel like the typical "product" (i.e. hair gel) at all.  Using just a light touch with it and combing it into wet hair directly after showering, I found it provided a light but useful hold without even a hint of the shiny, plasticky feel of other gels.  This pomade provided a completely natural, plain-hair look and a soft, natural hair-feeling hold, far preferable to the sticky or over-rigid feel of more aggressive products.  Recommended.

After months of thinking about an incredibly large skin care purchase, I splurged and purchased the StriVectin-SD cream. If you have ever gained and lost weight or have been pregnant, then you know that you can get stretch marks and they never seem to go away. How do you heal your skin so they literally disappear? Well, to start with, you need a cream that will produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Especially as Summer is approaching.

1499	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I bought the color Prim and it's a beautiful steel blue color. The formula isn't too thick or thin, glides on the nail smoothly, and is opaque in 1 coat. I can't describe how easily it glides on the nail. But I have to give it 4 stars though since thick coats can pool a bit and is prone to brush strokes so if you want it perfect you might have to be a bit more careful with application. It's a fantastic nail polish though and absolutely beautiful addition to my nail polish collection.
5965	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've read the other reviewers' comments, and all are 'correct' however, here are a few things one needs to know before purchasing. If you thought this would look like the bottle all by itself, with a standard one or two coats, you'll be disappointed.  This polish is best used with other colors, or if alone, more than two coats.
1170	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I don't know why I wait until the hyperpigmentation comes back to order this. I have been ordering about one bottle per year, and it lasts a little less than that, because I generally don't need to use it for a few months. This stuff works. Hyperpigmentation, melasma, these things will lighten gradually, but noticably with days. When if first receive it, I use it 3-4 times per day, rather than the manufacturer's recommended twice per day, and within four days, my face is peeling slightly, and very dry (I am normally quite oily). This discomfort is manageable with a moisturizer, and worth the visible lightening within one to two weeks. This contains 2% hydroquinone + kojic acid and azeliac acid. HQ + kojic acid have been clinically shown to work better together than either one separately (always look for peer-reviewed research by medical doctors). You MUST wear a UVA/UVB sunscreen with this product (just as you must after the fraxil laser treatments) or your hyper-pigmentation will return within days. My melasma looked like I put on a mask of too-dark foundation, from my upper lip to my jaw line, and the texture was almost leathery. With my last bottle, after using this product for about ten days, even my critical teen noticed that the contrast was considerably lessened and the leathery texture is gone (this is also a symptom of melasma). I do initially get a pinkish quality to my skin, but I don't mind since I am a bit olive-skinned. Once my skin gets used to it, it won't feel irritated and dry, and I will reduce my use to twice, and then once, per day.
4473	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Not bad for a 3-in-1 product. I use it basically as a facial cleansing wash, for which it works well. It's a little thicker/heavier-feeling than my normal cleanser, but it does the job.
3955	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the largest size body lotion I have seen from Crabtree and Evelyn, and the best value. The jojoba has a nice scent, it smells clean and fresh.

I layer it on as an accent nail ; using a pale color for the first coat, layers of Servin' Up Sparkle  two layers of top coat. The result looks like diamonds encased in glass. It's a wow kind of effect .

295	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Good buy
The application isn't as impressive. The brush doesn't fan out like my favorite nail polishes. It goes on very thick. If you put it next to other brands of nail polish (e.g., Essie, Butter London), you can see the difference - Zoya tends to look a bit more sloppy.
6900	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a good product.  I've purchased it in salons before so I knew what I was getting.  However, the bottle was leaking when it arrived so some of the product was lost.
Pros:
3873	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Unbelievable.  For as many years as I can remember, I have never had "nails".  You know the ones that really do something for your self esteem.  Mine would split in two, peel, break, so thin you could see through.  I have used this product faithfully for 2 months now, and I actually had to trim some nails that were getting long.  It sounds silly to many people but to me, this is a godsend.

4924	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I just used this stuff- I took a steamy shower, washed my face and then followed the instructions stating to get the cotton ball REALLY wet when applying Silver Powder- then I laid flat and let it dry. Next I used a pore strip and as I pulled it off, I literally did not have a black head in sight. I have battled blackheads my entire teenage and adult life. This product is INCREDIBLE... I seriously cried. I am going to use it weekly and can afford to do so, it's a reasonable price. Try this if your blackheads give you grief.
The product is a thick, white lotion and a little more than a pea-sized dab seems to be enough to effectively cover my entire face. I was worried a little that it wouldn't blend in, but a little work makes it disappear and it dries to a matte finish within a few minutes.
5940	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love Butter so I'm biased but this is a very pretty color.  If you're looking to round out your butter collection, you should have this color.  It does take numerous coats though if you use it by itself
With this product you need to leave it on for 3 hours before washing off. The good news is that it dries fairly quickly and then you can dress (dark clothes advised). It is a big cold here in WI to sit around undressed waiting 3 hours to take a shower.

3713	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This mild cleanser is a non-oily gel that deep cleanses. I have super sensitive skin and didn't have a flare up using this gel but it's no indication about its mildness since even regular soap can make my skin go nuts. This gel smells great and it did take off all my make up. I'm going to use it for deep cleansing to alternate with my regular mild cleanser since I would only use the sone when I wear makeup.
This expensive small pan of water based foundation conquers those two problems for me.
6761	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.

So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!
7283	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Silver Powder Review
Longevity was decent, about 4-6 hours of noticeable proximity effect (about 2-3 feet of projection) and then becomes a skin scent for another 2-4 hours. Silage was moderate, not a room clearing force field. Compared to many other "mall bath and body store" scents, this is pretty impressive. L'Occitan for instance is famous for not inexpensive scents that last an hour or so and then vanish utterly. In comparison, this C&E frag comes close to giving you what the big fragrance companies offer and at a fraction of their price.

Normally when I use a night time facial cream that moisturizes, my face will end up looking like a grease pit in the morning -- but not with this cream. I have combination, oily with dry areas, skin and I occasionally breakout, but experienced no adverse reaction to this cream; it left my skin feeling nicely hydrated and soft.

8644	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This lotion is a little heavy. I use it when my skin is especially dry but not every day. I like it because it is not full of glycerin. Too much glycerin irritates my skin. The scent is OK, nothing special.

69	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Chick Flick Cherry is a rich blue-red that makes me think of old movies and late nights in the summertime. This is the color of red I like to wear in the summertime with open-toed shoes.  It gives a little mystery, but flirty enough to say hello.  It is a versatile red that is perfect in the winter months as well.  I really like the darker, richer reds in the winter time as there is something comforting and cozy about the color.  If you are not one for blue-reds, this would not be the shade for you.  I put on one coat of polish and it is the perfect shade of red for me.  I don't think I would like it with a second coat.  I do love OPI products but this came with some of the bristles straight out to the side.  While they don't get in the way of polishing my nails, I do worry about product dripping off those stray bristles.
1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the "cooling action" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the "cleansing" part.

99	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful shimmer periwinkle that leans a tad more blue. The formula is a bit watery compared to the other OPI colors, but still OPI level quality. It is really sheer on the first coat so it could be used as a nice topper. It still builds up nicely despite this. You need 3 coats for full opacity, and you can get away with 2 coats if you don't care much about seeing bits of your nails still. There are no issues with brush strokes or pooling either. It is also definitely a hard to find color in stores so I would really recommend and stocking up if you like this color. Overall, I definitely fell in love with this color and I can't stop staring at my nails lol.
4558	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect for a quick clean up at the office or an early morning clean up when it is just too hard to wash the face regularly. Late night approved. Remove any oily shine and close up those pores while toning and getting ride of any gunk from the day, or night. I love these things and will definitely be getting more!

9070	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it!
There are so many variables to making polish last longer that it may be difficult to understand the difference that this product makes at first. It will depend on the formula of the polishes that you are using, the amount of water that you may get your hands into ( I always use rubber gloves when I am using water!). I can see how some people discount this product. It's difficult to quantify.
3361	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Haven't tried it yet.  Surprised at the "terra cotta" color from the outside of the bottle, I thought it would be more muted.  As soon as I use it, I will report more objectively.
3573	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The use of this along with MB's Enzyme Cleansing Gel and Cucumber Cleansing Lotion (and a few facial oils such as marula oil) has dramatically changed my skin. Over the past several years I suffered with painful cystic acne breakouts along with the more typical pimples associated with acne. Since starting to use the MB products mentioned above my skin has improved tenfold. It has been almost 6 months without even one cyst forming and have had only the occasional small pimple pop up, which is easily controlled with MB's Drying Lotion. I highly recommend MB products to anyone suffering with acne - you can even use a tool on the MB website to determine which products are most appropriate for your skin!
8452	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Mario Badescu products for quite a while and the Seaweed Cleansing Soap is one of my favorites.  It is gentle on my face and has a subtle scent which I enjoy.  My skin, which gets quite dry in the sub-arctic environment where I reside, seems to get its moisture replenished with this lotion.  It cleans my face very well and even gets my makeup off - I wear blush and eyebrow liner.  It lasts a long time as a little goes a long way.  I recommend this product.

Unlike other brands, this emollient is quickly absorbed and doesnt leave an oily appearance like so many others do.  I use it instead of a moisturizer before applying make-up.  Three drops is plentyone on my forehead and cheeks is enough to massage around my entire face.  It works best if I apply it to a slightly wet face.  The oil makes an excellent base for liquid make-up, and helps spread it more smoothly and evenly.  The end result is a natural look that I like very much.

3606	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have occasional pimples and this product worked perfect for those. It even healed a particular one that was bothersome for weeks after treatment with over the counter salicylic acid products and benzoyl peroxide (I had also even tried prescription retinoid cream to no use). It is liquid and I do think it makes it harder to apply but just tip the bottle on the area that you want to use it and drop a little there, that seemed to work fine for me. Also, make sure to use the product every other day for best results and shake before using as it does separate. I have oily areas in my face and applied this all over and it helped with that as well. It has a little bit of a clinical smell at first but you get used to it, worth it for the benefits of the product.

Oz.</a>&nbsp;and gave it 3 stars- see "Old Review" I pasted below- primarily because it had a very strong smell and caused a bit of a reaction. I decided to try this product again, because I thought it was a new formula (it is), and despite my first experience, I really liked the way my face was soft and clean after using it (before my face felt hot). A comparison of the ingredients on this newer, larger 300 ml version shows that this larger sized Thermale 3-in-1 does not list the words "shea butter" and the "parfum" ingredient has moved from ingredient number 6 (about in the middle of the ingredient list) to the last ingredient on this newer version. I tried using this again with water this time (like a lotion cleanser), and the smell had greatly diminished from the first bottle.  If you don't have a problem with "parfum" and/or shea butter, either rendition of this product produces really nice soft skin and removes make-up well. If you do have very sensitive skin, this second version with different ingredients seems to keep the positive traits of the product while minimizing the negative.  It also may have helped that I used water in combination w this product instead of using it straight out of the tube and wiping it off dry when I wrote the old review.

I am thrilled that this is also a toner since those can be so very drying on my skin.  This reduces several steps in my skin care routine which is wonderful.  My pores look a lot better.

7187	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I hate the messy spray dry shampoos.  I've tried about 6 different ones, high end and drugstore, and all of them have left a disturbing grayish cast in my dark blond hair.  But this dry shampoo is a sprinkle in powder that works incredibly well. I use the tiniest amount of this powder and it soaks up oil really well but it does take a few minutes to work.  At first the scent is strong but it soon disappears so if you're fragrance sensitive, you'll definitely be able to use Pronto.  It makes my hair look and feel much cleaner and it doesn't give me that flat matte finish like so many dry shampoos.  The small size is deceiving because it takes very little powder to do the job and I'll bet there's not much actual powder in the sprays and that all the room in the can is taken up by nasty propellant.  So this product is not expensive to use at all.  I've had the 1 ounce size for several months, even though I use it a couple of times a week.  It also comes in a larger size, which is more economical.  I know that Ulta carries Pronto and if you buy it there, you can return it if you don't like it.  However, I'm willing to bet that you'll like it as much as I do.  I definitely prefer the sprinkle in powder form over the sprays.  Today, for example, I used Pronto and after 20 minutes there was no residue left.  I just worked it in like regular shampoo and POOF!, 20 minutes later it had disappeared.  I had some nice volume and my hair still had shine.  I really like everything about this product and will keep it stocked from now on.  It's by far the best dry shampoo I've tried and I see no need to keep looking.  If you want cleaner looking hair without having to shampoo, I suggest you try this product.  I definitely recommend it.

While this product has a gel-like consistency its quite rich and moisturizing.  I gently tap just a tiny amount around my eyes and it absorbs right in.  Its not sticky or greasy and is compatible with my eye make-up.  It has a slight fragrance which is hard to describeits almost a little spicy smelling (I don't find it unpleasant).  I do not experience any burning, redness or stinging when I use this product.
I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.
I love the black matte look and feel of it - it provides a bit of non-slip protection and hasn't fallen out of my hands yet.

This not only smells amazing, the price buying for the 4.2 oz direct from amazon(I wouldn't buy from a 3rd party seller, personally) was unbeatable! It was the same bottle and box as I saw in the store. Buying this at Sephora or Ulta, it's about $75 bucks, so I was a huge fan of the price here. I would say this fragrance would span a variety of ages. We're in our early 30s, and it really suits him well. It's woodsy and rich, a bit mysterious. The notes are Ashwood, Tonka Beans, Santolina, Madras Wood, Quince Paste, Oak Moss, Silver Absinthe, White Lavender, Marine Fennel, Cubeb Peppers, Tobacco Leaf, Juniper Berries, Jasmine, Orris Root, Patchouli, Fir Balsam & Suede. A really delicious, masculine scent.  He alternates between this and a more aquatic fragrance depending on his mood. This is definitely my favorite of the two he uses. When he first started testing it out, I thought it might be too old for him, but after getting used to it, I really favor this scent. He sprays 1 spritz in the morning and when he comes home after work I can still smell it. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!

I wouldn't recommend this for someone who needs a decent amount of exfoliation on a consistent basis.

542	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This Dermablend Cover Crme full coverage foundation came in a good size that will last me quite awhile. It came with a small plastic "spatula" for easy scooping. The directions said to scoop a bit out onto the back of your hand to warm it up, and then apply to your face. I usually use a make up sponge for applying my foundation, but this technique worked well. I was able to spread it easily across my face. It felt lightweight even though it contains a suncreen with an SPF of 30. In the past when I've used foundation with sunscreen and it's felt oily or heavy. This foundation felt like a normal non sunscreen foundation. My skin did feel fresh and felt smooth like the description says. Very happy with this foundation and knowing my skin is protected from the sun as well.

7287	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	AMAZING! I have been looking for the EXACT shade for over 22 yrs and I have found it in golden glow! I am mixed and have a more yellowish undertone and VERY hard to find any kind of makeup with more yellow in it. Usually I get a beige muddy look (almost ruddy) and/or a pinkish undertone. I HATE looking two-toned. This takes the redness out and matches the rest of my body from the neck down and it's amazing in photos! I ordered a sample from Bloft cosmetics for $7 since I wasn't sure what my exact shade was and I wasn't about to shell out that much money for a product that didn't match (just like every other foundation/powder) and I'm sure glad I found a sample which has a decent amount btw. I stiple it on my face with my philosophy multi brush and so far that is The best method and best brush IMO. I never really used it but only for blending into my nose and around my nose area and under my eyes but using it to stiple and then blend and stiple works flawlessy! My face is so smooth and flawless and almost as if I am not wearing makeup. I cannot stress enough how much a miracle this is to me. I am def purchasing the refill, not sure about the compact but who knows, I think I am becoming a Jane Iredale fan! Just in case you are wondering, I am NC30(winter) and NC35 (summer)...as of now, I am the lightest NC30 and this is perfect! My pores don't react to this and I don't break out...this stuff looks much more better than Bareminerals or any other foundation I have ever tried! Even better than MAC mineralized skin finish! Mac looks more made up but this is so natural and you can easily build it up to a more made up look as well. I am def going to try their hydration spray and their BB cream!!!
I did read the directions, scooped a little bit of the product out with the provided spatula and made sure to warm the product up before applying-I did this on the back of my hand.  I applied the product with my fingers and liked that as I could control where and how much coverage I wanted.
7268	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This does not remove blackheads by itself. It will loosen and brings the blackhead gunk to the surface where it can be easily extracted with a blackhead extraction tool. I've been using this product twice a week and it is hands down one of the best product out there to help with deep pore cleansing. It's a bit messy to use hence why I dock off one star.

9936	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.
7947	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  Just spray on - I suggest the optional sprayer attachment and use hair spray to keep the toppix in.  Makes a huge difference in making sparse spots look full.  I am very sensitive to many products, and I have no sensitivity to this.- no problems.  Highly recommend this low tech solution
2509	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Maybe it's me, but I seem to like different types of fragrances based on the season. I like fruity, floral-y things for spring and summer, and more spicy/musky things when it gets colder. Sort of like how I pick food! (ok, not musky food! ha ha!!)
9964	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Everyone was recommending it and every article I read about skin care was saying this was a 'must have' product. I only have the occasional whitehead, some blackheads on my chin and nose, but I have sebaceous filament on my nose and my chin. This product did not work for blackheads and did not work for sebaceous filament (but it's not supposed to). I did have one pimple under the skin, and it was starting to hurt but since it hadn't broken through the skin it wasn't visible. I put this on and in the morning it was GONE. JUST GONE!

4997	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	As a beauty product hoarder for decades now, I discovered long ago that many products are made from the same manufacturer and simply repackaged under different brand names. Eye pencils - liners or for brows - usually fall into that category. The majority of brands, regardless of price, are made in Germany. That doesn't make them bad, just making an observation. I was surprised and impressed to see that this Vincent Longo pencil is made in Italy, a difference I noticed the first time I used the pencil. This goes on easily, wears well and the slim design feels good in your hand and allows for precise application. While I do have highlighted hair, I am naturally "mousey brown" and as such my eyebrows are fairly dark. Even so, I have found that using brown brow pencils look too dark and "painted on" for me so I switched to taupe/blonde pencils years ago. This pencil is perfect - a luxury product that I would recommend to more than just blondes. It provides good definition without looking as severe as some of the darker pencils. Beauty product cynic that I am, I did not expect to be impressed by an eyebrow pencil but this is a great product and one I will continue to use.
This product lasts me around 1-2 months of daily use.

These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.

6448	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This  versatile product works as a light moisturizer on it own or as a product booster. It is a lightly scented gel that applies easily. In the summer I like to go light. This product was adequate but not impressive on its own. I think it would be ideal for those with acne or oily skin but for combination or dry skin it was just okay. Where it excelled was as a product booster. When applied over another moisturizer it did seem to enhance the effect. I appreciated that it is not tested on animals and includes ingredients including ginko, ginseng and ceramides. The bottle is small but a little goes a long way. It is also safe for the eye area. Overall a nice product to have in your beauty arsenal.

Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.
All told, the quality of the package is four stars, but as a package, it is more expensive than I would want.  As noted, the individual components are more expensive if bought separately, but at the end of the day, only the moisturizer is worthy of that individual price, and competitors make a less expensive, comparable quality product for face soap and astringent.

You start with a light coat then add more layers until you get the coverage you need.  A setting powder is a good addition to make the make-up last longer.  Dermablend makes a cleaner which works well to remove the make-up.
The toner, kinda smells like toothpaste to me. I don't have a pore problem. But I am using all three steps to get the optimum benefits. I notice that if I do a rush job on my face and just want to get to bed then the toner picks up a lot of the dirt that the cleanser missed.

My main dislike is that this moisturizer doesn't include SPF.  That's fine for night application, but it requires an extra step and product in the morning.  I like this moisturizer well enough, but I'm not wowed.  I won't be changing preferred brands based on this product.

It still took a little longer than I would have liked to absorb, but I didn't have any major problems like my gf. But that being said I also didn't see any major benefit over this and any other thicker natural moisturizer I've used from kiehls or even neutrogena Norwegian formula.

There is absolutely no pink tone. I would say it is closer to a yellowish beige. Very unattractive. I can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
I think if you are a beginner you should get a 34C first as the 37C may have a steeper learning curve to get the angle correct.
There is a slight fragrance, but it is more pleasant than not (a bit of citrus, I guess) and it does not linger.

I love how lightweight it feels,  It lasts all day long without breaking down.  I also like the smell too.  It doesn't have the strange alcohol odor that some do.  Overall a great product.  No complaints at all about it.
456	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used this makeup recently and it is a very nice, consistent product. It is a creamy application which spreads and blends easily and provides good coverage to provide a subtle consistency that hides skin imperfections and also moisturizers while offering sun protection. This is essential as I burn quickly when I am exposed to outdoor direct light.
8118	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am a beauty product addict. Price doesnt matter to me, Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion. My fave hair serum is $5. My fave face cream is $200. I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end lines.
This is the first water based makeup I've ever loved.  Usually they look chalky and mask like on me.  The third ingredient in this is talc, one ingredient I have always avoided.  I dislike anything dry looking but in this, the talc is imperceptible.

974	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  It has kept my skin smooth and acne free for almost two years now.
I apply it daily, morning and evening. I use one pump, use my ring finger and gently pat around the eye contour.
The only reason I took off a star was because of the need for a bit more emollient action for me in the moisturizer, and that is likely because I'm a geezer. If you have oily skin, this is not going to be an issue for you and it is possibly a five for that application.
2812	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	As a DE shaving fanatic, this is absolutely the top of the line. I've shaved with a half-dozen blade razors, I've used a ton of brushes and soaps, and I've settled into a routine over the years. It was finally time to step up to my "forever" razor, and this is definitely it. Note to newbies: Don't be scared! Wet shaving isn't that scary. You can find a ton of videos online, and a good starter razor (such as cheaper razors in the Merkur line) can be gotten for a fraction of this price if you'd prefer to learn before you jump in here.
The moisturizer is creamy, greaseless, and works into the skin in seconds.  Very, very light scent, I can't really smell it, and I get bothered by scent, so don't worry about this one.  Light pink in color, goes on totally clear - no visible signs of sunblock, no shine, no grease.  And it makes your skin so unbelievable soft.  Like the whole texture of your skin is improved.  I really like this product.

It took a few days to see major results but I did notice each day improvements, it was certainly an experience for me as I don't typically care for this kind of thing but I'll try just about anything once. I'll have to say though seeing as the differences were noticed by others I may consider this a regular product. It's still strange for me though as normally I toss and turn at night and a couple nights I did have some stuff all over my pillow but it just made me have cleaner sheets on the bed. I ended up just switching to wearing the stuff for only a few hours before bed and washing it off before sleeping so that I could not have a mess in the bed (that sounds horrible).

Although a bit pricy, the shampoo itself is worth every penny.  It doesn't have a very strong pungent smell that is overwhelming like some shampoos.  I usually use Garnier Fructis that can sometimes leave the hair stringy and leave you smelling like a tropical fruit all day.  The jack black shampoo does seem to make your hair fuller and cleaner than most shampoos that I have tried that have promised the same results.  I am 35 years of age and have a full head of hair and according to my family history won't lose it anytime soon,  so I can not explain how the shampoo does on thinning hair, but with the results I got from it just using a quarter sized amount to wash my hair and beard, I would be shocked if it didn't do what it advertises for those with thinning hair.  Even though it is $19 for 12 ounces,  I will be buying this product from now on.
If you use a brush as suggested on the JI site, the coverage will be lighter but much will float into the air. I like the flocked sponge as I get a bit more coverage and no airborne loss.

4719	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Smells great - very lightweight and good for blonde hair. I use a pencil-size eraser amount and this bottle will last me forever. However, I don't notice any difference between this product and some of  the $10 or $12 hair oils ive tried. Probably will not order again simply due to price.


Conclusion:
UPDATE: Every time I use this on my 2yr old, she gags & coughs a LOT.  Neither of us can stand the strong smell, so it's useless to us regardless of its effectiveness.

Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.
1096	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a phenomenal setting powder that will keep your foundation and blush as flawless as when first applied. It makes your pores all but disappear. Right now it is hot and humid and with this setting powder my makeup keeps going strong 'till I get home in the evening. It also keeps my foundation (Dermablend) from smudging, and I find that very important because I do public contact work. It goes on white but is actually colorless. The packaging is really generous compared to other brands that I have tried. I've found that Dermablend products are truly worth the expense because they give you great coverage with only a slight application. I wholeheartedly recommend this powder because it so tremendously enhances your appearance!

The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.
Must admit that I use it in combination with ' it's a 10"  miracle leave-in product. Because my shoulder length hair tangles easily in the shower, I apply a few drops of "it's a 10" after shampooing and rinsing. Then I comb it through, eliminating all the tangles. Out of the shower I dry it slightly, and then apply a teaspoon of Super Skinny Serum, starting with the ends. The result is hair which holds its shape very well and shines brilliantly.
I highly recommend it!
The best part was the lotion. My husband really liked it, and so did I. It has very little scent and it isn't greasy. A really lovely light lotion. Next would be the toner. While it reminds me of other toners --as I mentioned-- it doesn't seem to leave a residue that needs to be washed off.
Interesting side note:  I bought this soap in December.  After I bought it Amazon said the soap would be delivered to me around Jan. 20th.  To my shock it came on exactly Jan. 20th!  I also found out why...It shipped from Europe.
1475	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  I have received countless compliments on the color "Pasha" used on my toenails.

It's has soothed, plumped, and softened my skin, it's worked well as a base for my liquid foundation, and it has minimized the pores across my nose, and evened-out my skin tone. In addition, it goes on easily with great coverage using a small amount, and it isn't greasy. It sinks in very well on my face, and doesn't creep down into my eyes. It works well on my neck as well (very soothing). I do find that it doesn't sink in as well on my dcollet, this is noticeable at shower time, when you can feel it sitting on the top layers of the skin (doesn't happen with the face and neck). The light citrus-woodsy scent is very nice.

It's amazing. And it left my hair smooth and soft, with fewer fly-aways. I'm definitely sticking with this.

3618	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The key to this is using it properly. If you just spray it all over dry hair, you're going to end up with no volume and a bunch of sticky hair. I let my hair dry, then flat iron it, then toss my head upside down and spray by my roots and work it outwards with my fingers. It dries quickly and really does provide volume. Just remember, a little bit goes a very long way. If you spray this like you'd spray an aerosol hairspray it's going to turn into a sticky mess. With this product, less is definitely more. If you're looking for a way to add volume to flat hair this is a great way to do it.

It really helps!
6904	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	These pads are great..They have a very nice minty smell and they also have a nice minty and cooling effect on the face.

These come in a flip top container so they are perfect for your gym bag, carry-on luggage or your desk drawer. These are an A+ product from an A+ Men's line. Overall, a great buy and I will continue to purchase and use these.
7703	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very nice eye cream, loaded with goodies.  I wake up with refreshed looking eyes.  This has no fragrance which is a bonus.  Do wish it came in a pump, but still love it.  I also use the Sleepwear moisturizer on my face.  Bioelements is a very good line.

8689	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I fly a lot and my skin really dries out in airplanes. This product has been pretty perfect for toting along on flights - it's small enough for TSA standards, and when I use it in flight, the oil absorbs quickly into my skin without being sticky, goopy or shiny. It's a bit pricey to use for everyday at home, but Mario Badescu is, after all, a high-profile name in skin care. Beyond, that, it works really well for when and where I need it most.
SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.
I'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair, but I still want to wear a pomp. Fortunately, I just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as MPB on top. Toppik works for me even if I use pomade to get the pomp look I like. I apply Toppik after greasing up and getting my hair partially styled. I'll add Toppik as needed to the thinning spots as I comb and style. The pomade actually seems to help keep Toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well. I've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum/wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps. I add the Toppik after applying pomades. You can add more pomade if you need to, but I usually then need to add a bit more Toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has Toppik applied.
2838	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome face wash.  My skin doesn't feel dried out after I shower when using this product.  I read other reviews saying products from Nivea are just as good at half the price.  Have you read the ingredients in both?  Not even close.  Jack Black is a premium wash and not some Target / Walmart brand. Also, a little goes a LONG way.  I don't need more than about a pea size amount as it lathers up richly.  A bottle lasts unless you're over doing it.  Highly recommended.
7195	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've tried just about every dry shampoo out there.  This is my favorite, I hop they don't stop making it.  It seems the aerosol is much more popular and many companies have stopped making the powder.  I'm blond so the white doesn't show, plus I tend to apply liberally at night and then I'm good to go in the morning with no "greasies".
8887	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	You can spray your face with rose water for $7, need I say more? Great for an afternoon makeup refresh, for hydrating at night or in the morning, or just to feel fancy af when you're chilling at home in your robe and slippies. One of my most favorite products ever!

This, amazingly, works really well.  I hate, hate, hate having a shiny face.  I normally carry around a powder compact wherever I go, so that I can take any shine away, as needed throughout the day.  But, when I use this powder, my face stays smooth, pretty and matte for hours.  I'm so impressed.  I do need to re-apply in the very late afternoon, but that is a joy for me.  I have very oily facial skin, so to me, that is a miracle.

9896	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great toner especially for aging.  It leaves your face feeling a little tingling for a minute.  Feels refreshing and again doesn't bother my adult acne. I don't get any breakouts due to the product.  Bioelements products are the best for me.

Does it do all that? Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it does, at least not for the first three times I've used it. The eye cream doesn't say it works better over time, just that it helps each time you use it.

I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now.  I have used it a couple of different ways.  First I used it in the shower as a cleanser to remove my makeup.  Second I used it as a toner by putting some on a cotton pad and wiping my face with it before applying makeup.  The directions aren't completely clear on which is the best way to use it; it sounds like it's meant to be a general cleanser/toner.
953	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like almost all the Jane Iredale products.  I especially like the Pure Pressed Blush in the Cotton Candy color.  It goes on smoothly, evenly and gives a nice glow to your face when used with the Pressed Powder foundation.  Sometimes, when I'm not in the mood to apply the mineral pressed powder foundation, I use only moisturizer and a sunscreen and then apply the 'Cotton Candy'.  This blush is very versatile in how you use it, and it never looks blotchy when applied or at the end of the day.  I would suggest using a large rounded brush for application.

That said, I'm also on a budget, a stay-at-home-mom now with three kids, so I don't have the money to spend on department store brands. I've been using mostly drugstore makeup, or the makeup I can buy at professional salon supply stores, for years now. My go-to foundations have ALWAYS been liquid Covergirl or L'Oreal. I always also use the very lightest shade. When I was a teen, my mom liked to spoil me with nice department store makeup, but brands like Clinique and Lancome never had a shade pale enough for me that wasn't also yellow/orange in the natural daylight. So, I've always been content with the liquid foundations from drugstore brands. I've always worn heavy foundation too.

6509	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LoVe this Rosewater and Aloe Facial Spray.  I live in the high desert and my facial beauty regimen changes constantly even with a normal skin complexion.  My face feels fresh and clean during and after ever spritz and I love the light rose aroma.  This really helps keep my face balanced during the seasons.
5244	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this.  Really helps the necks & some lines on the forehead, etc...
It does spread nicely on smooth skin, and the mitt does make it blend in nice and evenly if you're really careful about not putting on too much at a time. The color is nice. I was hoping it wouldn't be orange, because who wants to look like Donald Trump? It does not have an orange tint. The tanning looks quite natural as long as you do light applications at a time. This can stain your clothes if you're not careful. Especially white clothing. I would not wear white soon after application to be safe.
This is a wonderful cream because it sinks in, doesn't sting cracked skin, and really provides long-lasting protection and healing. One tube lasts forever, in fact I usually get the gift set of small tubes of L'Occitane hand creams just for some variety, and I find that the three small tubes easily last me the year.

Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).
Eucalyptus, a natural antiseptic, is also used to relieve the pain of arthritis and will increase blood flow and give a warm, soothing sensation.

Hey, Juice Beauty, if you are reading this, I hope you'll consider repackaging this with a pump!
This stuff is expensive IMO and is only 8oz.  I find it is not lasting but I think I can cut back on the amount as this stuff lathers very well with a proper brush and cup so I think I can stretch it out more to hopefully make it last longer.

Wonderful, healthy, and safe. I use the EWG's cosmetic database to look up all my cosmetics and the Juice Beauty products come up in the totally safe category.

Despite all the things I liked about this blush, I'm rating four stars instead of five, because a couple of the ingredients might not be what every consumer wants. Those ingredients are: Talc (1st ingredient--some women just don't like talc in any face product), and Mica (2nd ingredient--some women might not want ANY sparkle at all, not even a tiny amount).
I recently tried another brand that is about half the cost. It did not work for me at all. I had to get back on Amazon & order this quickly.
I want to add a note: the instructions say to burn the candle to the edge the first time you light it as that will afford a smooth burn all the way down. The estimated time to get to that stage was given as 2-3 hours. I have had this candle burning for 5 hours and cannot get that full circumferential burn. It doesn't diminish the candle for me but I did want to point  that out. Lovely product for home or gift.
As far as the irritation, I have a lot of allergies and super sensitive old-mom skin and what I found is that this left my skin 'burning'.  I rinsed my face with water but the feeling persisted.  I doubt many people will be effected by this but wanted to give other moms with dry, sensitive skin a heads up.

Anyway, when anyone was talking to me they would always scroll with their eyes up to my head looking at the thin parts.  I became very embarrassed, especially when the wind blew it was worse.  Since using Toppik I'v notice they do not look at my thinning head anymore.  But, sometimes in the sun when the wind blows it's a little more apparent.

6766	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I'm not really sure what all the hype is about with this product, but I'm happy that it turned me on to the brand.  The Mario Badescu buffering lotion, drying cream, acne cleanser, and special c clearing lotion were very effective.  I also like that the formulas are simple without a lot of extra added chemicals.  Although this particular product didn't work for me, a bunch of his other products have.  This is a great brand!

The cream has no fragrance and is non-greasy. I suggest you use a small glob to start with and massage it in until it liquefies and  absorbs. If you use too much it will sit on top of your skin like a coat of wax.

Topnotes  freesia, mandarin, sage Midnotes  muguet, white lily, marigold, narcissus Basenotes  sandalwood, patchouli, amber. Upon initial application, I can smell the floral topnotes along with just a passing hint of sage. That dissipates within a few minutes, revealing midnotes that are floral but without being either cloying or overwhelming. With the passage of 30 minutes or so, the basenotes predominate with an enticing mixture of sandalwood, amber and patchouli. The basenotes will linger, making them Eternity's signature aroma and for which it will be best remembered. Very pleasing in all respects, everyone that I introduced to Eternity Eau de Parfum enjoyed its subtle mixture of floral, wood and spice elements. A single application lasts for 3-4 hours. This is a subtle and elegant perfume.

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.
Juice Beauty Green Apple Nutrient Eye Cream is the best product I've used.

Little bit of a bummer because I wanted something ultra-moisturizing for my face for winter. But no biggie and at least my neck is happy :-) Oh and my boyfriend who has very no-fuss clear skin year-round sometimes uses it when hes too dry  he likes it and he is not a product guy at all so thats saying something. So I think people with non-fussy faces that are dry would love this; maybe I'll work up the courage to try on my face heehee

5541	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	After I had my baby, I lost a lot of hair (thanks, hormones) and had a few sparse spots that made me feel very self conscious. My hair dresser recommended this and I love it. It's slightly darker than my natural hair color, but it really doesn't seem to make a difference.

This hits the higher performance and upper end quality for sure! I have a facial beard and mustache, not too thick, so I shave my neck and do suffer from razor burn and irritation.

I hope you try it and put your own review up about what a difference it made for you!
Takes less than a minute to work up a really good lather with this product, one that really seems to protect my face from razor burn a lot better than all the other products I have used. I've tried shaving soaps, glycerin soaps, various GOO in a can, and even some of the higher end TRUE shaving creams (similar to this product listed). I would still say that Proraso has a solid hold on my. Its smell is light and soothing (other pretty much over power your nose). I can definitely tell that it protects my skin better than most other products. I personally like to put a couple extra drops of "essential oils" in the lather for that extra mile protection but that's just me.
7422	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The Baxter of California Night Cream AHA is a thick, dense AHA formula. I personally love how thick it is because you have so much control over how much to squeeze from the tube. I rub it on my fingers and then onto my washed face.

Gentle but effective, it deep cleans her pores where traditional surface cleansers can not go.  Her complexion is improved and her pores are smaller.  Her skin has a firmer, more resilient fell to it that even I notice (which is saying a lot!).

Opi goes on smooth, dries relatively fast, has rich colors, and lasts. Chick Flick Cherry is my fave of the cool, darker reds. Gorgeous red that makes my toes girly, sexy, and very happy. Hubby loves this color, too. Even comments on it. (When a man comments on a toenail color, it's gotta be nice!)

My skin has lost nearly all its redness in only a month. I use it in conjunction with other LaRoche=Posay and Vichy products.
434	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a thick foundation, I wouldn't use it unless you had something to cover up. If you do, then this is a good foundation. It comes with a tiny paddle, but I prefer a sponge. If you have age spots or acne, this will do a pretty good job to cover it. It blends well, and doesn't feel oily, though I have dry skin and could use a little of that! But anyway, it's a nice looking foundation and it does the job.

7393	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Somehow I found a sample of this in a makeup junk drawer, having no clue at all what this was I put it on . Gimme more, I'm loving it, maybe it's the pretty blue color or the way it feels going on  but it's like a serum soothing primer all in one. I am definitely planning on purchasing this in the future
It took me a while to learn how to apply this make-up without it caking in creases, and still sometimes it can cake a bit in the creases under my eyes if I'm not careful with my application of it.  I apply a tented moisturizer with sunscreen after any serums.  I then fully load the bottom of the brush with this loose mineral powder.  Then I strongly tap off any excess powder from the bush.  I start at the forehead and apply with downward strokes.  I end by applying it to my neck and decolletage.

3668	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Easy as pie!!!!  I'm a huge fan of self-tanners and have tried everything under the sun (ha!)!  This XEN-Tan Mousse is super easy to apply and the mitt is the key to how easy this self-tanner goes on and doesn't leave any streaking.  Be sure to shower and exfoliate so that the application goes on and stays on.  The fragrance is doable nothing offensive but I wouldn't put it on when you're starting your day off.  Shower, exfoliate, apply and put your pi's on before hopping into bed for the night.  In the morning take a quick shower and be sure to moisturize.  I was very pleased with the color and it lasted a few days.  If you did back-to-back nights of applying the tanner you would find that the color is a bit more intense and lasts longer.  I haven't had any issues with the tanner staining my clothing or sheets.
4860	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Purchased Suntan from Nordstrom and it's finally my match!
7738	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I think this product is intended as an anti-aging serum. I use for moisture/antioxidant boost when I need it - over EL Advanced Night Repair at night or under my humble lil Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizer for day. Im in my mid-twenties so I focus more on prevention. I definitely think the Celufirm drops help to create/maintain a moisturized, balanced, face that looks healthy/glowy. Oh and I have very sensitive skin that loves any excuse to have an acne extravaganza and this does not break me out
About once a week, I leave a bit of the cleanser on my face for 5 minutes to let the enzyme magic do it's thing.  I have no blackheads, not even on my oily t-zone area.  It works really well with the rest of my skin care regiment, and lasts forever!  My first bottle has lasted me 6 months.  Only a little bit is needed, and really, it's not that expensive when you consider how long it lasts, or the great things it does for your skin.
3935	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is really luxurious soap, and on the basis of that it'd be five stars. It makes such an amazingly thick and wonderful lather.

This cream feels incredible the second you put it on your face and leaves your skin soft. When I woke up the next morning my pores even looked smaller.
Update :-

7048	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the texture and quality of this product in providing moisture to your skin care regimen. I am a 57 and find that as I get older my skin needs more moisture and this product does the job.

5803	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wasn't sure how opaque this product would be applied, being a former Accutane user it's never the same trying to find quality lip balm ever again. I really like Korres, and this seemed to be the closest to a natural lip color on me (I'm a guy, mostly just wanted the moisture not the color). Definitely does a great job of that, the only comparison I have is the Neutrogena Revitalift for lips. Most of them are also colored, but they have been the best at fixing nasty dry lips without resorting to greasy impractical Aquaphor.
9230	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin.
As I have gotten older, my lips have become thinner (unlike the rest of me), and those little lines that my mom and grandma had started to appear on my own face (oh, the horror!).
8863	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I consider myself a beauty guru... I have tried so many things to get my skin to look healthy. I have very dry and sensitive skin. This is the perfect extra pop of moisture or color! It adds the perfect amount of moisture. Some products are so matte that it makes your dry skin worse or shows your dry patches. This brings that perfect amount of glow to your skin without making it look super oily. This does not feel that way. If you have oily skin I'm not sure this would be for you. I use this every day to set my foundation and sometimes at night if my skin feels tight from my face wash.
It is red but not too red, dark but not too dark, seems to go with most anything.

9252	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have never used a peel before, and really enjoyed this product. The smell is not great, but it's not terrible either -- a slight hint of apple, but not really fresh. Still, not a deal breaker. There is a bit of a slimy feel to it, it goes on smooth, and almost immediately begins to tingle, which worried me at first, but ultimately this didn't seem to be an indication that anything was wrong. By the time the recommended ten minutes had elapsed the peel had hardened a bit. It washed off like a masque. (Is a peel supposed to peel off?)
954	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product! Non greasy and doesn't break your face out. Went to the beach for a week and no burns. Love it!


5483	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	If you shave and get skin rashes because you have sensitive skin, this is a great product for you. And even though this is for men, you know we women use the men's shave products also. I have extremely dry skin and eczema and psoriasis an this helps shave the forest and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and you don't see as many dry streaks, less redness and less problem areas. I will certainly be using this more often. My husband will never know this could have been his...of course, he is very set in his ways and has used pretty much the same shaving products for years. It took 20 years for me to get him out of the old shaver to a new one. I will need to wait another twenty to get him to switch shaving products.
367	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Foremost, if your skin can handle a primer (and some people with very sensitive skin cannot always do this), try a light amount of primer before applying this this. It will minimize pores and make the product go on smoothly.
2917	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This has a nice clean smell, lathers well, and rinses off completely. Some soaps just seem to stick all over and never rinse clean. This isn't one of those soaps. About two pumps is enough to lather entire body. I tried it in my hair and didn't really care for it, but it wasn't horrible either. This is a little pricey, but I like it a lot and will probably enjoy trying the other versions too.

4033	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Micellar water is a new buzz word in cosmetics although it had been around France a long time. The attraction is that it can remove all of your make up without drying your skin, furthermore it leaves no oil behind. My experience with Vichy had been positive. The product has removed all of my makeup including eye makeup. My skin is smooth and soft with no problems. With another brand I had break outs on my chin so all formulas are not equal. I follow the micellar water with a regular night moisturizer.
6561	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smells amazing and feels great on the skin!
It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.
NB I have sensitive skin and I could use this. Like I said earlier, it stings a bit but not for long.
2834	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Excited to try it based on reviews, but find it to be a poor cleanser. Little baby acne since starting using this, very dry skin, and my face looks dirty right after shower. I will just stick to a dove for men soap bar as it is far superior for cleaning the face and making it look nice and clean. Way overpriced for what you get, but everyone is different. What doesn't work for me might work for you.
I have been using it morning and night for about a month now, and I have actually noticed a difference. The fine lines around my eyes and the bags under my eyes have diminished. It comes in a small bottle (0.5 oz), so I am hoping that this bottle will last a long time. Luckily, you only need to apply a small dab per eye. It has a nice luxurious feel. Doesn't sting or otherwise bother the eyes or skin.
5520	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	OK Product
HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?
Coverage is good for covering freckles and the like. And of course since it has titanium dioxide, it's a sunscreen.
9119	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Tried this and it worked so fast I don't get zits often but when I do this is the type of product I want it works.  It is not harsh but dries the zit up.
I have mild rosacea and this is perfect for the redness on my cheeks and bridge of my nose.  I then use a tinted moisturizer and most of the time that's it.  If I am going out into the sun I use an SPF moisturizer.
3398	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very nice color!
8270	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best nail polish on the market today. Goes on easy and smooth with no streaking. Drys fast. With the medium to dark colors, only one coat of polish is needed. Highly recommend!
Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.

The addition of "allantoin/Comfrey Root Extract" is significant and explains why this heals the skin so fast. Allantoin is said to produce an increase in leukocytes/white blood cells that help to ward off infection.

8346	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'll be darned .. it really works.  Dark circles (decades old) are diminished, all but gone!  And fast .. it's remarkable.
I loved the fact the applicator has an aluminum tip - so much easier to keep bacteria cleaned off this way.  If you apply this Vichy targeted treatment exactly where you need it, you will get results in about 20 hours.  I had three not terrible patches, and they were greatly reduced by the next day, after one treatment.
And here I am a few months later, back to buy another one!  LAFCO candles are pricey -- but they burn so slowly and cleanly.  For me, burning this while I work at my desk at home adds a little luxury to my day.

I purchased both this and the drying lotion and this is SO much better for cystic acne. It does not prevent acne, but it will definitely reduce the size and duration. The application is not messy (unlike the drying lotion) and you don't have to use much. This is sulphur based, which works wonderfully for cystic acne. I would also recommend using a sulphur soap once a day.

It will be good for dry and sensitive skin, even without the usual sort of granules (the bits of almond are to few and far between to do much) it seems to do some mild exfoliating without irritating. Because of that it can probably be used a lot more often than a regular scrub.
3179	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great skin cleanser for dry, sensitive skin.

5157	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	All the skin care products from NIA24 are excellent.  This cream is a touch greasy upon application, so if that is something of concern to the buyer, you may not care for this.  It seems to be rapidly absorbed by the skin, if you use just a dab.  To use generously will most certainly leave an oily feel and look.  I rate it 4 stars, instead of 5, only because of the oily consistency to the cream.
8241	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful color, worth the money, fast shipping, and great drying time of nail polish......just amazing all around.
You have to have the color that matches your skin color.  For my girlfriend Cafe Brown was a good color while Oliver Brown was a touch dark for her.  This is basically a paste sunscreen that covers your flaws.  The SPF 30 will provide good protection from the sun, although it might need to be applied every 2 hours if you're in the water or sweating heavily.
8338	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This cream is a god-sent! Before trying this cream I had tried sooooo many others to combat my dry under eyes. I can't even imagine how much money I've spent on different creams and oils to try to combat my issue. Thank God my search is over because this is now my 2nd time purchasing this eye cream and I'm hooked! I will definitely purchase this again and again and again and again...you get the point.
4854	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been wearing this shade for years.  It's terrific!
Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.
4063	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this for my mother to try.  She says she will now use nothing else to remove her makeup.
Neither of us have had our skin magically transformed by this, but it seems to be a fairly high quality product. The wash is slightly drying on my combination skin, but works well on my husband's.

Most cover-up attempts only draw more attention to it rather than the hoped for less attention. Thats where a product like Dermablends Smooth Indulgence Redness Green Concealer comes to the rescue.
5595	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  Just spray on - I suggest the optional sprayer attachment and use hair spray to keep the toppix in.  Makes a huge difference in making sparse spots look full.  I am very sensitive to many products, and I have no sensitivity to this.- no problems.  Highly recommend this low tech solution
9661	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	L'Occitane lavender liquid soap is of superb quality, very thick and rich with the scent of true French lavender (Lavandula dentata).  It makes a nice creamy lather and does not dry your skin.  The bottle and pump are quite sturdy.  It makes an excellent, slightly luxurious gift (or self-indulgent treat!) for anyone who enjoys lavender.  Very highly recommended.
9499	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	While I liked the product initially because it does hydrate well something started to happen that I thought might be coincidence.  I started noticing eye bags.  I thought at first maybe I was ingesting too much salt, not hydrated, not getting enough rest, etc.  Eventually I suspected it's the NIA complex and discontinued it.  The bags started disappearing.  A month later I tried it again (new jar this time just in case) to see if this was coincidence.  They began reappearing.  I tried reducing the amount applied, and even just using it only at night.  Only when I switched to another product did the problem clear up for me.
2278	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was a little concerned when I ordered this body wash that it would cause my husband to smell like an Axe commercial.  Happily, my fears were unfounded!  The bergamot/pear scent is refreshing, "clean" smelling and not overly sweet.  In fact, I'd recommend it as a gender-neutral body wash.
4280	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm fair skinned with freckles, and Tan Towels are one of the only self tanning products that don't make me look orange.  Just make sure to wash your hands immediately after use otherwise they will turn orange.
447	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff. It blends so easily, isn't too heavy and it has moisture in it so it doesn't get cake like on your face.  A shade darker than I thought it would be. Highly recommend.
9675	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried so many hand creams because my hands are very dry and this is a fantastic one. It really heals your skin of dryness... and it feels and smells like a natural product.

435	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This Dermablend Cover Creme does a very good job of covering my freckles & gives my face a smooth looking appearance. It lasts all day & washes off easily with soap and water.  Definitely recommended!
5440	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I just love this face wash! I noticed a difference after the first time I used it and after only a few days my skin is noticeably clearer.
* I hope I get offered other products from this line to review...
6281	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Simply put, this product is excellent. I'm black, and black people have thicker skin. Since this product has AHA, it allows other products to penetrate deeper into the skin. As a result of using this product, other products will work that much better. I received this on Wednesday and my skin is brighter, glowing and a lot smoother. I'm probably going to buy a second bottle. Excellent, excellent, excellent, etc.... :)
964	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	but returned it as it was an error on my part as the barrel was too large so I went back on line to order the 1.5" by the same maker. It's a nice iron and comes with extra springs which I am happy about. My hair is only med length so the 1.5" better suits me for waves.

8113	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I first came across this hairspray from my hairstylist. Then I found some at TJMaxx super cheap so I bought a can. I loved the first bottle of it, so next time I was at TJMaxx I bought every bottle they had, LOL! But since then I don't know if the texture of my hair has changed or what, but I don't like it anymore. It smells great but I ended up giving all of them to my Mom who does still love this! This is the only CHI hairspray I've ever tried so I can't really compare it to any other hairspray they offer. Maybe I'll try a firmer spray next time I want to try a CHI hairspray.

7296	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was given this as a gift from a friend. It has honestly been the best skin care gift I have ever gotten! It's easy to use all the products, doesn't clog my pores or irritate my skin, and doesn't smell weird or chemically. I have super sensitive skin that tends to dry out easily. These products work great.
Phytodensia: A regenerative treatment for ultra-dry, brittle, damaged hair. This one is a fluid plumping mask for aging hair in a pump bottle. Leave on for 3 - 5 minutes.

The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me. I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat). They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).
I wouldn't buy this due to how oily it is and the lack of any kind of benefit from using it.
2048	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It's nail polish.  It was unopened, it was the color I wanted, and it arrived relatively quickly.  What more can I say?
8830	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is an incredible product! I put it on every night and the next day, my eyes are not puffy and it's firm. I look forward to putting it on every single night! I use the Ceramide Eye Gel for the mornings (I place mine in the fridge for a quick coolness sensation). I love all his products. I definitely will be ordering in again and the rest.
2517	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm not a huge perfume wearer. The most alluring thing about this perfume is the bottle, very fun but elegant. Spraying it on, it isn't too over powering, and the scent does calm down during the day--but doesn't fade completely.
304	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Another gorgeous color from OPI. Beautiful dark green/teal!
In conclusion, I would recommend this product. The reason that I am deducting half a star is the scent. I don't really care for it. It isn't the minty/menthol smell, but something else that I cant describe.  But the other benefits of using this product outweigh the cons.
1650	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great polish high gloss. Sheer in color
5376	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is my first time trying a product like this. I have pale skin that is somewhat blotchy and my cheeks are always a bit red. If I have a blemish the redness last weeks even after the blemish is gone.  The concealer is really green and a little goes a long way so definitely blend this in thoroughly.  I found that it worked better for me if I used this under a medium to full coverage foundation.  Most days I use a powder foundation due to it being quick and easy but found that the power I was using was too light and the green tint showed through too much for my likening.  I've been using this when I wear full coverage liquid foundation for special occasions and it doesn't look green but takes the red look out and covers well.  This product does help diminish the redness and give a more even complexion.
7937	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	OK THE REASON I AM GIVING TOPPIK ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I BEEN BUYINGTHIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. NOW, THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. LATELY AFTER U PUT THE MEDIUM BROWN IN UR HAIR AND THEN U PUT THE SPRAY ON TOP OF IT, YOUR HAIR BECOMES PURPLE ON THE AREA WHERE UR HAIR IS THINNING BUT THE REST STAYS BROWN AND IT LOOKS GROSS AND DISGUSTING. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. I GAVE THEM A CHANCE AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND OH LORD IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!! I WENT AND I BOUGHT NEW BOTTLE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT WAS THE SAME THING. THATS ITTTTTTTTTT.

The next morning I woke up to smooth skin! NO OIL! I was so blown away. I went and purchased the normal size. It's pricy, I never usually spend more than $7 on a product so this is new to me. But I want to take my skincare seriously and will make the investment. Also, I got another free sample of this cream with my full size purchase from Ulta.

The moisturizer. This is the product that I like the most. I have oily skin. And once I wash my face the oil comes back really quickly. Not with this moisturizer. It doesn't feel thick. And doesn't have an overpowering smell.
6438	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Came inside a plastic bag with half the bottle spilled everywhere and the box came wet. My rose water and cucumber water ugh. Next time Im not buying this online anymore the kids weren't even full screwed on.

Skin brightening- this is more obvious. I have a largish freckle on the tip of my nose, and it is noticeably lighter. It's not gone, but I can actually camouflage it with make up now without pulling out the serious concealer.
7726	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have ruddy, red skin from years of plucking and waxing hair off of my neck. I used a silicone applicator to put this on. It is green at first but quickly blends in and helps tone down the redness quite a bit. It also feels very light, so it is great for those of us who do not like to wear foundation or makeup at all. I worked out at the gym wearing it and it did not smear or run.


6784	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product is amazing!  It's an fantastic spot treatment that really works!!
2185	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I don't care for the scent (smells a bit like insect repellent), but it's gentle and effective.
Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.
Update: it's almost four years since I wrote the review, and the curling iron is still going strong! I carry the extra spring in my suitcase, and haven't needed it as of yet. Oh, and my husband got me an auto shutoff device that I plug into an outlet, and the curling iron into this widget, and so now I have auto shutoff! (except when travelling) Curling iron has been left on MANY times for up to 12 hours, and it still works. Amazing.
Slightly fragrant (mainly due to Fragrance Parfum, Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, and Geraniol)
8632	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Have been using Billy Jealousy products for a couple years now. This is a great, gentle exfoliating cleanser. I have normal to oily skin, and use this as a pre-shave cleanser. Excellent results.

4520	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I used to be really impressed with this stuff when I first bought it, but the longer I've had it and as it begins to change to a more dry consistency I don't think it's giving me the same results. I won't be repurchasing this and plan on trying their Drying Lotion when I finish this product. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my more detailed review I wrote about it in my Skincare Routine post.


5537	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Really pleased with TOPPIK hair building fibers.. I would prefer to have a thick head of hair but since that is not the case I am very thankful for this product. It gives me the confidence to go out and feel comfortable without worrying that people are staring at my thinning hair.
7139	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I always have ingrown hair on my neck which usually leads to razor rash. I wasn't exactly sure how to apply this product, but it was just as simple as putting it on after the shave. My neck feels so much better after applying it, and somehow it really helps with the ingrown hair issues between shaves. Who would have thought?!?!  Well played, Anthony!
3. No-Rinse Cleansing Water: I have not had a need to use this product on the baby but it is for when you have to give the baby a bath without water available. This disappeared in my hands kind of the way gel hand cleanser does, it kind of evaporates away.  I can see how this would be useful for diaper changes away from a bathroom when baby wipes just don't seem like enough.
- moisturizers my skin - not overly so, just the right amount
This stuff was just perfect for my hair. It held it in place while still being movable and touchable. Friends commented on how my hair looked. It washed out nicely and didn't leave flakes of gunk on my brush and comb.

1619	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Not as dark green as my screen showed so some disappointment there.  It's more of a dark teal. But that's a monitor issue. Pretty color and I find that overall Zoya dries quickly, lasts well and doesn't chip easily.
1355	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works great to hide thinning hair patches. Just shake on the areas that are thinning. Works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. Also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. Withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. Washes out easily with shampoo and water. Will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. Is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. For it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. Best for concealing small patches. Causes me no irritation and don't even know I'm using it.
So, instead of sudsing up my poof, I took some into the cupped palm of my hand and rubbed it over my leg like you would with a foaming shave gel. Lo' and behold...it creates a foam lather! Not thick and crazy like Skintimite or anything but enough that your entire leg is covered in a white foamy lather. I let it sit for a few seconds and then went at it with my razor.

1095	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love that this helps with my shiny face. I have to touch up every couple of hours and this makes it easier and more discreet.
5199	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice feeling cream.  Definitely not heavy or greasy.  Since it doesn't have sunscreen in it, I use it at night and my face still feels moisturized in the morning.
8573	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great moisturizer that is not to heavy or light. When I use a lot of moisturizers they ither cause me to have styes because they are too rich or they are to light and my skin has dry spots. I suggest using the scooper that comes with it for measurement reasons. Fill the concave area and scrape it flush on the top edge and it gives you just the right amount to use on face and neck. Does not irritate my skin at all.
4694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this cream. Goes on easy and dries fast. I have noticed a difference in my lines and spots
5156	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nia 24 was recommended by my Derm for sun damage  it works so well I bought other products from the same line  The brown spots have disappeared to only a shadow  and Im sure they will continue to fade out  also used on my hands with the same results
I tend to get a much better coverage with this than the liquid foundation I was using and the color is spot on.  It has even helped to cover up some of the redness in my skin tone.

5522	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	easy to apply, did not need all of the other tools that i purchased with it.
I have given this four stars due to texture, application, time of wear, and performance for the price.

1997	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The color is nice and stays on a long time unlike other polishes I have tried. Would definitely buy this again.
6933	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great
3916	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Although I want to avoid as much as I can using formaldehyde I can not stay away from O.P.I. The strengthener helps my thin nails stay strong although the only one I do not like is the Matte finish.
It smells like grapes mixed with ecstasy. It's something you won't want to stop smelling, though you probably shouldn't spray too much of it given the cost. This is perfect for going out as your date will be drawn to the smell, but probably won't be able to discover that it's you right off the bat. Upon discovering that you're the source of the scent, I assume euphoria will ensue.
3641	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't believe I found this for such a good price. I was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer. My hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him. It's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering more soon.
Biggie is no smell!!!
4181	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This seems to be working well so far.  I have very oily skin and the previous type I used would leave dry patches, this one does not.

2562	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have waist length very fine hair, moderately thick. It is about 50% white. It tends to frizz and flyaway although on the flip side is very prone to over conditioning. I have never used this product before. It isn't advertised specifically for my hair issues but I thought I'd give it a try.
This works just as well, if not better, than what I have from the dermatologist, and it's not as harsh on my skin. I love that you can layer it and treat pin-point treatment by type of acne. It allows me to balance my (normally) very dry skin while still treating my acne. I also (strangely) love the strong camphor smell of the drying lotion. I feel like I'm in a fancy spa.
4676	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	LOVE this stuff. NEVER go to bed without slathering it on :)
3616	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have rosacea and whenever my face feels red I use this water and helps a lot.
2941	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Good stuff.  A little goes a L O N G way so a tube last quite a while, at least for me.  Others have written all the positives.  My only complaint is I shave every day.  My beard is not dark.  As such, and unlike a cream, it can be hard to see where I've shaved.  Not a huge deal but I find myself going over the same lines to be sure.
8517	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am a big fan of Mario Badescu's products and was eager to try this moisturizer. It seemed very heavy but was light on my face and left me glowing without feeling greasy. It keeps my skin moisturized all day. This is a small bottle but will probably last a month considering the drop I need to use daily. I can't wait to see how it works during winter when I usually develop dry patches on my cheeks and chin. Hopefully, this will take care of it. I will make sure to update then.
5791	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Got rid of my dry red spots immediately. I love Avene.
As excellent as this product is for me and other blonde/gray women, it's the shape of the brows that make a huge difference in the brightness of the eyes.
4639	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I really like this, even though it has likely gotten me hooked on a very expensive facial serum.  It's too soon to really tell if it does much for fine lines and wrinkles, but it definitely improved the look and feel of my skin after the first use.
464	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Dermablend products are the bomb. They cover up scars, acne and discolorations or flaws on your face, but it doesn't feel heavy. If you want to use it as a sunscreen, you will need to apply every two hours. If you want to use as a foundation, you will need  to apply in layers and when done, use the powder to finish the look and set the look. You can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face This product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well. It also comes with a paddle so that you can apply in small amounts where needed.

6960	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	As one other reviewer said, "Nothing unwrinkles wrinkles." And to be honest, I don't have a lot of wrinkles to start with, so I won't comment at all about this product's effectiveness on wrinkles. BUT, my skin gets dry at times, and I'm not getting any younger...

9110	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very effective product.  Chip Skip helps my natural nail manicure last so much longer than without it.
Avobenzone (Sunscreen) 2.0%
3685	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My husband and I are both avid swimmers, and the chlorine just about does our hair in.  We both used this, on his short hair and my long hair, even though this is a "men's" brand.  Both of us were happy.  No tangles and there was a fullness when we rinsed it out that wasn't there before.
The directions suggest using the serum over moisturizer or instead of moisturizer.
7118	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	good product!!! I'm a DE safety razor wet shaver and wear a full beard. I like this product, because its clear when applied, so that you can view beard while shaving. End result a barber quality shave with zero irratation.
5531	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I did not see "fibers".  This is more like a colored, powdered hair "shampoo" that DOES add body, and does NOT leave white residue like a dry shampoo.  That said, I like this product.  I have fine, thin curly hair that will droop if I use heavy products.  I have tried a lot of body-building hair products, and many are just too weighty  Even Frizz-eeze is not great for me. So far, this is a winner..
MOISTURIZER ($20 individually):  This is the standout.  I've tried a number of moisturizers, from drug store to specialty items, and this is one of the best.  There is no greasy feel, and it sinks into the skin quickly.  My skin feels softer for having used it.  Five Stars.
991	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like these. They seem to be good quality. These keep getting more expensive these glycolics.
8765	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	good


Here's a list of the ingredients:
3761	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I hate to be one of the few that hate this product. I can't think of one thing I liked about it. Some of the cons I experienced are: leaves a chalky white ghost face (I am already pretty fair), broke me out terribly after first use (maybe it's hard to wash off?), didn't settle into my skin/remained greasy throughout the day, had a greasy thick silicone feel upon application, did not look good under my makeup and caused it to flake and look weird  (maybelline fit me matte). For reference my skin is oily/combination and acne prone, reactive/sensitive, fair to fair medium, and normally I use olay complete sensitive spf 15 with no real problem I was just looking for a higher spf and a less greasy formula.

Anyway please try this, and I'm hoping you'll have the same experience as me.  I swear by it now.
6710	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This hot tools probably works great on longer hair.  Mine is too shot for this product (its down to my shoulders).  It gets very hot very fast so be careful.  I liked the long, easy swivel cord, makes it easy to wrap your hair around the barrel. Also the end of the barrel has a safe non thermal tip so you don't have to worry about burning your fingers. The hair is held tightly and there are even spring clips that are added in the package.  I am going to give this to my daughter who has really long hair. The curls will be better and more pronounced with her hair length.  When I used it, my hair just had body with only a little bit of curl.
9406	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone's polish collection!
1599	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	gorgeous mid tone blue, very bright! finish is shiny and multi colored, like in mother-of-pearl ( just like in "katy" by zoya). application is easy, opaque in 1 coat, wears really well without chipping for a week with base and top coat..
890	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm really impressed with this product. It is cooling and refreshing. It goes on like a water mist and wouldn't mess up makeup. In the middle of the day when I can't apply a moisturizer conveniently, a spritz of this spring water would freshen up my skin. I also use it just before applying a moisturizer at night to help seal in the moisture. It is an amazing product.
6075	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this product! Place it in your fridge for a better "awake" cooling feeling. I will definitely order again!!
344	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm happy with this. It has good coverage and matches my fair skin well. I apply it with a beauty blender and then blend with a foundation brush. I have sensitive skin and have not noticed any irritation. A little goes a LONG way.
2960	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm not a man but, apparently, I read as carefully (i.e., carelessly) as my husband does.  This is, it seems, a facial scrub for men.  That slipped right by me.  But, heck, I'm not giving it to my husband.  I love this stuff.  He can get his own.  It's really, really gritty so you get your money's worth.  A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel squeaky clean and soft.

4222	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very happy.  Received the product very quickly.

1476	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Gorgeous deep purple amethyst color. Looks more berry in the photo here, but I still really love this jewel-toned purple it turned out to be.
1049	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This product is useless.  When I use the pad that comes with it, it takes off make up as I put the powder on.  Forget waiting 2 minutes.  Foundation leaves a permanent make-up stain on the pad even after washing which tells me it really is soaking up the foundation rather than buffing it. I tried this powder several different ways: with 3 (yes 3 different Dermablend foundations I also reviewed) another brand foundation, and on skin with no make up. It works best and looks best on a make up less face.  Next it works okay with another brand's foundation.  Not as much comes off and I'm here is a little bit of glow. Finally, it does nor work at all with Dermablend foundations. That's right. The pad takes off the most make-up and has no glow with the very make up with which it should be designed to work well.  I tried using a brush made for compact powders, and it was a little better across the board.  In no scenario did my make up last any longer or prevent any more shine than using loose or compact powder from another brand.  It makes no sense to buy this compact.

I only used about three short sweeps of the brush on each cheek. It did not make me look like a little girl playing dress up with her mom's make up. Also, I like the idea that I could stack all of the make up if I brought a bunch of different products by this line. The back of the blush one has side tracks and grooves to stack with instructions on how to stack them.
A question for users may be the cost. There are similar products available at a lower cost, with alpha hyrdroxy acid as an active ingredient. One may wish to compare the other ingredients to determine ones comfort level with them.

This Xen-Tan mousse is ideal for fair skin people who aren't going for a dark "tan" look and instead want a healthy looking natural golden brown tint. Thus tanning mousse rids me of that glow-in-the-dark white look on my legs and gives me a nice golden color, yet it's so natural I'm not sure anyone else would notice. In fact, the color is so natural that applying the mousse to my legs makes them look the same color as my arms, which I don't try to tan but are darker than my legs just from walking around in the California sun. Two applications of the mousse still results in a natural color, but turns my skin a little deeper shade of a beautiful golden brown color. This tanner doesn't produce a dark "tan" like some other Xen-Tan tanners. But this Xen-Tan med/dark weekly mousse is my personal favorite for my body (especially my legs) as it results in such a healthy golden color compatible with my fair skin. It's a shade that suits me year round because it looks so natural that it won't appear odd even in the coldest months.

Middle aged skin with redness reacts so well to daily use - redness has gone away and my skin looks brighter and healthy with great hydration. I use this after cleansing at night, and again after cleansing in the morning (given we are in the harsh winter months in the midwest). Before applying I use the Chamomile Cleansing Lotion and think the combination of the two have had the most positive impact on my skin for reducing and eliminating redness, dryness, and dullness.

This moisturizer is working really well for my skin in winter. It does not have a heavy and sticky feel yet it is creamy enough to keep my skin moisturized and saves it from redness. I am using it every morning and night in the winter, and I find it much better than liquid moisturizers for this season. Maybe in the summer it may feel too heavy, and I will switch to using it in the night after cleansing. It's expensive but it can last 4 months with once a day use so probably still worth it.
Choose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area.  It will look like you are not doing much of anything.  Trust me, you are.
9924	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a "croap" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the "Marco method" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most "feminine" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

Like other Mario Badescu products, the liquid looks thick but feels smooth and non-greasy once you rub it into your skin. The best part is that it has SPF 15, which means I can use this as sunscreen, not just moisturizer. SPF 15 is good for everyday use, when you don't expect to be exposed to a lot of heat and sunshine, but you still want something to protect your face when you go out for work or casual walks.

The smell, which is somewhat astringent and chemical, lingers.  Even if I liked the scent itself better, I prefer fragrances that soften over time, rather than.....stay there.  I am aware that what people find pleasant, scent-wise, and how long they like a scent to linger, are highly individual things.  That said, I would definitely not recommend this lotion to people who don't like strong, rather chemical fragrances. This one is cloying enough to give the user a headache.

It's quite expensive compared to regular shampoos, but a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. It should last a good while. Outside of the price, this really is the ideal shampoo. If you don't mind treating yourself, this is a good daily shampoo, and will become a staple in my daily life.

I used a small amount and distributed with my finger easily on my face. After that, you will need to have a foundation and then the setting powder.

With regards to color protection, my hairdresser did a semi-permanent color rinse a few weeks back to try to get rid of some of the brassiness (in her professional opinion this would look best and I trust her judgment).  And, that is still working, despite washing my hair every day in between.  My roots (with permanent dye) are also looking good.  So I am happy with the color protection aspect of this product.
As for the products they were very nice. For this review I tested them along with my husband. My signif-other thought that the facial wash was a bit drying --but it has been a harsh winter, so this might be fine for summer. The toner reminded me of all the less expensive toners that I've purchased for my daughter and myself. It's translucent blue and minty.

I love it to use on my neck to keep it nice and soft and wrinkle free. Odor free for sensitive skin. Mario Badescu makes great skin care products. I love most of them.

9917	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.
Tocade surprised me. Some people say Tocade is dated, and I have to agree, at least at the opening.

Only then do I do my contouring and/or highlight. Do not do your setting powder after contour and/or highlight because it will ruin all your shadowing effects.  I then apply lipliner and then lipstick and finish the whole thing with a really good setting spray for double insurance. This technique will ensure that your makeup lasts all day or all night.

Is an AMAZING makeup setter and even better at helping me apply my bb cream or foundation: After applying all my moisturizer, serums, sunscreen etc and let that absorb I spray my face with this stuff several times (maybe 4 which might be too much for some people but I like it) and let it sit on my skin for 10-30 seconds as it absorbs. But, before it's fully absorbed and dried I then apply my bb cream (or foundation/concealer etc) with my fingertips (you can use a brush of course if you want) and it blends sooo smoothly and really gives more of a flawless, hydrated, airbrushed look. It is not oily looking at all but just perfectly blends my makeup and I can't believe how much better my makeup looks since I started using this to apply my bb cream. I've also used it to set makeup after fully finishing applying it and it does stay on and stay put longer. The idea with the bb cream application is similar to a makeup sponge dipped in water--I guess it does the same type of thing.

I decided to order the Burberry Brit Sheer since my wife likes to wear perfume and I figured she could try it. I have found that it is a scent that I actually like. It is not just an overpowering floral scent, but has the fragrance of citrus as well as floral. This was an interesting scent for a wearable fragrance. No scent of stale beer.

955	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Does a good job at protecting from the sun, but is a cream, not a lotion, very thick. Leaves the face with a white coating, certainly with a greasy look and feel, even clumps up as if looking like your skin is peeling.
This cleanser is creamy and non-irritating, but it really does slough off the junky top layer of skin.  It's truly magical.  I'd buy stock in it if I could.
3350	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Thanks.....
I'll repurchase when my other cleansers are depleted. This stuff is awesome.
The doctor told me this is the only cream that has been FDA approved to lift and improve the skin tone of the aging neck. I don't know whether or not that's true, and I won't take her word for it, or base my review on what she's said.  I can only say that the cream had a very light pleasant scent and felt very nice, absorbing well and quickly. Based on this I would recommend the cream, but based on lifting and firming of the neck, I can't recommend it.  I will continue to look, and would appreciate hearing about anyone else's experiences with products that do work really well on the neck for lifting and tightening the skin.

So why only four stars?  As mentioned in my subject line, I absolute HATE the bottle--so much so that I was tempted to take off more than just one star for that!  Apparently, the bottle is "a piece of art" designed by Fabien Baron.  Yes, it is pretty to look at, but as far as using it goes, it is extremely non-functional.  First, I'm not surprised that the designer is male--does he think women have a single perfume bottle that we display as an art piece?  No, we put the bottles together in drawers, on bathroom shelves, etc.  Not only is this bottle an awkward shape and size but also it does not stand flat on its own--that's right, it ROCKS!  I could actual live with that issue if the atomizer part worked correctly.  Unfortunately, just under the spray nozzle, there is a very cheap plastic piece (I will try to add a photo of this later), I think which is supposed to hold the cap on snugly.  Well, this piece does not work properly, as it is loose and leaks.  If I try to push the cap all the way back on as designed, it makes things worse.  Very frustrating!

A little goes a long way and I think the bottle is a fairly generous portion to last a few months easily. There is no unusual scent and it rinses off completely.

2187	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've had nice hair dryers in the past, but this one takes the cake and lives up to its reputation. Lightweight, short barrel, slim handle make it easy to use. And the highest heat setting gets HOT - curling iron hot. This works for me because I only do blowouts on my wavy hair twice a week or so, but you may want to do the middle setting if you use it every day. The only part I don't like is that it doesn't come with a diffuser (which I knew about ahead of time, but even cheaper brands include one).
I like the texture and thought this applied smoothly and without leaving a residue, though it did take a moment or two to fully dry.  You don't need a whole lot to get full coverage of your face and neck, either, so one bottle should last a long time.
This really is the orange color from the photo, which is sort of unusual for a toner, especially one without artificial dyes.  So I think there are tons of fruit-based antioxidants in this, which is awesome for a little extra measure of protection from free radical damage (e.g., from sun exposure).  Of course you should also use a sunscreen when using this product.

The rosacea line by Pevonia is definitely an investment, as the products are not inexpensive, but I have to say, it is the only product line that gives me relief!!
415	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Okay, so by now I've tried a whole range of Dermablend products - mostly good, some meh. But the cover crme is the best of the bunch and truly what I think of and what I want when I think of Dermablend - which is FULL coverage, anywhere, everywhere. If you can only get one product from their line, this is the one to get. If you want the product that made Dermablend its name, this is the product to get. Of course, first you have to match your skin tone. Keep it mind that your skin has different shades from part to part. The skin on my face is different from the skin on my leg or on my hand. You have to have at least two shades, if not three so you can blend to the perfect match to whatever area you want to cover.
Note: Would probably not work as well on bald heads or severe hair loss.
8662	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this along with the Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser. After I wash my face with the cleanser, I follow it up with this. The consistency is like water, and I would compare it to a toner or an astringent. However, this feels like it does that same job, but it is much less harsh feeling on my skin. I really like the fresh and clean smell it has to it.

3541	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This product is very easy to use and does exactly what it promised to do. However, the application sponge is a bit hard to use and gets dirty very easily hence why I only give it 4 stars. I prefer to apply this product using a powder brush. I put it on after my moisturizer and before my foundation. I found the best foundation to use with this is bare minerals since it blends better with another powder. I finish with maybellbe fit setting powder and I'm good to go all day with my skin looking poreless and matte. For the acne property, I use Mario badescu drying lotion at night but that's difficult to hide with makeup during the day so this special healing powder is my go-to daytime acne treatment. The sulfur ingredient in it works just as well as acne sulfur soap bar but without the smell.
This is a product I don't want to live without! You can also use it on your face as a healing spot treatment or on your cuticles if they feel dry. It is a good all-purpose, skin healing formula that will impress.

My wife has been using this for about a week. She applies it to cotton balls and then wipes away her makeup with the moistened cotton balls saturated with the solution. The scent is mildly reminiscent of a rose water type of scent. Although she is happy with it, she frets that it takes quite a bit of the solution to remove her makeup (and she doesn't wear excessive amounts of makeup I might add) and she fears that the cost of this, being rather high compared to what she normally uses, that she doubts she would purchase this again in the future.

I've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed AFTER application!). The stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. As far as the colors, after some trial and error, I mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. I've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and I had to blend the medium and light to make it work. I ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so I can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.
I will update again after using it for awhile....

There is no scent, it's not greasy feeling, and it absorbed quickly into my skin. I was previously using Philosophy's When Hope is Not Enough serum. I found the two to be very comparable, so the deciding factor for me comes down to price. Here on Amazon, Juice Beauty's serum is $52 for 1 oz. Philosphy's is $30.96 for 1 oz.  That's a savings of $20. Since I really didn't see any observable difference in my skin switching from one serum to the other, I have to go back to the lovely and less expensive Philosophy.

The reason is that it is not clear if it had a seal, and the top surface of soap had concentric circles with not very sharp edges. Could be the way it was manufactured, or it someone could have used it at least once: after I used it a couple of times, it still looked the same. Otherwise great sensation, great foam, great scent.

I know that Pureology is a favorite of the makeupalley hair forum and I've seen it recommended numerous times.  It's expensive but so worth it. It also smells wonderful, which is definitely a plus.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I've wasted countless dollars on, so it's nice to find a brand that actually delivers on its promises.  I can truthfully say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  It's shiny and soft and really healthy looking.  Now that I've used it for about a month, the difference in my hair is amazing!  It looked and felt like straw before and now that's no longer the case.  I color my hair regularly and use a high volume of peroxide, but you'd never know it after using these products.  They have transformed my hair into an almost virgin state.  I will continue to use these products and happily pay a premium for doing so.  My hubby even commented on how nice my hair looks (this was after a fantastic haircut, lol!).  The fact that he actually noticed the state of my hair means that these products are definitely working.  I knew they were but it's nice to be on the receiving end of a compliment.

I have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night before going to bed.  In fact, I feel confident that I could wash it more often as needed.  I squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish, speckled cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face.  I gently rub it into my skin.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

It did not condition my hair at all. I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water. My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized. It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful.

It seems to make a difference in my under-eye area, at least for a while. It tingles a bit and seems to make my eyes not show my fatigue as much as they have been. I will probably buy more when this is gone.

It has a pleasant smell (does contain perfume) but did not irritate her skin.

Just used it today, as a matter of fact, with the usual positive results.
It starts out a rich vanilla with a powdery iris holding it together.  It is not sugar sweet but unctuous like an aged whisky.  There is a rose, magnolia & jamine with cedar and patchouli undertones.  The cedar/patchouli is brightened with the lemony bergamot.  I think some men could wear this since it's not a super fem scent.  This is a gourmand for people who don't often like gourmand - like me.  It doesn't have frooty tooty, cloying sweetness.  It is elegant & delicious smelling.  VERY vanilla but not as VANILLA as it used to be.

It cleans your skin thoroughly without drying it out which means it won't irritate your skin problems like acne, rash, sun burn, etc.  It cleans and disinfect naturally and leaves skin nice and smooth without causing secondary breakouts from other harsh acne products.

2653	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am not the sort of person who retains scent well. Typical of what is said of me is 'wow, you smell great. What are you using?' The answer is typically soap and water or a light cologne or perfume.  Burberry Weekend is a lovely scent. It is on the fruity side, but quite honestly it seems a bit different depending on the user. When I received this I put this to a better test since I had two friends visiting. It was slightly different on each of us. We all liked it, thought it was pleasant, and yet it seemed just a bit different. We all thought this had fruity overtones with a little floral added to the mix, but it was more distinct on the other two ladies. In my case it was gentle and not nearly as distinctive. It was perfect for me because it was not even remotely cloying yet stayed with me. It did not elicit sneezing from my husband, and he actually liked the scent which he thought was 'Michigan fruit orchard' meets 'citrus grove'. Have to concur that this is a bright, sunny scent that is refreshing and clean.

3076	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	A somewhat "perfumey" scented lotion type white balm in attractive packaging. It is supposed to help with anti aging of my neck area. First thing I have to say is that it could be a little more generously  portioned since it's for the entire neck area I need to use more of it than what I would normally disperse, for say, an eye cream. So seeing as how this product is only 1.6 oz I did not to get even a full month's use out of it when applying it everyday to the neck/throat area.
Again, I didn't realize this set was geared towards men but it's okay!
I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.

I use it only at night and it has done a good job of handling the dry skin around my eyes especially as it gets into colder weather. Like most juice products I don't love the smell of it but I enjoy the product itself. Considering this is an eye product it is nice to know I am using a product around my eyes that isn't full of chemicals.

It also didn't leave me fire truck red like so many other products. Also it doesn't have a chemical scent like other products. I love how "clean" the ingredients are compared to similar products. I'm not plagued with tons of wrinkles or fine lines, so I'm using this more as a preventative. So far, I'm impressed. I'll up date my review after continued use.

It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat.

2441	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	When this arrived, the dryer smelled pretty bad. I hadn't even turned it on yet but I kept picking up an electrical/burning scent. It filled my bathroom when I put it in there, so I was skeptical to turn it on and use it. The first few times I used the dryer, it smelled, but gradually declined. My thought was maybe it just needed to be broken in. Although it wasn't a good impression (having read previous reviews w/ electrical problems), I am loving it now. It's very soft to the touch, easy to use and dries my hair pretty quickly. I was using an old conair dryer that finally died, so I was happy to upgrade. There are 3 temperature settings which I like, and I don't think the "Hot" gets so hot that it burns your head, hair and leaves you seeing smoke. It is a little heavy as previous reviews have mentioned, but I don't find that it is difficult to hold for the couple minutes I am using it. I never had a problem w/ frizz, so I can't speak to that. I don't notice any additional damage to my hair, and that's all that matters to me. I am just enjoying the couple minutes my long hair takes to dry using this, versus several minutes with other dryers. It's also quieter than my last dryer as well. Overall, I am liking this dryer a lot and would purchase again.
This has a lotion-like consistency (not too thin, not too thick).  It absorbs into the skin without leaving a white layer (like many mineral sunscreens do).  There is a bit of a residue left over, but it is not particularly troublesome and it doesn't discolor your clothing if it comes into contact.  When it comes time to shower, it is actually possible to get this off.
2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
A bit of trivia:  Rochas is now owned by Procter & Gamble (2003).
It does seem to dry out and remove acne overnight though
I now plan on adding to my collection!! I have never come across a candle that smells as good lit as unlit, most times the scent is subtle if at all!! Not so with these lafco candles! Also they have a suggested candle for each room in the house so I think I will try a lavender version next to promote a relaxing bedroom atmosphere and when I try it I will post a review!

I noticed years ago that my manicurist always applied a base coat that acts as a layer to receive the nail color I want. Some base layers are glossy, I prefer those that are not. This Opi base is perfect. I start by applying  one coat to my left hand and then by the time my right hand is done, the left is ready for the nail color. The base is a necessity for me, and keeps my manicure you'd for at least a week. I usually use only Opi and Essie products, so I do know that I am using quality products.

Please don't discontinue this.
5740	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My hair is naturally curly but has been thinning for several years. It finally reached a point where it was noticeable.  Being a woman in the performing arts I realized I needed to take action before it became too obvious.  I started to use Minoxidil, thickening shampoos, and hair vitamins. My hair is healthier and there are signs things might be getting better. However, the process takes too long so I wanted something in the meantime that I could use to help me regain my confidence.  I found it in Toppik. So easy to use and the results are immediate.  I even went out in windy weather and wasn't afraid that my thin spots would show.  Whether or not the Minoxidil works, I know I can use this product for as long as I want and no one, not even my husband, notices! Get the 10 gram first to be sure you like it, but then go ahead and get the bigger bottles with holding fiber hairspray.

The end result was fantastic. While it did take a little longer than I'm used to, my skin feels smooth and moisturized. I will look into getting the Jack Black brush to match in the near future. I'm hoping using a hot towel pre-shave and using a brush to create a more noticeable wet lather will improve my experience.

3980	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My skin is oily and breaks out often I use the triacneal 3 times a week for breakout but, I needed a good moisturizer because my skin was losing volume.  This cream is very rich so a little goes a long way.  After about a week I noticed my face plumping up and looking very hydrated. No more looking my age.  I will purchase the this again.
This works with a combination of nutrition, vitamins, oils and other things to strengthen the skin and keep it moist.  I can't complain about any of the contents and they appear to have done a good job blending them together in one effective compound.  It is expensive, a small tube costs a lot of money, but many of the things that work are.  I decided to let my sister have some of this stuff, and she posted a picture on FB, which I've attached here.  FYI, my sister turns 61 in June, so she was quite pleased with the result, I think she's going to save up for more, for her this is probably a five star product!

This gets my skin very clean without leaving any sort of residue.  It's a good product and I would purchase it again.
For skin health, Dermatologists recommend to hydrate the skin before your creams,etc.,so that the absoration rate is greater. Seems to work in that regard as well. This is a clean, natural toner after cleansing and the minerals are good for the skin.

9376	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice color
It has a sprinkle method that I've used on both dry and wet hair.  I am a medium blonde with some brown tones.  The light brown was a good match.  It helps conceal a larger part or thinning areas of the hair.  The small ones are great for travel too.
9312	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a good product. It does help whiten your teeth. Is it better than the $6 whitening mouthwash at the grocery store? Not really.

9103	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This curling iron really works on my hard-to-curl shoulder-length hair. The drugstore model I had bought does not. Perhaps it's because this one can get so hot (adjustable temp)and/or the metal it's made with (it's heavier than the one from the drug store) seems to be higher quality. And it does not damage or singe my hair. It works so well, the larger 1 1/2" version may have done the job, don't know...will stay with this one. Perhaps the slightly smaller, but still fairly large, barrel makes it so I don't have to hold it as long, maybe requiring less heat? The only thing I wish were different is that it does not have an automatic shut-off, and I keep leaving it on by accident--which would be a problem with young children in the house. Am wondering if the spare springs are needed because others do the same? Anyway, this curling iron has dramatically improved the look of my fine hair. I use it to add body at the ends, not for curly curls, but am sure it would also work well for curlier styles.
To echo other reviewers, the jar does last a long time.  I apply it about 10x a week and still have so much left!  When I get close to running low, I will absolutely purchase this again (and again).
POSITIVE

This "balm" is more of an oily gloss. I am not sure what else to even compare it to. It does not last on the lips long at all. When it does wear off, there is no moisturization left behind and I feel like I need something on my lips immediately. It is much too this in consistency and too shiny/greasy. Lips do feel soft for those very few minutes before it wears off, but it doesn't feel like it actually penetrates the lips to really moisturize.

3660	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	So far, of all the tanning solutions, sprays, creams, etc....that I have tried I find this one works the best.  I get a nice, even realistic-looking tan and the only orangish areas are on the bony parts of my body (ankle bones, tops of my feet) where I neglected to wipe the tanning mousse off. So, overall it tans well and lasts me about a week before I notice it fading away.  I can even shave my legs and still keep my tan.
915	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My hair used to be thick and wavy. As I've aged, it's thinner and finer, so much so that a scrunchie or hair clip slips out.  I tried SO many products I can't even list them all.  Serums, mousses, beach sprays, etc.  I did have some success with Philip B's Maui Wowie spray, but then I tried this.
9121	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it
4859	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Provides great coverage and doesn't change color. It lasts all day without touch ups.
The can is small and stylish in appearance.  It has about 1/2 the amount of foam you would get in a typical can of shave foam at the drugstore.  The foam is discharged from the can through several small slits in the spray head that give it a unique feel and appearance while using it.  The scent is very clean-smelling and pleasant.  It is light enough that it would not interfere with usage of aftershave or cologne if desired.  For the purposes of testing this product's ability to prevent irritation I let my beard grow for several days and used a many days old double edged Derby blade in a Merkur razor.  The foam applies easily, and a little goes a long way.  I allowed it to sit on my face for about a minute or so before I started shaving.  What I noticed immediately is the shave was very close, as good as I can get with a high quality brushed on shaving soap.  There was absolutely zero irritation, not even in the neck area, despite multiple shaving passes on my face in differing directions.  After I rinsed it off my face felt very smooth and moisturized.  I enjoyed the scent and moisturized sensation so much that I did not bother applying any aftershave afterward.  The next day I found that my face continued to feel very nicely moisturized.

Bought my second one through amazon and it broke less than one year.. The barrel does NOT heat up anymore ... Makes me question the quality control ...
9544	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very nice.  Just the right amount of heaviness plus absorption that I want in a night cream.
As far as my head went it works really well however I did nick myself at least once every shave. Nothing that didn't stop bleeding on its own bedre the end of the shave.
3184	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great for straightening but kills volume, even of you try to add it later with tools & heat.
8202	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  It is safe to use and lasts all week long.

9839	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this perfume. I have Skin by Clean and I love it too. This smells floral and powdery but it is not overwhelming. Only issue is that the staying power is poor. I would suggest reapplying it throughout the day.
For the right price, I would buy this product. After one try, free in exchange for an honest review, I'd try it again provided the cost is not too high.
As for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can make any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter rod. The price on Amazon was the best - beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that cater only to professionals.

6309	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful to use every day for combination skin
So with all the caveats, why do I still think this is a good cream? Well, you will get a good shave with the cream and it will last you a long time, making it worth your money if you follow one rule, always apply it with a badger brush. The cream says that it can be used with or without a brush, but to me there is a marked difference in the quality of the shave if you don't use a badger brush. If you do use one, you will get a nice lather, with a pleasant smell, that will give you a close and comfortable shave and the tub will actually last you a long time, 3 or 4 months with daily shaving. However, you must use with a brush. It takes time to learn how to properly use a brush to create a proper lather for wetshaving but it is something worth learning to get a good shave and on the plus side you will use about a fourth of the amount of product that you would use if you just used your fingers to apply it to your face. Overall, this cream is a big step up from what you will find at your average drugstore.

3538	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the smell of this product and a little goes a long way. If you use to much, your hair looks greasy. I use some before I blow dry and a little after I iron my hair.

3910	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The finish is great, it's just the multiple coating I don't like, it a lot to keep up. I feel like it just builds up on my nail polish. But if you're just concerned about the finish then its perfect.

7165	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I originally bought this about 20 yrs ago from QVC (after an article appeared in a magazine and it completely sold out at Nordstrom's). I remember paying about $25-30 for it, back then. I almost bought it from HSN (for about $30) recently, but found it here and I was soooo happy!!!! I love the natural, floral, botanical scent. I usually put it on, comb through, blow dry to get it penetrated and leave it on all nite. Then in the morning add a tiny bit of water and a handful of shampoo and "dry shampoo" it out, it usually takes a second shampooing after rinsing out the first. My hair ends up looking and feeling very soft, healthy, yet not limp, stray gray hairs somehow seem to blend in and it looks like I just had a haircut. I really love this product, am very happy to find it again and at such a great price, too.

7732	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Have to admit - this is a great serum
418	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	As with other Dermablend covers that I have tried, a very, very little of the product goes a very, very long way. The instructions recommend that you put a spot of it on the back of your hand and work the product to warm and loosen it; I think this is very good advice as the product really sticks to the first spot you put it on (including the back of your hand). The cover is 100% and still let's your skin look like skin. It is also water-proof, sweat-proof and practically soap-proof. It's really hard to get it off of skin (especially the back of your hand). Both the Reddish Tan and Toasted Brown can be used as a dark contour, even if your skin is pretty dark. I love how the Reddish Tan looks like dark suntan. There is no scent and I haven't had any breakouts or skin sensitivity, although I tend to have pretty tough skin and don't usually have any problems.

6925	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I have a multitude of "designer deodorants" and while this has absolutely NO SCENT it caused a reaction on my skin. I've never had this issue with ANY deodorant before however I will never purchase this deodorant again.
It did feel nice going on, and it smelled pleasant. But wear? Didn't do anything good for me.
I also used less makeup, just a smidge of CC here and there and a bit of concealer. The plumping of the skin made my skin look more radiant than usual. ME, Radiant???

5700	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. Even with her discount it was almost $25. But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots. Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used Toppik.
Note about the application process: When using this setting powder, cover the area with foundation very well and allow it to set for a few minutes. Then gently brush off the excess to get the best results.
5771	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This cream deodorant works great for me ,the scent is nice not to strong and has lasted through the day even after a workout it still provided me with the protection I was hoping for I would order this again

It doesn't irritate my reactive skin & seems to help hydrate/moisturize without breakouts.
8186	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried many different face products, but by far this one is the best.  I continue to purchase it, as it not only hydrates the skin, but protects it from the sun.  I would highly recommend this product.

This spray does not make your skin feel taught or dry after it dries like some setting/facial mists I have tried in the past. It leaves your skin plump, moisturized and comfortable.

6636	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I read all the 5 star reviews on this curling iron and I went for it.
Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.

The other thing I want to note is that I felt like I needed to rinse my face after using this product because if felt very slightly sticky/filmy.

My family tends to stay with one scent forever, taking a few detours here and there, but always returning to the one that works best.  It has a clean light fragrance that is not heavy.  The spray on this bottle works perfectly everytime.  The girls really apprciate how he smells as well.  Another note:  This size can travel with you in your quart baggie when you go through security. I am still trying to find him a sample size when he travels for work. I purchase this for him every year on his birthday and for Christmas.
I'm no longer concerned should someone take my picture from a a facial picture to one from behind.
786	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	First thing I noticed about this foundation was the price. Wowzers. I haven't spent that much on one beauty product in forever. Or maybe even never.

6865	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Dries out pimples really well. Helps them come to a head if they have not yet. I like that I can truly spot treat because since my face is dry from all the acne products I don't to apply spot treatment anywhere but where I need it. With creams although I try to spot treat it ends up being a larger area than the bump site. I am very happy with it. Will continue to use it. I don't know that it works any better than when I use the Proactiv sulfur mask as a spot treatment. I will put a dab of that on a pimple before bed and it dries it out pretty good the next day. And it is much cheaper since it comes "free" with the proactiv 3 piece kit. But even so I bought this and I like it and still would buy it again.
1188	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.
Lastly I was probably the most apathetic about it. My skin is drier so I didn't mind the thickness, especially right before bed. It still took a little longer than I would have liked to absorb, but I didn't have any major problems like my gf. But that being said I also didn't see any major benefit over this and any other thicker natural moisturizer I've used from kiehls or even neutrogena Norwegian formula.

The result?

Amazing product!

If other acne sufferers are looking for an alternative or natural cure, I would like to mention that neem and zinc (in combination) have worked well for me in the cast.
Update:


It gave my skin a mask like look. It just didn't suit me at all. I'm not sure if it's just a reaction with my own skin chemistry or if other people also find this product looking very artificial after application.
It will last all day, the only draw back, it will wash off if your hair gets too wet.  It is also best to use hair spray to keep it in place.
I look forward to using it more and reporting back on the effect on my skin.  So far, am pleased with the product.

5451	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This Vichy Soothing After Shave Balm was not what I expected as I assumed it would be a brisk, menthol-like, alcohol based refresher.  What I did get was a very soothing, non greasy, practically unscented lotion which felt good on my face.  I didn't have to use more than a few drops as it went on so easily.  This is another excellent product from a reliable manufacturer.
9489	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Based on the fact that I previously used this eyecream and then stopped because of the price  (bad decision on my part), I'm glad to start using it again.  Really, it's worth the price as a little goes a long way and it does help eliminate fine wrinkles under one's eyes.
4638	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Definitely not for sensitive skin! My hands are not particularly sensitive, unlike my face and neck, so I tried this on the back of one hand. It is has a lovely moist, but not shiny finish. It has a very faint herbal/lemony scent. My hand looks so much better than the one I didn't apply it on. It does itch a bit though, an hour after I applied it. I will use this only on tough skin, like the outer parts of my arms, and backs of my hands, both of which have not benefited from the religious application of sunscreen my face and neck have gotten. I just won't be able to use it on my face, neck or chest. Sigh

The Mrs. says it's a light floral scent that's very fresh.  She loves that it manages to be long-lasting without being overbearing or overly strong even when first applied.  The scent is classy and even though it's floral it's still a youthful scent.  She really loves it.

But, I do want to go on record as a long-time user of Nail Envy.  I stand by this product.  For example, I was given a gel manicure--just one!  My nails were severely damaged after removal of that manicure.  Everything I touched caused my nails to break and split.  Because I know what Nail Envy can do, I applied a coat to my nails every other day.  My nails are long, beautiful, strong, and healthy again.

We are talking full on bulbous pink-white eruptions, the likes of which I haven't seen since 8th grade. For reference, I am now 42. When you have rosacea, the last thing you want to see is more pink marks on your face, no matter what their clinical description might be!  It is a decent moisturizer so I now use it as a hand cream. My hands and nails are in great condition,now, so at least this purchase wasn't a complete cash loss.

If your not into flowery fragrances, this isn't for you. But even though it is a strong scent, the smell is beautiful and pleasing to the nose.
9486	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a light, smooth balm for the eye area.  Since Im in my 80s, the eye area tends to get dry, and regular moisturizer doesnt really do much to help this out.  I like this - its very silky, and doesnt cause any problems with my eyes.  Glad to have discovered it.  Im not looking for miracles at this point with wrinkles and bags, but my eye area definitely looks better and feels better.

Overall I can't speak highly enough of the Baxter products I've tried. Their pomades are perfect- including a hard water formula if that's a concern. The deoderant I got is the exact scent I've searched for my whole life. My travel shave brush is a perfect, compact solution when I need a full shave on the go. If this line continues to demonstrate this level of quality I'll be getting more items in the future.
3304	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	What's wrong with having hair that smells as delicious as a cupcake?  Absolutely nothing!!  This stuff is amazing.  If you love Pink Sugar, then you need this hair perfume.  It smells just like the perfume only a little lighter, and the oil makes my hair so soft and shiny. Also lasts a long time for me.  I can smell it all day long, especially when my hair blows in the wind.  If you think that the alcohol in perfumes damages your hair or if you just want more Pink Sugar products to get hooked on, buy this hair perfume now! You won't regret it.
The wash: This comes in a nice, practical plastic pump bottle. I found I only needed a single pump or less to wash my face very thoroughly. What scent there is reminds me of the old PhisoHex product from many years ago. It is non-greasy or oily and left my skin clean and dry feeling; ready for the next step.

Smear it all over your face and neck in an upward manner and go to bed. It's as simple as that.

I can imagine this sturdy razor delivering excellent shaves in the year 3009, unless our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ comes before then.

This product is great -- but it's not great for me all the time.  I have redness issues, so I only use this cleanser occasionally.  If your skin is a little heartier and you can tolerate stronger exfoliation, you will love this one.  If you're like me, you like to have it on hand but you can't use it every day.

I have just started using this product for past 3 days. Its amazing. Smells awesome and feels like its cleaning your face pretty well. I am also using some other products such as clearsonic etc so can not say that it is the sole reason my face is shining.

Does it work: yes, for me it works. It works best on those bumps I tend to get on my forehead or temples which are usually from hair products or face wash or something that is clogging my pores or irritating me. Those bumps respond to nothing except time, or this. It also works for me when a product or food causes me to get what I call a whitehead rash. This is when you get a lot of teeny whiteheads that are in clusters usually between my eyebrows, and in the area where people get smile lines (don't know what the area is called). These whiteheads can sometimes be itchy, they are very easy to pop but they come back what seems like immediately and more pop up each day until my skins irritation/allergy reaction naturally stops which for me is about a week or more. I feel like popping them just makes them spread so if they are tiny enough I leave them alone. I get these usually from chemical sunscreens, products with irritating essential oils (ironically just like this product has haha), or when I eat food I'm allergic to.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  I hadnt read the instructions yet.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have dry patches on spots.  Now I get it!  This particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  This product is soft and smooth.  It appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  It is lovely.
so, perhaps straight haired people get a better deal...but i still love it!
3069	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this with the Eye Collagen serum
I will say this, if you're using it as part of your shave routine and can afford the price difference and have regular access to Menscience Face Scrub, that's actually the best for Step 1. Problem is it's about 2-3 times more and is more for just pre-shave than whereas Liquidsand can be used all the time.
1423	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great after shave balm, it acts a bit anti-septic and soothing.  Leaves my face feeling cool and moist and smells nice.

I've been using it morning and night. I have a feeling that would be too often for me if I were using this during the summer here in Florida, but it's been cooler and dryer lately, so twice a day has been just right.

5026	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I do not have any other Vincent Longo products, I got this just to use under my normal makeup.  It works as a very light moisturizing base, I did notice a difference that my powder went on smoother than normal (I don't use foundation).  The one drawback of this is that I have somewhat dry skin so if I use only this, it isn't enough of a moisturizer.  I have found that if I alternate my regular moisturizer and this that is works perfectly.  I have also used it over my regular moisturizer and it works well like that also.
3156	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was a bit sceptical as Eau de Toilette has a tendency to loose its fragrance quickly but I was delighted to learn that Eau De Rochas was still going strong for at least 8 hours. I love fragrance and usually purchase the Parfum because of it tends to last longer. This fragrance is a light and refreshing mixure of citrus and florals with a hint of oakmoss, amber, sandlewood, and musk. You do not need to spray on heavy to achieve its tantilizing effect. Can be used for everyday casual as well as romantic effect day or night. The elegant but simple clear "crystal" design gives it a very retro but also modern look that the French do very well. I would definitely purchase this for myself or for a gift.
5837	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a terrific product.  It has kept my nails long all winter.  I had given up using nail polish until I found Butter London.
It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.
2450	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wow! just wow. Outside of having my hair blown out after getting it done at the salon, I have never used an ionic hair dryer on myself. I have hectic, chaotic, insane mornings and I have to get ready in about 15 minutes from the time I get out of the shower if I want to avoid traffic (and I do).  In the summer, I've just been leaving my hair wet but then i get to my office and it's freezing in there. I didn't want to keep having to take the time or create the damage of blow drying it everyday. With fall in winter around the corner in the north east, I needed a plan. I had heard about these dryers and figured I'd give this try after reading the reviews. I'm so glad I did! I only had time for a half-a**ed dry this morning but I could tell there is a totally amazing quality to this hair dryer. I love the warm/cool settings, I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair PLUS my hair came out straighter and without frizz. I can't wait to see what this bad boy does when I actually have the time. Great, high quality hair dryer IMO. I would definitely recommend.
7813	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product - does what it says.  Nice size, too - larger than I expected.  I use this about twice a week and it keeps my lips nice and soft.
Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said "That stuff is F--- AMAZING!" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.
4105	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I will attempt to review and rate this shaving kit from the perspective that money is no object. Every man places a different value on his beard and many shoppers have varying amounts of disposable cash. Personally I find the $120 price tag jaw-dropping, not because the product is poor, but because that's $120 for a tub of shaving cream, a bottle of oil, aftershave lotion and a brush. When you consider them individually, that's only $30 for each item which doesn't sound nearly as intimidating. But still, I'm the kind of person who holds onto spare ketchup packets and a can of Barbasol is like 99 cents. It's hard for me to ignore the price, but for the purpose of this review, I will do so.

3635	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	About 20 years ago (ugh feeling old), this was THE perfume/cologne that the cool kids wore. I decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that I am. Everyone in their 30s & 40s recognizes the scent even if they don't know exactly that it's CK1. My only complaint is that it can give me a headache. Worth it.
1764	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LIKE THIS SHADE OF GREEN. CAN'T wait to use it .
Like most Dermablend products, the Cover Crme line is pricey, but it is a very nice cream foundation.  It wears exceptionally well, stays put, and also cleans up pretty easy with water, soap, and wipes.  Even though Dermablend recommends using a setting powder, I find it holds up very well for hours without it.
A few things about me, I am poor and a major skeptic. I always look at reviews online thinking to myself that people from the company or those that are paid wrote them. Search "Dark eye circle cream" and tons of products will pop up promising to help. I have tried a few products and normally would never spend this much money on anything for my skin, but I was feeling generous to myself the day I bought it and I am glad I did.
I then use the moisturizer afterwards...

This product does what it says.  It keeps skin moisturized throughout an entire day.  It keeps the skin protected from the sun even under makeup.  There are not annoying scents or any bad reactions that I have had from using this moisturizer.  My only frustration with it is the label coming apart in a way that it will not go back together, making it frustrating to store.  I took one star off for that.  Using tape is what I am doing, but it still is making it tough to work with.  I would prefer a different style of labeling.  Perhaps a box with an insert and only key ingredients on the bottle or something else?

9761	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very dry skin and I'm always trying creams to keep it hydrated. So when I saw the chance of trying the Juice Beauty Nutrient Moisturizer, I took it. But first, I had to go to the manufacturer's website to see the list of all the ingredients, it would be great if they'd listed them on the Product Description as well.  Among its many ingredients are organic shea butter, jojoba, aloe  and algae. This is my experience with it, it's a nice moisturizer that is great for my face,  and also for my hands. After I applied it to my face and neck, I got the idea of massaging into my cuticles, fingernails and hands, and it hydrates them all very well. The cream is thick but it penetrates fast and it has a mild and pleasant aroma.  It's all natural, without chemicals, or artificial fragrance or dyes. And it doesn't have any soy components, either.  I recommend this products both for women and men.

Yes, it doesn't contain silicone, and that's great for those who are silicone sensitive.  However, silicone is the only defrizzer that works for me when the humidity climbs to 90%.  This balm does smell wonderful and goes on smoothly, and it did make my dry, frizz prone hair smooth.  But once I stepped outside my air-conditioned house, all hell broke loose.  Within an hour, the frizz was back with a vengeance and I was right back where I started, as if I had not applied any product or made any effort at styling my hair at all.  So I can't exactly understand the good reviews for this product.  I purchased it at Ulta, so I know it is authentic.  I also purchased Phyto 7 leave in conditioner, which is nice.  However, this product is promptly going back to the store.  Years ago, this was a cult favorite, but that was before silicone serums started appearing on the market.  As far as the Florida humidity goes, only silicone is strong enough to eliminate Florida frizz.  I recommend a few products that have worked well for me.  For drugstore, Got2b Shine Serum is pure silicone and works as well as much more expensive serums.  Moroccan Oil Treatment and Macadamia Professional serum are both good options.  Apply these to clean damp hair.  I use about a nickel size dollop for my below shoulder length hair.  Be careful not to apply these products to the roots.  I apply them to the midlengths and ends and then, without adding any more product, I smooth what's left on my hands over the top layer of my hair, avoiding the part.  Also good, is Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer, which hydrates, provides thermal protection (as do the serums), adds shine and eliminates frizz completely.  It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In is also good.  Spray these on clean damp hair before styling products.  These products are holy grail products for me and work much better than Phyto.  But if you're on a no silicone kick, by all means give this product a try.  However, if the humidity where you live is high, you'd be better off with one of the serums or sprays I've mentioned.  I definitely don't recommend this product.

3688	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Baxter products may be for men but this is one conditioner to steal from your man. The reason I like it so much is because it is so pleasant to use in the summer. It leaves your head tingly from the peppermint oil. So it really is refreshing. To get the pump working you have to take it out of the bottle. Then simply use a washcloth to hold the slippery part of the pump. Then twist the top of the pump. That releases the pump easily.

5172	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It feels good.
Three products one step.  This product is a cleansing, milky toner, which cleanses your skin, removes both make-up & eye make-up & leaves your skin feeling clean & toned.  It does not leave my skin feeling tight, dry & stripped like some cleansers do.
5632	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	So I have used this product for years and swear by it. I started losing my hair at a very young age. By the time I was in my 50's I really needed to do something. Thank God this product was introduced to me, it really has changed my life. I can now get dressed and go out with confidence because all I need to is spray my hair with hair spray and then add this product to the spots that are balding. It makes a huge diffference and I recommend it to anyone who has hair loss. I  uaw it every day and no one knows I use anything!
This product does what it says.  It keeps skin moisturized throughout an entire day.  It keeps the skin protected from the sun even under makeup.  There are not annoying scents or any bad reactions that I have had from using this moisturizer.  My only frustration with it is the label coming apart in a way that it will not go back together, making it frustrating to store.  I took one star off for that.  Using tape is what I am doing, but it still is making it tough to work with.  I would prefer a different style of labeling.  Perhaps a box with an insert and only key ingredients on the bottle or something else?
9507	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have mixed feelings about this eye cream. My eyes get easily irritated by most creams used near the eyes, but this product doesn't bother my eyes at all. It's a very nice moisturizer and a little bit goes a long way. However, I have seen absolutely no difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. This cream doesn't seem to have any effect on those persistent wrinkles. So if you want a pretty expensive moisturizing product that won't irritate your eyes, then this is your product. But if your looking for help with wrinkles around the eyes, I would save your money and look elsewhere.

7750	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	i love how it exfoliates your skin as your washing it off
7841	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used this for legs and arm pits and was very, very happy with the smooth feeling and also the nice scent. This is a very rich, soft cream that you don't need a whole lot of to get a smooth shave.

So far, it's looked good since using the product. Will keep using it and expect to see good results - the box/bottle says to use no more than twice a week, which I believe since it seems potent enough. For the price and the effects you get, Juice Beauty Green Apple Peel is definitely worth the investment.
Applying Toppik is fairly simple.  Begin by sprinkling it a little at a time until you see the desired effect.  If you are placing it near your hairline, Toppik offers a tool for putting it in a small, defined area.  (I just hold a tissue on my face to avoid having it settle on my skin.)  The top of the jar is wide so, if you want to cover a very small area, the tool could be quite handy.
I am a young woman, and without this product I would probably go back to feeling  very self -conscience and uncomfortable in public.

9297	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I bought this after watching MaskCara's HAC (highlighting and contouring) tutorials.  In them, she has you use this powder to re-shape your nose so as to thin it out.  I'm still working on my technique, but this is a great bronzer for contouring since it doesn't have any sparkle or shine to it.
I've had not breakouts with this product as I have experienced with other moisturizers and this really works to soften dry skin. I had a cold where around my nose, my skin got chapped and dry but this cream cleared up the dryness in no time. This is a really wonderful moisturizing cream that I can't say has had any drawbacks for me, only benefits so far.
First, if you've nicked yourself shaving, do not apply this to freshly-cut skin, because it stings terribly (from the acids in the product)! This does apply beautifully--it smooths on easily and absorbs quickly. I have been applying immediately post-shave and then again once nightly. I can't say that all my shaving-related skin issues have been resolved thanks to this product, but they are reduced noticeably. I hope over time to see even greater benefit.
9463	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Disappointing.  This stain made my lips sore. It also didn't apply evenly or dispense well from the brush.  I love my other Stilla products but this one is a loser.
Overall, this is an excellent product, and since you only need to use a small amount, it should last a long time.

4986	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was pleased with this skin care set, but not in love with it because it is tuned to a younger man's skin (in general). I believe this to be the case because the three products seem to reduce the amount of skin oil on my face a lot, which is not so necessary now that I am on the doorstep of "geezerdom" (59 years). I can see I am about ten to fifteen years past this product and probably should start thinking about "dry skin" formations instead of "normal". Looking at each product in the set:

8260	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Nothing like butter LONDON nail lacquer.  I found that Rosie Lee did not work well with my salon gel manicure.
You can see the full ingredients list on the product page (enlarge the image of the back of the package).  This does not look to have any animal-derived ingredients, if you are into that sort of thing.
There are so many variables to making polish last longer that it may be difficult to understand the difference that this product makes at first. It will depend on the formula of the polishes that you are using, the amount of water that you may get your hands into ( I always use rubber gloves when I am using water!). I can see how some people discount this product. It's difficult to quantify.
9574	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Lovely fragrance but as others have mentioned, doesn't endure through the day. This is packaged in a box and cellophane suitable for gift giving. The bold, masculine black and gold bottle is distinctive yet attractive much like the fragrance itself. This is an excellent choice for those that desire a very subtle scent whether due to a partner who is sensitive to chemicals or for the simple fact of not having it follow you like a cloud - this will do neither. It is subtle and dissipates quickly leaving only the lightest fragrance lingering.


1410	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It's ok: it cleaned well but I didn't care for the taste. You could taste the Jasmine and it was pleasant but I couldn't really taste much of the mint. Overall, it wasn't unpleasant but I didn't "love it". I think it's a personal preference because a lot of other purchasers loved it!
I color my own hair. It is straight and fine but I have lots of it. I like this shampoo because it does not take the color out. It is noticable how well my color stays in. I can also use this shampoo without the conditioner and still get a silky feel to it. I won't say it flattens my hair but compared to the Pureology Volume my hair is straighter, silkier and yes, flatter but not in a bad way. Just different. I have used lots of salon shampoos and this is one of my favorites. I also have found this shampoo and the conditioner do not cause my face to break out.
I'm sure it has more to do with the AHA, but my skin looks better. I think so and others have noticed as well. My skin is even and just looks better, healthy people mostly commented. Like most Baxter products, this is a good quality and will last longer due to using less. So while some might look at the cost and think twice, it is actually a pretty good value.
8288	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this nail polish.  was impressed it didn't have the bad stuff.  In fact,  I recently found out their nail lacquers are formulated without carcinogens.  I guess in the US we allow it but in the UK they don't. The polish color is true to what's in the bottle and it lasts long.  I would say it lasts about 5 days which is two days longer than what I usually wear.  This Royal Navy color looks amazing on your fingernails and on your toes.

908	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I learned about French Skincare maybe a year ago from my dermatologist. Now I can't tell you if it does anything for wrinkles because I'm 26 but I can tell you that since I started using this, my skin has changed. I use La Roche Posay Effaclar because the dermatologist recommended it. There was a toner which I used for a month or so but then I ran out and ended up discovering this. After a few youtube videos and some reviews, I figured I would try it. Yes it water but it's not JUST water. Think of the water that your grandparents or maybe your great grandparents used to drink. It's pure water. Untouched by man. I use this product as a toner before I put on my daytime moisturizer, in the middle of the day when my skin is feeling parched and just recently I used it to set my makeup. I don't use makeup daily, a few times a month maybe. So I heard you could set your makeup using this. I tried it, and had some blot papers in my purse just in case. I finished my makeup around 6pm, I didn't get home until 2 am. NO TOUCH UPS. I know what you're thinking...all night without a touch up? YES. There was virtually no shine on my face. My makeup looked just as good as it did when I put it on. So USE this.
3200	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Update 4/09: I am not as big a fan after several months of using this exclusively. The shampoo/conditioner combo does not give the shine I want, so I am switching to another brand. It does keep my color.

454	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Dermablend is a professional cover creme that works beautifully to obtain flawless skin. Many women have acne, scars or different pigmentation on their face and neck. This creme was designed to cover up those issues, when used as directed. If you are going to use this as a sunscreen, apply 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapply every two hours to benefit from the 30spf. If using as a foundation, you only need to apply once and if you also use the setting powder, it will stay put without smudging for 16 hours. The deep brown shade is the darkest of four shades. It can be used as a contour creme also.

It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.

3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.

I decided to try the whole "system" and after the first use, I have opted not to use it again. First, the smell is unpleasant, or at least it was to me. Perhaps extended use would work wonders for the skin, but I am unable to stomach the smell so that's something. I used the cleanser, serum and moisturizer, just as indicted in the instructions. After the first and only use, my skin felt dry with an odd texture - hard to explain, not exactly smooth or silky or very sticky (just a little sticky), just weird. Then I started to itch and feel tingling. Not good tingling, more burning, rashy tingling. Nothing that I'd ever want to feel again. I did not try the peel, one whiff and I felt nauseated. I will use the bamboo washcloth again, however. It's really great.
This does contain hyaluronic acid (as sodium hyaluronate) but this product is advertised as vegan so I'm going to assume the hyaluronic acid comes from bacteria.  This is great if you want to avoid animal products but get the benefits of hyaluronic acid (very moisturizing; it's a polymer that hangs onto lots of water molecules within its chemical structure and is used in many anti-aging preparations).

This one has notes of floral and citrus (for me the floral stands out above the citrus but both are present) and once applied leaves a nice layer of fragrance that outlasts my typical body sprays. It's nice to have a "grown up" option that doesn't trigger a headache. All in all a great product!
It's very refreshing and feels really nice on my skin. Helps my skin feel hydrated too.

7645	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I bought this on a whim. I love theBalm products.  I'm so glad I got it! Over a purple shadow it will make a matte a shimmer. If you spray it with fix+ it makes shadows look almost like duo chrome and when I'm being lazy and don't want to blend like I should it's a great transition color that blends the colors together.  A must have in any makeup  bag/collection.
I bought a universal diffuser to work with this hairdryer and would make both purchases over again.

I have large dogs and their hair on fur are like boar hair. Allot of protein from eating Bison entree. I use it too but my hair is less dense and straight. It helps my dogs with great shine on their hair. Who would of known? And their fur after shampoo cleaned off easily with just hosing them down with clean water. Rinsed. Fabulous dogs and Fabulous owner/people.

A couple of months ago I decided to try Toppik after my barber recommended it.  It has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  I've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  I never told anyone what I was doing.  People kept asking me if I had just gotten a haircut.  They knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.

I wouldn't say I have acne, but I get really big pimples once in a while I get lots of black head and other little zits.  My facialist turned me onto Clear Skin and I love it.  I realized that Amazon is cheaper then buying it anywhere else.  This keeps my breakouts at bay.
the price has something to do with this but it is not the Toppik brand and does not work as well.

It's creamy and gentle on the skin but it does leave my skin feeling very clean without it being stripped of natural oils.  It smells light, not of seaweed but slightly floral.  Mario Badescu consistently has good quality products that work well with my sensitive skin.

Since my brows are so light it's hard to pluck them just right, but I have a tool that helps with that too. :-) After I pluck them, applying this excellent pencil is easy. The color is perfect for my coloring--no reddish cast as some blonde pencils tend to produce.

Shortly after application, the peel made my face start tingling.  Then, it started itching.  This was bearable since it only lasts the product is rinsed off.  It's also clearly stated on the product label that a tingling sensation will occur with this product.
The smell is nice.



820	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Decent product. Works but not all day long for my skin.
TONER ($18 individually):  Nothing special.  It's a decent astringent, but nothing other than the color and a slight fragrance, there is nothing distinguishing about the toner.  Essentially, it's water, witch hazel, and some color and fragrance.  Not worth the price of $18 for the separate item.  Three Stars.
Second.  Brush method only.  No pre shave.  Somewhat irritating shave.  Shave quality was fair.

8850	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'd been looking for a scented candle with some serious fragrance heft; a great throw to really add to my whole (small) house. This does the trick. It burns cleanly and has a clean, crisp scent. There are light floral overtones but "champagne" would not be far off. The candle comes in a hefty presentation box that I'd be proud to give as a gift for a shower or celebratory event.
5167	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This works really well on my skin for clearing up the occasional stubborn blemish that decides to turn up. I usually rotate from Salicylic acid to benzyl peroxide, so I tend to keep both on hand. I don't like using anything that stands out on my face or just lingers, so this is nice, because it actually goes on clear and dries quickly. After a few minutes, it's like I have nothing on my face, but I know it's working, because I see the results. The only downside is that this a bit pricey. I have found comparable products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. Other than that, it is a really good salicylic acid for sporadic spot treating.

5653	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product is superior to other brands. I have tried them all and for me this is the best. Been using it for 2 years and it makes a huge difference in the appearance of my thin hair.
Composition and effectiveness: Many of the ingredients are organic and nature-based, which is a big selling point for me compared to many of the drugstore and department store products. The ingredients include antioxidants that should help prevent signs of aging. Experiences are very subjective, but I will try to update this as I use this product over time.
9751	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have to say that so far, Juice Beauty Nutrient Moisturizer has proven to be quite excellent. Firstly, there is no irritation -- as a matter of fact, it seemed quite soothing to my skin. I use it right after a shower and exfoliating, with nice results. The product seems to sink right into my skin. I use it in moderation, as I am not looking for a build-up of moisturizer on my skin, I just want enough to keep it feeling soft. This eliminated the patches of winter dryness. Under cosmetics, I rarely use moisturizer. However, I did try using the slightest bit, and my foundation went on very nicely without getting an oily look as the day went on.

4516	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This bottle looks like it holds nothing but water. It isn't. This is micellar cleansing water that lifts oil, dirt and makeup away from your face with zero harmful effects. This bottle is for oily skin. You don't have to rub harshly to remove what is on your face and it also leaves your skin clean, refreshed, no shine and with no greasy feel. You are not going to believe how this stuff works. It does it all and prepares your face for what ever you need to put on it next.
My first impression of Obsession is that is is a spicy, rich scent, relatively heavy but not overpowering.  It is not a light floral.  For my tastes, it is more suited to winter or special evenings out than sunny summer days.  It has a woodsy scent to it in addition to the spicy tones.  According to the product page, there are lots of different ingredients that add up to a very nice blend.  It is also supposed to be musky, but that is not strong, which is good for me.  I don't like overly musky scents.

I have fine hair and was struggling to find something that wouldn't weigh it down, this is it, it rinses right out that my hair squeaks, back in the day my mom would always say, "you rinse until your hair squeaks" and this stuff does just that, nice body to my hair and I like the scent, I also grew up with egg shampoo, I was happy to see someone still sold egg shampoo, if you have fine lifeless hair then this is for you, try it

7853	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This stuff is seriously awful. I was looking for a change from ORLY top to bottom because of its bluish tone and bought this. I didn't need to straighten my nails, but thought that something extra is always a plus.

9748	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I applied this as a night cream.  It is thick and at first feels heavy but through the night it sinks in and makes my skin soft.  When I shower in the morning my skin is super smooth.  This is a really good dry skin moisturizer.  I would not wear this during the day.  The smell isn't bad but it's not great.  It seems to have a hint of a depilatory cream smell.
9502	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Although I did not experience anything negative from using this product, I didn't really experience a benefit either.  I was particularly paying attention to the area under my eyes and around the corners, but I have not seen any improvement there, which is a bummer.  Products like this are so expensive, they ought to work great!

1932	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I actually came across this sort of accidentally. See, I was removing some dark red nail polish from my fingernails, and it left behind this really awesome pinkish hue. No, I did not use a base coat, and yes, I do realize the pinkish hue was a stain. But this got me thinking...I would pay for this look. I had no idea if I could replicate it, and it was a little uneven so I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a nail polish that could give me the same effect?!" Turns out, there is. It's Essie's Pink Glove Service. I ordered it a couple days ago, received it today, and put it on. My nails are adorable. They look so natural and feminine! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic, elegant look for their natural nails. :)

901	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I do find this to be very calming and refreshing.  It does contain trace elements and selenium, and it is pH balanced.  The bottle is metal with a nozzle type sprayer that has worked fine for me.  The trace elements are antioxidants that help protect the skin from damage and signs of aging and can reduce inflammation.
I recommended the cream to others and can say that the only people who were not happy with it either did not give it enough time or used it in summer and during the day did nothing (sunscreen, clothing, shade) to protect their skin from UV light. I wonder if the people who gave the cream

2443	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Really good power, good heat at high or medium, and I appreciate the cool shot button to 'set' a curl on the brush. Gets the job done quickly in the morning.  It's a little clunky, and noisy, but they mostly are.  The sliding buttons on the shaft for volume and heat control are a little hard to move with thumb while holding the dryer, I usually have to stop and get a really good grip with my nail in the lower button.

7355	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I thought I had the very best eye brown pencil out there but have changed my mind after using the Vincent Longo Everbrow  Micro Pencil.  I really like how it goes on and how it fills in places.  It just glides on so easy and doesn't have that waxy crayon look.  It looks as if you hadn't used a brow pencil because it looks so natural.  It also doesn't smear.  I have on  my right eyebrow a area almost as big as the end of a pencil before it is sharpened and it didn't matter what I used it wouldn't fill in so I was very excited when the Vincent Longo brow pencil filled in to where it looks like the rest of my eyebrow now.  I will be ordering the Vincent Longo brand. I hope it helps those of you who are looking for a really good eye brow pencil.
7528	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a light and airy cream that works well over other moisturizers or on its own.  I found that it had a very slight floral scent.  That caused me not to be able to put it on my face for worry about the fragrance.  It is a very mild scent.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
734	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using the Toppik Keratin Fiber spray for almost 2 years now and the Fiberhold Spray is a must to hold the keratin fibers in place.  Regular hair spray does not even come close. I make sure never to run out of the Toppik fiberhold spray!!!
To get the best control over where the fibers go, it's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly aggitate the can to shake just enough and where you want it. There is no reason to hold it high above the head - in fact, if you do, fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed. They make a special applicator for the can to "spray" the fiber, but I find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head. For the front close to the hairline, it's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed. If you apply too close to the hairline, it may look too fake. You can always come a bit closer and apply.

223	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love OPI's Cajun Shrimp color! It's the perfect coral-red mixture. A great summertime color! OPI has had this color out for years and there's a reason. Whenever I do an at-home pedi, the polish chips quicker than it does when I got get a professional pedi - it can last for weeks then!
6402	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	LOVE this product!  Very effective.
For home use, I like it as well.  It is a lot more convenient to use the pads then to have to use a bottle and cotton balls.  Like one other poster mentioned, it is nice having a toner designed for men that doesn't have a smell that is meant for females.
The Eau De Toilette is not as strong as a perfume, and takes a bit more but is potent and lasting. 1-2 sprays provides a great scent profile for most people. An ounce will last a nice long time in normal use.  The scent itself lasts about 5 hours, but that can vary by person.
8343	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Despite the small size, this product lasts for a long time because a little of it goes a very long way. I find that it sinks in very quickly too, which is nice in the morning for under concealer. But I don't find that this product has any noticeable different on my under eye area.
46	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	If you're into unique, subtle scents, Calvin Klein's ck one is for you. It reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their heyday in the 90s. It's spicey, with the merest hint of a floral. I like it for myself, as a non-girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice.
Also good to note:  I had my sister try this as well and she had similar results.  She ended up giving it back (for our mother to try) and went back to using Burt's Bees Herbal Blemish stick which she likes (and also contains Tea Tree oil).

8833	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the smell and it refreshing feeling after you spray it+
5191	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a really nice face cream. It smells mild and pleasant and feels really rich going on, yet it absorbs quickly with no residue. I can put makeup on right after applying on it goes on well. I do feel a slight warming of my skin after using this, so even though it says it is sensitive skin and allergy tested, that is no guarantee that this is going to work for everyone. So far it isn't bad enough for me to discontinue use, and I love the texture my skin has after using it.

7652	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this product mainly just for eyeshadow and to outline my eyebrows, and it is AWESOME. I could see someone using it over concealer (if applied lightly) or even used as a base under a smokey eye, or even natural eye. It is sooooo pigmented with beautiful champagne shimmer. I am going to try the other shades soon!
5659	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this product for 14 years. GREAT PRODUCT! I only found out recently that I can get it cheaper on Amazon.

4048	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Keeping skin hydrated is an on-going goal, and the challenge definitely increases in this part of the country where the norm is a cold dry winter, so I was interested in trying this product. Following the directions I applied a small amount to my fingertips, two pumps, and massaged it into my skin. Then I added a couple of drops of water which created a creamy emulsion which I had no problem rinsing off. My skin was left feeling soft, not oily.
6400	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love ALL Mario Badescu products! I have very sensitive skin and this mask helps calm the irritation from my breakouts as well as diminish red patches.
8524	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I put this on in the morning and didn't put on any makeup since I planned on staying home.  My skin felt soft all day, but also just a tad greasy.  After washing my face before bedtime, I applied this and wore it to bed.  My skin felt well hydrated in the morning.  I will continue to use this product and post any new results.
4880	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've heard such great things about this product for such a long time and I finally decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. I am so impressed with how fast it works and I love that the ingredients list is very minimal. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my full, more detailed review I posted about it.
I like that there is almost no odor, and what faint hint you do smell is almost like fresh grass. You do need to remember to use sunscreen after this product because the AHA's will make it easier for you to burn. And, it is a bit thin in viscosity.

7338	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was pleased with this skin care set, but not in love with it because it is tuned to a younger man's skin (in general). I believe this to be the case because the three products seem to reduce the amount of skin oil on my face a lot, which is not so necessary now that I am on the doorstep of "geezerdom" (59 years). I can see I am about ten to fifteen years past this product and probably should start thinking about "dry skin" formations instead of "normal". Looking at each product in the set:
6857	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	this is the only thing that has worked for me, it dries your pimples over night

6144	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Just the right weight for a daytime moisturizer.
8091	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works fast and really covers the thin spots.  Just be sure you pat it in and give it a spray with the holding spray. Otherwise it might flake off.  Washes off easily.
4571	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Subtle fragrance. Works well. It's hard to find a deodorant stick that doesn't leave underarms sticky. This is just perfect.
56	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I haven't used any other deodorant product for several years, except for this Calvin Klein product.  I do not use a product with an antiperspirant in it because of the studies done on women regarding breast cancer, and this product does an absolutely perfect job!

7038	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	One of my recent samples has been Mario Badescu Skin Care Products. I started off with the Almond and Honey Face Scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub. It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.
My color was slightly too dark but then I blended the edges with other color. Just play and get better at it.
8970	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Refreshing, lovely scent. I'm not sure this is the intent, but in addition to a moisturizing spray, I use this to "set" my makeup.  I'm not sure it actually sets it, but it does create a nice dewey look so that the rest of my makeup looks less powdery/cakey. Just a light spritz from a foot away and you're good.
2675	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the smell, not to strong.. It just reminds me of cake, or candy.. Very nice, not over powering, I'd say it's in between a body spray and perfume, meaning the strength of it. I even bought the hair perfume which is nice too, it's not over powering, it's a very light scent, great for people who may wash hair not everyday, like me, gives your hair the smell of like you just washed it. I used to use Pantene I can't find it anymore, I would just pump a little bit in my hand and run my fingers through my hair, it had alcohol in it so it absorbed quickly, so no oil..but it smelled soooo good!! I think it was a type of maybe dry shampoo? I can't even remember it's been so long... But I love this Pink Sugar!!! I got it at Ulta.com for $20 I think it's normally $30. The pink sugar hair perfume is $15 not a big bottle but lasts a long time! It won't make your hair stiff or anything, you just spray a little on after you have put your hair spray on, or say if your going out later at night it refreshes your hair like you just washed it.. Definitely worth trying out. :)
8589	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	The sprayer is not a very fine mist...and it's too expensive.

1550	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	One of my very favorites!!
9096	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the best curling iron I have ever owned. I have wavy, short medium thick hair. I am 50 years old. I put it on the highest level to try it out because of the reviews I had read. It is fast. Do not use it like the older curling Orion. Holding it for a few minutes. Roll your hair up and less then 2 seconds take it out. The temp control is away from your hands. That means when you are holding it your fingers do not change the dial. This is truly the best iron I have ever owned. The shipper was right on time. No peanut packaging. Huge bubble packing. I am more the satisfied

3649	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is great way to add color to my face. This tan is easy to apply. This mousse dries instantly. This is a great way to update your tan as well. This has a small scent. The scent is not overpowering. A little goes a long way. I use this to enhance my tan. This way I can do my arms legs as well as face. High quality product. Great for a perfect tan all year round.
3721	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product. My skin is so sensitive so I can't use harsh acne products but every time of the month that is so wonderful (not) for us females I break out unless I use SOMETHING so I was in the lovely position of having to choose between irritated, dry, and peeling skin or blemishes when this time would occur. Enter this product. Those days are now over. Effective at fighting blemishes AND it doesn't nuke my skin. My teenage daughter has the same problems I do and this works just as well for her. This is definitely something I'll be buying on a regular basis.
5270	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have oily skin and this product really helps reduce the oil and keeps my skim blemish free! Highly recommend.
 I must say that I am grateful for a product that works under heavy lighting and has a number 30 SPF count as well.

370	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The information given on how to find your shade family, undertone and shade are pretty interesting and really help to narrow it down to help you find the correct foundation for your skin tone. From there they give a great easy tutorial on how to use, warm with fingers and apply to face, using a brush or sponge tap tap tap your face to build coverage to your desiered look. To wash off, buff off in a circular motion. It doesn't state to apply a setting spray, but I always do. (I use urban decay and kat von d setting sprays for all day/night wear). I have rosacea aka red cheeks and when it is hot or I laugh more then usual it will cause my rosacea to become inflamed and be red all day long - I found that the dermablend really helped to keep my red cheeks at bay through out the day.


Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital is a cream.  It can go on thick and remain sticky depending on how much you apply.  Too much and it will stay moist.  Just enough and it dries to stay on longer for better retention.  It does not have any added color, so it will not be immediately obvious until later how much tan color you may have retained. The fragrance is OK, not overwhelming, and it does seem to subside over hours, although not totally.
1755	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I expected.
3322	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It does help dry faster.  I've had a few smudges even with using it, but works well with most nail polishes.  I does speed drying time.  I would recommend.  I equally like the aresol can spray
I have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.
8761	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this.  I mainly use it on my hands as they get so dry feeling in the winter since I have to wash my hands often.  You only need a little bit.  It goes on very smoothing and leaves my hands feeling better.  I put it on at night before bed.  I love the scent also.  It's light but very nice.

7377	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have dry skin and I really love this product. The sensation of it on your skin is very soothing as it hydrates the skin rather well. It works great as a base - keeps my foundation and blush in place all day. A lot pricey but it does as advertised.

7406	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I grabbed this up and didn't realize it was for men.  I really like the cream anyway - it is rich, smooth, and super nice for sensitive skin.  I like that the cream is really thick.  One tube should last me a long time.
5691	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product was a life saver for me. My hair has continually got thinner and I really didn't want to buy a wig. A friend told me about this and I can't believe how well it covers thinning areas. You just have to make sure after applying the resisdue isn't on your forehead or back. But it's a great product and worth every penny....

Why am I mentioning this in a review of a cleanser?  Because after using this cleanser my moisturizer seems to be working alot better.  Could it be because my other cleanser wasn't cleaning well enough?  I don't know I just know that there is a difference in my skin.  Recommend for you if you want your skin really clean.

I recommend using the skin analysis. I am going to receive free samples from Mario Badescue's  website of the products they recommend for my skin, so I can test out the moisturizer they recommend in comparison to this one I received to see which is the best for my skin.  Either way I am sticking with a moisturizer from their line.  The cool thing is they don't have a one size fits all moisturizer like most companies, so you have freedom to choose which one works best for you. This is my first experience with the company, and it was a good one. I recommend trying their products.
I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.
Highly recommended!
It's still true today that there is a staying and concealer power to this product I've never seen before.
I would recommend all for skin with rosacea problems.
I am a big fan of Billy Jealousy products and use them regularly. I have been using the Ocean Front body wash for some time and it works well. I decided to give this a try and I am never switching back. This body wash smells terrific, but isn't overpowering. This wash pours thick and suds incredibly well. I was used to the thin, low sudsing, Ocean Front and ended up using way too much, the first time around. You hardly need any of this product to wash yourself. The moisturizing is wonderful! It leaves your skin feeling lightly moisturized without feeling overly greasy. My skin is on the more sensitive side and I have had no reaction to this body wash.
206	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Big apple red is THE BEST real red nail polish I've ever been able to find, Its long lasting and stays on well. OPI is my favorite polish. A lot of the red have too much orange or pink and aren't bright enough this is a classic red perfect for a night out or even everyday use!
update I bought a second one ! i love the mini because you can fit it in a clutch and don't have to worry about reapplying when you're out and about ! perfect for those wanting to make their hair look a little more full !

WOULD I USE THIS PROFESSIONALLY?
4378	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My favorite Juice Beauty cleanser. Great for my sensitive skin and removes makeup very well. It has a clean, light, smell. Perfect for all skin types.
7633	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My favorite face sunscreen moisturizer ever! I have a morning and even routine with high end face products. This moisturizer does wonders for the price. Super moisturizing in this dry weather. Rubs on thin and easy to apply make up over once it dries. Love it
It is long-lasting, because I could smell it on me today from yesterday. I just spray a bit and it is enough.  A half a spray. I love how it is subtle.

When I hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4".  My hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. I'd be burning myself quite often if I was using the 1" size.

5132	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have thick short hair thats not easy to manage, as its turning grey the dryness is getting worse so I've been looking for a product that softens while keeping it manageable, CHI Silk Infusion is easy to apply and works keeping my hair soft and easy to manage, it smells good too with a clean mild scent. I always add to my hair right after washing but have applyed to my dry hair still getting good results.
As always, remember to burn the candle the first time equal to the diameter for even burn.

4244	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have sensitive and oily skin, so shaving has always been a painful experience, in terms of the irritation it creates through blemishes, razor bumps and ingrown hair. In the past I tried different kinds of shaving creams and razors to make it as painless as possible. A few years ago I tried Anthony Logistics for men Ingrown Hair treatment and in combination with preshave oil, a shaving brush, and sensitive skin shave cream, found it substantially reduces ingrown hair and other irritation. The label suggests using it for about two weeks to make sure the irritation goes away, but I typically use it all the time a little in the morning after washing my face (or after shaving) and then at night. It does involve a tingling sensation and a slight odor that goes away quickly, but compared to the typical alcohol based aftershaves, is not unpleasant. It is expensive, but as other reviewers have noted, it doesn't take much, so once you get used to the dispenser, can make it last about two months or so.


8864	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	NEED - great setting spray - obsessed.
9957	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.

I am very happy with this product. The whole line of Juice Beaty is organic, safe and effective!
8397	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this cleanser. It doesn't lather but cleanses well. I have combo skin, so my t zone breaks out. With this cleanser, my face feels smoother and less dry, w/o it making my t zone greasy. It removes makeup well and can also double as makeup remover and be wiped away. I've been using for weeks and my bottle is only a quarter empty. Great value for such an extraordinary product.
9561	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	The holder is different and a cheap one that keeps coming out.......Bronzer is OK....
- Product is long lasting enough to actually work on the lips. Lips are soft and seem moisturized.
4332	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I have used the equalizer for several years and liked it; but this one has a pump that does not work;  I have to pour it out of this bottle into another one to use.
5140	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	CHI Silk Infusion is a great hair product. It left my hair very soft and shiny. Plus, it smells great. I like that it doesn't take a huge amount of product to get through my thick, wavy hair either.
4162	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This curling iron heats up so fast.
6482	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Petroleum jelly like "ointment" that, if you rub into the cuticle area regularly keeps them from getting out of hand.  Since it's kind of sticky, need to massage it in.  There's quite a bit in here so it lasts a long time.
7924	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	These fibers are a good product for making a thinning head of hair look thick again. I do however recommend the TOPPIK hair fattener spray over this product. Also, if you are insistent on purchasing this item, I highly recommend purchasing the pump applicator as well. It makes for the application process so much more effective and will extend the duration of the products use.
9091	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I already have this iron, and was happy the new one that I purchased for our daughter came with 2 springs, as my old iron will need a spring replaced soon. This iron heats up quickly, like the variable temperature control and rotating cord. Hair product residue wipes of with damp cloth. Am happy with this product, otherwise I wouldn't have purchased a 2nd one for our daughter.
I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

8174	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	It made me break out, especially my chin area .  To be fair though, I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  However, I do recommend their Bioglycolic cleanser which really helps to exfoliate.

4690	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great gentle scrub. Smells great and the texture is smooth and nice. This doesn't strip your face raw. I use this daily, its just a nice gentle scrub. My face and neck are smooth and non irritated from this product. I'm 53 and I love anything from Mario Badescu.
22	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes.  The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized.  This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years.  It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Angela-s-Garden-7120-921-Kids-Garden-Glove-Honey-Bee/dp/B000P8DHQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Angela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee</a>, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too.  Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell.
5390	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is great stuff. I purchased it after I started using the acne starter kit and really like it. It's a serum that is used for problem areas only. The serum is a bit sticky so I use it before I go to bed so that it works during the night. It helps with redness and I noticed that when I feel swelling or inflammation, with a blemish that hasn't reached the surface yet, it reduces the tenderness and redness which I love. When I use it at night it takes the tenderness away and I can see that the blemish doesn't come up. If i have some inflammation in the morning I will apply a small amount on the problem area under my makeup. Like I said it has a bit of a sticky texture but it doesn't get to sticky if you use a small amount under makeup. Overall great product.

7930	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product!
My current cleansing habit as we approach the change in seasons is to use raw honey to clean my face, sometimes using Adzuki beans to slough off dead skin.  After cleansing I use rose water to tone or remove eye makeup.  I was also using Mario Badescu Rose hip oil around my super dry eyes.  I sometimes use Barbussa oil or natural Shea butter to moisturize - but as long as the weather is above 60 degrees these melt and sort of roll off my face, so I need a back up plan.  There is little to no scent in the moisture magnet.  The lotion is not terribly thick and it isn't runny, it is a medium consistency.  After my toner, I put a little rose hip oil around my eyes, and then a pea sized amount of the moisture magnet on the rest of my face.  The top has a small spout to deliver just the right amount of moisturizer in your hand, the bottle is a squeeze bottle.  I sometimes find with moisturizers that my oily regions get sort of slick with an all over moisturizer, I don't have that problem with the moisture magnet.  This keeps my face dewy and plump, but not oily or greasy.  The other thing I really worry about with moisturizers is clogging pores, since mine are huge, my pores do not seem to be any more plugged up than with the usual amount of dirt on the day to day.  I also can get cystic acne with some moisturizers, I have been using this for several weeks now and have not had a cystic acne breakout.
1565	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A well-received gift.
979	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	In a short period of time I have noticed that my skin tone is starting to even out and feels smooth.

- Suitable for everyone; since this is thermal water, it can even be used on babies

756	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is an amazing cologne!  However, I choose Eternity "Aqua" as my favorite.
3294	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The scent is fabulous - it transports you to tropical beach, island, blingy pool, name your favorite water-themed vacation spot.  It goes on easily and smoothly and imparts a subtle color and sheen that is tres chic and flattering, especially if you are starting your tanning process or not.
9112	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	There are some folks out there who really dislike this product. I am not one of them.
I recommend this to anyone that wants to use a toner or an astringent but looking for a less harsh version. I hope my review was helpful to any readers!
With the jar of product comes a little spatula. Don't lose it! Scrape a little product with the spatula and put it on the back of your hand. Don't put too much. I made the mistake of putting too much product out the first time and had to discard half of it when I didn't use it. A little truly goes a long way because this is really thick, hence the full coverage. So, just scrape less than what you think you might need. Let the product warm on your hand for a bit and then apply on the skin area in question. I use my index finger. It covers my really dark acne spots and pimples. If it was dark enough for my legs, I would have used it on them for a flawless look. It thoroughly conceals any imperfections. I apply some setting powder, let it set and then brush the excess off and then use a setting spray. It lasts ALL DAY.
7617	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used to think that all cleansers were equal but this facial wash really makes a BIG difference in my skin and I now use it religiously. It keeps the oil production under control without overdrying my skin and well after a year+ of use, my skin has not plateaued using this facial wash. In a nutshell, I LOVE it!

Some of the pluses are that it is definitely FULL coverage (if that is what you need), and, it has a good dose of sunscreen for protection. I do have some dark circles under my eyes due to HRT, and this cream foundation did a very nice job of hiding them. Still, being over 60, for everyday wear, I found it too heavy to wear on a regular basis, and I definitely had trouble with it caking in the lines of my skin. My preference is still a good mineral (powder) foundation for everyday use. I know you don't get the full coverage that a foundation of this type can give you, but, the effect is more natural and lighter, especially for daytime use.
7815	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wife loves it
8994	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	One of my new favorite curling irons now.

There is nothing good about this product, except the packaging.
9509	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	First off, Juice Beauty Green Apple Eye Cream is amazing for sensitive skin.  I love the smell and the feel, it's silky smooth and very soft.  There's not a hint of grease in this cream.  I think my lines are fading.
3879	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I adore this stuff! Matte finish is gorgeous! Nice thin layers that are ultra protective. My nails are growing strong and healthy and long. Beautiful! I am going to be a lifelong user.
On a note for Asian-toned/Golden-skinned/Warmer skinned ladies: The gladiola is amazing. I thought that color would be gross, but it totally adds light and glow to the skin (as does Petunia, but that one is more like warm pink/coral). Gladiola has orange tones, but it's not clownish. If there is warm/gold in your natural skin tone, this will just LIGHT you up. I love it for warm/sunny days/summer.
Now that we're past the surprises...
I do love the fragrance and the cooling feel of the mist. I think I will end up using it more during the winter than summer, or maybe even after a harsh, hot and drying day in the sun. It's a great product, it's just not very useful for me as a make-up fixing spray.
730	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This product use to be strong and makes my hair HARD like a rock and i loved it because no one can tell that u have powder on ur F***** hair. Now for some reasons its all wet and nasty and once someone put their hands in ur hair, oh lord have mercy for the embarrassing moment that you will have. When its RAINING, please run and DO NOT AND YES I SAID DO NOT let anyone see u in that horrific, disgusting, and terrible moment. ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT I BEEN THROUGH

4097	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I get dry hands, dry cuticles. I am always looking for a therapy to help me not have so many hangnails, and rips.  Crabtree &Evelyn Nail and Cuticle Therapy smells like a pine tree to me, which is not pleasant. It absorbed quickly and left my cuticles soft which is what it is supposed to do but I get that from plain old cheap coconut oil.
6033	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	One of my recent samples has been Mario Badescu Skin Care Products. I started off with the Almond and Honey Face Scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub. It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.

7013	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have been using the Juice Green Apple Peel for 5 or more years and I swear by it - If you have sensitive, acne-prone and rosacea-prone skin this peel is wonderful.  The Clear Skin kit is perfect for sampling other Juice products or having travel sized products.  I am equally in love with the cleanser finding it gentle yet treating.  I am not impressed with the moisturizer, it feels a bit sticky and irritates my sensitive skin.  I do like the blemish clearing lotion but I only apply it every other day because (again) sensitive skin!!
It actually is a seaweed based product so it is mostly water with the pigment suspended in it.  This is the most natural looking makeup I've ever worn.
9769	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Stays on for a long time. A little challenging to blend well (make sure you have lotion on first). Doesn't really cover the darker circles under my eyes. I got the peach based color they said would cover those..
7934	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it!
I love that it's SPF 30. I only wear high-ish SPF skin products anymore.
If applied as outlined in this review, this is an excellently performing foundation.  Although the color turned out to be lighter than I expected, if applied as I outlined, it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match.  Sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light, but if that does not bother you, then it still is a good choice.  Great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability (except extreme humidity and heat) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off.  If applied any other way, results will be different.
2845	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Not bad for an under eye concealer although I wish the two colors were just put together
5849	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This top coat is incredibly durable!  Just one coat has protected my nails from all kinds of abuse.  I have a big dog, garden, and cook, and so am very active with my hands.  This top layer wasn't even scratched after digging in the dirt to do some planting.  I'm mighty impressed and would recommend this to anyone.
4457	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	The description says "can be used with or without water," so I tried it both ways.  Without water left my skin feeling greasy, so I began rinsing it off.  Unfortunately, neither method was good for my skin.  Shortly after I began using this cleanser, my skin broke out--a lot.  I then began using the 3-in-1 simply as a makeup remover and then using my regular skincare regimen after.  That's how I discovered that this cleanser was actually leaving a lot of makeup behind which is probably why I was breaking out so much.  Although I like the milky feel when putting it on, this product simply doesn't work for my skin.
5290	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite line of sun protection. I won't use anything else! It smells fantastic and feels awesome. It's simply the best.
1953	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this color. Essie is always a hit or miss for me. This is definitely a hit! Plus i love the name!

8707	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This oil is very similar to one my mom made in my childhood mixing rose hips oil and glycerin with a few other things to keep my skin moisturized and glowing in the winter. We used no other moisturizer after our bath. This absorbed so well in the skin and kept it glowing. I am amazed that this is so expensive, as my mom used it as a whole body moisturizer on us, but this product has a higher concentration of the oil. This oil does work well for my face and neck to eliminate dryness and has a great fragrance. I can wear it under my moisturizer and makeup. I just wish it was a bit cheaper, but a little goes a long way.
9533	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like everything about this, it has a pleasant "clean", not chemically or "perfumy" bit a natural light scent.
199	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful, long lasting color. What more can we ask for?
THE WORST PART- ITCHING
2130	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I tried this shampoo after using the Awapuhi shampoo and this one is much better IMO. My hair is baby fine and tends to get oily after one day even though I am 29 years old. I wanted a shampoo that could help my hair feel clean, voluminous,and didn't harm animals. This product has everything I need. It has a coconut smell but its not bothersome - coming from someone who doesn't care for coconut scents. It's lather is less soapy than the Awapuhi and has more of a thick lather. I like it more because it makes my hair feel clean within any greasy build up. It also helps my hair feel less oily over time. I purchased the one liter because it is 3 times the product of the smaller bottle you find at Target and roughly twice the price so it's a better deal. The standard bottle lasts around 2 months with daily usage. This bottle will probably last half the year! I also support the cruelty free stance of Paul Mitchell and his products are some of the best in that market. Other vegan products have made my hair feel dull and just sit on my head without cleaning my hair. This product gets the job done without the guilt!
I have sensitive/combo skin.
I can't feel this makeup on my face nor can I see it.  All I can see is glowing radiant perfect looking skin.  I cringe at the price of this but...would I buy it again, in spite of the cheap looking case and small amount you get?  You bet I would.
1101	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used DermaBlend for many years. I used to sell it and I loved to teach other how to apply it for the most effective coverage. Warm saffron has always been my favorite powder and I am glad to see that it is still offered.
6029	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My skin has multiple personalities.  It's oily, sensitive, gets easily irritated and breaks out, gets dry flaky patches, and no matter what cleanser I use, something (the oiliness or the dryness) gets aggravated.  For years, I've stuck with my trusty Cetaphil cleanser and tested other products in between.  My Mom actually gave me this cleanser after I house sat for her and used it and I'm SO glad I tried it.  I absolutely love, love, love this cleanser.  It cleans without stripping my skin, without making my face feel tight, and it takes off every trace of make up including eye make up and mascara. My face is soft and smooth with no dryness, no irritation, and it doesn't feel greasy that way it did with some other gel/cream based cleansers.
2853	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Lasts and works well to conceal without causing obvious white/light circles under eyes or wherever it is applied. HOWEVER, I found that it settles in wrinkles and creases EXCESSIVELY.  I was constantly having to smooth under my eyes (every hour at least) because of this.  I have switched to a Lancome concealer (in a tube) and have zero problems with coverage and NO creasing.  I'm using the Jane Iredale above to cover vein spots on my legs but no longer use it on my face.  :(  Will not purchase again!
4216	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the smell, feel & results of this moisturizer. I've used it for several years & no issues.
I've had this on for about a day now and I don't see any chips.  (My nails are fairly short.)  I did have to do a lot of cleaning yesterday evening and normally that would cause chips, but it didn't this time.
1935	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I saw this color at the salon and knew I had to have it.  I got a pedicure with it at the salon, and when I applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter, but I actually like it better like that.  I used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle.
7290	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Simply the best make-up I've ever used.  It feels good, looks great and provides SPF protection. It's great for my sensitive skin too. I can't say enough good things about it.
7411	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My husband has been using Baxter rather than his usual Olay for about a month and he really likes it.  The thick consistency spreads evenly and the cream leaves his face and neck feeling smooth moisturized.  Even with the AHA, this is a gentle face cream that does not bring out any redness.  The complete lack of fragrance is also a plus.

Even though it is fairly thick when applied, it dries quickly.  Nail Envy can be used as a base, a top coat or as a nail strengthener. However, if used as a nail strengthener, which I might say is the best product I've used, the results are not cumulative. Once you quit using it, your nails go back to the original brittle condition.

8280	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like my title reflects, I use this nail polish for the white tips of my French manicures. I love it and it works perfectly. I do Butter basecoat, then this white, then Butter top coat and it's perfect
2329	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this moisturizer in combination with the Baxter toner and the Baxter night cream. This moisturizer goes on very well, absorbs quickly, and generally does a great job. There is no sun protection with this moisturizer that I am aware of, so you will still need some SPF protection. This spreads very well, and you don't need to use a ton of it. I've been using it about three weeks, and I haven't made a huge dent in the bottle. It looks like it will last a few months, which is nice. Overall, I'm very pleased with this moisturizer.

9660	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	To be fair this is a nice soap, but for $22? I received this as a gift and liked it well enough, but when I saw the price I knew I'd never purchase it for myself. It was really no better or worse than cheaper soap.
4006	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've tried a different Vichy facial cleanser in the past, but this one is far superior.  It doesn't have an overwhelming scent, goes on easily, and wipes practically all of my make-up off on the first go around with a tissue, What I really like about this Vichy product is that I don't have to use water as a finishing touch so that I can just cleanse my face and then, if needed, re-apply new makeup.  Good product.
9322	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been buying this brand  and this cream for a decade, always works, doesn't irritates your skin and moisturizes enough even during the winter.

5746	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Both this version and the water pomade remind me of my son's Butch Wax when he was a kid. A sticky waxy product that you put in his hair to hold his flat top straight up. They appear to have that micro glitter in them or something that makes them sort of silvery. If I had time, I'd work the Slick pomade through my hair bit by bit, I think it would work great for definition and curl. But I don't, I use it for the front of my hair that tends to get very frizzy. It works for that and works to hold some lift in the front section without the use of hairspray. Be forewarned that they assume you know how to use this product as it comes with zero instructions or suggestions. The ingredients are on a little folded label stuck to the bottom and so if you're not an experienced pomade user, look it up on the internet.

9151	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this. I've bought this product multiple times. Only apply to pimple as it will dry out the rest of your skin. However, I have put this on large areas of my face during summer months when my face has more oil than usual. I've had problamtic skin for a while and I consider this product necessary in my skin care regimen.

3622	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This really makes your hair shiny and healthy looking. I lost my hair due to chemo, and when it started coming back, it was dull and sad. I used this and it really made it look better. Five stars.

7560	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm an old person so I can say that I have used probably hundreds of different face creams and honestly not one of them has made me weep with joy because my face looks so much younger. I mean, I don't expect miracles, and I have paid a lot for some of them. This one is well worth the price.
But the price almost doubled in a day!
6341	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The first time I used it, I was confused by the consistency. Its not oily at all. Its practically watery. It is a lightweight and fast absorbing oil full of vitamin C, so it brightens as well as hydrates. It reduces scaliness and improves texture. Ive been using it for a about a week now, and combined with my Burt's Bees Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, my skin is the best its been in recent memory. I put 4-5 drops onto the back of my hand, and apply it to my each evening before bed You can wear it under your regular moisturizer, too. Ive been using it under my Aveeno moisturizer, and they're a really nice combination together.
Cons:

1346	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used to use another brand, but the next morning all my head started to scratch,
It comes with a large poof, but I would suggest using a light brush as the poof was a bit awkward for me and gives you less control. This product does contain talc, so if you're allergic to talc, this may not be the product for your.
1006	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have only used this for 4nights now (I use it only at night) and my goodness!!!!!! My face is BABY BOTTOM SOFT- NO JOKE!!!. It stings though, so you have to be careful. However, the stinging doesn't last. I have been following  DermTv Dr for a while who suggests incorporating an exfoliant into one's regimen. He particularly likes glycolic acid and i can see why. This product from glycolix is one of the best glycolic acid-base products I have used. Worth every penny!!!

3823	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	AMAZING! I was hesitant to purchase at first, as introducing my very sensitive skin to new products is always a daunting task. But, this is an amazing product. My extremely sensitive, acne prone (including painful cystic acne) has gotten much clearer! I will definitely be purchasing this again.

4761	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Husband loves it for beard and shaving his head.  A very thin coating does the trick, so a little goes a long way.  Slippery lube quality.
Sadly it needs to go back because the barrel is too wide for my short thin hair.

FOUR STARS at this point, and I will update when winter comes as performance will be completely different when the air is dry and skin is parched.
My skin tends to be sensitive, but it has done well with this product.

8484	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my day moisturizer. I love it. Not to heavy and smells amazing.
4641	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It's still early but I like what I see and feel so far. A little bit goes a very long way. One little pump and it starts off as a gel and turns into a liquid that speads very easily. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant and it aborbs instantly into the skin. What I notice the most, and I wasn't expecting much, is the firmness it gave my skin from the first application. I do apply my moisturizer with SPF aftwards always and so far I like the results but as far as skin brightening or reducing fine lines and wrinkles (which I do have) I haven't noticed a significant difference yet. Maybe longer use is necessary so we'll see.

5447	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've become pretty skeptical about well-packaged creams like this one. Too often, they don't work well, or they irritate sensitive skin, or they are cheap lotions in good-looking, expensive bottles. Or combinations of all that.
1324	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is great! I Couldn't live without it , my friend told me to try it cuz u was upset that I'm losing hair at a young age and being a woman. I use it after I wash and dry my hair. I keep it in my purse. Love it
4431	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this stuff. It feels good going on as it's not too greasy and has a soft like texture to it. I use it to remove make up and I put it on before using my facial massager. Afterwards my skin feels nice and smooth and still feels like that until the next application. I use it daily. A small dab will cover your whole face so it goes a long way. My face is looking better every day. The smell is nice even though I usually like things that don't have any smell as odors usually bother my sinuses something awful. The other night my husband came in and said what smells so good in here. I had him smell my face and that was it, so even if you don't wear perfume, you are still going to smell good.
3853	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have bought a few nail polish thinners and because I use so much glitter they tend to get gloppy. I seem to need to add a few drops each time I use one of my glitter polishes and this thinner doesn't seem to do the trick but I haven't really tested it enough to make an informed rating.
358	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This creme is the perfect full coverage that doesn't clump up and stays where you put it.  It also comes off easily with all of my make up removes.  Of the coverage products and formats this is the first one I reach for now.
This product is formulated with ginkgo extract, ceramides and panax ginseng for a generally beneficial skin tonic.

Ive been using facial oils ever since my skin started drying out around age 50.  They really work wonders.  Elemis isn't the only brand Ive tried or use, but its certainly one of the nicest if you can afford it.  Ingredients are plant based, and the main ingredient is coco-caprylate, a skin conditioning agent derived from coconut oil.  Its one reason why this oil provides such good hydration, spreadability and such a silky feel.  The extensive addition of other oils and seaweeds helps reduce wrinkles and fine lines.
270	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful color. Looks purple in the bottle, but is a navy blue... Love it!



So I'd have to say that this works quite well at gently cleaning your face while at the same time being pleasant smelling.

9006	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Had my other one for 15+ years, it finally died so I got the same one!
9778	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This came already used- if it wasn't opened and used, it would be a great product!
The stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked.
This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage on my hand (see image attached - the darkest color by the thumb). It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.
1067	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The best always

5563	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff... Perfect for my thinning hair and when I'm in between coloring...
Be aware that the cleanser is very drying, and the peel will burn if you leave it on too long. Otherwise, this is a fantastic skin care regimen. Five stars.
3818	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I needed a good daily cleanser and I love the way this makes my skin feel.  You use so little that it is actually cheaper than the drugstore brands I had been using.
I don't have deep wrinkles, but I do have some fine lines on my forehead and in-between my eyebrows and after using the BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA NIGHT CREAM for nearly a month the lines have softened a bit. I'm sure with continued use they'll be almost non-existent.
6650	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Nice long big barrel for my thick long wavy hair. Easy to use & comfortable. I wish it had an automatic turn off. Pretty sweet tool for the price.

8929	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice but I don't think it does much. Refreshing during hot summer days and I use this on my cosmetic sponges before blending my concealer.

4347	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I know this is some bougie stuff but I love it. My house is so dry right now and I run the humidifier as often as I can but it feels really good!! I bet it would be nice to carry along on a bag with you in the summer if you're in a dry climate.  They've got the miss setting at a perfect level where it's not drenching your face with huge water pellets like a water bottle but a fine mist
And All ingredients are not listed on the bottle.

4975	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	So...When I ordered this, I must have had my oblivious glasses on, because I did not notice that the product was designed for men.  That being said, when it arrived at my house, I decided to try it anyway.  I have VERY sensitive skin.  Most products make my face turn bright red.  I used all three products and had no red rash.  My skin felt clean and smooth.  The moisturizer was light and not greasy.  There is not a strong "man" smell either.  It just smells clean. I was surprisingly impressed.
4203	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Quick to ship, the item was received as described. Love this product! Will buy from again in the future. Thank you for a smooth transaction.
buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.
6583	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it - will re order
I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.
3283	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this lip balm at least 2 to 3 times a day and LOVE it!  I enjoy the refreshing minty tingle it gives.  It stays on the lips a long time without leaving a goopy residue on them.  Highly recommend it!
4811	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This truly is an amazing product for the price!  It makes your scalp feel amazing and you honestly do feel and see a difference in your hairline.
3804	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Removes makeup easily and on-waterproof mascara.  Odor-free, non-oily.  What's not to like?
Its a very thick cream, about as thick as toothpaste.  And, it comes in a toothpaste-like container, with the same type of cap.  A small dab of this will cover your entire face.  It goes on thick and white, but blends into the skin fast without leaving residue.  It does take some time to completely soak in.  This is for very dry skin only.  If you spend a lot of time outdoors, this would be a good product to help hydrate your skin at night.  Its not a good product for the day time because theres no SPF in it.  Even men should wear sunscreen during the day.

However it appears that the Rose Hip extract has been diluted with glycerin and butylene  glycol.

5276	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Broke out.
6706	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have the wider version of this, but for some reason this seems to work better on my hair. It gives me more control with what I want to do. Also, it is long which is helpful. Very pleased.



1400	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Works fast and really covers the thin spots.  Just be sure you pat it in and give it a spray with the holding spray. Otherwise it might flake off.  Washes off easily.
1623	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	beautiful color! Great brand.
I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!
8559	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product for the control of  Rosacea.  Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.
9206	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It sucks others haven't gotten this to work for them. I hope they are using it correctly and letting the product settle completely before using. As for me, this product is hg and I have bought it three times so far. It is best for whiteheads although I definitely use this on popped pimples to keep them from coming back. I have also used this successfully on forming cystic pimples and they flattened. No it doesn't work every time on every single pimple. And some pimples just get really horrible no matter what you use on them. But this stuff is my most reliable spot treatment for overnight, and I will keep buying forever. Only con is that in the winter when my face isn't as oily it's harder to wash off in the morning and can leave a pink cast if my cleanser is too gentle.
2204	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this every day. I'm outside all day and my skin has been super abused. I think this is helping me.

7138	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product for those of us that are prone to ingrown hairs.  After shaving, my sensitive neck area used to always get ingrown hair and breakouts.  Using this product in combination with the Anthony Shaving cream has eliminated ingrown hairs completely.  my skin is soft and smooth!
Beyond that, it's nice to have everything together in one kit so you kind of have a whole instant skin care regime going. That's particularly helpful because if you're using products you bought separately, it's easy to overdo it and end up irritating your skin with too much medication. I'd say that if you haven't already ruled out salicylic acid as a good option, this is worth a try.
5150	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Feels great . Not heavy and makes your skin feel really soft. Great feeling on skin with use. Does not clog
-The toner is the best item in this trio, according to my brother!
2636	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I gotta admit, this Pink Sugar body mousse totally blew me away.  Yes I already love Pink Sugar products, but this not only smells absolutely delicious but also makes your skin really soft and doesn't leave you greasy.  The texture is kind of weird and not exactly like a lotion or a body cream (it starts out feeling like rubbing cottage cheese on your body), but once you get it rubbed into your skin the scent is incredible and lasts a full day of work for me.  So if you also enjoy smelling sweet and tasty, make this a necessity!
4117	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This applicator gets clogged after a few applications and then is impossible to clean so stops working altogether. It's hugely overpriced as well!
563	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful coverage. Really does a nice job covering everything including birthmarks. Stays on and doesn't come off until you take it off.

3812	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My favorite MB product yet. I use this daily with my Clarisonic, even though it says to use max 3 times a week. Nothing else makes my skin feel so clean. Can be drying, but I moisturize after with Argan oil so that's not an issue for me.
5741	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away.
130	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice color, looks great will definitely recommend
The smell is nice.

2642	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A really nice scent, with the Amber on top but with the floral lightly in the background. This has a much nicer smell than most of the other Amber based perfumes that I've smelled. It could be really overwhelming if you sprayed a lot on but sprayed lightly - it's lovely, and kind of a warm scent.

8590	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My favorite soothing and hydrating toner. I have combo/oily skin and use it after a clay mask or on days/nights when my skin is a bit inflamed from allergies.
8771	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have lupus and acne this is really helping with my irritated skin, used it twice and my skin is much less red and softer without feeling greasy.
I've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed AFTER application!). The stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. As far as the colors, after some trial and error, I mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. I've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and I had to blend the medium and light to make it work. I ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so I can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.

Prior to using CHI Silk, I have tried a few similar products but they never worked the way CHI Silk works. It makes hair so silky without making them greasy or reducing the volume down.
but this one is great.
2) Billy Jealousy Hot Towel
7246	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this product.  Have used on a daily basis.  Looks natural and blends well to skin tone.
IS IT NATURAL?
There is a learning curve to using a Dermablend product as I found out after applying too much and looking like a clown.  Start out with LESS and if need, build on that, but when I used less product and gently worked with it, it morphed onto my skin.  Not into the skin, but onto it with a lovely finish. It did not settle into pores or fine lines.




9437	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a cool brand of skin care but for problem skin, don't expect great results. I like the smell feel and price but it only marginally better than most products.
9467	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this polish and container - makes it so easy to get just enough remover on my cotton ball. This stuff works well unless you have glittery polish. It will still work for that polish but will take a while because it's more gentle than other removers. It also has a more mild smell than other products.

1970	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".

At $20 per tube, the price seems steep, but only needing to use small amounts each time makes this a bargain. So, no matter what the box says, Baxters is non-gender specific in my eyes and I highly recommend it.

3) Billy Jealousy Super Slick Shave Cream
5088	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this product on my elbow and knees and I am very happy that this works.  I'm a little bit scared to use this on my face as I have a very sensitive skin and .... I can't take the chances.  That's just me but I'm sure this works just fine.
4311	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I don't know if I got a real Bioelements product or not but this does foam when you dispense on your hand but then I feel like it turns to a watery substance and I don't feel like it is doing anything whatsoever. It seems watered down, or, just ineffective. I would not repurchase this.
She found that the Nourishing oil was not oily on the skin. Her skin just felt softer and not dry. It soaked right in and gave a skin the nice smooth non-dry appearance and feeling. It has no fragrance and it seems to leave no residue of any kind. Another thing that she liked about the oil was that it was not a chemical soup. She will not use most of the common products for skin care because of the many unpronounceable substances which they contain.

Please note that this contains willow bark extract, so it has some salicylic acid in it.  Keep this in mind if you are allergic or sensitive to aspirin.  Salicylic acid is wonderful (for me, at least) for clearing up blemishes and breakouts and I feel this product helped with that.  You will probably want to wear sunscreen if using this product because of the willow bark extract; this serum does also contain some antioxidants which will help with sun damage (for example, from the black tea leaf extract and grape juice).

2416	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This hydroplane shave cream is good but there are better brands out there (proraso, taylor of old bond st). It is also lighter/thinner than most creams and doesn't leave any residue on your face. The best thing about it is that it rinses off very easily from my razor and from the sink too- doesn't gum everything up. I imagine it'd be great with an electric razor but I use a safety razor so I need something thicker. Price is high but I spend this much on 3 beers at happy hour and the bottle lasts a few months lol.

509	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This warm beige is darker than I expected and will look better on a person with olive skin or a deep tan. It is too dark for my complexion. In addition, this make-up does not spread well. When I apply a foundation, I expect a smooth flow with my sponge and this did not provide that.

It does leave a white residue on my olive skin (this is why it loses a point). If I put some elbow grease behind it, the white cast mostly dissipates. My skin is normal and this product makes me feel like I have a primer on my face. I don't wear foundation but I imagine this product would work well underneath it.

Enjoy and shave on!
3824	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This was one of the first Mario products that I ever purchased and I love it. It's great for exfoliating and leaves my skin tone more even and glowy. For an exfoliating toner, it does not dry my combo skin out or irritate it. I will forever be loyal to this stuff.


Overall for as long as this has lasted and the great results, I will definitely be buying this when I finally run out.
I used this product over several days while in SF with my gf--we were staying with my mom. I mention this because we got a wide variety of skin types to test this product out. As mentioned early it is thick on everyone. The apple smell is amazing. The age defy part though... thats a little nebulous.
7777	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I only cleanse my face with salicylic acid 2%.  Ive tried other cleansers but they do not work. I see a dermatologist and sleep with medicated lotion that is prescribed but need to have my face clean prior.

Firstly it commits the packaging sin of having TWICE as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up.  There is literally no reason for it to be in that size box, except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting.  Dishonest.
2263	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The Baxter of California Herbal Mint Toner is my first time using a toner. I have used several Baxter of California products that were mostly very good, so I thought to try the toner.  I used it daily, at night, and it was refreshing, the scent wasn't overly strong and it cleans very well.  It was after a few weeks when I was told by a friend that my skin looked really good. I hadn't told her I was using anything and told her of the toner.  My skin isn't bad, it just looked clearer, better after a few weeks of daily use. My skin is on the slightly oily side so a nice change was that my skin was clean and the toner didn't dry me out.

6156	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Based on reading another review, I went to Mario Badescue's website and did their skin analysis.  You answer some questions and they give you product recommendations.  I had already received this moisturizer for review, but had not tried it yet.  This moisturizer was not the one recommended so I was a little nervous at the term "moisture magnet."  I have combination skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that don't make me breakout. Even if I find one that works for a while eventually it makes my skin breakout.  I usually don't use a moisturizer just to avoid the drama.

Marine Creams are all the rage, and this gel-to-cream formulation, helps to moisturize my skin.  Antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines. I  never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself. This is Top of The Line and Top Quality. This is both light and non-greasy. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is formulated with marine algae, padina pavonica, porphyridium, and ginkgo biloba.

They have a really small travel-size that I carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!
101	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This review is for Russian Navy. Nice color, but when you remove it, it's a real mess, it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails, the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess, discolors your natural nails too. Awful! I have it away from my other polishes to be sure I don't use it again. I had to refile my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off, I wanted to cry. I use a base coat too so this isn't the case. I love opi, but they can keep this, not sure what there doing, I hope it's just this color and they haven't changed the formula, I do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal

This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.

6271	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use many of the billy jealousy products (live and die by the shave products) and I've replaced some generic facial cleansers (Nivea, Aveeno, etc) with this. I use liquidsand in my pre-shave routine and use this as my other cleanser. It doesn't leave my face feeling burnt from chemicals like other cleaners do. If you have the extra cash to spend on something like this I suggest using it.
4419	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have super sensitive skin and problems with flakes and redness. This has worked wonderfully for my skin. It cleanses well without drying out my skin. It does leave a slight feeling of sticky residue so I follow up with a separate toner followed by a moisturizer. It removes foundation and eye makeup nicely. It is a creamy cleanser and leaves my skin feeling soft.
1645	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Okay, this is officially my favorite red polish. And I really like red polish. It's cool-toned, but I think it would be flattering on ANY skin tone. It applies very evenly and is opaque in 1-2 coats. It's not thick, it's not thin, I don't know what else to say because it's a no-brainer! :) I would recommend this to anyone! I think it'll be especially gorgeous for the Fall & Winter months, but it's a great red anytime. And because it's Zoya, it's "5 Free." No DBP, Formaldahyde, Toulene, or any of those other ingredients supposedly toxic. I love this!
4136	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I like the product, but was looking for an easier way to apply instead of just shaking it on.  I thought his was my solution.  It did not fit the canister and even if it did, it was a bulb type of spray.  It would have been hard to use, if it fit the canister.
1747	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great great neutral color
Supersmile doesn't make my teeth sensitive or anything, the only thing is it burns a little on the tongue/gums while brushing but as long as you rinse your mouth out well afterwards it's not a big problem!
1510	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am OBSESSED with Zoya nail polish.  As a long time OPI and Essie polish lover, I came across Zoya through pinterest.  Sloane was my first color used and it is a beautiful color.  I find the polish to last as long as the competitors, if not an extra day (though that could be because I'm trying a different base-coat).  I also find that Zoya is not as thick as the others and I find it easier to manage.

So, for eight or nine days, I lathered on the lotions and creams I had.  I still had itching problems on my back and name of my neck.  Today, this
933	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a very natural color but yet has impact - it is very easy to apply
The best part was the lotion. My husband really liked it, and so did I. It has very little scent and it isn't greasy. A really lovely light lotion. Next would be the toner. While it reminds me of other toners --as I mentioned-- it doesn't seem to leave a residue that needs to be washed off.
I find the color in the bottle looks pretty similar to the color you see when it dries (and also to the image on the screen on the computer I'm currently using).  So you know what you'll be getting.  I'd say this had cool/purplish undertones for a red, it's really more of a wine color.  It has a subtle shimmer and looks really nice with a high-shine topcoat (I used one from Seche Vite).
9838	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a clean and strong scent.  Smells like a big ole' bubble bath and the scent lasts forever.  Might be a bit much for some, but always subjective.  If you like a powerful soapy scent this is the one.  My daughter thought it smelled like carpet fresh.
8419	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	i have a very hard time finding night creams that don't give me acne, but this product is great! feels very thick at first, but absorbs well and leaves skin feeling very smooth.

9365	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical.  I am 64 years old and still have adolescent skin.  The only product that has ever helped is Glycolic Acid MD Skin Peel 70% (which I highly recommend and which you can buy on Amazon, but not in any stores I have ever identified).  Much to my amazement, this Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Serum actually works!  I have been using it for several weeks now and have seen pretty astonishing results.  So, two thumbs up + a blemish free smile for this product.  Give it a try.  If you have seemingly intractable skin issues, this may be the solution you have been looking for.
2068	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	goes on nicely, I would recommend using a topcoat over it. Color doesn't fade but normal chipping happens with use

The Translucent is white, but goes on fairly clear. It does seem to lighten up my foundation a bit.
8473	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like sex for your eyes! It feels so amazing! I have dryer under eyes and after a night with this cream I'll never go to sleep without it!
4640	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've tried a lot of serums in the past year.  I'd say this one measures up to most, if not all, of them.  I don't have a huge problem with fine lines yet, but the idea is to start using anti-aging products now (in my mid/late 30s) to prevent issues in the future.
After reading the ingredient list, I realized like others that this product really isn't an oil but a rose hip extract in a base of propylene glycol and glycerin.  Even so, I do notice a benefit from using it as directed.  Skin is less dry with a more even complexion.

Overall, they work great and are very gentle.  They do not burn like other brands and can be used right after shaving without any problems.  They are refreshing and have a good small without being girly.  I like to use these in conjunction with the Jack Black DIY face peel pads.  Two days of these, third day Jack Black.  Works like a charm.  How do I know?  My 10 year old daughter recently asked me what I had been doing because I didn't look as old as before!  Hah!  Now that's an endorsement.
The best way to apply this foundation after much experimentation is to use a Beauty Blender sponge which is dampened and then bounced onto the face (after moisturizing skin) using the various shaped curves of the blender.  Using a brush does not seem to make the finish go on as smoothly.  Using fingers does not apply the foundation evenly enough.

Bonus:  Strawberry blondes will be able to use this pencil as it has a very slight reddish tint.
5545	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is great. I have a frontal incline of my hairline and this product helps cover it up perfectly. Can't tell at all i have this in my hair and thats the way i like it. Highly recommend
5905	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The BEST nail polish!
Do buy something to dig the dirt out under your nails. I find, now that I have nails, they can get a little dirty.

2978	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very nice products in an elegant presentation.  I don't know how many guys would buy this set for themselves, but I bet most non-electric aficionados would enjoy it as a gift.  The lavender scent is not overwhelming, very soothing.
As for the lipstick itself, it has staying power and did not need refreshing during the day.  It's creamy, but did not feel particularly moisturizing.  However, it was comfortable and the overall finish was nice.  It looked high quality - just the wrong shade for me.
4573	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I have a multitude of "designer deodorants" and while this has absolutely NO SCENT it caused a reaction on my skin. I've never had this issue with ANY deodorant before however I will never purchase this deodorant again.
7733	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My skin loves this and it reduced the appearance of my expression line. I am on my second bottle.
3243	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff. The mint flavor doesn't have that cloying flavor common in commercial toothpastes - much more real taste. Looks very elegant (shocking for toothpaste) on the counter.

I recommended the cream to others and can say that the only people who were not happy with it either did not give it enough time or used it in summer and during the day did nothing (sunscreen, clothing, shade) to protect their skin from UV light. I wonder if the people who gave the cream

I do not use a product with an antiperspirant in it because of the studies done on women regarding breast cancer, and this product does an absolutely perfect job!  I love the fragrance, the deodorant stick, and the packaging.  I have always purchased this product from Amazon, and I highly recommend it!
9742	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This has a wonderful masculine fragrance. It lathers well and rinses easily. Great for the body from head to toe. My husband loves products that are good for more than just one thing and the fact that this is for hair and body makes him very happy. The fact that he smells great after using it makes me very happy.

 makes pedicure last at least 1 month.
Using the product, I tried differing application methods:
2460	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I received a tester.
If you prefer a smooth, silky and soothing aftershave experience, Vichy is for you.  If you are looking for SPF protection in the same application or you like the brisk menthol experience you will not find it here.  Over all, I really like Vichy Homme
Not sure if they have the correct color for my skin tone (which is important)

Also, if you care about these things (and I do), Badescu products are not tested on animals.
The culprit in those cases is SUNSCREEN.  If you use a product with sunscreen in it, you will get flashback in photos, and have an ashy appearance in certain lights and on videos.  Your skin on your face will look starkly different than the rest of your body, even under makeup.
I gave this cream a one-month trial. You need very little because this cream is very concentrated. It seems to increase the skin's thickness and firmness, therefore making the depths of indented surfaces much less apparent.
They say on the bottle that it's suitable for all skin types, which is kind of subjective to me.  Yes I want my face to feel clean when Iam using a cleansing product, but I don't like it feeling stripped. This also left my facial skin looking red, which really surprised me.  Not sure if Iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not.
It comes with a puff to apply the makeup.
4906	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like the way my skin looks and feels after several uses.
I cleansed my face, patted it dry and applied the mask.  I could feel the mask working within 30 seconds after applying it.  The slight tingle (not quite burn) went away within the next 30 seconds.  I left it on for 5 minutes (didn't dry and tighten as most other might) and then followed the package suggestion to massage the exfoliating agent gently on my face.
Go's on smoothly blends easily and when left for a setting period of time, gives a beautiful coverage.  It is not thick.  I wanted to cover up some very very dark bruises on my arms. Bruises caused due to thin skin, that often form  from age and medicine.
4. I used the protein booster skin serum- saw no real difference, and for as much as it costs, you could find better options.
8030	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this since around 2002 and couldn't go a day without it. It gives me a sense of confidence!

9114	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this to add a little shine to my hair and to help protect against heat damage, and it's been working great. Love that it does both without making my hair look 'oily', unlike some other products, or weighing it down.

595	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Not too soft just right the color is perfect this is exactly what I was looking for.

PLUSES
I use them 3-4 times a weeks .

There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.
9606	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried every soap bar under the sun and even some that came from the sea. These are the best. Great for skin, last forever and leave your skin feeling clean but not dry.
8415	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it!!
3330	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have seen many 'silver' polishes but this one is truly at the top. The silver is gorgeous and if you look closely you will see little metallic silver stars. I mix this polish with some fine halogen crystals to give it even more sparkle but it stands beautifully on it's own. I know you will never get a more beautiful silver ( w/a pinch of white) than this and you will definitely NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
It does contain some ingredients that sensitive skin types may react to, so read the ingredient list first
8090	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm an African American male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. It makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and I can't where the low to bald styles since I have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. One day I discovered Toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.
7694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love Elizabeth Arden products (particularly her Red Door perfume).  I decided to try Visible Difference Special Body Care Lotion.  It is lightly scented and not overwhelming at all.  It is light and only a dash of lotion can be applied over legs and body.  Once applied it gets absorbed by the skin very quickly.  Beautiful light scent lingers for a long time.  I apply my regular perfume before going to work and it does not interfere with the lotion.  Skin is very soft after lotion application.
Blue Copper 5 is the same treatment applied to burn victims to replenish and restore the skin's firmness and suppleness.  If it's good enough for the surgeons and hospitals to use, it's good enough for us, too.
Summary---I would prefer to use a concealer or cover up just on the spots where I might need it and not go for a total coverage foundation.  That is what this is and that is what you will be getting when you order this.
2413	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My esthetician recmnded this & she was right! It keeps a low profile so it's easier to see what you're doing but still makes the skin just slick enough to help with smooth shaving. There's no slipping around.
5770	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Elizabeth Arden since 1990. I wasn't aware of the deodorant but it was well worth the expense. Reminds me of the good old days when I would shop at the Fashion malls in the state of Florida.

3665	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This product gives me a nice color, and it smells better then most self tanners. I like the foam, which makes it easy to apply.  You can use the Xen-tan glove, or you can use disposable gloves. I just used it for my legs and arms. It is pretty expensive for what it is. I usually use Suave Professionals Visible Glow Self-Tanning Body Lotion, Fair to Medium 7.5 oz, and I love it! The price is great, and the color lasts several days, if not a week. It doesn't rub off on clothes, like the Xen-tan does. However, the Suave has that self-tanner stink.

4774	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It's definitely a really good conditioner and it leaves your hair feeling very soft especially if you leave it in, but there are definitely cheaper products out there that do just as good of a job for less. I wish there was a little bit of a menthol effect like you have with some other shampoos. I like having matched products though and I'm a big fan of the Jack Black shampoo so I'll probably just continue to use this anyways as the rest of their product line is amazing.
* The brush does smell funky the first few times you get it wet (like a wet badger), but this fades. This is because the brush actually IS made of badger "hair"/fur (and to that point, I personally haven't researched whether it's humanely harvested or not, though I can't imagine they shave the badgers and send them back out into the wild)
Would recommend.
2762	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really love this shine spray!! I don't quite use it as directed but it is very similar to a more expensive shine spray product that I have used in the past. I use the CHI Polishing Shine Spray before blow drying and flat ironing- after I have put in my texturizer and smoothing gels. This shine spray, when applied section to section on damp hair, adds amazing texture and volume! It seems to "seal" the hair, leaving it soft, texturized, and controlled. It also smooths and shines... just like it says.
This product is wonderful for my sometimes-dry skin.

1289	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A must for me!!!! Always need to have it to fill those not so hairy spots!!!


4247	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a lovely scent, not very floral but more musky. When first applied, it's more floral but the residual scent after wearing it for several hours is the vanilla musk scent, which I prefer.  It comes in a cool, Roman column-like bottle.  I also like that it seems to be quite concentrated, which means you need just a little so the bottle should last a very long time.
1094	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great weightless powder. The saffron color is a bit on the orangish yellow side. It seals in the foundation well and reduces shine.
6795	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've heard such great things about this product for such a long time and I finally decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. I am so impressed with how fast it works and I love that the ingredients list is very minimal. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my full, more detailed review I posted about it.
4290	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Expensive & I think it only works with the Acne Gel (also by PCA) but the two together do a good job at keeping my skin clear.


2643	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	First thought: rich, floral, heady..in your face to start with.  Relax, it mellows and you're able to be aware of the different parts.  I can kind of pick out the vanilla and magnolia.  It becomes more subtle but still really is a night time fragrance.that can be smelled on your skin hours later.  It reminds me of Shalimar..in the sense that you wouldn't put that on to go to work but it's intensity is perfect for nights.  Rochas is a well known perfume maker in Paris and this is a generously sized bottle for the price..enjoy!
very nice scent that works for woman or men.
9591	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff just smells great and the scent seems to last a good long time. Very subtle fresh and earthy scent that lathers very well.
7687	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product after borrowing a friends on a trip to the Middle East...this stuff is amazing what a life saver! I have light blonde hair and used to have to wash it daily because I felt my scalp looked oily...this stuff allows me to go a day or even 2 without washing! It smells great and gives my hair lots of volume as well. Also great for the gym after a workout if you don't have time to wash your hair. The bottle lasts FOREVER - so worth the $$$
I decided I needed to try it as such too. I mean, it's okay as a shower gel and everything, but the lather doesn't last too long and it honestly feels almost wasteful to use it as such.
I went straight to L'Occitane and purchased more. I now use this every time I shave, religiously. I will never touch a razor to my body without it again. It's pure magic in a bottle.

I stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner somehow searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here. My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever "perfect" when I flat iron!). Soemtimes I don't even use the serum, and its still great.
Just one to two times a day. At first I tried to apply the cream three times a day, but found it was easier to remember to put this cream on after a shower and/or before bed. It seems to work very well with only two applications a day.
6682	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Should have bought this years ago. My hair is very thick and this iron actually works on it and holds for a few days.
24	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this product for many years.  Although it is expensive, it is the only toothpaste I use.
The entire life of this fragrance is amazing. From opening notes to the dry down to the last little bit of fragrance that lingers at the end of the day. The worst thing about it is that it only lasts about 3 or 4 hours on me. I have been told that I leave my smell behind on other people's clothes or their furniture, so maybe it just becomes undetectable to me at 3 or 4 hours. Also, the only people to ever compliment me on this product are people (women) that come within a foot or two of me- this is fine as I don't want to be the ass that is creating scent pollution in the office! I have only purchased from retail stores, so I cannot speak to the service or product delivered by Amazon but, If you're looking for an original fragrance that is spicy and sweet but not too sweet, you should give this stuff a try! The most noticeable notes all throughout are cinnamon, leather and vanilla. Words cannot express how much I love this juice!
286	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Good quality product
I've found that it cleans just as well and it doesn't leave my skin too dry.  Another thing I like is that I can use it around my eyes.  There are no fumes to irritate my dry eyes and makeup comes off beautifully.
2990	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Lanza KB2 Leave In Conditioner does help with frizz problems. I love almost all Lanza products, and this one is no exception.
2994	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wow, this balm is wonderful!  I have dry skin all year round & this is so rich & creamy without being greasy.  I use this in combo with the PCA retinol treatment & my skin has never looked better & I'm 58!  I'm a big believer in PCA & use many of their products, this Silkcoat Balm is a must for me.
3848	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Came packaged as others mentioned. Had one single piece of tape over the lid that had come off. My OPI Polish was barely too thick but I still added 9 drops before I noticed any difference. The polish seemed to chip faster than usual but that could be completely random. Overall, it thinned the polish so I would recommend it.

5735	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I found this on Amazon and bought the smaller size to try it out.  It is fabulous for people that are going thin on top.  I highly recommend this product.
3171	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love, love, love. I have been experiencing thinning hair for a variety of hormonal and stress related reasons. I had been using another phyto product but had been going through a bottle in less than a month - for $34 a bottle that was way too much. I thought I would give this a try and have been super pleased. I find considerably less hair falling out and my hair just looks healthier. I know that some have commented on the smell and while I do find there is a certain pine odor I don't think it's bad enough to stop using. I know that some say they leave it in overnight but I have never tried that. I put it in as soon as I get up in the morning and let it sit for 20 mins while I have morning coffee. Since I only do it once a week I don't think its a problem with my morning routine.
2745	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	The product feels creamy and spread easily. It does seem to make my eye area look a little better. I felt no burning or irritation from it. I can't get past the strong perfume scent it has though. It is terrible, I really don't understand why these companies have to put this kind of scent into skin products, it is very irritating and I will not buy something like this that has a perfume scent. This product also pills which I find unacceptable in any type of skin cream.
This is a high quality brand that is luxurious to use, has a fresh, clean smell and when purchased as a set like this can be more cost-effective.
4205	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	The smell is awful!
2719	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best eyeshadow ever!
9765	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Lovely fragrance, kind of heavy and sticks around looong after you apply it. Seems like the perfect thing though for winter! Update..... I have been using every day since I got it. It keeps my makeup on, as a user on my face. So use a little bit on my neck or my age is starting to show. It really seems to help my neck :-) you may consider this an issue, or you may not,  but you can still feel this moisturizer on the next morning. It has not any breakouts for any negative side at all. For something at last this long, that's a miracle!
6196	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very nice sunscreen, doesn't leave your face white. 4 stars due to being a little thin or runny coming out of the tube and always get to much.
9344	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down. It makes it soft and bouncy.  I even have added it to my dry hair with great results. What I'm going to try next is to add a little to my hair before I color it.  It's supposed to help the color absorb into the hair shaft better. I highly recommend this product!
5927	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite blue nail polish. It's the perfect tint of a light grey blue and the sparkles in it really make the color pop. It's a perfect color for any time of the year also. Very versatile!
FACE SOAP ($15 individually):  This is a nice soap, cleanses, doesn't overly foam, but after the rinse, you feel clean.  Nothing truly spectacular, and a number of face soaps will do this, but it is a nice face soap.  Four Stars.
7971	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Contents should be filled closer to the top of the bottle; otherwise, product was fine.  Delivery was also good.
6985	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	There are a lot of positives to this product.  I've been using this product for several weeks now and have never experience the burning sensation which other reviewers noted; however, it must be noted that I do not have particularly sensitive skin, either.  I have combination skin, so take that as you will.
2173	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm writing this on behalf of my husband, who just started using it.  He'd been using the Jack Black Beard Lube for probably about ten years, but wanted to try something different, so he ordered this.  It gives SUCH a nice, clean, smooth shave!  His face is so soft afterwards, and it seems like the shave does last longer.
2091	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I was expecting a nice pink color, but what you get is especially a nude polish. I will probably not  buy polish online without seeing it in person in the future.
2350	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have been using this for a few weeks and it is a good moisturizer.  I am hoping it will help with some fine lines and know it will take awhile longer to see results.  I will buy in the future if I see good results from this!
2070	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love Essie Nail Polish - It's the best out their - and the prices here are fantastic!  Very happy with this purchase!
4338	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I know many people don't get the purpose of thermal water, especially the Evian thermal spray. People tend to associate Evian only with drinking water, and find this aerosol to be no more than a gimmick.
790	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I applied it with a brush for a light coverage finish and found that it did not settle into my smile lines. The Bisque color blended perfectly with my skin and there is no line of demarcation between the foundation's application on my face and my neck.
1729	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely loved my purchase!!!:))
312	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	What a difference this product makes. I honestly didn't think I needed it... but I am so pleased with the way it makes my nail polish look.
4221	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE IT
And she really likes it. So there's no loss there EVER.
7428	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have combination skin, plus I have a stressful job and life. I also have very sensitive skin. So finding something that works that didn't dry my skin out or give me a rash or burn my skin has been something of a wild goose chance. I was actually gifted a small version of this in their Detox Kit and fell in love. Not only did it work, but it didn't smell, was easy to use, and I could literally see the difference in a matter of days not weeks. I know that more than likely won't be typical for most people, but I know I'll continue to buy this as long as it works.

1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):


3948	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Excellent moisturizing with no burning, this is a great product for very sensitive skin that tends toward dryness. I have experienced burning with other moisturizing masks, even those supposedly designed for sensitive skin. Never with this - I love it and use it year-round.
8783	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this product also

356	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	First, the color on this worked very well.
I really like the consistency of this product. It goes on smoothly and blends extremely well. Honestly, it does take away a bit of the scars redness all on its own. For full coverage, I require a skin-matching concealer over top of it, but the disappearing act is much better with this product acting as a base.
The "secret" ingredient is "Dimethicone" which is an organic micro silicone that delivers a frictionless shave.

UPDATE 2:  I bought a new bottle and continue to be happy with the product months later.
8843	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	didnt work for me burned my skin moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!
Oil free foundation
3. the price is so prohibitive, I don't know how many people can afford to spend this much on a foundation (I can't)
2402	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love it. would not be without it.
This is a five-free polish (as are all Zoya polishes).  Although my bottle was kind of old, this went on smoothly and wasn't sticky or goopy.  This had some of the best performance of a Zoya polish I've used, actually (and I have quite a few of them).  Definitely recommended if you like the color.
All in all, good stuff. I might heat it up a little and pour some into a plastic tube for traveling, though.
5817	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Ive been using this product for almost 10 years and this batch has no expiration date and has a different fragrance
1687	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	As exppected.
Great great iron the best. My hair stylist only uses this one in the most expensive salon in Boston.
- The ingredients are natural.
I have tried so many products to cover my issues and none have been satisfactory,  Now, after hearing about Dermablend for many, many years, I am finally using it and am happy with the results.
I will say this, if you have regular access to Menscience Face Scrub, that's actually the best for Step 1. Problem is it's about 2-3 times more and is more for just pre-shave than whereas Liquidsand can be used all the time.
1902	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Pretty color, very pink!
I like that there are shades that you can choose and its not a one-size-fits-all like so many other sunscreen products.  You can choose a tone that is suitable for both daytime and nighttime wear.  The price point is a little higher than I usually choose but Ive found a little goes a long way  you certainly don't slather it on.  In fact its basically a high end make up item.  Its very natural looking; not cackey or maskey.
4420	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Great skin cleanser  doesnt do much as a makeup remover.
I officially have been converted to Butter London, however, they lack a lot of colors. So, when they come out with more I will investigate. I completely recommend this brand if you are able to spare the cost for the quality.

4231	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product great price
6528	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smells good and has a nice moisturizing quality.
3852	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	works well, as I wanted it to.
9759	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a moisturizer for use at night and in the morning.  The jar it comes in is nice and hefty, but still annoying.  It's harder to get product out of jars and the ingredients degrade every time you open it.
4030	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Gentle, effective, no sting.  With little moisturization,  I apply this  after washing my face with water, and it removes my eye makeup and grim of the day nicely.  No fragrance, and you wonder if it is not water!  But my eye make up is often the tougher area to  clean off, quickly.  I am not normally big fan of make up remover, but this simple product wins a point from me!
5729	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I always re-order this product. My previous reviews no longer exist because the reseller is gone so I am going to c&p my original review.


5593	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic cover for thin hair!
4456	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great cleanser that's smooth and creamy. It can be wiped off with a cloth or rinsed off with water. It's a cleanser, toner, and eye makeup remover, which is also convenient for when I travel. My face feels really soft after using it. I love Vichy products!
8339	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	40 years old and still get mistaken for a 20 something...i'd say this works!!!
3703	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This cleaner helps clear my skin of makeup and dirt from the day.  It feels refreshing after I pat dry and I don't need to scrub on my skin to get the makeup and dirt removed.
1574	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great polish high gloss. Sheer in color
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!
4853	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Powder color is off, much lighter than expected, not the same as I have gotten before but should be. Can not compare to Bare Minerals.
869	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It seemed kinda silly to spray water on your face, but I have dry skin and this definitely helps my face in the middle of the day.  I spray on over my makeup, and it seems to bring back the elasticity.
goes on smoothly and does not feel goopy or greasy.  it is light and good for under makeup.
8654	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Good shampoo. I enjoy this brand a lot. They do not test on animals. Always nice quality product as well. I have curly hair. Gentle on it.
596	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I used this product in the past and liked it then too. It seems like it was slightly darker before, but that may be an optical illusion. Whatever, I like it because it's such good quality and the color is a good all-purpose. I'll keep it.


6667	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Great brand but the clamp crimped my hair so badly I returned it and ended up buying another one without it.

Moisturizer
6248	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Service great. Product the best ever had. Wonderful personal cleaning.
Second...I only read the name before I bought it, I skipped the subtitle.  Wow!  I was surprised at my first cleansing session.  This wash has beads in it!  Oh, if you look past the name and down to the smaller print you'll see "2 in 1 cleanser and exfoliator".  Okay, so the weekly scrub will be shelved for a while.
5415	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Dermatoligist recommended for older skin & wrinkles. I love it, used over year & wouldn't use anything else. Love it!
I've tried a couple of the CLEAN scents and I really like them because they are refreshingly different from other perfumes I buy.
4437	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The great thing is I had purchased this product before it showed up on my Vine list (but I lost it in a TSA search.)
I like the Aqua scent by Calvin Klein a bit more than One but I've been wearing them both and have gotten compliments on the fragrances.
The cuticle oil smells very good as well and the top coat is awesome.
3798	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Any product I have bought from Marie Badescu has been really good. This cleanser contains glycolic acid which is very good for your face. It lathers really well with just a small amount.
2022	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The color is amazing. Perfect for fall. As with most Essie brand nail polishes, you'll need to apply 2+ coats and it only looks good for a few days max. The color is awesome though.
957	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Works very well and feels good on the skin.  Very good brand. I purchased because someone recommend it to me.

9567	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A very nice scent, almost cinammon-y.  Perfect for a man.  Perhaps give it a sniff at the store, to make sure you like it, and then price shop to see what the difference is between store and Amazon.  But if you are looking for a quick gift or just something to make yourself smell better, this will do the trick.
8504	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It's a bit greasy so I only use it on the area beneath my eyes were I have some lines, hoping to smooth them out.  My pores clog easily so I don't dare put it on my t-zone but I also use it around my lips.  It has a very light fragrance and I only use it for night use.

5783	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Your skin feels extremely clean. You don't need to use much to have a nice thick foam. I love it!!
Product usage impressions:

This is a lightweight liquid that is applied using a cotton pad and as stated, no rinsing is necessary. In that sense it works like a toner and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean and fresh. I love using it for that reason alone.


5795	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very refreshing. Looking forward to using it in the summer and on vacation to cool off and keep skin hydrated. Will buy again. Very nice mist.

2025	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Gorgeous, deep color that looks great on all skin tones. Nice consistency and great shine.  Another example of color and quality from essie brand. Great price from company, too.
4729	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great


Other positive: while I haven't used it consistently or on a weekly basis, my medium sized bottle has lasted over three years. A little truly does go a long way and you really get your money's worth.
9418	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This mascara does NOT clump or smudge under my eyes.  I love how it feel - never hard on the lashes.
Since my brows are so light it's hard to pluck them just right, but I have a tool that helps with that too. :-) After I pluck them, applying this excellent pencil is easy. The color is perfect for my coloring--no reddish cast as some blonde pencils tend to produce.
Plus, the bottle is huge. A little goes a long way and I only have to buy it twice a year.
Two coats make perfect! Love in a bottle.
3364	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my toe nails.
When I am using a shower gel, deodorant, or cologne I want something that smells nice but does not smell like a perfume. This is a nice smelling shower gel that is made for a man. It is not something I would wear to work but is perfect when I am going out on a date or going out with friends.
8848	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the way this candle smells. Burns for many hours.
3153	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I received a sample of this product and the fragrance was so lovely, I ordered a bottle.  I am very pleased.  The fragrance is not overpowering and lasts for some time.  It has a floral scent, which is heavenly.  You cannot go wrong with this product.
2754	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My wife has been using it for two weeks every night and says she has not noticed a significant change or improvement in skin tone. She likes it in general but does not see a huge improvement over other skin cream brands she has used.
In case you haven't seen one in a store, the top black part actually pops off which I thought was kind of strange but I don't mind it. Once the top pops off you have a lid to twist to open the bottle. I think its just for design which I like because it makes for clean storage because of the solid rectangular shape.
836	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	We love the smell of this stuff! Keeps our babies skin soft and never has irritated it!
for healing applications.
3208	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this primer. It separates each of my lashes to make them look fuller, and it adds a slight curl so I don't have to use an eyelash curler.

1420	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Of all the aftershave products I've tried this is the one I always come back to. My barber (who I occasionally go to for a shave too) tells me that it's drying because its a gel. She's probably right, but I love the cooling menthol-ness of it nonetheless. I'll keep buying it until they stop making it.
Pros:
5328	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this.  I alternate using it with their regular cleanser and then only use it in the evening.  I like NIA24 products in general.  A little goes along way and it keeps your skins feeling smooth and fresh.
I will say this, if you're using it as part of your shave routine and can afford the price difference and have regular access to Menscience Face Scrub, that's actually the best for Step 1. Problem is it's about 2-3 times more and is more for just pre-shave than whereas Liquidsand can be used all the time.
The only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application, but is easily cleaned up. Right now Amazon has the best price on this product, costing $10 less than at beauty supply stores. I've also tried Caboki, which for me was of inferior quality, lasting power and had a funny rubber-like smell (Toppik has no scent whatsoever).
5005	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I have used a lot of different brow products over time, and one thing that I have a difficult time finding is a brow product that does not settle into the skin, pores, or smear while wearing in the day.
2629	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	An elegant, rather assertive, musky scent with a small hint of old-fashioned cologne underneath. I'm a woman but I'm wearing it. It beats sweet florals any day.
9726	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have never been a big fan of my wife or others wearing perfume because it was usually too strong. I also was not that fond of the scents that were too sweet and floral. I remember that while I was teaching, a certain perfume was being used by quite a few high school girls as well as my wife for a time. After a short time the scent would change. It took on the scent of stale beer. Needless to say I mentioned to my wife who then threw it out. I always got a chuckle when I smelled stale beer in my classroom as a student walked by.

This is my first DE razor.  I read about it at badgerandblade.  It is the favorite razor of a bunch of guys there, so I decided to get the gold one.  I don't know how it compares to other DE razors, but I'll take the word of those shavegeeks as gospel.  I have only used Feather blades (supposedly the sharpest/harshest).  If you don't apply pressure, you should have smooth hairless skin, instead of a skinless face.
Enjoy!
9290	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this bronzer because in the package it didn't look the least bit orange.  However, upon application it was most definitely orange.  Packaging can be deceptive!  This is disappointing because every bronzer I've tried thus far, from high end to low end, has ended up orange, if not immediately then after a few hours of wear.  I guess it is that I don't like the look of bronzer,  I prefer just blush.  What a waste of cash!  I wanted something that would sculpt my cheekbones and give me a nude look.  But it's as orange as can be and makes me look way too made up.  Now I have a somewhat expensive makeup item that I can't do a thing with.  I bought it on vacation in San Francisco and can't return it anywhere.  What a shame!  I'll find someone to give it to.  I simply have no use for yet another bronzer that's as orange as a pumpkin!  I definitely don't recommend this product.

8100	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a very nice pomade. It is not the greasy, waxy pomade of old, but an easy to wash out product that does not dry out or get hard. The smell is light.
I like to mix it with any wash that contains exfoliating beads to really get a clean feel.  Then you can use even less of this product and get the same menthol effect.


Important note...this product goes perfectly with the Sara Happ Lip Slip - LOVE it.  I would highly recommend that you use both of them together...works great.  Definitely worth the cost as I have tried everything else and nothing worked.

7388	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base takes the saying "a little goes a long way" a little too seriously. This tiny tube of foundation base is not worth $45.00, not to me anyway. Yes, it's creates a nice soft feeling on your skin but it did not help my makeup stay put or minimize pores like other, less expensive bases and primers. It actually felt like glycerin which you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price. I didn't notice any difference in the final look with or without it. I was very disappointed and could not imagine ever purchasing or recommending Canvas Base, not when there are plenty of products available that do the job perfectly.
When dry, our hair felt silky and soft and both of us commented on how much less brittle it felt after the pool.

I am so glad I found this product! I have told friends I use it and they have stared at my head and can't tell where the powder is versus my actual hair. It has made me much more confident! Occasionally when I scratch my head some of it comes off onto my hand but this is a minor annoyance compared to how great it makes me look.

She said the plates are nice and smooth and it doesn't 'catch' her hair like some flat irons do.  Also, she says it is very easy to use for curling her hair also.  A great styling tool at this price point.
4007	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Vichy's Micellar Cleansing Water is fantastic! The absence of alcohol in Vichy's Micellar Cleansing Water means the product is gentler on skin and ideal for those with sensitive skin!. The product is perfect for cleansing, toning, or removing makeup.  I have used it to remove heavy makeup, including thick fiber mascara, and it does a fantastic job.  My skin always feels soft and refreshed after using Vichy's Micellar Cleansing Water and it doesn't leave an oily residue.  I like that it comes in a smaller bottle with a sturdy lid, perfect for taking on trips.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Water-All-in-1-Cleanser-Waterproof-Makeup-Remover-13-5-floz/dp/B017PCGAXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-1 Cleanser & Waterproof Makeup Remover, 13.5 floz</a>

3328	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Living in the middle of a Midwestern cornfield can be challenging during the sticky, humid summer months especially for nail polish.
The coverage is spectacular, but this product is likely not meant for blending/contouring. I suggest it for hrs to cover blemishes and smooth texture. Make sure you get setting powder as it can be a little greasy.
Once on my skin this is easy to massage into my skin.  Once done it comes off easily. My face feels more alive and cleaner after I use this product. Also, a little of this goes a long way so this should last for a while.


7119	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Nice but not my favorite.
Imagine my surprise when this little beauty arrived.  It has a great bead-blasted matte finish that looks like titanium (it is actually stainless steel, according to the packaging).  The little instruction book was tiny and impossible to follow, but who needs instructions to figure out a nail clipper, right?

3938	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Although I'm not a soap snob, this Jojoba Oil soap made me understand that there truly can be a difference in soaps. First, the smell of this soap is perfect. It's not too perfume-y and not too musky. It smells neither overtly feminine nor masculine, but rides the middle ground beautifully. It's not overpowering, but neither is it understated. It has a good, clean earthy fragrance that both my husband and I enjoy. The Jojoba Oil DOES make a difference! Harsh winter temperatures cause dry skin problems in this house, and this soap has a good moisturizing affect when used daily. It is not greasy or oily, but leaves your skin feeling clean and well moisturized. Overall, this soap may well turn me into a soap snob, because I really like it and I will definitely buy it in the future.
9575	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is suitable for unisex use. I love this fragrance. The top note has a touch of pepper (not my favorite). It dries down to a snuggly and welcoming sweet  sandalwood smell that I adore. I got very light with this one because of the top notes. I  can smell it on my skin and hair the next day.
3724	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great toner! Doesn't dry out your skin. Leaves it fresh and feeling clean! I will definitely continue to buy!!
7938	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used to think buying a wig was my only alternative as a female with alopecia. I started with one little thin spot 20 years ago. Now the entire top of my head is extremely sparse or bald. Nothing worked for me before this. My only problem was that the dark brown was too dark, and the med brown too light. I found out you could pry/twist off the top of the regular size container or larger, and then you could mix colors to get the exact right match.

All of Vichy's products are reasonably priced for the results you get.  And with Amazon, they are easy to buy.
577	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I gave this foundation a four-star rating because it seemed a bit thick and dark to me. Having said that I almost never wear make up other than mascara. So my expectations may be impossible to realize considering that I need high SPF as well as good cover-up for occasional film and Skype appearances.  Women who are accustomed to wearing foundation and powder every day very well might find this product relatively sheer.
The masque, itself, is a thick cream having the consistency of paste. It is not greasy. It has a light, somewhat floral scent.  The masque goes on easily. I found that I didn't have to use a lot of the product either. Because of its consistency, it is easy to apply. I divided my very long hair into sections to make it easier.. Each strand needs to be covered, and using a thick-toothed comb to distribute it evenly is helpful.
1435	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this brush.  I hesitated to buy it because of the price but it is so worth the money.  My hair no longer gets that stringy look midday, but stays full of volume with tons of shine all day.  I can't believe how much difference a brush can make.  It also works perfect for adding a little back combing (brushing) and then smoothing the top.  I wish I had gone for the most expensive Mason brush, but for now I will just enjoy this one.
6452	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like other Mario Badescu products, the liquid is thick but not greasy at all when you apply it to your face. It has a gentle soothing effect and I found my skin feeling soft and well hydrated after a day running around in the hot, humid weather. Though the bottle is small, a little goes a long way and it's the perfect size for traveling. I can't imagine going on a plane without it.
It was good for my sensitive skin - no redness or irritation.
7347	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have pale, almost non-existent eyebrows.  Currently I've been using two different department store brands of "wind up" automatic pencils.  They're smooth going on but very easily break off, and are expensive for the amount of actual product inside the pencil.  I've also tried hard pencils but they don't apply easily and often the color is too dark or doesn't show up at all.  And the brow powders I've tried are difficult to get on light enough to not look like a drawn-on eyebrow, plus powder doesn't seem to last all day or stay on when swimming.  This micro pencil is the best of all of them:  goes on easily/smoothly in tiny strokes so it looks very natural, is a great color for me, stays on until you take it off, and you get the whole pencil plus sharpener.  It will last a long time and is a good value.  I highly recommend this product--it is my new holy grail of eyebrow pencils!!
I kind of wish that it didn't have the exfoliator beads in it.  I prefer a stronger weekly scrub to a gentle daily one, but hey, the world isn't perfect.
7798	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used this after I shaved and it felt very good.  It goes on light, and non greasy.  It doesn't have any scent to me, and felt like I was applying a delicate face wash.  I don't have a lot of facial hair, but I occasionally break out when I shave.  This hasn't caused any break outs after using it, and my skin felt smooth where it was applied.  It only takes a tiny bit to cover a decent amount of area so this bottle should last.  I liked this product, and would continue using it.
This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.
7792	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I just love this face wash! I noticed a difference after the first time I used it and after only a few days my skin is noticeably clearer.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.
6566	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The facial spray by Mario Badescu smells wonderful  (if you like roses). There is so much product in this, it's cheap, and the ingredients are great. I have been using this in the morning as a toner, it makes my pores feel tighter, and I've been using it as a setting spray for my makeup. Definitely recommend.
1398	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.
900	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used to love the Evian spray.
Anyway, even though I have not run out of my current supply of Beard Lube, I ordered this Shave Cream.  I used it for the first time about 30 minutes ago.  This stuff is REMARKABLE!  It takes a bit more effort to apply than Beard Lube (I do not own $200 shaving brushes) but I worked up a good lather with just my fingers.  As soon as I began to move the razor against my skin, I actually had to stop because I thought I had forgotten to install a blade.  We are talking about an entire weekend's worth of stubble and the blade went through it with no pulling of any kind.  Without exaggerating one iota, this was the closest, cleanest, most comfortable shave I have ever had.
Blends Well
One suggestion for Toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink. Dumb, as people would order sooner, if they knew they were running low.
I did notice that Baxter of California Hydro Salve Lip Balm is marketed to men.  I'm not sure how it will do with that crowd.  The packaging isn't pink or anything, but it's in a squeeze tube instead of the more gender neutral chapstick style.  However, I like that the brand isn't being ridiculous and going overboard with trying to make the product seem manly.  I don't see any reason why a guy couldn't wear this product.
The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a loop attached to hang it forcing me to have to try to balance it on my sink. Electrical items should NOT be by water. Still, that's where I "do" my hair and it's too hot to put on my lap, wood surface, etc.

6574	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I wanted to love this, because my skin needs extra moisture once I've applied my make up and throughout the day. However, if you have sensitive skin, this will more than likely irritate your skin.

4565	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have always thought the decanter holding the precious liquid was pretty but I was unprepared how gorgeous and mesmerizing this scent was going to be. From the moment I rubbed the tester from a magazine my nose was in love. Five minutes later I ordered a big bottle off the internet and it arrived a few days ago, and I still cannot part with the scent. I even spray it on to go to bed, the sheer fact how warm and softly scented my sheets are in the morning makes it hard to get up to work. This scent melts into the skin, the musky crme brulee base is topped with juicy crimson watermelon, glowing mandarin, apples, fresh aquatic hyacinth, royal smelling lily and precious woods that give it a soft and spun like quality to the scent. I often find myself inhaling the aroma through the day, catching whiffs of my warm body and they escape up and away.
thank you
3611	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product is great for those painful bumps that never come to a head.  They're considerably smaller by morning, if not completely gone.  I used the buffering lotion every day until my cystic acne was gone, and now i only use it once in a while when I have a flare up.  This worked faster and better than all of the different topical prescriptions my dermatologist prescribed!  I use a bunch of products from the Mario Badescu line and I like them a lot.

6353	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a skincare junkie, but for some reason I never really got any Mario Badescu products or samples (probably because they aren't a brand offered by Sephora.) I did a little research, and I was surprised by how loyal the followers of this brand are, and that for the ingredients, the prices on their products are pretty reasonable. You'd think $20+ for an ounce of rose hip oil is pricey, but it really isn't. This smells fabulous, and your skin drinks in the few drops you can use to cover face, neck, and decollete. Rosehip oil is swimming in Vitamin C, an antioxidant that's superb for anti-agiing skincare.
6565	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	In love!! This is a complete worth, it makes me feel fresh and gives me a very nice glow
6454	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	With airconditioning on all day, my skin gets very dry, especially areas under my eyes and cheek.  Apply little around those areas during the day, really minimise the dryness and constant cream application.  Hence avoid very simulating the oily area around my nose.  Economical , tiny amount is suffice.  Great for dry environments.
6352	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is--pleasantly--light both in texture and in scent.  Lest that sound like damning the product with faint praise, I DON'T mean it that way.  I really dislike strongly scented facial products, and have found that more and more products seem now to have strong scents.  I have also found that 'rich' products are as often (if not more often) pore-clogging as helpful.
7562	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Since I faithfully use cream on my face twice a day, in the morning under my makeup and in the evening after I wash my face, I decided to try this product. I was pleasantly surprised. It has a thick consistency with a slight scent. It goes on nice and smooth and a small amount goes a long way. I have used it a few times now and it has left my skin feeling pretty soft but not greasy. Also, I like the fact that it does not leave a film on my skin. I would recommend this product.

The plastic rectangle container perplexed me. (You can see it in the close-up photos of the product.) I thought it might have some hidden object. After a little research  (the box didn't explain it), I found out the "side arms" are for stacking other Jouer products for easier storage. This is the first Jouer product I've tried, so there aren't any others to test the stacking feature.
This also works very well with my Clarisonic cleaning system. I carry it in my gym bag and prefer it to other face washes. It takes me a while to have confidence in facial products and this has proven to be the best for my skin.
4570	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very pleasant fragrance and last all day.
9478	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried this product for a couple of weeks.  While I am not sure my neck area looks any different, I have to say I love the feel of this cream.

I didn't really notice a difference, but I've never had a irritablity problem with any Proraso soap.  There isn't much scent to this one, but like the others it makes a rich, creamy foam that never goes flat.

4021	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This is absolutely terrible smelling. It's a combination of old lady and very old, sickly-sweet perfume smell-- not at all like the other crabtree & evelyn products I've had over the years. A cute box and bottle don't make up for the odor.
  STUPID ME did not know how to go about using it.  I did not read the ample instructions that came with it.  That's just my style.  So I sat there poking this weird feeling makeup, giggling, until I poked a hole right in the top of it.  I later found out that was a no-no, but other than making it look ugly sitting in the container, the makeup is still working fine.

I marched back into the bathroom and looked at my hair - yup, smooth, shiny, and silky all right. And after sleeping on it all night - even tossing and turning -- I woke to smooth silky hair! Okay, so, I'm sold!

2805	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have to admit, this is my first experience with a high quality nail clipper. And what a huge difference, compared to the drugstore version I have been using all my life. The blades are very sharp, giving you a nice, precise cut. The product is stainless steel, so it should last a long time (and I am talking years, here). The clippers themselves are very light in weight, and slim in design. The leather case is perfect for putting the tool away, and the fit is tight, which is good, as leather stretches over time. I don't foresee the clippers falling out of the case in the future.
2966	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The oil free foaming face wash is enriched with rosehip extract, milk thistle, passionflower, and chamomile. The foaming wash left my skin feeling soft and clean without stripping skin. The wash smells heavenly and was a treat to use.

6356	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've trusted Mario Badescu products and their spa for years, but just recently tried this Rose Hips Nourishing Oil.  I use a few drops on my face at night before putting on a moisturizer.  It feels good, goes on quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily.  I like it because of the antioxidants in the Vitamin C.  I don't have issues with dry spots, especially during the summer.
Just a pea-sized dollop of moisturizer is enough to apply to your face and neck. It smooths on easily and does not leave a persistent greasy feeling. After weeks of use I have noticed a change. The winter weather usually plays havoc with my skin and leaves it dry and flakey. Right now, it is smooth and well hydrated and the only change to my skin care regimen is adding Baxters.
Polish comes off very easily
No Moisturizer
8767	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smells great, feels great. My skin feels brand new the next morning.
On the first application, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of color provided after letting it stay on about 8 hours then washing it off in a shower.  The second application provided a bit more color. From my experience with other tanners I would say the concentration of DHA is average, not providing a quick tan, and requiring an additional next day application.
4141	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This makes application so much easier and you use less product.  It may take a couple of tries to get your technique down.  You need to hold the container up straight to keep the fibers in the bottom of the container and that way the air can circulate and pick them up to shoot them out the nozzle.  If I notice that fibers aren't coming I just give the bottom of the container a rap on my hand to knock the fibers back down to the bottom.  Once you get your technique down you will be happy.

If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when I apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.
856	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is really nice and refreshing. My wife used it nightly  when the air is dry here in the West Coast.  She liked the convenience of just spraying it on your face and she uses her night cream afterwards.  My nine year old daughter uses it too, we love that it is safe to use for the whole family.
1340	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing. Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer. You do not shake it on to the roots of your hair where you can see the scalp, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp. If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.
Note:  I also tried the Purifying Foaming Cream Cleanser and it felt exactly the same.
Great price for a night cream (why are women's products so much more expensive??)
1720	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the color
Overall, this cream has helped a lot with the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes.  I enjoyed how smoothly it went on, how lightweight it felt, and how great the skin around my eyes felt afterwards.

The fragrance has a slight coconut with tropical flowers (jasmine, tiare?).  I tried it on my face & it was actually comfortable but I don't like heavy scents on my face and this is just too scented.  If the scent was gone, I would use this on my face.

9883	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A hefty, compact, awesome razor. Certainly not for newbie wet shavers; but, once you get your technique honed try this one. Gives a very close shave with little effort. I have done a couple WTG passes and it's a closer shave than my Edwin Jagger DE89 (which is also an awesome tool) gives when I add XTG and ATG passes. With the 37c, you really need to be careful under your nose and around your upper lip. If you're not careful, you can get bit badly. I use Personna Red and Gillette 7 O'Clock (Green and Yellow) blades in this razor. Finish your shave with a wet alum block, a cold water rinse, and a healthy handful of Clubman's Original or Bay Rum After Shave splash...and you are go to go!

1432	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using PCA Facial Wash Phaze 1 for over a year. I love the way it cleans off makeup without drying your skin.
Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a "regular" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.

I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

8837	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	In the past, whenever I have purchased candles, they tend to be from Yankee - they are fine, maybe look a little old fashioned, but they have nice scents, but sometimes, the scent is not noticed when the candle burns which pretty much defeats the point of having scents in the first place!
Overall, they work great and are very gentle.  They do not burn like other brands and can be used right after shaving without any problems.  They are refreshing and have a good small without being girly.  I like to use these in conjunction with the Jack Black DIY face peel pads.  Two days of these, third day Jack Black.  Works like a charm.  How do I know?  My 10 year old daughter recently asked me what I had been doing because I didn't look as old as before!  Hah!  Now that's an endorsement.
The shampoo itself is thick, clear, and quick to lather. It was strong enough that I felt that my hair was well cleaned but it didn't leave me with the squeakiness that sometimes comes with the very strong shampoos (those that need to be followed by a conditioner).  I didn't need to use a conditioner after the thickening shampoo, which indicated to me that it was nicely balanced.

I was hoping this would help but it's not helped so far.  It does help on my chin where I have black sebum inside my pores, diminishing them a little, each time I use the cleanser.  It has a faint aroma which is pleasant.  I am still searching for a product to slough off my skin in hopes of opening that clogged white head, which I got from using a moisturizer.

My face has more of a porcelain color in the winter.  However, I also can sometimes have some red undertones.  Therefore, I bought the warm sienna and love it!  It covers red undertones very well and is a very nice color on my skin.
  It is made in Japan.

This fragrance is one that seems fail-proof unless looking for something that makes a loud statement because it speaks at a lower volume. I lightly doused the other adult with the scent and he instantly liked it very much and so did I. This scent makes me want to lean-in rather than back away.
6150	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like this lotion as a moisturizer - it's very creamy and rubs in easily and definitely makes my skin feel moisturized. However, it also has a stronger scent of sunscreen than other SPF 15 moisturizers I've used, and the thickness is more consistent with sunscreen (though it does go on fairly smooth and without too much residue). I reserve this moisturizer for if I know I'm actually going to be walking around in the sun (rather than just a normal day where I want to put on some moisturizer that happens to also have SPF15 in it, like some of the other brands I use). As a very white person, I usually use moisturizer with some amount of SPF but I prefer that it not smell so much like sunscreen so I can continue to fool myself into thinking I'm just putting on lotion...

Herein is my review of this product that I received to sample without charge.
My wife, 40 years old with normal to dry skin, has been using this product daily (morning and night) for one week and the results of this moisturizer are already being noticed:

9131	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the one product if you have acne and want it gone fast. Wash your face, dip the qtip into the pink sediment and dab a nice thick schmear on it. I woke up and they were significantly smaller and less red. I combine this with his buffering lotion when Im having a really bad cystic with regular acne breakout.
This is definitely great for fragile, sensitive skin. I keep one bottle at work for after yoga and one at home for my evening skin regime. After trying so many products it is a relief to find one that does what I need it to do.
I have used Sephora's Eyebrow Kit (which comes with stencils and two blendable shades) which I love, but this pencil is easier to use and more portable.
9978	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a "croap" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the "Marco method" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most "feminine" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.
7754	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like PCA products and this is certainly no exception.  Arrived sealed, good seller
9229	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I recently got the worst adult acne on my back and face I have ever had.  I apply this with a Q-Tip on the affected areas after either I tone with pure rubbing alcohol or witch hazel.  (Usually back, chest and cheeks), wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed.  The smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares!  This really dries out active pimples and "opens up" under the skin cysts. I have noticed even when I use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down, but the surrounding areas will break out less often.  Maybe it's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne?  Either way it's DEFINITELY not a cure-all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you're dealing with an all out attack, this helps tremendously.
I would recommend this product to men and women
630	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best mineral/powder foundation I have used.  Non-irritating, doesn't get chalky (especially if you mist with water or setting spray after applied), great coverage, and lasts all day.  Worth the money.

I'll keep using this as it's one of the best face washes I've found.
The ingredients are: AQUA / WATER - DIMETHICONE - GLYCERIN - ZEA MAYS STARCH / CORN STARCH - ISOHEXADECANE - SORBITAN STEARATE - C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN - 2,6-DIMETHYL-7-OCTEN-2-OL - STEARYL ALCOHOL - AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE - POLOXAMER 338 - DISODIUM EDTA - SUCROSE COCOATE - CAPRYLYL GLYCOL - HYDROXYAPATITE - LAURETH-7 - EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT - DEXTRIN - LACTIC ACID  POLYACRYLAMIDE.
2559	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This would be a fantastic oil for your face if it wasn't so heavily scented (or if it was fragrance free). When I tried to use it on my sensitive facial skin, I had a slight reaction (a burning sensation followed by redness) and had to wash it off. However, when I used it on my body, it was just fine. I enjoyed very soft, supple skin. It absorbs almost immediately, so you don't have to wait long to get dressed.  I have also used just a few drops on my hair ends to help manage fly-aways and prevent split ends. The fragrance itself isn't bad (it is a tropical floral with hints of neroli), it's just a bit too heavy for my taste. Wish it came in a lightly scented version.

4183	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love everything about this toner - it feels & smells great, I can't put my finger on what the smell is but it's a clean natural scent.  A little goes a long way & it definitely tones.  I love the entire PCA line & have found that used in conjunction with their other products, the benefits are greater.
But this razor is solid and will last forever if taken care of and the slant is noticeably smoother than regular straight razor design.  I just wish Merkur made an adjustable slant - THAT would be the perfect razor.
9992	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

562	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This full coverage foundation works remarkably well on light, dry skin.  We initially spread the foundation directly on skin, and then worked the foundation across the skin manually to even the coverage and to avoid a caked appearance.  Note that a good-quality makeup brush would work as well.  To make the test as fair as possible, we applied on one side, and left the other side clean.  Once the foundation is worked into the skin it almost seems to disappear, but a mirror comparison showed that the difference with and without the foundation was dramatic.  Many minor blemishes were covered, and skin tone was much more uniform.  Darker blemishes showed through, but were reduced in color.

And I have to say the quality of this little box that arrived is top notch and totally worth the price. It has it's own sharpener that made for it, a very fancy little box and directions, and a lid for the pencil too.  I am SO glad I took the leap and tried.  Enjoy!

I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.
3525	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	The packaging is very cool - a half flat bottle, but that's the only distinguishing advantage of this product.
9836	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I tend to like perfume that isn't so bold as to overpower. Here we have an attractively designed contemporary bottle, well manufactured for this price range, and a perfume that has a pleasant jasmine and musk scent which, lightly applied, does indeed smell like laundry that I've washed in Tide + Febreze. Over the course of the day, the scent decays smoothly leaving the freshness intact. Very nice.

All in all, a winner!  I like it, will likely wear it for as long as it will last.  The test though is that as of right now, I'll buy more when the present bottle is emptied!

7115	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've tried many varieties of shave creams and foams from the drugstore variety to high-end creams. Many creams aren't thick enough and drip down your face as you shave, or they fail to protect your skin from getting irritated. Jack Black's Supreme Cream is amazing. It's thick and can be applied perfectly with your fingers. It sticks to your face without risk of running down your neck. Most importantly, it provides enough glide for your blade and enough cushion to avoid irritation. I've been looking for a shave cream like this for many years.
8975	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great value and multipurpose iron.  I have long hair and originally purchased a 1 1/2" size; however, the curl would quickly fall, so I decided to go with a 1".  Hands down best investment I made.  If I want looser curls, I finger brush through the curl when it is still warm.  For tighter curls, I pin the curl and allow to fully cool.
7488	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I tried this Silk Infusion treatment using various styling tools - on both wet and dry hair. I have fine hair. When using the treatment on wet hair after getting out of the shower with my hair dryer, I found that my hair felt greasy afterward. So, I tried it after showering without conditioner. I also used less of the treatment. I liked the results - my hair was nice and soft. I also tried this on dry hair and then used my CHI straightener afterward. I used a very small amount. My hair is silky as promised. For the CHI Silk Infusion a little goes a long way. You do not need to slather your hair with the treatment, just use a dime sized amount and then style your hair. It will be soft and fluffy afterward.

3884	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The best nail strengthener I've ever used!! My nails would break so easily, so I would have to keep them trimmed really short.
When used for strengthening, you must of course start out with clean dry nails. Two coats are required to start, and then every other day another coat is applied. At the end of the week you remove the Nail Envy and start over with the same routine. OPI "recommends" a non-acetone based polish remover, but I didn't have that type on hand so I used my regular acetone remover and it worked just as well. It doesn't require a lot of effort to obtain good results with this product.
746	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is such a nice natural pink. It's very easy to blend. i apply with my fingers, then blend with a stippling blush. I find that it lasts about 8-10 hours before I need to apply. It's great for every day use as well.

6120	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The perfect eye cream for me. I have very dry skin, especially under my eyes. This cream makes my under eye area incredibly soft and hydrated. I don't have any issues with fine lines as of yet so I can't speak on that, but if you need hydration, this is the stuff to try! I also have very sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all.
I did have to use 3-4 coats to really get it to be opaque, but light colors are often like that for me.  I think I am going to try it in the future over an opaque white polish; it should look great that way.  It was a good texture when wet (not too thin or too thick) and was easy to apply and I like the brush.  The finish on my nails is super smooth.

Based on the other (rave) reviews here, I may try to use it more on a daily basis to see how it goes.  Definitely a great cream for the price.

This product feels light to the touch and absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy feel to it. I am able to apply make up immediately, with no wait time. Nothing makes wrinkles go away, but this does soften the skin and does away with flakiness. I would like to say that i will certainly buy this product again, but the price is a little high for my budget. What I will say is that I would like to be able to do so, and in fact would love to try their entire product line.
7386	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My initial reaction to this base was one of doubt.  When this is called water canvas, there is no lie, for I felt I was merely slapping on my face a substance with only slightly more body than water thinking to myself "is this actually going to make any sort of base or just mix in with my  moisturizer?"
3154	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a light, crisp fragrance that smells very strongly of grapefruit. It's a very clean almost unisex fragrance. In fact, I had to double check Amazon upon receiving it since the box this perfume arrives in looks more like what I'd expect from a men's cologne. The bottle is decidedly feminine though.

3210	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Meh. It goes on pretty dry and flaky. My lashes look crunchy and don't hold a curl. I'll be sticking with my Dior primer.

7906	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this regularly to hide the thinning hair at my part.  My scalp is ghostly white, and this somehow bonds to the hair (not the scalp) and fill in the part.

This is a nice system consisting of a cleanser, astringent and moisturizer. They don't all have to be used every day but I'm sure that the benefits are greater if you follow the system as recommended. The cleanser is nice, nothing too harsh and not too drying. The astringent has a mild mint scent but it is really hard to smell. The moisturizer is thick and blends in quickly.
8375	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very happy it doesn't smell like seaweed! I look forward to putting this on my face all day long
5513	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love it. It does wonders for my hair. It's really improved over the years. Does not come off on your hands or pillow cases. Makes your hair look fuller.
4058	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I usually use the Micellar Cleansing Water from Simple so that's what I compared this one to.  Both did a great job of removing make up, including mascara, gently and completely but neither could remove lip stain.  Both did an excellent job of removing sweat and grime post workout.  The only difference I noticed was the Vichy water left my face feeling a little tacky.  Not a lot, but when I lightly drag my fingertips across my cheeks, I can feel a slight pulling on the Vichy side. The tachy feeling diminishes with time and after about 10 minutes,  both sides felt the same.

973	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Seems to work well. Hard to tell.
I don't have a lot of lines around my eyes, but the skin seemed better after having used this. If you like a lighter eye cream and you can handle the fragrance, this might be the choice for you.

I might try to add some water and/or other moisturizer and see if that improves the situation, rather than throw the tube away, but I don't think I'd recommend it to others.

1845	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the color. Only needs 2 coats.
FWIW I used Proraso pre shave cream, then Proraso shaving soap with Astra SP blades, finished with alum and then aftershave lotion. NO irritation, no bumps, no razor burn, no nicks, no cuts - best shave I ever got! (I can't say that I've perfected the straight edge).
121	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am not much of a glitter or sparkle gal, but this one is truly, a gem. It looks like gems come to think of it!
MOISTURIZER ($20 individually):  This is the standout.  I've tried a number of moisturizers, from drug store to specialty items, and this is one of the best.  There is no greasy feel, and it sinks into the skin quickly.  My skin feels softer for having used it.  Five Stars.

On the whole, aside from application, she has been satisfied with the product.
9426	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like most women my age (48) I have tried every foundation brand and type.  This covers well without looking or feeling heavy.  It has ingredients that have helped improve my skin's tone and texture.  So many shades, it's easy to find a match.  Love it!

3346	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great soft while color I love it.
8698	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love Mario Badescu's product they never brake me out with a rash or brake me out considering I have very sensitive dry skin. I like this very much but I'm a little older and wanting a bitter stronger of a product. So I'm moving on to the honey, but this would be great for anyone under 40.
4219	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this!  I use it twice a day and it's a nice hydrator.  I use the hydrating serum for days when my skin is super dry.
545	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Dermablend Professional Cover Creme Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Caramel Beige is slightly paler than the by far most popular Medium Beige, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural only slight variation of color typical to the rest and vast majority of us additionally intensifying with aging.  It is especially useful to cover darker and more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making caramel slightly more reddish, becomes typical medium beige.  In other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose a lighter color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills and also use of Setting Powder on the top to finish and protect the result.
Why I love this product:
9184	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Great for Spot treatment. Dries up cystic acne within a couple of days. However, the bright pink formula is definitely noticeable and cannot be worn under makeup. I could use this only at night, which is why it got 4 stars. I have forgotten to rinse it off a couple of times when I've run out the door in the morning (without makeup), only to realize by the afternoon that no-one told me I had noticeable pink spots all over my face all day. A little embarrassing.
4717	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Gorgeous,authentic Jasmine fragrance. Use a tiny amount and add more sparingly if needed. Controls frizz and fly-aways. Your hair will have a mirror like gloss and shine to it. Also, great for smoothing the look of dry, split ends. The bottle seems to last forever since you only need to use small amounts of this concentrated serum. I always get comments on how beautiful I smell when I have this in my hair! The bottle itself is also very attractive and travels well.
5308	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Easy to use and travel with....I'd buy it again.
6651	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	this is exactly what i was looking for. i have a curling wand by Hot Tools already so i knew the brand was great. i love this curling iron. it makes bigger curls which i wanted. and it gets HOT so you don't have to leave it in the hair for long. very smooth too. the cord is super long like my other Hot Tools which is really nice
2721	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smooth and well pigmented. This particular color is matte.

1727	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great summer color!  May be discontinued, but the bottle seemed fresh and has held up well...
6921	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have sensitive skin and unfortunately have suffered painful reactions to certain brands of deodorant (mostly of the aluminum free or natural varieties from brands I otherwise like). I can't get enough of CK One and wanted to try this deodorant for a little while-so glad I did. Definitely the CK One fragrance I adore but a little lighter/ more subtle, no skin irritation, long lasting (most surprising) and I'm happy with the results and experience of wearing it. Smells fresh and clean which is what I want.
215	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the OPI  infinite shine.  I ordered the color "you can count on it"  and it is a perfect nude shade. I absolutely love it  I've included a picture with and without the flash for reference.

7702	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Pretty happy with product......wish it had a little more moisture.
7190	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Wow, this bottle is SO TINY - I didn't realize how small it was going to be. I was looking for an alternative to dry shampoos that use alcohol. I tried it, not impressed. Smell is ok.
5989	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product! It is hydrating and fabulous! Great seller too!
3309	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	What a wonderful lip pencil. I was pleasantly surprised in a good way with the colors. Using a lip pencil is a new thing for me. I wasn't sure how hard it would be to use. Don't worry because it applied with ease. My husband commented how nice it looked which is something he never does so I'd say it is a winner just for that comment!

2143	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great stuff.  Can't go wrong buying this one.
Despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.
2015	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for fall!  It's a nice grey with just a little bit of shimmer in it.  I liked it so much, I bought one for a friend too.

2125	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	really makes your teeth feel clean!
1800	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Essie NP- Partner In Crime is a great fall color! It is not as light as it looks in the bottle. People have asked if it was maroon or black on my nails more often than asking if it was brown. But when I tell them it is brown, they compliment it. I was worried that the brown may look weird on my nails, but I really enjoy it!
3084	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is not a lotion but an opaque oil.  It is heavily scented and goes on greasy.  I find that if I put it on early enough ahead of my makeup, I can go ahead and apply makeup over it, but immediately after application my face feels oily and not a good surface to apply makeup.  Thankfully, the scent also fades, because it's really strong and would not only clash with my cologne but is overpowering so close to my nose. I love scented products but this one is a bit much even for me.  One pump is enough only for my face; if I want to include my neck and decollete I need two.
First off, I'm kind of confused about what can and cannot be labeled organic but they did put that label on most most of their ingredients.  Organic or not, none of their ingredients seem too offensive (unless, of course, you're allergic to them).
This collection is a relative bargain for Baxter of Cali. It would probably be best appreciated by someone who still has oily skin
I have sensitive, thin skin and am prone to a few of those deep pimples you can feel coming before you see them... This worked like a charm on one of those - the pimple never broke. I do not have problem skin in the sense of acne, but I'm cautious about anything I add to the mix.
8576	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product for the control of  Rosacea.  Much cheaper than I usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product I was buying straight from the Pevonia site.
3194	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I wish I didn't love this so much because its so expensive! But the formula is fantastic, it smells divine, and its great for bleached/processed hair. Really good lather for a sulfate-free product. Conditioner actually conditions my hair - what a concept! My only tiny gripe - the packaging is not that nice-looking, to my taste. Id love to see a redesign.
2150	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This I found to have a pleasant and light smell!

9234	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	So, I love this because it dries up the blemish without drying the surrounding skin. I find benzoyl peroxide to damaging to my skin, this is the perfect solution!!


Pros:
2694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love Jane Iredale products. This item works best on ladies with light brown or highlighted hair. I will definitely reorder.
6792	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Amazing! Works like magic. Applied to a very stubborn deep pimple and this stuff dried it up to a significantly smaller, much more shallow pimple overnight. Shocking results . Usually deeper pimples take almost a week to surface. This one never did. Applied a second time and the drying lotion killed off the bacteria completely and obliterated the last bit of debris under the skin. Pimple Never came to the surface and is now completely gone
3471	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Opi makes the best nail polish by far and there colors are always beautiful and come out with a solid shiny vibrant finish.

3506	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Best shave ever!! Better than my electric razor by far. Great for the price and it gets the job done and then some.
7961	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My wife loved it for the thick effect it had on her thinning hair, and I just ordered another bigger size for her!!

5853	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	does a great job
You want to make sure you get it on the ROOTS/Scalp.. brush hair afterward to knock off "extra" and use hairspray.  It will look awesome and STAY PUT. Been using this for 2 years now and tried SEVERAL types before I found this... if I was a "prep per" I would stock food, water, emergency supplies and THIS for the vanity side of me.
3945	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	this product works okay. might keep buying it until i find another brand.
2658	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	UPDATE  11/7/16: I receive compliments every time I wear this.  Many people write down the name to purchase it later.  It's become my favorite.  My other favorites,  Emporio Armani &  Trsor,  do not have the same fragrance as Burberry Weekend.
4828	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with all of my Billy Jealousy skincare products. This is another daily use product that never leaves my skin oily or greasy.  It's perfect for my combination skin.
8794	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried the Mario Badescu Rose Hips Nourishing Oil with favorable results.
1610	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Very Disappointing
3709	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was skeptical about this face wash - there is literally nothing to it, it's a clear slick gel.  The tiniest pea size amount will glide all over your face while you cleanse and massage giving yourself a but of a spa session.  It rinses off and my skin feels....soft, not dry at all.  It feels like I am cleaning with a moisturizer but it is not oily at all and my sensitive skin is responding really well.
1886	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	beautiful this color 
It's has soothed, plumped, and softened my skin, it's worked well as a base for my liquid foundation, and it has evened-out my skin tone. My face is noticeably more radiant and healthy looking, and feels wonderfully soft, and smooth. In addition, this bright white creamy moisturizer goes on easily with great coverage using a small amount, and it isn't greasy (no breakouts). It sinks in very well on my face, and doesn't creep down into my eyes. It works well on my neck as well (very soothing).  The light citrus-woodsy scent is very nice.
After use, I notice that my skin feels like it does when I first wake up- a bit naturally oily.  I thought it might be makeup residue so I've tried it when I have absolutely no make up on, and it feels the same.  I think it is the glycerin in the product.  My skin is dry though, so it has worked ok for me.
603	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Just got this so can't say for sure if it will irritate but did wear well enough, used a little of this on my crease to help pop out the color on my blue green eyes. Very pigmented and soft. I even used some on my lips and looked good there too, with a light touch.
9683	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love how my hands feel
Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said "That stuff is F--- AMAZING!" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.
This arrived on time,packed well & exactly as described.
875	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Huge bottle, fine mist, very refreshing. Calms the skin and can be used over make up. I love it.
4014	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used this facial cleanser with cotton ball pads.  This cleanser effectively removed more dirt from my face than I could ever expect.  I was really surprised at how well this removed the dirt from my face that I wasn't even aware was there.  I experienced no irritation or redness from using this product.  My skin which is normal felt clean and refreshed after using.  It also felt hydrated enough to where I didn't feel the immediate need to add lotion.  This is an excellent facial cleanser and hydrator.
I really love this product, it's keeper, definitely would recommend to all.
4665	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Good way to try all of the products before spending money. Great size that lasts a long time  good way to try products

1169	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	2% Hydroquinone is the active ingredient and you can get products with this much Hydroquinone at CVS, Walmart or Walgreens.  Of course for fraction of the price.  Not to mention, it leaves a orange tint on your skin, which you will be able to see if you are using it alone.  Will not buy again.
buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.

6935	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to use because I used heated tools on my hair. I have no complaints about it. I know I love the CHI silk infusion oil.
8669	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great light weight moisture!
8274	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like butter London polish first thing I want to mention that this color does not look like the picture I am looking at as I write this review .This is a teal color and if you like teal you will love this I was not disappointed at all because I like teal. This goes on so easy I used a base coat than two coats of the polish and a top coat and wow the color really stuck out. I like this brand because it is a 3 free meaning noFormaldehyde,no Toluene and no DBP I have used this brand before with great results I do recommend a top coat so it will last longer on your nails .Also the seller is a great seller arrived fast and packaged perfect.

5491	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great smell, terrific lather, and so far, it not only made a smooth shave, but left behind clear skin, as promised. No ingrown hairs. None. My only complaint is the label is all foreign language..French? I really do like this shaving cream though. It leaves behind a faint but pleasant smell. It's thick from the get go. Easy to spread. Easy to shave. Maintains its lather long enough for you to see what you're doing.
9166	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This works really well!  Highly recommend...drop Q tip into the pink solution...do not shake the bottle.  Place on blemish...the next day, blemish is smaller and less irritated...no miracle, just do this everyday and you will see results...
You may be a "newbie" or a "beginner" with double edge, but you are not a child. This may be the last razor you need. But I know it won't stop you from having several, guys like to have a "collection" (or a fleet, as the case may be).
4905	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used this for 15 years now and will always refill it. It is light and sits on the skin rather than filling pores up.
Third, we didn't find this conditioner to be more effective than the cheap stuff. I'm not sure why it costs so much.
6519	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smells great. I use it everyday, it leaves my skin hydrated and soft. I will continue to repurchase.
4559	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is another great product by Anthony. I use this product at night and in the morning. The pads do a good job in cleaning and toning the face. The smell is very nice with a cooling sensation felt on the face. I'm happy with using this product and I plan on using it for some time.

It is worth noting that this isn't a pure rose hip oil, but an extract mixed into a cocktail with other ingredients. If you're looking for a pure oil you'll want to look elsewhere.
7152	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great shampoo that leaves your hair smelling great and your scalp stimulated with the cool relaxing feel and smell of peppermint. This shampoo gives you an experience that is both mentally and physically satisfying.
1489	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful soft color!
Other positive: while I haven't used it consistently or on a weekly basis, my medium sized bottle has lasted over three years. A little truly does go a long way and you really get your money's worth.

9926	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.
438	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Dermablend works so well for me. First, a little dab covers my imperfections. This means this jar will last a really long time. Next, it goes on smoothly. It's not dry or cakey. By the same token it stays put. I don't have to reapply it throughout the day. I apply this coverage and set it with MAC powder and I am good all day.
I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.
9728	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I was excited to try this "fresh and youthful scent." I like light fragrances, not anything heavy and overpowering.  This was... awful. Like a big jar of cheap, old lady perfume. Very sweet, but not young at all. The bottle is pretty, though!
3789	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	loved the cleanser .. read my full review at cutebeginnings.com
9921	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.
3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
6602	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use several Mario Badescu products. This particular one came highly recommended in an online "makeup addicts" community. The scent is wonderful (if you don't mind floral scents) and feels refreshing and soft. I love this spray. I don't use it for setting, so I can't speak to that, but I use it as a refreshing, hydrating spray throughout the day at work, and in my hair, as a refresher during the day. It's such an inexpensive product, you can't really go wrong trying it. I do NOT find that the ingredients have changed much, save for a couple of preservatives (which are VERY low on the ingredients list).
793	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very sheer coverage in this creme to powder foundation from Vincent Longo. I usually use a liquid mineral powder, so this was the exact opposite for me.  The compact seals tightly and fits nicely into the palm of your hand. A faint scent that is not too over powering. I am very translucent and found this to be a good match for my skin in winter. I do need to use a moisturizer underneath as it did cake a bit around my eyes because my skin is so dry this time of year. I'm excited to try it in summer, where I'm sure the sheer coverage will be more welcome!

6819	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff works!!  Has a little bit of a potent smell but it works fast. 2 nights of application and your pimple is gone. Shrinks in one over night application.
368	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this creme. I only need to use a tiny amount - more like dabbing it on areas I want to cover - and then blend with a cotton ball or fingertips.  It's not greasy or oily but it does go on smoothly. I rarely wear makeup for a full day so I can't estimate how it would hold up for ten or twelve hours, but it looks great for special occasions. Definitely makes my skin look more even in tone and consistency. One small container will last for a long time;  little goes a long way. It's easy to remove with water or cleansing products.  It works with my skin tone but of course that varies with the individual. So far, I'm very pleased.
4955	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Identical to the reed diffuser version, but much stronger - one spritz immediately scents the room! Love this warm vanilla scent for every room in the house!
6126	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Perfect, non-irritating, smoothing. It's exactly what I was looking for to smooth the texture of the skin around my eyes. Not so much for wrinkles, but for overall texture, which seemed a bit drier and rougher than it used to be. I'm alternating it with a peptide product and it's doing what I hoped it would and not causing any problems. For my sensitive skin and for $20, that's a very good deal. I'll probably get the MB glygolic moisturizer to go with it.
540	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a full coverage foundation with sunscreen.  It works well to cover some dark sun spots I have on my face and some red marks from blemishes.  It makes my skin tone look nice and even. It is a bit thicker than I am use to wearing but does a much better job at covering up blemishes Than what I usually wear.
But the mousse consistency makes application easy to control with very nice, believable results that lasts several days.
9636	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Slathering on some of this L'Occitane shower oil is like "ahhhhhhhhh" - pure Heaven for my skin! Feels silky on but is thick enough so it's not spilling everywhere as soon as you try to pour some out, and the fresh smell is perfect for my sensitive nose. My skin ends up feeling amazingly soft once I get out of the shower and lotion up, so I do really enjoy using this stuff.  My only complaints are the price and how slippery the shower gets after using it, but that's a downside of using any oil.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a new way to get silky soft skin.
1265	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Fills in those thin spots nicely..Great for men or women.
7346	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very light eyebrows and have been using eyebrow pencil for decades.  It always wiped off with brief contact.  Even the compact eyebrow treatments have wiped off.
3494	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this color! Chips faster than previous bottles but still love it!

Upon receiving these three products, I developed a system of daily use.  I apply the herbal mint toner at night before bed.  The next morning I use the daily face wash in the shower and then, after drying my hair, I apply a pea-sized amount of the oil-free moisturizer to my cheeks, nose, and forehead.  I've been doing this every day for the past two weeks, and I am pleased to say that I have experienced definite improvement around my nose, which can be so dry and flaky in cold weather that I need to apply moisturizer almost hourly.  Since using this Baxter of California system, I have never had to apply touch-ups throughout the day, and I would say that my dryness has been reduced some 75%.  Meanwhile, I have had only one small pimple since starting this daily regime, and it was closer to my ear in an area I was not regularly treating.  Thus, all in all, I would say that this is a very successful and worthwhile product, particularly if you have skin issues that other products cannot clear up.

7796	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I can't begin to name all the brands and types of aftershave (and razors) he's tried over the years that just didn't cut it when it came to preventing ingrown hairs or irritation after shaving. My hubby is the type of guy that can shave at 8:00am and already have a five o'clock shadow a couple hours later. Fighting razor bumps, irritation, ingrown hairs, redness, etc. has been an ongoing struggle for years, especially since his job requires zero facial hair and he's often exposed to the elements. After using this for three weeks, the improvement in his skin is amazing. No more razor bumps or ingrown hairs or feeling like his face is on fire after shaving. This is hands down the best aftershave he's ever used. Very light and refreshing to use after shaving and it immediately calms down any razor burn or irritation. It's a cream, but it dries quickly without feeling sticky or greasy and leaves his skin smooth and moisturized. There is no overpowering scent, either, which we both love. Since it only takes a bean-sized dot to take care of his face and neck after shaving, and because it works so incredibly well, the cost is well worth it. It's one of those products that you desperately hope they never discontinue or dink with the formula because it's perfect just the way it is. The hubby is NOT a product guy, so for him to gush over anything skincare related never happens. Because this has worked so well, I've even gotten him to follow this balm up with a La Roche-Posay sunscreen. He'd use sunscreen everywhere else but his face because of so many bad experiences with breakouts or intense irritation, so getting him to wear it on his face was always a battle. This Vichy aftershave has treated his skin so well that he is now willing to try other facial care products (like a good sunscreen!). I wish Amazon carried the rest of the Vichy men's line products as well.
926	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I feel this product made absloutely no difference in the appearance of my hair.  Much less as it states to make my hair thicker.
This is one of those.

9923	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.
Good for mature skin or younger skin
5319	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	They have a great thing going with this cleansing cream, you have to use twice or three times what they suggest.  It does not lather at all.  I will not buy it again.
This is my favorite cleanser at the moment. I do think it is pricey though. I use it two or three times a week to make it last. I noticed there is another page for this item that is significantly cheaper, not sure why. It might be pricey but once you see how well it works, you will be addicted too.
6163	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm super picky when it comes to moisturizers - any scent is usually overpowering for me, so I am happy to report that this moisturizer doesn't really smell like anything. I'm a little confused that it has a bit of a pink hue to it - reminds me of calamine lotion a little bit :) It is SO THICK when it comes out of the bottle, it definitely sinks into the skin and provides hydration for an extended period without any greasiness. I'd definitely pick up a larger bottle in the future! This tiny one will probably be enough for the dark Settle winter, though. :|

7505	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This stuff gave me a terrible rash on my chest. Definitely not for use if you have sensitive skin. I started out using it every day. Then went to once every other day. Rash didn't start to clear up until I stopped use altogether.

4340	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love the Epicuren coconut body cream.  I had hoped that this face cream would be rich and have a great scent. It is rich, but the lack of scent makes it just a little less luxurious for me.
The product does a nice job of cleansing and has good rinse-ablilty.

It is not greasy, absorbs instantly, and leaves my skin glowing and looking great. No smell at all. Perfect!

Here is what i think. No product on the planet really makes wrinkles unwrinkle. There are a lot of products out there and some disappoint me because i find out that they use animal testing in the production of the product. Not necessary. In my particular case, I am sensitive to all sorts of environmental chemicals and drugs, so I like to stay as natural as possible with all of the products that I use in my home and on my person.
I use OPI when doing french or deep french style nail art, and CND for full covering nail art.

3944	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Two thumbs up, it really leaves your skin hydrated. An excellent mask for sensitive skin.
I own a 1 inch and wanted bigger curls, but my hair is to thin and too short.
Make sure when you press down to get the cream from the bottle, go easy, as a little tiny dab goes a very long way.  Sometimes, when I'm in a hurry, I just push and a lot of cream comes out which is just too much for just 2 eyes... 4 is more like it.
9747	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the way this feels on my skin - moisturizing, but not oily at all. Absorbs really quickly. Makes your skin look radiant afterwards. I haven't gotten any acne using it.

This is an item that will stay on our list of favorites and we'll turn to Amazon again and again whenever we need it.

I have used this daily with an exfoliation scrub brush on my face and arms. My skin glows and feels fantastic. It takes sunblock off very well. I like the smell, and I do not like perfume in any soap.  The brush is lumaRX


6412	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I alternate between this and the drying mask and I love it too. I can honestly say I have nothing negative to say about this line of skin care. The products are amazing and extremely affordable. I use this as a facial mask on my entire face and after about 10 minutes and once it dries and hardens I rinse it off. It doesn't have a bad odor and I love how soft and smooth my face feels after I use it. This is part of my nightly skin care routine. It's not rec to use every night so I use it every other night or 3 times a week. It's such a great mask, I'm obsessed.!!!
2403	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Obsession is a big spicy oriental that is similar to Opium & Cinnabar in my mind. However, Obsession seems so much better to me because it's still current, relevant, & wearable. Although gorgeous, Opium & Cinnabar seem dated by comparison. That is usually how I think of Obsession - as a me-too spicy oriental that has aged better than her big sisters.

I applied the serum for several days over my entire face but concentrating on the areas that were broken out. After the first application that night, I woke the next morning to a change--I really was astonished that this serum worked that quickly to begin drying up the mess on my face! After about three to four applications (morning and night), my blemishes were almost gone.

Anyway, PCA Skin is an awesome line.  It does not disappoint. It is gentle yet effective. No greasiness or icky perfumes.

1274	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Looks just like real hair! Okay, so let me start by saying that I had alopecia (not sure on the spelling) when I was in college. The hair on the sides of my head, right above my ears just thinned out and has never grown back. I always wear my hair down because it's easy to cover the spots with my curly hair. However, if I ever want to wear my hair up, I'm faced with exposing my 2-Half-Dollar-sized bald spots. I've colored in the spots before, but I go through those eye pencils way too quickly and they aren't exactly real looking. These Fibers are the first thing that has really allowed me to wear my hair up and look normal. Don't get me wrong, I'm still keeping an eye out for a hair growth miracle, but in the mean time, this will do. ;)

2138	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	smells nice
The shampoo itself is thick, clear, and quick to lather. It was strong enough that I felt that my hair was well cleaned but it didn't leave me with the squeakiness that sometimes comes with the very strong shampoos (those that need to be followed by a conditioner).  I didn't need to use a conditioner after the thickening shampoo, which indicated to me that it was nicely balanced.

- Skin feels fresh and tight after every use.
4759	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Though I can't vouch for the price of $129.99 price listed here. I am extremely sensitive to chemical smells including just about every fragrance mix in every brand of shampoo. It's hard to find hair care products that don't contain fragrance. I have medium-fine hair and my husband has thick wavy hair. This shampoo works great for both of us. My husband uses conditioner with it to control his waves and I use only the shampoo because I want more volume.

4504	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I really like La Roche-Posay's foaming micellar cleanser do I figured I'd give this a shot. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of this. It smells like cheap hand soap and did not live up to the hype.
8462	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LOVED this liquid soap.  It smells great, it is thick and creamy, I used it with my Clarisonic and felt like I was at the spa.  GREAT, great, great soap and a really big bottle of it, too.  This is the type of product that makes you excited to go shower!  lol  So, great smell, great cleaning, great texture and works super well with Clarisonic.  Epic win for this product.
4629	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	When I think of free radicals, I think of people waving signs in the street, protesting this or that government decision. But there is another kind of free radical. This kind of free radical is related to an atom or molecule that "has a single unpaired electron in an outer shell." (Thank you, Wikipedia!) I don't pretend to understand them, but I don't have to. The makers of Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum do and they know that free radicals should be reduced when possible. This product reduces free radical aging in skin cells and can help your skin feel and, hopefully, with time, look younger.

But, I do want to go on record as a long-time user of Nail Envy.  I stand by this product.  For example, I was given a gel manicure--just one!  My nails were severely damaged after removal of that manicure.  Everything I touched caused my nails to break and split.  Because I know what Nail Envy can do, I applied a coat to my nails every other day.  My nails are long, beautiful, strong, and healthy again.

UPDATE: it's been about 2 years now and I have yet to use up half of this first jar! I also made a complete switch to double-edge safety razors (when I don't have time to be careful with my straight edge) - I ain't EVER buying another cartridge :) This makes you feel like you're in a higher income bracket - I've managed to get a few of my friends on this product and the proper razors as well :)

This also worked well in my fianc hair which he is Asian with black hair so color is definitely darker than expected ( got medium brown ). It came on easy like pepper shaker and apply straight on problem area it sticks and stays until you shower or sweat . Covered his thinning hair very well ! If you touch it with a brush it will move it does not stick so style hair then put it on as final touches . Hope this helps

Yes it does make me think of the Sexy Marlboro Man without the stinky cigarettes ... Howdy Cowboy!
This sunscreen doesn't cause breakouts, either.  It's a definite must have for my beach bag.


When I first bought this product, I wasn't sure about buying a shampoo that I couldn't see and smell first, but I have been very pleased with it. It was so great that I started trying out Baxter's other products.

Vincent Longo Blonde eyebrow pencil lasted all day.  My eyebrows look the same as they did this morning - even after a workout.  It's very easy to apply and the color is great.
9840	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very refreshing and different. Not too sweet or overly floral. The overall packaging is very attractive.
5120	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is one of the good hair oils that I use.  It smells wonderful.  I also use Amla, a product of Pakistan. This oil came to me with the oil having escaped the bottle so I had to absorb the oil from outside the bottle immediately after I opened it.

The 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.
I'm sure it has more to do with the AHA, but my skin looks better. I think so and others have noticed as well. My skin is even and just looks better, healthy people mostly commented. Like most Baxter products, this is a good quality and will last longer due to using less. So while some might look at the cost and think twice, it is actually a pretty good value.
8308	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great color.  It mimics the natural raspberry color when on the nails.  I think this is a great color for spring.  It is appropriate for work or play and would even look nice while in a formal evening gown.  I particularly like Butter London nail polishes because they are free of most contaminates.  I feel that they also make my nails healthier.  I would recommend this color to everyone.
No smears, smudges with a quick dry spray.  Wait 45 to 60 seconds after the last coat then lightly spray and within 5 to minutes you have shiny, perfect nails.
It's pricey, but I'm honestly just amazed at the difference this has made in such a short amount of time!
9257	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It is decent peel. It's meant for sensitive skin, which I don't have but it burns unpleasantly. After I washed my face the skin was smooth and a bit tight, I had to follow with moisturizer or facial oil to feel comfortable.
5996	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this product. I had been searching for a face wash to suit my rosacea skin but nothing quite hit the mark. During a visit to New York, I visited the Mario Badescu store and had a consultation with one of the specialists there. She immediately identified my rosacea and associates cuperose and recommended this face wash. I  and after a consultation at
3039	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My skin generally has a reaction to salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide after I took Accutane 4 years ago, and now this is the only cleanser that my skin really likes. I have acne-prone, red, sensitive, and combination/dry skin, and this cleanser really does a good job of cleansing my face, soothing redness, and not drying out my face. It also foams really nicely, and a little really goes a long way.

469	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a maximum coverage cream which can cover scars, acne scars, birthmarks, bruising, burns, hyper-pigmentation, lupus and vitiligo. As such, I found it just a little too heavy for daily wear if you need minimum coverage.
6345	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am a sucker for Mario Badescu products. Several years ago I researched the absolute best possible cleanser for my skin, and again and again I was directed to Mario Badescu.  I loved it, deep cleansing, and no drying. Since then I have been working my way through the line.  I typically spray rose water on my face after I clean it, I use rose water to tone and soften and hydrate. (I also spray rose water on my hair). I pat my face dry, then I apply the rose hips nourishing oil, I tend to get very dry on the skin around my eyes.  I follow up with a moisturizing lotion.  I just love how fresh and dewy my face feels without being greasy or oily.  I really love it.
7366	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Finally, a foot cream that doesn't just evaporate into my feet. This leaves my footsies feeling fresh and soft all the way till morning. A little pricey, but worth every penny IMO.
2571	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Not only do I love this stuff my wife does as well.  It is a perfect grit to use about every 3 days, does a great job cleaning my face and has gotten rid of my black heads on my nose.  After I use it I usually let it sit on my face for 1-3 minutes in the shower and then rinse.
If you have dry skin you may like this a lot.  I recommend visiting a store that sells this to make sure you get just the right matching color for your skin.  This is very high quality high end department store makeup for those who want high coverage to hide more obvious imperfections.  It's worth the higher price if you want higher coverage and a truly flawless look.

Evening Primrose Oil
914	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Honestly, I really don't see any effect after using it for a month. Does it really thickens the hair diameter or just temporarily coats the hair with gel to make it appear thick?  Does it really nourish the hair? Not sure how long you need to use it to see results.
9527	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Im not saying that this doesnt work well, but it doesnt work well for me. I am a 40 year old woman who still suffers from the occasionally bout of acne, and in addition to not being able to stand the smell, this stuff burns like crazy when its being applied. Maybe for someone younger with less sensitive skin, this will work better. For me, its not a product Ill continue to use.


This particular brand doesn't leave any sticky residue behind. It has a very light scent that is refreshingly pleasant. Gentle yet effective.
 Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.
3) Billy Jealousy Super Slick Shave Cream
2244	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	The dryer not so bad but the filter on the back and the directional nozzle WILL NOT STAY ON!  I mean really will not stay on.  So frustrating.  Don't buy this!  I stupidly tried it only once waiting for my current one to die completely and now I missed the window to return.  Ugh.

To that end, this is a good product in that it meets those basic criteria.  It is gentle, easy to use, pleasant smelling, and it leaves the face looking better without excessive redness or "blotchiness".  It does feel nice and soothing on the skin
666	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	great product
5336	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I started using this recently and absolutely love it.  It allows me to wash my face and eyes at the same time.
3811	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice cleanser I use once a week because I have sensitive skin. The thing I could do without is the really strong smell, hence the 4 star rating. But overall, it is a nice cleanser.

9640	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a luxurious shower oil that definitely feels more moisturizing than regular shower gels. The smell is wonderful and rich and lingers on the skin for a little while. Id say its a little pricey but I will be buying it again.
2343	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	My impression this was a natural skin care product.  It was not clear at the time it is designed for men.  This product contains parabens which are potentially cancer causing.  I would not use it for this reason and threw it away.

When using it on my face, I use a setting powder.
8379	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Expected more.  Irritated my skin.  Smelled chemically.
I've switched to using it at night before bed, but I actually still prefer my Solar Oil, which sinks in right away.

6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF):
8611	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been unsing this product for about 5 years. It is effective in removing fine lines and wrinkles. It goes on easily. I alternate it with Niadyne Skin Strengthening Complex.
6694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm so pleased with this hair dryer because it is not too loud and not too heavy and clumsy. Also it is not as expensive as the ones sold at the beauty supply stores. This dryer dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer and I really love the bright clean red color. The only drawback I have is that the grated vent gets blanketed in dust and needs to be cleaned very quickly. But its pretty simple to use a hair brush to brush it clean.
I have dry skin and lips, so I usually steer clear of tinted balms since I like to layer it on several times a day, and other products tend to cake on dry spots, or oversaturate my lips with color so I look like I did when I used Bonnie Bell products excessively in middle school. With this, the color is so sheer and high quality that even if you re-apply for extra moisture, it still stays natural-looking and smooth. You can even wear it on top of lipstick if you want to subtly play with colors.
1430	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like to use this product in the morning. It's not that good at removing makeup in the evening.  It leaves yours skin feeling clean and refreshed. I would not suggest it for dry skin
The color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old Sally Hansen prism polishes, minus the color change effect. I do like the texture of the polish and it's wearable with or without a topcoat. This color can also be worn well at one or two coats. The drying time was fast, but I can't speak too much for the longevity yet. I see complaints about chipping polish, which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth, well buffed and totally clean of all oils. After a day of wear, shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact, at least. (I used Out the Door topcoat)
5470	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff! Really helps the skin soften and just feels really nice! I invest in my skincare so while it's pricey, I think it's worth it! This is the second time I've purchased.
She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  I've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful SPF to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

517	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	While I am not a fan of some of Dermablend's other products (their foundation in a tube products), the Cover Crme line excels.  It applies easily, and a small application covers very well.  You don't really notice it on your face, and it doesn't get cakey.
That doesn't necessarily mean you have to apply it with your fingertips. I put a little in the palm of my hand and let it get warm in my hand before using a sponge to quickly start applying it.
4920	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the absolute best makeup for people with rosacea!  I looked long and hard, trying to find one that wouldn't create a flare up.  Such a catch 22.  I want to cover my redness and bumps with foundation but wearing foundation makes it worse.  I know women around the world can relate!  Finally I found this one recommended by a number of people on a rosacea forum.  Love it and have been using it almost 2 years now.  I actually think it helps clear my rosacea.  Plus it has spf which is fantastic because every sunscreen except greasy zinc burns my face.  If you have rosacea, I understand your discouragement in looking for foundation.  Try this!  There is a case you can buy for it, but I just use the plastic it comes in.  I find it works just as well and saves money.  Golden Glow works well for my coloring too.  In the winter I wear Riviera and summer it's golden glow.
6066	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	If you don't use Mario Badescu's products you're missing out!  His products are natrual and reasonably priced.  I'm in my late forties and when a co-worker told me I have great skin, I jumped for joy.  And purchsed several products for her, for Christmas and yes, she uses them everyday.  I also got my boss hit on his products.  Effective, ship quickly and you'll also receive three free samples with every order.
9366	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I have never used any kind of blemish clearing serum before. I never needed one before either. When I saw this offered in my Vine que, I thought I'd try it especially since I have been dealing with some blemishes due to the weather changing, age and stress. I didn't have a lot of blemishes, but the few that I did have cleared up right away and my face actually felt better than it has in weeks.


All in all, it's probably good for younger women who don't have skin problems. If you have dry skin patches, this isn't a good idea.

3246	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was not impressed initially but after many uses my teeth feel much cleaner when I use Marvis vs another brand. Maybe I reviewed too soon - it is pricey but I am 75 years old and many my age no longer have their teeth so price shouldn't be the deciding factor. Hope my dentist sees improvement.

2155	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love Proraso shave products. I am an avid wet shaver and I love the Proaso Shaving Cream. It whips up to a great lather in my scuttle and treats my beard to a great shave. I have all of their different types of Shave Creams and all are great. I change depending on how long I have been without a shave or what the situation is at the time. This is a Italian  product. It is FANTASTIC. If you haven't tried Proraso, you don't know what you are missing.
3559	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I have tried DOZENS of acne treatment products from Amazon, and this was among the worst. My heart sank as soon as I used this cleanser for the first time, because it BURNED. I tried to hold out hope, reasoning that perhaps it was only because it contained strong medicine (which my acne-ravaged skin BADLY needs) and my skin would adjust. HA! ONE DAY of using this and other Mario Badescu products and my skin was so hideously ravaged it looked like I had a contagious disease. I just don't understand it because the ingredients listed in these products are not ones that usually have an adverse effect on my skin. Oh, and by the way, all of the Mario Badescu products I ordered (via Amazon LLC) came UNSEALED, and were not even in any kind of box/container/wrapper. Considering that several of the products were LIQUIDY, that's crazy. But I will say Amazon gave me a FULL refund, which is indeed very honorable and shows great integrity.
7095	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My experience with Jack Black products over the years has been quite favorable, and that holds true for this shampoo, which I've used before.  The shampoo itself is, for the most part, colorless and its scent both interesting and muted.  Made with "basil & white lupine" (white wolf?), the smell is unique and not objectionable, though I much prefer a shampoo that smells like coconut or mint.
I'm an African American male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. It makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and I can't where the low to bald styles since I have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. One day I discovered Toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.
4274	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Really like the color and the fact that it's not as heavy as a lot of foundations, but still gives a little illusion.  Doesn't emphasize wrinkles, as some makeup can.  Slightly higher SPF is a good factor as well.
2066	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice color for summer. Essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping. Would recommend Essie polish. Great deal.
9469	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best nail polish remover EVER.  Used by my favorite nail tech at a nearby salon, I find this to remove even the most stubborn polish without smearing it all over my fingers.  Soak a tiny piece of cotton ball and place on each nail.  By the time you've got the 10th finger covered, it's time to take a full size cotton ball, wet it with the remover and take the polish off in a few easy swipes.  No drying or ashy look to nails.
3363	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great

9802	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

4604	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	*Note: I've changed my original rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because I've found that after using Juice Beauty's Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer for over a month, my face has noticeably brightened and become ultra smooth and hydrated. I already liked this moisturizer and saw (see original review below) benefits after using it for just a week. After a month, it's benefits are more evident, and it's become an essential component to my daily moisturizing routine.
2819	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	UPDATE: July 3, 2016 - It has come to my attention that Triclosan is no longer an ingredient in this product. I don't know if it was removed in response to my negative comments about it in my review or not. But since it has apparently been removed, that's good news and potentially bad news. The removal of triclosan negates my negative comment but now that the formulation has changed, and I have not tried the new formulation, I don't know if it's as effective a product as what I originally tested.

But I can say this - when I gave it a try it reminded me exactly of rubbing mud on my face at the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa in Reykjavik, Iceland (look it up). Feeling that more might be said, I turned this over to my wife, and this is what she had to say...

I want to point out to you something that I consider VERY important.  Have you ever seen someone on TV who has a face that looks ashen or gray?  Have you ever seen someone in a photo whose hands look peachy pink, or beautiful chocolate brown, yet their face looks like they have ashy dirty makeup on?

6125	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Let me start by saying I really hate eye creams.  Hate them passionately.  My eyes are super sensitive, plus I wear contacts so many creams and serums seem to cause issues for me and I end up buying items that I use maybe 3 times before tossing out.  What a waste of money.  Unfortunately, my eye area tends to be very dry and sadly, there are some lines and crepe-y texture trying to happen, so I keep trying to find the holy grail of eye creams...and I think this might actually be it!  I started using this just under a week ago, and upon application, didn't think I was going to like it.  It is very emollient, and didn't immediately absorb into my skin.  Fine for night time (because it's completely absorbed in the morning) but not so great for daytime, I thought.  I forged ahead anyway, lightly blotted the area with tissue and applied my concealer.  It plays very nicely with it, and it makes the area look smooth and fresh, with out causing creasing or smearing.  I was pleasantly surprised!

I must admit, I didn't see much change in the first week but as time went on and I became much more thorough with my routine I absolutely loved it.

495	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Found this extremely difficult to apply - it was hard, thick, and didn't blend well. But, as a professional cover creme, it is likely good for using this to cover scars or other imperfections, especially for photographs. I gave it four stars because even though it didn't work for me, it seems to cover well once it is applied. Would prefer 3.5 stars as it's fairly price and difficult to use.
A great moisturizer used on a regular basis (I like Kiehls products), along with daily exfoliating, makes all the difference for me. I will definitely enjoy using this primer while it lasts, but can't afford the expense to make it a permanent part of my daily regimen.

5828	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The sunscreen seems authentic, unlike other JM items I have purchased through Amazon.
This is the first time I have used a make-up setting spray and I didn't notice a dramatic difference using this product. It felt nice going on and did have a wide spray to cover my entire face. I was pleased that it didn't seem to smear any of my applied make up and it did seem to dry everything in place. It did leave my skin a litte flat and dry looking. Unfortunately I have very acne-prone skin and I felt like this spray flared up my acne.

I have tried other translucent setting powders but I've never found one that satisfied me. Either they were not fine enough or they left a white dusting on my face that I never could brush away. This setting powder is truly translucent. I do not use it every day - only for special occasions when I need my makeup to set for a very long time. That being said, I go through additional steps to achieve a longlasting, camera ready look. First of all, I do moisturize then apply a primer to keep my makeup looking smooth. I then apply concealer then foundation.

7559	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a refreshing change, a moisturizer that doesn't promise to give me the skin of a child or to transform all wrinkles into unicorns and doves.  This promises deep moisturizing and I found that it delivers on that promise.  The moisturizer was very light and was absorbed pretty quickly without any shininess.  My skin has felt very soft and no issues with dry patches which I had been fighting.  The ingredient list contains no parabens and plenty of well known good performers (glycerin, Shea butter, hyaluronate) .  The only con is that inwish this was in a pump since exposure to oxygen is never good for beauty products.  This is a well formulated moisturizer that delivers hydration without shine or greasiness.

6673	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this mousse.  It makes my hair more voluminous and gives it some added thickness.  I can definitely tell the difference when I use it.  It adds tons of body and a nice amount of hold so that when I use the curling iron my waves stay in place for several days.  I'm pretty generous with the amount I use because my hair is hard to hold so I need the extra oomph and control.  I then let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning it's a little stiff but it brushes right out and once I've done the waves, it has plenty of bounce.  I finish with Bumble and Bumble Thickening Creme Contour, which adds a little bit of hold but also some additional thickness and separation.  The two products together are awesome and my hair has never looked better.  I don't even need to recurl it on the 2nd or 3rd day because it stays in place so well.  I've tried other thickening mousse formulas but always come back to this one.  It gives my hair some added heft and dimension and the volume is terrific.  Who could ask for more?  This is an awesome product and great for fine hair.  If you're looking for a product with a thickening effect, then you can't do better than this one.  I definitely recommend it for all hair types.
419	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	A little goes a long way, but how it ends up is the issue. The feeling is Very greasy and heavy, and my pores looked and felt very clogged with this. It cannot be used alone without looking rather strange. It covers pretty well, which means that you have to add back shading to look like a real person instead of a plastic toy. When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.

1058	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I had no idea that I needed a setting powder after applying the rest of my makeup until I actually had the chance to review this product. The Dermablend Compact Solid Setting Powder is easy to use (even if you don't follow the directions), goes on smoothly without being noticeable, and does what it claims to do. As I had mentioned, I did not follow the directions and I just used the pad that was included in the compact to apply the powder. I patted to apply it. However, I did not buff it off and I still had great results. Due to the fact that I did not generously use the product as instructed, it might not have made a difference if I had buffed the makeup or not. It still kept my makeup looking fresh hours later. Usually, after a couple of hours, my blush is gone and my foundation begins to cake or disappears. This was not the case after using the Dermablend Setting Powder. Now a product that does what it says it does regardless of user error makes it a superior makeup. I am glad that I had the chance to try this Dermablend product because setting powders are definitely necessary for your busy days.

The cleaner worked well to catch any residual makeup I missed after a makeup removal and washing with my normal remover and cleanser.  While it did work adequately on its own to cleanse skin and remove a light layer of foundation, it wasn't as effective when removing eye make up.  It took a lot of scrubbing to remove everything when used alone.

With a new bottle, I peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.
  The soap is easily washed off.  It does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done.  My skin is left feeling moist, not dry and irritated.  According to the packaging, this soap is designed for ALL skin types.  The plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine.  It is what I call gender friendly.  However, there wasn't any safety seal beneath the old-fashioned screw on cap.  It is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand.  It would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle.  You lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream.

3042	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	unfortunately this product clogs my skin and breaks me out, im guessing its the squalane because i am fine with glycerine. its also not very moisturizing, and it kind of burns sometimes going on, not to mention makes my face turn reddish and shiny. the redness dissipates but the shine factor does not go away especially on the forehead, so i would only use this at night. but anyway i will probably have to give this away as i feel its too expensive and too small of an amount to waste as a hand cream or something haha.
4444	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Instead of my having to use 2 products, actually 3 sometimes, I am trying this.  I've heard of the company but have never tried anything of theirs.  This is a light feeling cleanser that you can use to wipe away your eye make up too.  Says usable for eye area and sensitive skin.  Lastly, includes a toner..there is no rinsing required.  Apply with cottonball.  From what I can decipher from ingredients, besides the Vichy natural"spa" water..there is shea butter, liquid parafin, liquid cocoa something.  This really does feel soothing and my face has not broken out.  The biggest surprise for me is that there is perfume fragrance to this..is that a little weird or just my thought?  To me it smells kind of like Eternity!  I mean, love the smell but wow, surprised me that perfume is an ingredient.
I've been working with a lot of different facial products in the last few months and this one is one of the most impressive cleansers I've used.  I keep a tube by the bath tub and I let it sit on my face while i soak in hot water.  Afterwards, all I do to remove it is gently wipe down my face with a warm wash cloth.  Afterwards, my skin feels soft, happy, and moisturized.  I always apply moisturizers before I go to bed at night, but I don't feel the need to rush to apply them after cleansing my face with this product.  I can relax and let my skin breathe for a while before I feel the need to moisturize it again.

4995	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have pale, almost non-existent eyebrows.  Currently I've been using two different department store brands of "wind up" automatic pencils.  They're smooth going on but very easily break off, and are expensive for the amount of actual product inside the pencil.  I've also tried hard pencils but they don't apply easily and often the color is too dark or doesn't show up at all.  And the brow powders I've tried are difficult to get on light enough to not look like a drawn-on eyebrow, plus powder doesn't seem to last all day or stay on when swimming.  This micro pencil is the best of all of them:  goes on easily/smoothly in tiny strokes so it looks very natural, is a great color for me, stays on until you take it off, and you get the whole pencil plus sharpener.  It will last a long time and is a good value.  I highly recommend this product--it is my new holy grail of eyebrow pencils!!

7328	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	When it comes to skincare, women have been light years ahead of men.  That's changing, I think, judging from my son who wants to literally put his best face forward.  It's good to know that there are quality products like those from Baxter of California to support that change.  In a word, this set is the bomb.  The cleanser is strong enough to cut through a workout's worth of sweat without being irritating (even to someone with sensitive skin), the toner has a fresh, but not overpowering minty scent and again, doesn't cause redness or feel like it's stripping the skin of a layer of good stuff like other toners do. And the moisturizer is fabulous, thick effective but it doesn't feel like you have stuff on your face when you use it.  This is not a cheap set, but it's a great one.  And this stuff lasts, even with daily use,
702	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great, lightweight cleanser with a mild peel to it.  I use this daily after shaving. I'm a bit lazy and do everything at once, but my skin looks reallyl good for a geezer.  Great product line.

5331	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Does a fabulous job of exfoliating the skin gently . I use it three days a week in the morning only . Very pleased with the product was recommended by my esthetician who is also a nurse

Downsides: I contacted the company to ask a simple question that should have had a canned response, and never heard back, so they may not be the most customer service-oriented folks. The products also contain parabens, so if you avoid those, these are a no-go.

I recommend using the skin analysis. I am going to receive free samples from Mario Badescue's  website of the products they recommend for my skin, so I can test out the moisturizer they recommend in comparison to this one I received to see which is the best for my skin.  Either way I am sticking with a moisturizer from their line.  The cool thing is they don't have a one size fits all moisturizer like most companies, so you have freedom to choose which one works best for you. This is my first experience with the company, and it was a good one. I recommend trying their products.

1796	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.
I do feel that this was effective at cleansing my skin. I used this after several tough workouts and I feel that it (in combination with a pouf sponge) removed sweat, oil, and dead skin cells. Please keep in mind that this is a shower oil and not a shower gel or body wash, so it will not have the same texture and consistency. It was a little thin and, despite claims on the product page to the contrary, it did not really lather or foam.
2472	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Supersmile does a good job.  Does help with teeth whitening so long as you use daily and follow instruction.
First and foremost, the Jack Black does not foam/lather at all - I'm guessing you need to use a brush and hot water. I'm fairly certain this was marketed as a "brushless" product, similar to Art Of Shaving.

Putting the cream on is fairly easy.  Warm it up in your hands and then smooth on.  It does feel heavy and unpleasant at first, but absorbs fairly quickly.  It smells like Fruit Loops.  I know the ingredients are organic, but the smell just seems overly sweet.  Luckily, it fades fast.

4978	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The Baxter of California skin set worked well for my man, who has medium oily skin and we're currently in the midst of a very dry winter: he liked the face wash, it was minty and smooth and left a good feel.  The lotion was also good, but he said it was weird that it came in a tube: he would prefer a pump or cap top...toner was nice, removed extra oil and left the face feeling fresh albeit a bit dry (you apply the lotion after the toner).  All in all, this skin set worked well, is reasonably priced - probably under normal conditions he'd only use the face wash, and possibly lotion.  When it's hot and/or his skin is feeling oily, add in the toner with lotion use after: would recommend!  Later edit: I tried the face wash myself and it worked well on my more sensitive skin, :).


8074	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've used this product for years.  It totally works and fills in the hair that I've lost.  It makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair.  I recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.
Then I needed something for thicker beard. I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  Wow! It mowed right through on the first pass. I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!

6390	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I discovered the Mario Badescu line almost a year ago and I love all of their products with this being no exception. I have keratosis pilaris, which causes a red, acne like rash on my arms and thighs. I recently have gotten it under control w Ahava, coconut oil and now Mario Badescu. My skin was almost clear but would flair up. This soap has fixed that. I now enjoy smooth skin, always. This soap is very thin but lathers very well. It has a mild fruity smell similar to the Enzyme Gel Cleanser, which I use on  my face. It leaves me feeling squeaky clean and extremely soft. My tiny bumps were smoothed instantly. After 3 days of use my skin felt incredible. I do follow up w coconut oil as a moisturizer and I use the Ahava mud wrap weekly. I haven't touched my Ahava bar soap since purchasing this. This has become my new go to cleanser. I even noticed my husband caressing my thighs more. =D This makes this product a win for me. I use a small amount on my washcloth and expect the bottle to last, at least 2 weeks w daily use. My skin has never felt better.
I have not tried it on my face yet as I wanted to see what it looked like where I needed good coverage the most.  I do think I would have liked a creamier version better but maybe the coverage would not have been as good.  I shall use it tomorrow when I am preparing this old face and

Crest, in their infinite wisdom, has just discontinued my favorite fluoride toothpaste, Vanilla Mint. It was the only fluoride toothpaste without an oppressively sharp or metallic minty flavor. So I'm switching to the fluoride-free Marvis line. (I also use Ginger Mint occasionally for a change of pace). If you're in doubt about brushing with flowery flavors, look for the small tube, also sold on Amazon -- but do try it out.

6242	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It took me a long time to find a product line that helps with my rosacea.  In addition to the lotion, I also use the face cream, the toner & the cleanser.  This product line really works for me!!! When I don't use it for a couple of days, I can really tell a difference.  My skin starts to become itchy, red, & I get a slightly burning sensation.  The rosacea line by Pevonia is definitely an investment, as the products are not inexpensive, but I have to say, it is the only product line that gives me relief!!

5354	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product for a very long time and can highly recommend it. However be careful where you purchase from. Do not pay for a 0.5oz. That is a free sample size!!!!!
This product is a light peachy pink in color.  It comes in a flip top bottle which is soft, so easy to squeeze out.  The label on it is a bit of a problem as it is supposed to be peeled away in two levels to read the inside for instructions.  The label was very hard to get apart, and ended up having the clear coating peel away instead, which means that the label now will not go back into place.  This is very annoying.
742	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	It's simply a hairspray, nothing special about it. If you really think this hair spray has a different chemical to bond to the toppik better then purchase it. I would compare this hair spray with any other strong hold hair spray you can buy anywhere. I don't want to burst your bubble and say Santa don't exist. I was one of those guys dooped thinking this hair spray was different. Save your money and just use your existing hair spray. Honestly, I want my money back but I already paid for the dumb shipping and handling fee so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want a buy a used Toppik Hairspray?

7864	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Doesnt work
-The toner is the best item in this trio, according to my brother!
It's has soothed, plumped, and softened my skin, it's worked well as a base for my liquid foundation, and it has minimized the pores across my nose, and evened-out my skin tone. In addition, it goes on easily with great coverage using a small amount, and it isn't greasy. It sinks in very well on my face, and doesn't creep down into my eyes. It works well on my neck as well (very soothing). I do find that it doesn't sink in as well on my dcollet, this is noticeable at shower time, when you can feel it sitting on the top layers of the skin (doesn't happen with the face and neck). The light citrus-woodsy scent is very nice.
However, I do like the gentle exfoliation results of this.  Whether or not it's worth the extra money I would have to put out to buy this regularly, instead of the scrubs I usually use and which are less expensive, is still a question I'll have to answer with more use.  If after using all 2 oz of this green apple peel I do see a noticeable difference in my skin, I'll edit this review.
6381	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've struggled with splotchy skin on my arms and back forever, and this really helps. It's not harsh, smells great, replaces my other body washes, and it leaves my skin really smooth feeling and looking. Love it. I definitely notice the difference when I'm not using it. If you are less than pleased with the smoothness of your skin, you should definitely give this a try.

Below are the ingredients since they don't appear on the product page.

5056	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The perfect companion to the day time Oil Free Moisturizer!  What I love best is no perfume/scent in the products, which can irritate  people, particularly if you happen to wear contacts, as I do.
In the morning, put it on first thing. It needs time to dry and work its  magic tightening the skin before you can apply eye shadow.  Put shadow on before it's dry and you'll get a clumpy mess. Let it dry and it becomes a good base to make shadow stay on all day. I didn't expect this benefit, but I like it.
2633	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Thought I was getting the same cologne I had before from John Varvatos.  I'm definitely not disappointed, but when I smelled it I knew it wasn't the same one.  The good news is that it smells great and I do not regret it.  I fixed it, however, for Christmas I asked my mother-in-law to get me JT Vintage cologne.  Now, Vintage is what I was after to begin with and it is one of the best smelling masculine colognes out there period.  Still, this is nice and warrants 4-stars.  See other reviews for detailed smell description as I think they've covered that base nicely.

1080	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I like some of the derma blend line, like their concealer.  But this powder does not work for me at all.  I have dry skin & this goes on like a "bake".  You have to dust it all over your face and then brush off the excess.  This left my already dry skin, EXTREMELY dry & showed off even the finest of lines.  If you are prone to dry skin i would definitely go a more moisturized route.  This one is a huge miss for me.
It's a lot of work and I have new respect for the psychosis my girlfriend goes through to look so good all the time but I just don't know that I could do this on a regular basis. Maybe every few days but I don't know about regular use, it's just too much work... That and half my face is beard anyway so it's not like people have much skin to look at. Though I will say under the eyes it does help, so I may just stick with that area over night.

1113	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This powder looks white but it's actually "clear" and can be used with any shade of foundation.  This is the "setting" powder that is applied after you have applied the coverage to your face.  Because the foundation is waterproof and a little on the oily side, if you don't "set" it, it rubs off.  This powder keeps it in place until you take it off.  It comes with a puff, but I prefer to use a powder application brush myself.  I tried using tinted powders over the foundation, but came back to this because it doesn't change the color of the foundation like the tinted powders sometimes do.  It also lasts a long time.
The lotion blends in easily without using a sticky residue.
7141	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Was really thick like old Chapstick.  Probably won't buy anymore since you get like three sticks with the kit. Not moist

Bottom line: try these if you're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne, or if you're simply looking for something to help with anti-aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed. This product really is great!

4650	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	When the juice beauty arrived, I had blackheads (giant pores) over my nose, a blemish on my chin, and a cystic zit on the bridge of my nose.  The cystic zit was gone within three days of using juice beauty, which is impressive.  The blackheads cleared up within a week.  The blemish on the chin, well that beast is just winding down, three weeks later.  To use juice beauty, wet face, apply cleanser, scrub, rinse.  My package came with a nice little washcloth, which aided in the scrubbing. After you pat your face dry you put some blemish serum on, it comes in a little tube, it's very runny, so squeeze with caution or you'll get a whole mitt full.  You can apply the serum to just blemishes or the whole face.  I went with the whole face approach, which I liked, because it has a little tightening effect after you put it on, it's great.  Wait a few moments before putting the moisturizing lotion on otherwise you have a white creamy mess on your face, when the serum isn't quite dry and you put the moisturizer on right away...you get a mess.  The face mask, was, nothing impressive.  It comes in a little jar, you scoop it out and put it on, wait ten minutes, then rinse off.  The mask never tightened, or made my face feel any different.  So the mask, didn't do a thing for me.  I really like the cleanser and the serum.  It didn't do much for a real blemish, but cystic acne is awful, and it cleared that up in days.
6958	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The first thing that hit me when I opened this jar was the cloying smell of rotting fruit (Garnier Fructis has the same smell).

5716	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.
My problem area is my forehead.  I have a tendency to end up with clogged pores on my forehead.  It presents as little bumps.  The bumps aren't pimples and definitely not acne.  They seem to be clogged pores.  After a week of using the Clear Skin Kit, the bumps have disappeared.  I have never been able to get them to completely disappear before, so I am very happy.
I waited to use this for two weeks before writing a review, but even in that short amount of time, it has already made a huge difference in my skin, which appears brighter and feels smoother.  I've also noticed a pretty dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eye area.  My red acne marks are also slowly fading, and I'm not getting as many breakouts as I had been.
9037	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Get's hot quick, but does not curl my hair. I have a older one that takes forever to get hot but when it does, it gives me a tight curl, but for some reason no matter how long i keep this iron in my hair, i can't get a curl.
