Her life now is full of constant pain, from starvation to sexual abuse, without any hopes of escaping...except through death. It's a route that Alice is willing to take, if only she could find the chance. But then even her desperate hope for death is marred by Ray's one last request: find a girl to replace Alice. Despite the horror of his demand, Alice sets about doing it, with only one thought on her mind: freedom.

The power of the immigrant story, the success of the immigrant and the healing necessary from evil makes this a remarkable tale and worth the effort to read.



The eroticism was underlined and bolded by the intensity of desire and depth of need the author expressed so well. This was not just a hot description of moves and and how said moves feel. The need Will felt for Jenny came through loud and clear. His lack of experience certainly conflicted with his ability to expertly arouse Jenny. We've all known the fumbling of the first time. A man with no experience cannot possibly know his way around a woman's body, cannot possibly balance interpreting her response to his touch while somehow knowing the right time to move on, the right duration, the right intensity, ect. Will's ability to do everything right was believably set up by the way the author describes his utter fascination with knowing every inch of her body by touch, taste and scent. If I say much more I will give too much away... and also have to end this review right here, ahem.

Living Dead Girl is a horrifyingly emotional story about a 10 year old that is kidnapped and sexually abused. Her abductor tries to keep her a little girl forever. The writing is haunting, well done, and has great pacing. Thankfully, because of the topic, this is a short novel (only 3 discs). Though this was hard to read/listen to, I think it's an important story. It's so easy to look away, to accept the excuses, to ignore the red flags and the little voice in your head that something is wrong. In my opinion, we as a society need to pay more attention and not be so afraid to speak up! I truly admire Elizabeth Scott for doing such a wonderful job tackling this subject.

My only real problem with this book is that the reason for the reconciliation was too flimsy; too transparent. It seemed like something that could have been resolved with a stern lecture or two.

On the Edge brings back the characters from the Devlin Group and this time is Charlotte's turn to get her happy ever after.  But when you are a member of this group, nothing is ever easy and that includes love.  Tony has been put down most of his life because of his background - the same one that makes him perfect in his undercover work.  Charlotte has worked hard over the years to remove herself from her past and now she must face it again to save the others.  Danger feeds passion, and Tony and Charlotte already had the flames rising even before the danger happened.  I was never happier than when Tony and Charlotte made it out okay only to have them tear each other apart.  It made me want to knock their heads together, but I was rewarded in the end with a perfect ending.  Suspense stories have always been able to hold me in their grip. Ms. Stacey did one even better and wouldn't let me put the book down until the last word had been read.  On the Edge is sexy, full of danger, and has two main characters I just had to back.  It is also a book I will be rereading time and again, as will you, I'm sure.

We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in "The Wallflower", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it. If I had one problem with this story it was that it was too darn short and that I didn't want it to end, but if that isn't the best recommendation I can give for a story, I just don't know what is.

These short stories that you are able to download at any time are wonderful.  They have taken the place of the old magazine giants of decades past, where a reader could plunk down some change and for relatively little money, have a very good reading experience.  The days of those great old publications are long gone now and they left a horrible void for those of us who love reading.  This void, to a certain extent, is being fulfilled now and I personally feel we are going to see many more quality reading made available to all of us.



On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist "attributes" is up to the reader to decide.

First thing, the two men, we know they're ex-Seals, but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?), how they came there, and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat, they're trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought, execution and information.

The main lead..He's the ultimate Hero! A man used to being out in the wilderness and having trained with the military Special Forces as well as with the GhostWalker teams. Most of his life he had been cold and dispassionate in his dealings with people and never been able to form any emotional connection with another human being...until he met her...From the moment he saw her, I was devouring his each thought process...how much he wanted her, craved her and wanted to touch her! Seriously, throughout the book there was not a moment he wanted to separate himself from heroine...it may sound a bit extreme, but not in this case..This hero was used to being cold from the inside, not having any feelings/emotions and what he felt for heroine was completely foreign to him! I really enjoyed his transformation..he was caring, possessive and considerate and I was absolutely heartbroken each time there was a portrayal of his vulnerability when he though he was Losing the heroine...

What I love about this book: First of all, Marillier understands that a heroine can be strong without wielding a sword and marching off to war. Her female characters are strong of heart and conviction. Jenica is strong in that she would do anything to protect her family, sometimes to a fault. She is flawed like a human being, and throughout the story she learns how to overcome these faults. Second, I love the location, descriptions, and atmosphere. The fairy-tale creatures and festivities of the Other Kingdom are imagined in a way that makes your heart ache for it to be real. The atmosphere is soft, romantic, ethereal, and somewhat mysterious. Third, I love the love stories, plain and simple. There are two love stories in Wildwood Dancing; they are tell a different kind of story, and I think Marillier did a good job of balancing the two out. One is eloquent and somber, whereas the other sweet and light-heated. The first love story is apparent from the beginning and remains rather constant throughout the book, whereas the latter is revealed toward the end.

The last is probably his most impressive exploit, as he passes the bar exam (on his third try) with only two years of high school.

Should be a 5 star GFY book. Yes, the sex scenes are hot, but everything else in the book is one big stereotype and filled with horrible self-loathing words. If Ms. Anderson wrote "pitcher" and "catcher" one more time to describe the top and bottom definitions in a gay relationship, I was going to scream. Plus the homophobic jock friend who used the word, "fag," was so over the top and two-dimensional, it was cartoonish. What could have been a sweet, coming of age, boys fall in love story turned into a poorly developed cliched plot fest with no redeeming qualities that I could find. I suggest renting the movie "Defying Gravity" if you want straight college boy roommates falling in love and angsting about it.

The Bad:

It is a fast paced Sci/Fi novel with both strong male & female Alpha characters with a lot of fights and battles.  Wulf was the ultimate Alpha male wanting to do nothing but protect his mate but having to come to term with the fact that with her experience & abilities, Melina was not going to stay on the sidelines.  While Melina is a kick-ass heroine and capable of taking down the bad guys she's not invincible and does have to deal with injuries.  Too many times in a novel, the stong Alpha female is shown overcoming the bad guys with only a few bruises to show for it.  In both novels that I have read so far by Monette Michaels, the Alpha females while able to deal with the bad guys are not invincible and are therefore more credible.

In Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.

With a brief intro in to his life before and during training he quickly moved to his insertion in to the 82nd PIR as a replacement officer.  So he wasn't there from the beginning, but he was certainly close enough.  He fought in the hills of Italy in what seem like guerilla type warfare.  Although he experienced combat it wasn't until Anzio that he was baptized by fire and blooded his first German.  From this brutal battle he was sent back to England to rest and recuperate and ultimately missed D-Day.  His next major action was Operation Market Garden where he had to fight across the Waal River, which, from his description, was one of the more bloody engagements, and not well planned, of not only Operation Market Garden but also of WWII.  And yet he survived when the majority of the men around him were dying.  Battle of the Bulge came next where he battled German SS soldiers and single handedly, with H company, took out a tank and invaded and captured a town before the Germans could regroup.  Megellas certainly fought a lot and became an efficient killing machine.

I loved this story. There is one thing I love more than a free book and it's a free book that's good. What I really liked about this book is the story started right away, no unnecessary intro and no unnecessary words. Even though it dived right into the story, you still understood what's taking place.  Through out the book we got to know Jess and Llewelyn and it was good reading their chemistry as the story plays out. It wasn't just the sexual things they did but it was the book as a whole that was pleasing to read. We got to meet the brothers, Allard and Graham whose stories will be coming out next as this is book 1. The brothers surely had me entertain as well in the book. They brought good chemistry to the story. Of course the ending of the book was really interesting  and leaves room for me wanting more.

1.  Like so many indie books, the lack of effective editing made it nearly unreadable.  I'm not saying responsibility doesn't lie with the author, but when you have an untried writer, a good editor makes all the difference.

It's true that Rebecca had done some really off the wall things in the past, but if someone tells you that you're no good, or that you're a total screw up....you tend to start believing it.

Told through the voices of those who know him best, it is a wonderfully fleshed-out account of a young man's life viewed from the many different angles and points that give us all our form, and never is it clearer than when driving home the point that no one of us is an island, and that no matter how we fight it, we are to some extent - more than most of us would probably like - products of our heritage, our upbringing, and the actions and words of those who love us - and, just as significantly or perhaps even more so, those who don't.

In Wings I have not only one but two winged heroes. In a fantasy medieval setting, two breed are at war; the little Melanians, bronzed skin and colourful wings, against the tall and pale Nazarians with the white wings. Among the Melanians, Anyar always felt not at ease, he is bigger than them and plus he has longer and deep black wings, almost too big for his lithe body. He is a bit of a black duckling.

I was struck by his belief that swapping the two classes would result in a permanent fix to the problem.  History has born out that empowering the oppressed class just turns them eventually into oppressors.  Communists eventually become an elite class and there still becomes a less privileged class.  The incentive to excel becomes stifled and overall prosperity suffers.
The Dark Farewell is a rather tasty little mystery set in the mid-1920s. Its prohibition, and not a good time to be a gay man in a small town. You have to be discreet, which is one of the many things that Julian is not. The author has a penchant for setting up his main characters so that at least one of them has a strong dislike for the other, and in this story it serves him quite well. Flynn takes an instant dislike to Julian, and not without good reason. Watching the two men getting to know one another enough for love to blossom seems a lot more realistic than the over-used made for each other romance.

2-THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
The plot -- such as it is -- revolves around the suicide of one of Veronica's brothers, which sends her on a trip to Brighton to bring the body back to Ireland for the funeral (she is gathering the body to bring it back to a gathering of people -- clever). About halfway into the book the "secret" of this brother's lifelong depression is revealed, and it's both jaw-droppingly cliched and wholly simplistic and reductionist. My one hope was that this "revelation" would be the spark that lit a fire under the second half of the book -- but no, it simply plods forward at the same stultifying pace. Ultimately the book has nothing to offer: it has no telling insights into memory or regret, it rehashes the same tired cliches about growing up poor and Irish, its use of the unreliable narrator is rudimentary at best, and its not even notably bleak and depressing. I guess you could make the argument that many of these flaws are actually commentary on the flawed nature of humans, but this doesn't make it worth spending your own precious time on.
I really found so much hilarious Pelham Winwood, Horatias brother, and his friend Roland Pommeroy, often mentioned in the book as Pel and Pom. They are very funny and all the scenes with them are uproarious. My favourite was the duel scene with Crosby Drelincourt, cousin and presumptive heir of Lord Rule. Both Pel and Pom are great characters and give to the story amusement and light heartedness. I enjoyed them a lot. Besides, Pel is quite dashing!
As Oscar's lonely tale unfolds, readers are taken back two generations to when his family lived in the Dominican Republic under the violent dictator Trujillo. Oscar's grandfather, Abelard, spends the last years of his life as a broken and literally tortured man in prison for not turning over his daughter to Trujillo. Abelard's third daughter, Belicia, is born after his imprisonment and soon sold into virtual slavery. She is eventually tracked down by her father's cousin, a wise widow called La Inca. La Inca finds Belicia defiant after years of abuse, and she soon grows into a gorgeous young woman. The two do their best under the oppressive government and are even prospering until Belicia falls in love with a powerful gangster and gets pregnant. Belicia's dreams of love are shattered, and so is her body, as the gangster's goons beat her to the edge of death and leave her in a cane field. Angry and mourning the loss of her unborn baby, Belicia leaves the Dominican Republic, taking the fuk with her.
This story goes back and forth between the present time and the night five years ago that things went so horribly wrong for the two men. The only negative to this story is the going back and forth is rather confusing. The story itself is very good and Ms. Cooper really made me feel for both Hayden and Josh. Hayden cannot remember everything that happened five years ago and is very bitter since he thinks Josh betrayed him by testifying in Court that Hayden was driving drunk and killed someone, leading to Hayden spending time in jail. I could also feel Josh's frustration in trying to get Hayden to remember what happened and all that he endured five years ago. Josh is also hurt by the anger he feels coming from Hayden, when he knows the truth that they are mated.

Walt Longmire is the longtime sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, with a territory that extends to the Buckhorn Mountains and includes Native American reservation land. Since the death of his wife, Martha, he's a bit like a broken clock spring, leaving much of his work to his deputy sheriff and subordinates. His closest friend is Henry Standing Bear, who runs the Red Pony, a local "watering hole." As the book opens, a young man who, with three friends, sexually assaulted a learning-disabled Cheyenne girl several years earlier, is found murdered. Walt would prefer his last years as sheriff be as quiet as possible, but the mystery just refuses to let go. It soon becomes obvious that someone is gunning for the remaining three young men.
I will say that I was very impressed and even shed a tear or two learning more about Nina and why she acts the way she does. The book has some excellent life lessons that we all could take something away from. That, and it is funnier than hell.

I have a hardbook from Benton and I know the difference, this book IS NOT what it portrays itself as.
The world-building is unique and imaginative. The characters are even more so-- fully fleshed out, with individual personalities and idiosyncrasies, as well as plenty of humor thrown in.
The continued character development is great. Again, you see more of a human side of Halt as he himself realizes just how much Will meant to him. It is amazing how far Horace has come, from the brat he was at the beginning of the first book to the highly mature, loyal, and dedicated Knight's apprentice. Jarl (captain) Erak, the one who captured will and Evanlyn, proves that he is more than just some savage viking knock-off, but a man of honor.

If you are unfamiliar with Pride and Prejudice and don't understand what is written above here is the scenario:
While our own decision to join a church was nowhere near the radical conversion Sara Miles experienced, I can relate to her needing to fulfill some latent part of her life that was void of meaning.  My own life rarely parallels Miles' life, but I can also relate to her desire to keep her mission work simple and open to all.  I have a problem with people who want to treat religion (and subsequently their church life) as if it is an exclusive "members only" club that does not have time for any deviation from established norms.  Jesus did not teach us to be exclusive but rather inclusive, as demonstrated by his association with tax collectors and harlots.

One thing I admire most of all:  this story was clearly a novella-sized idea, and the author did not try to pad it out into a 300-page novel, as so many authors do, thereby producing a bloated whale.  He let it run the length it should be, and the result is a very nice, tight, ingenious story.

The secondary characters of Ben, David and Wesley were brilliant.  While everyone in the book was a so-called geek, they were completely comfortable in their skins and made no apologies for who and what they were.  Utterly relatable and charming.  I also liked the secondary romance in the book between Ben and Wesley.  Talk about being stubborn but in the end, Ms. Pape did a great job with them and it didn't distract from Eric and Lori's romance.

There's a lot of to-do in this book about some sort of curse placed on Oscar's family by the Dominican Republic's dictator. This results in a slight feel of "magical realism," especially in a mongoose-like creature and a faceless man who both haunt some of the characters. It added an interesting angle to the story, and made things slightly more bearable.

Two favorites that I have "discovered" in this complete works are The Death of Jean, and What is Man? The Death of Jean is a stunningly poignant reflection on the sudden and unexpected death of his adult daughter. It was written from the moment of the discovery of her death and for the next two days. The pain is so tangible, and the observations of life are so astute. Just a marvelous read. What is Man? is a philosophical essay in which we read a conversation between the Young Man and the Old Man as they discuss topics such as free will and destiny.

5393	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This book has to be one of my top 10 favorites. I love the Character of Hunt Jamison; he was brutal, brazen, and honest to fault. He spoke what was on mind and found myself smiling and liking it. I felt bad for him at times because like Hunt I have a scar on my face from a car accident and I was embarrassed by it and sometime I'm still am, so I related to the character so much. I loved Lila character as well she tried her best not to fall for him while trying to keep her dignity. I like that the "Write" didn't make them fall in love so quick and like I said the honesty of Hunter and plain-spokenness is so needed in others writers' characters. I love the book and it was worth it. I read it in one night.

Currently, I am reading the science of being great. It is a very simple straightforward book that anyone can follow.
I have often wondered a book generates a buzz prior to its release. In this case, the attention is well deserved. I'd read the follow up novel, A Touch of Scandal, today if someone were to put it in my greedy little hands.
The first part of the story, and frankly my favorite part of the novel, takes place in Italy, where the pilgrims are trying to get to Avenrus, a gateway to the underworld according to Virgil in the Aeneid. The problem is that Marco has no intention of joining them, and this provides the conflict for the first half of the story. The pilgrims' travels through Italy take them to Rome and Padua, the home of Petrarch, the most famous poet of the time, who possesses an artifact the pilgrims will need if they're to survive a journey through Hell. I found the scenes set in medieval Italy to be well-crafted, and they anchored what otherwise could have been a purely fantasy tale to a real and important period of history.

The Flaws: The major flaw in this book is that maybe it focuses too much on the war. What makes this series so stellar is the personal relationships between the characters, which are pushed to the side a great deal in this story. There is still a lot of talking, but it is almost completely related to the major conflict. Even at the beginning with the heartfelt reunion, the next passage moves on to the Temujai. This is not a deal-breaker but for readers who are looking for a deeper exploration into the ties that bind Horace, Evanlyn, Will, and Halt, they will be disappointed.
This was my first foray into Patricia Briggs's werewolf society and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Fortunately, though I assume this takes place in the same society as in her two most recent werewolf books, I did not need to read them first. I had no problem following along with the rules of the werewolves and unfolding events. There are also some very interesting twists thrown into the story that explain just what did happen to the missing werewolves in the pack and why there are no females besides Anna and the pack leader's mate.

When I got it I was surprised that the book was seemingly so short- however I was unable to put this book down.  I was equally horrified and yet left wanting to know what was going to happen next.  I can only give this book four stars however, because I was disappointed in the way it ended. It was far too abrupt and left this reader wanting to know more about what happened after the end of the book. I don't want to go too much into detail and ruin the story- but it was far too abrupt.

I too have lost a child and there is nothing to prepare you for the inexpressible, unfathomable and soul destroying grief, and you DO look for ANYTHING to take away the pain. You do also become quite selfish in your grief and feel at times that no one could possibly suffer as you are and it is the best medicine to  hear other peoples tales of loss and the manner in which they coped. To me the knitting circle women were very real and the story of the  loss of a child spot on. Some of the reviews were quite caustic which surprised me with such a good book but perhaps one has to experience this horror to understand.

1124	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Although the title of the book may make you think this is a paranormal romance, it is not.  There are three "fates" who serve to match the main characters and make them fall in love (they seem to be serving the needs of the heroine, but this is never explained) and also intervene at a critical point to ensure the HEA.  These are the only paranormal elements and they really struck me as lazy storytelling - they just make it so the author doesn't have to explain why a confirmed bachelor would suddenly marry a woman he's never met before (and one who is the opposite of his physical type) and ensure that the heroine is rescued.

However if I were ever to talk to the writer of "Living Dead Girl," I would tell her that if you create a disturbing story like this, if you take your readers on such an emotional roller-coaster, you'd better come up with a better ending than the one we were offered. If there is no hope or inspiration, such a tale becomes simply a horror story with nothing to learn, an exercise at psychological manipulation if you will.
The characters in each of these tales were developed to the extent necessary for the reader's enjoyment. There weren't any actual character study types as these were mainly plot and story driven works.
I am not a fan of short stories (I kind of get attached to the main characters in a novel and hate to part with them too quckly) and definitely not a fan of horrors (my imagination being too vivd, obviously:)), but nonetheless I found all the stories in "65 Proof" at least intriguing, and most of them really amusing. I loved the twists and the humour, although I probably sometimes missed on the cultural/local puns - as I am not a native-speaker of English, which has not in the least taken any joy and fun from the reading:D
Zoltack's writing is creative and full of adventure. There's never a dull moment in Aislinn's life. The dialogue is authentic to the time and the plot moves at a brisk pace.
The author also suggest that all humans enjoy telling and retelling a good story.  As with a good joke, the best are more easily remembered and therefore more likely to be transmitted to others.  Since no story is ever passed on exactly as it was received, the tale undergoes an "evolution of the fittest" of sorts, creating very long lasting and resilient tales.  Details that are non-events fall out, while details that are surprising or threatening or instructive are perpetuated.  Furthermore, the human as social animal naturally looks upon those events and activities having to do with self and others as the most important focus.  The gods or ancestors, omniscient though they may be, are therefore more concerned with whether one is stealing from ones neighbor or seducing someone else's spouse than they are with whether there are 22 teeth in ones comb or 21, or wether a bug just walked across the table.  Professor Boyer indicates that most religious people who believe in gods who are totally aware of all events tend to pay little attention to these all powerful beings and more attention to those spirits, etc. who have more of an immediate impact on their own lives.

Unable to go on after her loss, Mary was urged by her mother to join a knitting circle in Providence. The idea seemed absurd to her since she didn't even know how to knit, but she decided to go, unsure of what to do next once she was there. Welcomed by Alice, Harriet, Scarlett, Lulu, Beth and Ellen, she quickly found a spot for herself trying to live her day one moment and one knot at a time. The therapeutic qualities of focusing on knitting those tiny little knots relived her mind and heard for her devastating loss. Instead of slowly losing herself in the inky depths of the black hole her heart felt she found purpose in knitting and talking to the women. Each one as it turned out had her own dramatic tale, reminding Mary that people are more similar than different. As she cracked her hard shell exterior to these women their tales of sorrow made her heart come to life, she felt the need to be there for them even if her own life was slowly unraveling, her work being difficult to do, her hair and clothes no longer important, her husband coming home later and later...

Whether in novels like The Big Sleep or Farewell, My Lovely, or stories such as those included in The Simple Art of Murder, the noir world, truth be told, is much like our own.  Hypocrisy, duplicity, vanity, ruthless self-seeking, official corruption, and cruelty, with or without a purpose, are the stuff of which the noir context is made.  Genuine decency, unselfish kindness, generosity, and untainted love are hard to find and commonly devalued as just so much softness.

In order to tell Oscar's familiar history, Daz uses this curse as both a device and an excuse. The whole narrative maybe focused on the journey of fuk until it reaches the protagonist. As such, "The brief wondrous life of Oscar Wao" becomes a bigger picture. This reminds of another Pultizer Prize winner Jeffrey Eugenides' "Middlesex", in which by telling the journey of a gene, the writer revisits a whole century and an immigrant saga.

Writing Style - The writing style of Marion Stein is very interesting and easy to keep up with.  While everything is explained in great detail so that the reader can understand all the scientific aspects of the book, the story is able to remain extremely intriguing throughout these explanations.  The story does deal slightly with the controversy of euthanasia, but it does not try to force either side on the reader at all; it states each side's views diplomatically and shouldn't offend the reader's beliefs.  Also included are just a few typos, but they are minute and no problem at all.  Lastly, there was no attempt to hide product or company names in the book, and often real companies or people would be included to give the story realism.  It was slightly awkward at times but, like the typos, it didn't detract from the book much at all.

7786	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case. The author writes well, the plot, though creaky is serviceable and the more relevant characters nicely sketched. I will happily now move on to other books by Moats.


All of these characters pop in and out of Saul and Patsy's life, but the one thing that remains constant is its setting. SAUL AND PATSY is a Midwestern pastoral: Baxter evokes a Michigan whose flatness holds a "sensual loneliness" and whose cities are losing their personalities through the ups and downs of the industries that created them. Like Terre Haute, Duluth, Flint, Grand Forks, or dozens of other similar --- and actual --- municipalities, Five Oaks is one of those "cities you had heard of but couldn't quite picture, cities that called nothing in particular to mind except for an eagerness to be larger and more prosperous than they were, and an all-consuming late-stage boosterism that was mostly insecurity and worry masked by bluster." Even as Saul and Patsy get comfortable in Michigan, Michigan is becoming an increasingly uncomfortable place to live.


Great read and highly recommended for all ages.

I'm not sure why the other reviewer was caught up on the cover but most people recognize covers as stock images...they aren't necessarily reflective of the books characters.
Cut back on expenses. I now pay mostly with cash, not debit or credit card because it shows me clearly how much money I am spending out of my self-imposed weekly allowance.

It is not embarrassing because in the end I know that I will be better off financially.
A Spanking for Valentine is sugar and spice and everything...naughty.  I have a new favorite book of Evangeline Anderson's and trust me when I say A Spanking for Valentine has a lot of competition.  What sends this book over the top for me is the mix of tender and tart.  There's something incredibly sweet about both Valentine and Shane.  Their love for one another comes right off the page from the start, even if Shane doesn't recognize the depth of his feelings for her at first.  Ms. Anderson definitely hit my "dreamy sigh" button more than a few times in A Spanking for Valentine, even at moments I wouldn't have expected it.

I'm probably being too hard on this book. It's like waking up to a snowy cold morning, after flying in from the Caribean, reading this book after the sunny and funny 'Collision Course'. Chasing Smoke is wintry, humourless, angsty and angry, and some people will love that. It's not that it's a bad book at all. I'm talking purely about my emotional response, which is an individual thing. Mitchell nonetheless delivers a story with real meat on its bones, and real men, even if they're not particularly winning. Not a reread for me, but far from poor value.
Greg gets treated to the full crazy of falling into a family of vampires. Lissianna's family is insanely protective of her, which is a little funny seeing as he's tied up for the first part of this book. As he gets to know her and those around her, he sees how much she's respected and loved. Which, naturally, leads to THINGS HAPPENING. Because things happen when you've been abducted by vampires and find the woman you're destined to be with.

When we meet Vander, he is in a great dilemma. He recently received a letter from a young woman in Europe who discovered a grim secret in Vander's past, a secret that threatens to expose him and bring disgrace to his vaunted career. Vander feels he must meet this danger head on, so he goes to Turin, Italy, home of the sacred Shroud of Turin, to meet Cass Cleave. Vander is determined to savage this young rube in his characteristic way until he realizes that he is falling in love with the young Irish girl. In a deeply affecting sequence of events, Vander falls ill and relates the story of how he came to be who he is to Cass. Banville concludes "Shroud" with one surprise after another, keeping the reader constantly on his or her toes right to the very end.

In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.

Written about 1910, about a year before he died, Wallace Wattles sums up all he has learned about the methods of obtaining wealth. About the age of thirty, struggling to feed his family, Wallace seeks to find the answer of why some people are poor and others are not. The book shares his findings. This was the book that the DVD "The Secret" was based on.  The basic principles given by Wattles are very similar to present day prosperity writers.  The book is short and easy to read.

Wattles writes with genuine authority and his style is free of embellishment. This is definitely a classic of the genre and ranks with the best works of later authors in the field, like Catherine Ponder, Joseph Murphy, John Randolph Price and Stuart Wilde.

6778	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	Let me be frank up front.  I am a Christian with all that implies.  Yet I did not like this book and I am not sure I am going to ever read another book by this artist.  From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like "Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it."  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say "these tactics are not working?"  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.
  The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of environmental determinism.

2079	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Winner of the 2007 Man Booker Prize. The story unfolds as a dysfunctional family gathers together for the funeral of the dead brother Liam, who killed himself by swimming out into the ocean. Flashbacks abound and hidden secrets of the past are revealed. Enright's prose is unique: sparse, poetic, and evocative of deep mourning. Unless artful prose can keep you entertained for several hundred pages, however, this book is likely to be slow going for you. Although I appreciate Enright's masterful writing, I struggled to finish this book.

The stories in THE SIMPLE ART OF MURDER, though, are earlier stories, and some of their detectives have characters that would not let them be easily renamed after Marlowe. For example the hero of "Spanish Blood," the first story in this collection, is Hispanic, and that is important to the plot.

Characters are good.  I like Samatha Mack, the protagonist, who's been on the Chicago police force for only two years.

She sees it as a punishment, not fully aware that her father sees it as sending her to safety. As her father expects she takes risks, risks that lead trouble to her. Ky is a flawed complex character who I found myself not only rooting for but also identifying with, and this lead to trouble putting the book down.

When I first met Remi in Without Reservations he was the somewhat homophobic best friend of Chayton Winston, a veterinarian and mate of Keaton Reynolds. Initially it was difficult for me to accept Remi in a gay relationship as well as the change in his personality, however the author provided a plausible explanation for his change of mind about Chay's and Keaton's relationship as well as the major shift in his own sexual orientation. It seems that Remi had a deep, dark secret that he had never admitted to himself or anyone else until it's almost too late.

I was hoping to love this one, as I've been waiting for Ms. Garwood to return to historicals for a long time.  But I decidedly did NOT like this book!  I finished it because I kept hoping it would get better, but it did not.  I hope that, in future, there will be more historicals, BUT with the quality, romance, and chemistry that we are used to from her.
The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.  Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.
At time it seems the whole town is against Ransom and Gwen's relationship and they have to battle predictable adversaries at every turn.  Through it all Ransom proves you can't judge a man by his age but by his maturity.

I read this book for the third time today. I really enjoy this one. This story, although not perfect, is a very believable premise for gay-for-you love. You can just imagine the two MCs, Mav & Duke 'daring' each other so as to excuse their gay urges. Reminds me of all those spin-the-bottle games I played at school camps & sleep-overs as a child. There is a little bit of awkwardness to the angst, but apart from that the story hangs together well. The erotic content is beautifully written too. This is a sweet romance that I would happily recommend.

These are written for children but everything is so fresh and new they are great fun reads for adults, too.  I'm only part way through the entire collection but am having a great time following Dorothy's adventures in the different worlds.  Not all take place in Oz - so far, I've traveled to Ev (across the great desert from Oz) and a land underground inhabited by people who are vegetables and not particularly nice ones.

I read this book to my two preschoolers, and surprisingly, despite the length of the book and each of the chapters, they absorbed quite a bit of the story.

"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" tells the story of Oscar, the awkward and overweight teen son of a Dominican immigrant. Oscar is a fan of what the narrator calls "the Genres" -- fantasy, sci-fi, video games, anime, role-playing games, etc. -- and dreams of someday becoming a great writer on par with J. R. R. Tolkein. But Oscar also dreams of finding a girlfriend, a quest thwarted by his social awkwardness and his looks... not to mention his brutal, overprotective mother. Oscar's story doesn't stand alone, however, and woven throughout his narrative are other stories -- his older sister who struggles to break free from their mother's toxic parenting, his mother who grew up in horrific circumstances during the reign of a sadistic dictator, and his grandparents who made a powerful enemy in the leader of the Dominican Republic and lost everything, including their lives, to his vengeance. All this is told through the voice of Yunior, Oscar's college roommate, who has his own take on what happened to Oscar and his family... but can we trust his words?

My preferred fantasy is Lackey, Butcher, McCaffery plus but I thoroughly enjoyed both Web Mage and this excellent sequel.  I completely agree with previous reviewers who have done a great job of describing the contents of the books.  I just wanted to add that both are real page turners.  Ravirn / Raven is an engaging hero and the computer / hacker stuff while probably authentic enough to satisfy the cognoscenti doesn't overwhelm the ignorant (like me) or the story line.  Other characters are perhaps not quite as well rounded - but that may be the down side of first person narrative.  I look forward to more stories!
4032	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Robb/Roberts provides her standard excellence in the in Death series. I actually bought this book by mistake. I read this months (years?) ago. However, it is the kind of book that needs to have multiple reads to get all the nuance. I read so fast that I sometimes miss things, which is why I re-read books. Oddly, I had not read the other short stories in the book. Kinsman by Krinard was wonderful. It started a little slowly, since there was so much foreign information to absorb. However, the information was presented pretty well in the context of the story. The short seemed much longer, in a good way, than it was. A lot was packed into a few pages. Immortality by Shayne was amazing. Although there could clearly be a series of longer books that tell them story up to the point where the short story starts and more could be written after the story ended, the short story is complete in itself. It is well presented as a stand-alone and is a wonderful story. The ending is fabulous. Magic Like Heat Across My Skin by Hamilton has all the sexual bits one expects from a Hamilton piece of writing and, in the short story, they work well enough. (Personally, I don't care for the sexual tenor of ALL of her books; it is a little like a sledgehammer. Nevertheless, she can tell a good story. I would just like more subtle sex.) The back story regarding the female protagonist's leadership of this clan of the wereleopards is well presented. My problem with the story is that it is presented as an adventure to rescue two wereleopards and all of the necessary facts are detailed about the wereleopards at issue. While we seem to move in that direction, the story suddenly takes a tangent regarding some unexplained point from the series the book is a part of. When that small subplot is supposedly resolved, by the character exclaiming that the mystery will never be resolved, the story ends. We never ever get to rescuing the wereleopards. However, we are told that we can learn the rest of the story if we buy the next book. I would assume that we would also need to buy the earlier books as well in order to know what in the world is really going on. Robb and, I presume, Shayne are writing stories that are part of a series. However, their stories can be read as stand-alone stories that have a clear, understandable beginning and a fully resolved endpoint. That more action may happen is clearly intimated, but we get to the end of the story that was initially presented. Hamilton's story feels more like a somewhat longer sneak peek at her series than an actual short story. Really, it is a set of vignettes from the series that would be unfulfilling to anyone who is not a reader of the series. So, the first three stories were excellent. I hated to penalize them by reducing the stars, when it was only Hamilton's story that was under par. As I said, Hamilton writes well, but this particular short story is not really a story that has a beginning with a rational ending.
Note that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).
Yet inside her, is there still a glimmer of compassion? Alice herself barely knows.
It was great to see Kaylee's best friend Em, as well. I just adore her most of all, because she sticks with Kaylee through thick-and-thin. They have such a sweet, innocent friendship at this point in the story. We also get to see Nash in his all is alpha, jock glory. I would have like to see just a little interaction between Kaylee and Nash, but that is probably me just being greedy.

9. The Doctor's Secret Bride
About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% "believable" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.

1606	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	There were so many bad reviews about this book, that I almost didn't read it, having enjoyed the first two books in this series so much I didn't want to ruin it. I am so glad I did read it, and I loved it as much as the first two books. I am honestly confused about everyone's displeasure. Some thought the story took too long to get going, but I didn't notice undue delay and felt the extra background information was needed for the story. Others felt Brodick's character was unrecognizable, and though I admit he had softened a bit from the first two books, I felt it was already happening at the end of the second book and largely due to being married. One of the things I really liked about this book was Gabrielle's guard and their interaction with Colm and his men. There is something enjoyable about the banter between a group of men that are close to each other, particularly when they are all protecting the same woman. I enjoyed the same thing in the second book with Brodick's guard. I enjoyed Colm and Gabrielle, and felt they were likable, engaging main characters. I also enjoyed the explanations and references to the title, Shadow Music. I highly recommend this book and series!

I still don't understand how she thought getting recommended by her family and friends equaled a handout. Either way I'm glad she and Caleb finally got their act together and really talked to one another.
The mystery itself is quite good, and typical of Lanyon. You will probably figure out whodunit a little before Flynn does, but there are enough good red herrings along the way to distract you and make you doubt your conclusions. The conclusion is actually quite abrupt, but things do get resolved cleanly, if all too conveniently. It leaves you feeling a bit dissatisfied. A little bit of an epilogue might have been nice. Still, this is a very good historical mystery which at under 200 pages in print makes for a nice read.

Everyone interested in political thought or modern history needs to read this book.  Its influence--its ongoing influence--is incalculable.  Its critique of the exploitative nature of capitalism remains astonishingly relevant.  And its predictions about the future course of history, even if no longer inspiring or convincing, are crucial to grasp if one is to understand many of the political impulses of the past one hundred and fifty years.

However if I were ever to talk to the writer of "Living Dead Girl," I would tell her that if you create a disturbing story like this, if you take your readers on such an emotional roller-coaster, you'd better come up with a better ending than the one we were offered. If there is no hope or inspiration, such a tale becomes simply a horror story with nothing to learn, an exercise at psychological manipulation if you will.

Mitchell is one of those women who writes men well.  She gets the emotional repression, and also the physical attraction that goes beyond plumbing and hooks you right into the heart/brain/body triad.  I have to confess, admitting that I understand this genre really well, I could have done with less sex.  Mitchell is careful to make her love scenes integral to the plot development - but I find her characters and their stories interesting enough that I don't really need all the bump and grind.  Love, to me, is more interesting than sex.  Mitchell knows that, and her later works demonstrate her skill even more, well, skilfully.

And so plans are made, and metaphorical lines have been drawn in the metaphorical sand.  Everyone has their thinking caps on, and that includes Halt (of course) and Will, Horace, and even the Princess in disguise when she is given the opportunity.  New friendships are forged between parties that have been enemies for generations that will have long lasting reverberations both in the books universe and the one we happen to find ourselves in.
Even though I got it for free for my Kindle, I just can't recommend this book.
Burke believes that the code is a set of instructions for building a super spaceship. But there is a catch. Building spacecraft is strictly illegal. How to get away with a project this big? Burke's plan is to build a ship that looks like a jumbo-sized plastic bomb shelter. Leinster (who was an inventor himself) has great fun showing how this is done. I know of no other novel in all of science fiction that boasts of such a spacecraft. Nor do I know of a scene exactly like the one in which a bomb shelter is fleeing from a group of nuclear missles.


I will say I thought it very disturbing with the Islam vs. everyone else scenario, but when you think about it, it does have a shade of potential reality to it.  This one really makes you think vs. a "soft" read.  I'm not going to spoil the story by telling you all about it except I really liked it.  You probably will, too.

For my part, I would encourage anyone who is sitting on the fence and can't decide whether or not to read this to NOT.  There are so many better reads out there.
7998	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't put this down, I love what Mandy Roth does with characters and new imaginative worlds and this didn't disappoint. In this story Earth has exiled all paranormal beings to a predetermined planet far away and threaten to kill any that try to stay, even if they only have a little bit of paranormal DNA and have little or no special abilities.  Sevan Vasil is one of these diluted shifters hiding in plain sight as the captain of  the Commission (the government body controlling most of the known universe and the ones responsible for the exile of paranormals).  Sevan has strange dreams of his mate for the last six months and when he has to make an emergency landing on an unknown planet outside the Commission's reach,  finds out they weren't just dreams as he sees her in person.  To say the least it gets pretty interesting from there.  There's a lot of cultural differences that lead to some humorous situations, a little danger, a damsel in distress, an evil vampire, a hot hero and a prophecy that will change everything for the planets dying race.

Zuckerberg made great decisions about his business. He took in workaholic partners from the beginning, he controlled the growth so he could keep up with the strain on his network, he did not allow advertisers to interfere with the experience. His motto, growth first, revenue second. He moved his company to Palo Alto, California to be near the technology capital of the world:Silicon Valley and Venture Capital. He hired Sean Parker as the first President of his company who knew the ends and outs of retaining power while raising capital. Parker was the one who changed the company's name to Facebook and was a mentor to Mark.
Reeces destiny is about to crash into him, literally, but is he ready for what she has in store.  I have to say I am a sucker for a man with dark hair and light eyes and this man was no exception.  Throw in his sexy accent and the way he knows how to treat a lady and Reece is one hell of a leading man.  When he was so understanding and compassionate with Destiny I felt my heart go out to them a little.
Will is still weak from his ordeal from the warmweed and he does not recover right away. Again, playing to the realism. All the characters go through growth when they are so far from home and forced into challenging circumstances. Halt has to come into his own as a strategist after working on his own or among fellow rangers for so long. Horaces skills are put to the test and Evanlyn struggles with her role as a princess out of her kingdom. Finally the Skandians and Erak have to face an enemy that won't flee at the sight of their wolfships. Everyone is put to the test.

I also had a few problems with how Jake and Remi, and by extension, their friends and pack, dealt with the very serious threat of Remi's father. Not to mention my utter disgust over Remi's mother's willingness to stay in such a violently abusive relationship. It's tragically realistic - happens every day - but it's not something that makes for a pleasant read. And frankly, with so many werewolves around, I just couldn't understand why Remi's father didn't "accidentally" end up as dead as he deserved before the situation degenerated to the degree it did. Especially with the lives of Sterling and their mom on the line. It's not like precedent hadn't been set in the first book to allow for killing in self defense.

Personal Involvement: 4 - I enjoyed reading this tale and I cannot wait to read the second book. I thought this book fit in nicely as a P&P retelling/what if variation. It was light, sweet, and a good blending of romance and attraction. This being said, I did have a slight issue. It was heavy on the Christian side of fiction. Now, I know during that period of time, there was a strong influence of the Church in literature and society, which is not as conspicuous in literature published today - although there is a huge religious fiction literature section. Although this doesn't detract from the actual plot, and in a sense it's used as a plot device, I found it a little bothersome.
There are too many asinine ideas to detail, but some highlights (or lowlights) are; abolition of the family; abolition of home education; abolition of nations; abolition of eternal truth, religion, and morality; aboltion of private property; abolition of inheritance; progressive income tax (we have it!); confiscation of property; central bank (we have it!); centralized communication and transport; production owned by the State (GM); industrial armies (national service); abolition of town and country; free education (nothing is free).

Jessaline refuses to marry Timon, and swears that she will marry a Demon of Dunmore before becoming Timon's wife.  As it happens, Lord Llewellyn Dunmore himself is witness to her vow and decides to hold her to it.  Jess is immediately attracted to Llew, but his reputation as a demon doesn't make him a much better alternative than her betrothed.  She agrees to marry him only after he promises never to beat her or physically harm her.  That alone makes him her best option.

Levin also argues against other things that many American's cherish, like the right to privacy. True, there is no explicit right to privacy granted in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean it isn't an implied right, intended by the nation's founders. Surveys show that the majority of Americans feel that privacy is a right and should be Constitutionally protected. Levin feels it is not a right and that the Supreme Court should not treat it as such. It's interesting how the book so Levin so quickly changes his position on democracy and the importance of upholding the will of the people when they vote something into law. If a vote of the people confirms the right to privacy, one would think that someone like Levin would agree that it should be made into law. But based on his other convictions in this book, he would likely be against it, in direct contradiction of some of his other stands on the issues and the Supreme Court's authority to decide them.
I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.


Jess Dee delves into the complications that could occur if close personal friends engage in a m&eacute;nage-a-trois relationship.  Maddie, Connor and Gabe enter into their m&eacute;nage with a lighthearted, fun mentality but at some point a unique connection is made and friendships and hearts could easily be shattered.

At first the book grabbed my attention because I love to knit, but when I read the dust jacket I knew this book could appeal to pretty much anyone who loves to read. The Knitting Circle followed the life of Mary Baxter, a Rhode Island resident who lived a pleasant life with her husband Dylan and five year old daughter Stella. She wrote reviews for the local alternative newspaper, following her own schedule, living to her own beat immersed in the world of books and restaurants, pink tutus and happy family days spend grilling outdoors and making fresh lemonade. Her life was so good she would often stop everything and cry from sheer joy until one day those tears turned dark and swallowed up her whole world, the day her beloved little girl died.

 If you are familiar with the tenets of new age spirituality you will recognize the similarity between these "dimensions of existence" in the book and the "higher planes of existence" in new age spirituality. In both, the inhabitants are spiritually advanced and in both the inhabitants and their environment vibrate at higher frequencies (called existential waveform in the book). The differing frequencies or existential waveforms create an actual barrier between each parallel dimension. The aliens have the technology to quickly move between the multiple existential waveforms and enter other dimensions of existence on this planet.

Jo Banks is a Goth chick wannabe stuck with the body of a Playmate of the Year. She wears her lack of normalcy on her sleeve like a badge of honor...and a shield to protect herself, yet feels deeply the slings of family and friends who don't accept her for who she is.

Being on an airplane sure riles his wolf up, and he is very close to the edge.

The characters are delightful. Karigan is a reluctant hero without being temperamental and childish in obnoxious ways. There are some quirky helper characters who aren't just convenient plot devices, but fascinating mysteries unto themselves.

Elizabeth weeps and agonizes in between bed romps (endlessly described, and way too often) that she and Darcy sneak in as often as possible.

Initially, I was interested in what would happen and how the characters would develop. However, after the first book, my hopes that the writing style would mature did not happen. Throughout the second title in this trilogy, I continued to feel the characters would only converse in order for the author to have a way to explain concepts to the reader. And he seemed to be preaching New Age or Eastern philosophies, more than truly make it a part of his world-building. The characters continued to lack emotional depth and did not have very realistic motives or actions.

9671	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I have a habit with authors I like.  When I read one book that I like I swallow the rest of the author's books.  This is my second by Martin and I am not disappointed.  Really,  the level of detail about farming, oil-rig roughnecks and corporate takeovers is astounding.  More important for me, though,  is the way the author gives you dialogue  and character development that are a perfect fit for their environments.  The roughnecks are roughnecks, the woman struggling to succeed in a man's world is very believable, and the scars left over from Vietnam are tangible, but understated.  I would say that the most interesting aspect of Martin's book for this reader is the visual nature of his descriptions.  With the right script writer, I could see a Gordon Gekko, "Greed is Good", kind of movie based on the book.  I will keep reading Mister Martin
I can't divulge more about the plot without giving it away.  But let me say it is a book that will haunt you with questions and what ifs.  Is it possible to be happy with someone knowing that they don't love you?  It is possible to love someone too much?  How does love and passion turn into a dangerous obsession?  What is the difference between love and ownership?  And how is it that obsessive love can drive intelligent people to do rash, stupid, unethical and even illegal things (consider the recent case of astronaut Lisa Nowak)? You will continue thinking about this book long after you've finished.

Oscar is far and away the most poignant character to come along in a great long while; in my book he's every bit as memorable as Ignatius J. Reilly, Holden Caulfield, Randall Patrick McMurphy, and other literary giants.  Furthermore, "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" is a phenomenal novel that is hysterical, hypnotic, heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal parts (and quite often at the same time).  The plot is a madcap high-wire act balanced with astonishing dexterity by Junot D&iacute;az.  If he has a misstep it is in the denouement, which is rather sudden and slightly lacking in clarity for an otherwise thorough novel.  Nonetheless, I loved, loved, loved this book.  And, naturally, I highly recommend it.
I loved the way the inner life of the characters unfolded, revealing so much through action and reaction. And the environment, the mis en place of Western Australia, added to the sense of place and time these characters lived in, as they struggled to find their place in the world, and with one another.

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a "dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first?

While reading the story I kept finding myself thinking of an old black and white Bogart movie. The story's plot while compelling starts out slowly. It then draws you in with its building suspense and with a colorful dialogue. The dialogue is very much in keeping with era of the roaring twenties and topics of the times. The story of the massacre is a mystery within this mystery and then the mystery of the dead girls all add to spell the author builds around the reader drawing us in. The character of David starts out as the typical cynical newspaper reporter who is looking to write a good story while at the same time trying to deny who he is inside. While the character of Julian is more confident in who he is and what he wants. Yet even with different personalities and background come together as a pairing you are rooting for. While there are some m/m situations there is nothing that is offensive to readers in anyway.

Drummond "purchases" his love from 25 years ago from another Lord who is "selling" her, because she is baron.  Gabriella soon discovers that Drummond plans to have his way with her, sexually.  Though she is reluctant at first due to lack of experience, she soon comes to enjoy her liaisons with Drummond.  The love builds between them, with some interesting twists threatening their relationship.

9115	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Great short story about menage sex and a lot of sexual exploring by a couple.  OK, so you need to just suspend your disbelief immediately since the premise is that Hake, who has been disabled by an accident, asks his cousin and his cousin's employee, to have wild sex with his wife to make up for the fact that she hasn't been getting any lately.  Or at least, not getting anything wild and hot from Hake since his accident.
3016	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Lacey Vaughn was unlucky in love.  None of her relationships ever work out, and now she had caught her latest boyfriend Evan cheating in the shower with her friend Christy.  She didn't understand what she was doing wrong, but could only determine she must be doing something wrong in bed, and that was why she kept having relationship problems.  Her best friend, Nick Stone thought that was laughable.  He had never been intimate with Lacey, but had been in love with her for a long time, and knew she wouldn't be a terrible bed partner.  He was just glad she was finally free so he could show her how good they would be together.

But let's talk about these two crazy kids for a second. Or, well, one two hundred year old vampire and the man she finds tied to her bed. Lissianna is charmingly sheltered for being two hundred years old. With her fear of blood and her father's legacy to contend with (not to mention growing up in a time when women were expected to be sheltered), this works.

The reader of this Amanda Ronconi does a good job in providing Kaylee's voice and as a result
The Flaws: The major flaw in this book is that maybe it focuses too much on the war. What makes this series so stellar is the personal relationships between the characters, which are pushed to the side a great deal in this story. There is still a lot of talking, but it is almost completely related to the major conflict. Even at the beginning with the heartfelt reunion, the next passage moves on to the Temujai. This is not a deal-breaker but for readers who are looking for a deeper exploration into the ties that bind Horace, Evanlyn, Will, and Halt, they will be disappointed.

4850	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	CD/unabridged/Chick lit:  By the time I got through the first CD, I really hated this book.  The women were so manipulated, it made my stomach hurt.  Then by the time I got to the third CD, I really liked it.  It kinda ended up the way I thought it would, but there were points that ended up very different.
There aren't many characters.  Alice lives a secluded life with her abuser, who doesn't even appear in the text as often as you'd expect.  However, we still know him intimately.  We know him through Alice's descriptions of his abuse.  Her fear of him.  The details she slips about his life and his threats.  We even pity him, briefly, while still hating him.  In the same way, Jake is both lovable and loathable.  He's no prince charming, but he's as deeply broken as Alice and looking for any way to escape.  He's that dark part of all of us.


The story had a very smooth flow, the writing ornate in details of the scents and tastes of fresh baked lemon cake and espresso, the scent of the wooden cottage, fresh falling snow, the painted porcelain at Alice's shop and the colorful and moving stories the women shared melted my heart and made me care for the characters more than I have in a long time with a book. Mary's journey was long; her transformation was not happening overnight and with her efforts to be there for her friends who dealt with death, divorce, betrayal, heart breaks and dark secrets she slowly found the first step on the ladder of her own salvation.
Franklin's rural residents, some in abject poverty and others in comfortable homesteads, provide a colorful panorama of lives affected by civil war. Side plots involve townspeople whose lives will change forever. The grieving widow takes strength from the men who have resided within her house, however short their time. Carnton's halls are filled with activity, then abruptly emptied. But she cannot forget those who died at Carnton. She begins a correspondence with families of the dead to provide relatives with knowledge about boys they've lost, eventually leading to their reburial on her land. She wears black in memory of them all.

So other than the high school drama kind of feel and the men sounding more like women at times (ex. one of the male characters described a pushy female as a 'stanky ho'), I liked the story. I think I would have liked it a little longer but I appreciated the dialogue. It was witty with out being too sharp like a another popular shifter series that I shall not name. (Don't worry I like that series too.)

Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate crme brulee body cream souffl that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.
In all, though, I recommend this well researched book.

The problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material "productive forces" empirical observation.
Lisa, a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo, a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.

On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.

3632	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This is an autobiographic look at the war experience of a lieutenant of paratroopers serving in World War II in the famed 82d Airborne Division.  In this book, author James Megellas (a/k/a "Maggie") tells us the story of intense and almost continuous combat beginning in North Africa, continuing in Italy, and finally D-Day and the invasion of Western Europe.  The author explains that his "MOS" (Military Occupational Specialty) was simply to "Kill Germans" and that this was the real, if unofficial, job description of himself and his men.  The author makes no bones about the merciless nature of the war.  Prisoners were sometimes shot by both sides, and to say that there were hard feelings is an understatement.  This was a rough war against a competent enemy who inflicted terrible casualties on allied soldiers, who in turn gave even better than they got.

This collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Her main novels are all love stories, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment), and a biting, sharp-edged wit. But we also see her more openly comedic side ("Love and Freindship," a parody she wrote early on).


I found it odd that a very few chapters were thrown in that told the story from different viewpoints. It seemed like the entire book should have been from Johnny's point of view or have had more chapters told from various viewpoints. Those few chapters threw the book off course for short periods.

LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! From start to finish I was fascinated with all the characters in this story as well as the story itself! This author had my heart churning and emotions running wild. Lilly was an interesting character. She had such a big heart and although she was a strong woman, she struggled with feelings of inferiority. Never wanting to hurt anyone's feelings she holds a lot inside. Case is a wonderful hero. Strong, tender, protective. Always knows what to do. His playful ways draw you in. I loved how the author handled the situation in this story of a believer falling for an unbeliever. There is no preaching here but a quiet faith that gets the message across. The romantic tension in this story had so much electricity that I could practically read it without the light on. I loved ALL the interaction between Lilly and Case. I also loved Case's family. You meet his brothers Zane and Jude and his sister Haven. They are all strong and funny and you warm to them instantly. You also meet Case's parents, Grace and Preston. Grace is a wonderful woman who keeps everyone in line. This is Book 1 in the Twisted Roots series. The next book out will be Zane's story and I am really looking forward to that! Great job Carie. I highly recommend this story. It's one I will definitely read again and again.

I really loved this book, enough to make me very interested in looking out for more of Diaz's work. It was a wonderfully written novel, filled with interesting characters and a funny, tragic, action-filled plot that has some in it that would grab any reader and teach them something, too, inadvertently or not. I don't know that I would have even thought about looking into the history of the Dominican Republic if I hadn't picked up this novel. I'd recommend it to just about anyone.

Ms. Feehan, I love your work, but please bring back more of the heart of the story - the characters, the teamwork, and making us care about what is going on, and making us mad at the bad guys and want to HELP the Ghostwalkers.
I would recommend it to classic mystery readers, recommend against it for those who want real action and a feel of violence. Those who have not established a commitment will have to judge for themselves how a rather slow moving story would appeal to them.

This book in particular kept me guessing and kept me on my toes. It was that delicious combination of sexiness, humor, mystery, and paranormal that lands right on my ultimate sweet spot. I am ignoring all of my books on my to-read shelf to plow through this series. This book was a bit meatier than the one before it and I have ridiculously high hopes for the next in the series.
The story begins in 1856 and jobs for women are sparse and hard-to-find.  After the death of her overbearing and drunk husband, Eli Barton, Jessica knows she must take her three children and run.  Eli's mother is wealthy and wants to give a home to the 3 girls - without their mother.

Stevic!! He came in with a bang. He is a strong character and his love for his daughter is beyond realistic. He reminds me of Liam Neeson in Taken, but without all of that ass-kicking.

The goal Dave Ramsey wants to help you reach is that pinnacle experience of being really, really wealthy -- so you can spend your time Purchasing, Investing, and Giving.  "If you will live like no one else, later you can live like no one else."  Live frugally now so you can whoop it up later.  Linking that philosophy to scripture is a mistake -- a mistake that many Christian denominations are diving into when they offer Ramsey's... oops, I mean !Dave's!...

But while Junot Diaz's long-awaited THE BRIEF WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAO is romantic in its own way, this book is anything but typical.
Mark has made a descending parabola from the first books in which he appeared. He is still handsome and loved, but he starts to feel the weight of his age. First he had to prove himself having first a threesome and than a foursome with his partner and two very young actor (Acting 2). The he had to be sure of Jack's undying love for him, and to do so, he involved Jack and his partner Adam in another foursome with Steve (Action 3). Actually, this last experiment, other than confirming him that he has a lot of men loving him, served to Mark to convince him that he is still desirable, same reason why he started to modelling at the age of 38. After a youth and young age spent trying to force himself to love women, Mark now seems to not have boundaries, he is becoming all gay, and a bottom, arriving to refuse to top in bed. He has still big issue of self-esteem, and sex is the only way for him to bond people to him. It's not a chance that everytime he fights with Steve, he then enticed him to bed parading himself all naked in front of his lover.

The love scenes, of course, are very HOT, but honestly I knew they would be from other things I read of Tymber's. The most surprising part of the book was how well written the book was.

Together they sort out her pack's wrongness and become enamored with each other.  I love a story that meets out justice and has a good romance.  This story does it all.

They all looked intriguing, but I decided to download this one to my Kindle and started reading right away. I became so engrossed in the story that I began listening to it while driving (wish more Kindle books had the text to speech option!), and I soon found myself taking the long way home just to see what happened next. Would Bennie be killed by the young cop? Was Alice really her twin? Did Alice actually kill Valencia? What exactly was wrong with her mother, and what was the secret she was hiding? Along with the suspense were stories of love and "rightness" such as the scenes of Mary and her family. Then too, there were scenes of harshness, avarice, and pure meanness.

6856	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This novel was so emotionally moving my heart literally ached. I loved medieval stories that are well told. And this one has a fantasy twist that makes it that much more fun. Reading about knights and castles are always enjoyable novels for me. Bottom line...Woman of Honor is a well-told, emotionally gripping story. I was literally swept away into the battle scenes, the romance, the fierce loyalty and honor even if it went against matters of the heart. I nearly cried several times while reading this story and was so engrossed a bomb could have gone off outside and I would've kept reading. I am eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. And anyone who has a computer can read this book. While it may not be a print book yet and can only be read in e-book format, it's well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My heart is still pounding. And don't let that sweet rating fool you. There was some serious passion in this novel, but if you were to compare it to most romances I guess it was sweet since the characters honored each other's purity. But it still sizzled. And talk about an ending that leaves you begging for more. Sheesh! But it was more than satisfying. I'm just glad that April is only a few months away.
Unable to go on after her loss, Mary was urged by her mother to join a knitting circle in Providence. The idea seemed absurd to her since she didn't even know how to knit, but she decided to go, unsure of what to do next once she was there. Welcomed by Alice, Harriet, Scarlett, Lulu, Beth and Ellen, she quickly found a spot for herself trying to live her day one moment and one knot at a time. The therapeutic qualities of focusing on knitting those tiny little knots relived her mind and heard for her devastating loss. Instead of slowly losing herself in the inky depths of the black hole her heart felt she found purpose in knitting and talking to the women. Each one as it turned out had her own dramatic tale, reminding Mary that people are more similar than different. As she cracked her hard shell exterior to these women their tales of sorrow made her heart come to life, she felt the need to be there for them even if her own life was slowly unraveling, her work being difficult to do, her hair and clothes no longer important, her husband coming home later and later...

Briggs is a new-to-me author, and I was immediately drawn into her world. Anna is a survivor, and you cannot help but feel for what she has gone through. Her strength has enabled her to adapt and to survive against the odds, especially since she has been given so little information about werewolf customs and history. Most of what she has been told has been inaccurate. And who wouldn't fall for Charles? He is fiercely protective of Anna, which I love! He is a little bit thrown by his feelings for Anna, and he grapples with these new emotions. I love Anna's cheekiness and how she likes to show Charles a little defiance, which sounds like something that he is not used to!! I wouldn't expect her to have so much sass, not after all the abuse she has suffered, so it is a credit to her character. It was nice to see their relationship develop, but it also frustrated me because they frequently failed to read each other correctly which created a lot of angst!
About the book: Is fast paced but it has parts where it goes out of reality. That doesn't mean is a bad book but the best of this "trilogy" was the second book, which I read first. "Fatal Secrets"

6583	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I love the concept of this book. The idea of people grouping together to survive has always held my interest. However, there were a few places that need to be fixed. I was a little turned of by the fact the teens and adults seemed to pair up, exclusively. Every adult was paired with a teen, and I can't remember any paired with other adults. Why didn't the handyman and the farm lady get together? Nope, both got with teens. Another thing is the fact that all the things and people they needed seemed to crop up just when they needed it. They needed to build, oh, look, a handyman. Someone is hurt, here's the doctor. Everything is in order, we should build a democracy, oh, and here's the army to help. This book is what I would class as fantasy survival, because they don't really have to survive much. They seem to have everything they need, even solar panels and seeds to grow food. I did like the ending, but I hated the fact that Mike let his leadership go after he made all the decisions that kept everyone from killing each other.

Sara & Wyatt spent a week together in the past, at which point Sara skipped out & they haven't seen each other since.  This story starts with Wyatt finding her a year later & only covers a little over a 24 hour period.  While we weren't there for their initial "getting to know each other", the author did a good job of bringing the reader up to speed & establishing the connection that was still there.  Is it realistic for two people to care deeply & possibly be in love after only a short week in the past?  Of course not, but if I'm reading a vampire novel, honestly, I'm not looking for or expecting reality.  The ending wasn't a happy "ever after", but a happy for now & lets see where this leads us.



Take away the adults.  Better yet, eliminate the known world.  A whole camp of children forced to survive on their own.

If this were the first Garwood book I'd ever read, I'd've simply dismissed it as a generic piece of romance fluff and I would not have bothered to look the author up again. But I know what this author is capable of and I am severely disappointed because I know she can write better than this.

2328	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	Muddled. The idea of developing multiple plotlines in parallel has been attempted by some serious authors many times but this go around misses the mark. It takes way too long to establish what the various sects are up to and the reveal is underwhelming.
1873	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Well, following other reviewers on Amazon who have proven the thoughtful equals of Banville's own intelligent fiction makes my own comments rather anti-climactic. I'm glad I hadn't read the summary or the comments before I opened Shroud--warning: major plot spoilers abound! Suffice it to say that David Lehman's "Signs of the Times" on the late 1980s Paul deMan revelations, while not receiving explicit credit in the author's notes, can shed light on the inspiration for Banville, much as the Blount spy episode does for The Untouchable, which pairs neatly with this novel as two portraits of unlikeable but captivating men that Banville sketches not with a righteous incrimination but a humanist compassion as he seems to report rather than construct their tales. No other comments have appeared on the triptych-like structure of the novel, so about this I will add a few words.

But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.

The main difficulty comes in applying what you learn here.  As the author acknowledges, sometimes it's hard to assess whether it's really your intuition talking to you, or whether it's your own desires or fears you're hearing in your head.  Also, she notes you should use intuition, logic and common sense to make your best choices, but in some instances the 3 don't agree, making your decision more difficult.

Written about 1910, about a year before he died, Wallace Wattles sums up all he has learned about the methods of obtaining wealth. About the age of thirty, struggling to feed his family, Wallace seeks to find the answer of why some people are poor and others are not. The book shares his findings. This was the book that the DVD "The Secret" was based on.  The basic principles given by Wattles are very similar to present day prosperity writers.  The book is short and easy to read.  Other good books on the topic are "Law of Attraction" and "Ask and It is given" by Esther Hicks and "The Greatest Secret" (Internet book) by Darell Daybre
However, there are some weak points present in Jacobsen's work. Few scriptures are provided to back up his points, and single verses at times serve as the foundation for suppositions that are widely divergent from those held by the majority of the body of Christ. For instance, he posits that believers no longer need to fear God, but a brief survey of the word `fear' as used throughout the New Testament would display that the matter of fearing God is not as one-sided as presented here. Scripture speaks to the fear of God in a believer's life, as well as fear not being present in perfect love. All instances of the term `fear' need to be taken into account to form a balanced view of God's thoughts on the matter. Jacobsen's beliefs regarding sin should also be closely compared with scripture; it seems that they may ultimately lead to the doctrine of complete sanctification within this life when followed to their logical conclusion. Readers will need to proceed with discernment, eating the meat and spitting out the bones.

Well, one thing for sure: if he does succeed in "getting out alive", all Hell will definitely break loose and he'll have made Hades, the Lord of the Dead himself, into an immortal enemy.

I would say it's a tale of survival, but at the same time it's not. It's not the perfect story of being able to overcome a situation, but the ending is satisfactory to my standards. This was really eye-opening and kind of scary. It seems like one of those books that parents and adults would not want their kids reading because it's SO true and parents want to protect their kids at all costs. However, I would say that this could be used as a learning tool between parents and kids to show that kids should never talk to strangers and should stay together as a group. Really good book, and definitely pretty dark. I'm going to need a light read after this to brighten my reading mood because this got me pretty down.

Especially interesting was how the colonial areas were settled from 1500-on, and how the disputes with the English, French, Dutch, and native American tribes were all interwoven before the War of Independence. Very interesting information on charters and what part they played in the settlement of New England's colonies.

That intersection is first expressed in the chief character, born into a wealthy and powerful English family in Malaya of a Chinese mother and English father.  In essence this book thus becomes a tale of the many conflicts between Western and Eastern values and philosophies, exemplified in part by his English father and Chinese grandfather.  Western values are derived from the Old Testament order that man (not woman or other species) should control the Earth and resulted in European colonization and exploitation of much of the rest of the world.  The Asian value system in this novel is expressed in the character of Endo, the Japanese sensei, who becomes the mentor and friend of this confused English-Chinese teenager, teaching him the martial arts, discipline and philosophy which will allow him to become a strong man.  This value system honors both duty and compassion, a duality of sometimes conflicting elements.

Levin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.

I would like to excuse all this by the fact that the author was born in Europe and so came to English as a second language.  But the biography indicates that a lot of writing has been done since then, so one would assume that a better grasp of the English language would have taken place at some time.  My husband came to this country at the age of 40 with six languages in his grasp, and, although he is not an author, his writing (when he does it) is absolutely correct.  Hmm.  Maybe I should hand him a few plots and see what he can do with them.  It couldn't be worse than this book.
In the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side.

Four of these are Phillip Marlowe adventures, all written before the novels.  Of these, "Goldfish" and "Trouble is My Business" truly stand out.

Each of these three stories feature a very obvious antecedent to Phillip Marlowe.

However, due to the way that it is written, I did not develop any kind of attachment to any of the main characters. This book is basically written as a narrative of events that happened, reminding me of a fictional history book. The book also gets very technical about its development of the space drive and weapons.  Liked it, didn't love it. Will buy the next one to see what happens.
To also add complications to his life, he is a new werewolf who has little control over the sensations and transformations that come along with being one. The most disrupting of the traits is that Jake Romero is Remi's mate. Everybody has a mate, the one person in the world that complements that person in every possible way. Even though Remi is straight, being near Jake arouses him and overwhelms him with emotions that he not only has no control over, but which he doesn't understand.

So you see the author is not attempting to rewrite Pride and Prejudice or give it a sequel. Even if you are critical when it comes to fiction about Jane Austen or Pride and Prejudice, I think you will enjoy this book emensely.  I will issue a warning that some of the language and the style are not like that of Jane Austen. I enjoyed how even though the two main characters met on a ship, certain events or converstations took place that also took place in Pride and Prejudice. For example, the discussion of an "accomplished lady," or Charles Bingley's letting of Netherfield Park.
But you know what? Overall, I did enjoy reading the book. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it a lot. I sort of wish I hadn't even spent 99 cents on it, but it is what it is. There is definite sexual chemistry for all you smut lovers out there, but there isn't a ton of sex...this isn't Black Dagger Brotherhood, after all. But it's probably still up your alley. I did like the twist Sands puts on how the vampires came into existance in the first place.  Either it's been so long since I read the other book that I had forgotten, or it isn't mentioned in that one at all.  Either way, it was news to me, and pretty fascinating to boot.  I like when an author mixes a bit of cultural legend with fiction.  The writing was funny and engaging as well, and yes, it was meant to be a comedy, because it did get quite a few lulz out of me. But I can definitely tell there have been improvements between books 1 and 4. I might even still read the others....someday.

Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte is a fantastic book with lava-hot sex and characters who quickly realize that what they're feeling is a lot more than mere lust. Gage and Hailey are immensely likeable because both have trouble talking to the opposite sex and both have trouble with relationships. Their imperfections make readers really care about their budding relationship. I love that they feel like they're addicted to each other. Enjoying the Show is extremely well-written and believable, and readers will love seeing Hailey and Gage explore their feelings for each other. Gage is caring and sexy, Hailey is friendly and intelligent, and while neither is perfect (and who would want them to be?), they're dynamite together. Very highly recommended.

5683	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Although this continuing saga of the Ghost Walkers has some of Feehan's usual action, the plot is extremely convoluted and depressingly (as well as descriptively) gory. Perhaps if Feehan had devoted more pages to plot development rather than repetitious sex scenes, I would have given the book the 5 star rating I gave the other books in the Ghost Walker series. For some reason, Feehan has given Kadan Montague, whom I have always considered to be one of the "rocks" of the team, a weird obsessive compulsion to stake his claim on Tansy, regardless of the location or who is present. While the book is still an okay read, it definitely is not one of Feehan's best.
Sure, it might be a little slow in parts, but that's part of world building and character development and all that jazz.  I'd give this book a look because I think if you like good fantasy you'll like this.

1860	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Like many others, I've always been fascinated by the story of Eva Braun, but (maybe because I'm Jewish) was also afraid to really take a good look.  It's part of a horrifying story for a Jew, but I was drawn to this book specifically because it purported to be a "fictionalized" version of a (probably mostly) true story.  That kind of made it more neutral for me.  What I didn't expect was to come away with some sympathy for Eva; the author revealed aspects of her life with Hitler that show her to be something of a victim and a prisoner herself.  After all, once involved with this monster, she was not able to be free; she couldn't even leave her home alone, ever - she was always under guard.  And the author also brings up the fact that Hitler wouldn't marry her publicly...she was always described as his "friend" or his "secretary."  In that time, in Europe, it was something of a disgrace to be a mistress, with no hope of marrying the man who had ruined your reputation.  So that Eva was placed in a humiliating position.  In  other words, this is as much a feminist novel as one about an evil society (which it also is; very, very subtly elaborated as the story unfolds). Another surprise was to find that I identified with Eva in some respects.  For example, the author describes her as a "fashion addict," a shopaholic; all she ever thought about was what she would wear next.  And Eva would often change her clothing several times a day.  This vanity - this character defect  of  placing appearances above other values - is found among women everywhere, trained to use appearance to compete for men's attentions.  Eva is depicted as shallow and uninterested in anything other than being Hitler's lap dog.  This made her an object of scorn in the novel - but also a forgiveable, if weak, type of woman common to every culture.  I found myself unable to put the book down, and I admired the writing, which was, as one reviewer said, perfectly "creepy" - as if the storyteller were whispering a horror tale.  There are many insights about the times, the protagonists, including Hitler, Eva and Hitler's stooges.  As another reviewer has mentioned, one thinks about this book long after putting it down.

835	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I so very much enjoy this series. The Sisterhood can get away with anything. They seek out revenge on behalf of those that have been SERIOUSLY wronged from others. It's almost a female vigilante group. It can be mental, physical or emotional payback. This was pretty hard core. Wouldn't everyone just once in their life want to get back to someone if they could. This is a way we can pretend to just do that. Wonderful book and so fun to read. It was also very emotional and powerful story regarding love and loss.

I started this book right before bed thinking I would only read a few pages before falling asleep. I couldn't put it down and read it right through.

Author Lora Leigh unveils a unique story with her own version of sexy vampire lore in Knight Stalker.  In this complex tale the humans are hosts to off world symbiots and it is these `others' who require blood, through their hosts.  Cadan is an embattled hero both internally and externally, trying to always do the right thing.  He wants to keep Bliss out of it all, but how do you walk away from the person who's the perfect partner?  Bliss is frightened and thrilled by Cadan's attention.  She's trying to be logical but running on emotions and a strong sexual pull.

Bottom line:  While the story will keep your attention, none of the characters are subtle enough to capture your emotions; they are stylized shadows which at times fail to elicit much response other than a shrug and a turn of the page.  The literary style fails to recreate a feel for ancient times, rather it attributes modern day sensibilities to otherwise primordial savages.  I don't know if I will read the second volume of this trilogy unless I could again listen to it while I engaged in something physically challenging.

The h does nothing to redeem herself throughout the story and goes from one scrape to the next. It takes way too much of a leap of imagination to understand the H falling in love with her.

For the right-hand section, the action fades and after what for me was the climactic revelation around page 150, the remaining section is prepared for by: "The year and I are both declining; there is a chill in the air." (177) With part three, the last sixty pages present more of a diminishing presence of all of the main characters. This last section, however, in its deliberately blurred and less substantially rendered details, involved me less than it could have. Death in Turin rather than Venice, yes, but again this morbidity shrouds the last segment in shadows more than sun. I see here the momento mori, the aging and contorted figures, the skulls and the devils awaiting below the ledge. If the opening of the book recalls Beckett, the end summons up the aftermath of another revelation--Greta to Gabriel, from Joyce's "The Dead." For the protagonist of Banville's study, he is doomed to live on in a world of increasing gloom, descending while still alive into the Hades of his own making, and of what he has been made into by the ghosts of the last century. (P.S. See also my reviews of "Eclipse" and "Ancient Light." These overlap with Axel Vander, Cass, and her father Alex Cleave's story.)

I liked the updated characters and situations.  My only grievance would be that both Max and Jane are unlikable once in a while as the characterization goes too far.  However, by the end, you so wanted to be there at the dinner party to see the looks on the family's faces for real.  I liked the way JR and Isabelle were worked into the story and Pris was just as frustrating as in the original.  I did love her cougar tendencies!  Highly recommend this one - it's a fast read and a nice change of pace.

The core focus of this political persuasion is on "the worker". It evolved from a prior eternity of monarchs dominating the poor and a response to the scourge of serfdom. Ultimately, Lenin used "The Communist Manifesto" as a means of promoting the Russian Revolution which ultimately became the cultural horror which the rest of us came to know as The Soviet Union. In other words, it provided the basis for a ploy on the part of the Bolsheviks (Communist Party).

I would definitely continue reading the series if I could get it for free, or only a couple of bucks each. The good guys are good, the bad are very bad, and there are some very normal people who have some good days and some problem times. The main characters are likable. The adventures fit the general mold of young people trying to save the world, or at least their part of it. Companions on a quest kind of thing. The series is oriented toward a teen audience, but that's about the level of complexity that  my mind has attained to in my sixty-eight years.
I thought the book was brilliant. Oscar Wao is an overweight oddball kid who loves science fiction and reading is obsessed with finding a girlfriend and losing his virginity. He seems inept at both. As much as we, the readers, grow to love Oscar and see him as the good-hearted and special man that he is, he is mistreated by so many others and ostracized by others for his eccentricities. He is not recognized for the diamond that he is except by his family, and especially his sister Lola and her sometimes boyfriend Yunior.

THE FIELD describes how scientists have gradually become aware of what appears to be a unifying energy structure in our universe. This "Zero Point Field" provides us with a simpler explanation for how things work than previous overly-complex ideas require. Simplicity in science is a good thing, because it generally indicates which theories will win out as time goes by. The Zero Point Field theory demonstrates it's elegant simplicity by allowing physicists to derive the famous equation F=ma (rather than take it as a starting assumption), and by helping medical practitioners understand the underlying scientific basis for homeopathy.
Chapters 16, 17, and 18 also include stories about participants in the Lincoln County War, so it is hard to disagree with the commercial.

Hough took Garrett to visit Fort Sumner and Pete Maxwells House, and Garrett told exactly how his final encounter with Billy the Kid went down as he was at the scene.  Quien Es?

Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.

Why is it banned? The whole book is child abuse and repeated rape. Nothing is presented to be titillating or erotic, rather it will disturb you. Disturb you to want to do something to prevent this from happening to any child.

With This Ring is the sweet continuation of Ryan and Josh's story.  Getting married on New Year's Eve would be romantic anyway, but with these two it's a guaranteed aww!  I really like Ryan and Josh, and reading more about how their relationship progresses to marriage is enjoyable.  There's a particularly cool secondary character, one of Ryan's older relatives, who I liked a lot.  Garrett and CJ from TA Chase's Love of Sports series make a cameo appearance, and Kasey and Gram are mentioned, which is fun if you've read those books as well.  With This Ring doesn't feature a lot of conflict, but it's a nice holiday read with enough sweetness to brighten a gloomy day.

There is a good story within this book, unfortunately it's hampered by way too many obstacles which bog down the plot line, an overabundance of bad communication between characters (to the point where I almost put the book down because they were annoying me so much with their ridiculousness), and ludicrous turn-arounds from several of the side characters who suddenly start behaving supportive without any explained motivation. That being said; I did adore Lord Nathan and the end of his story was immensely satisfying. I just wish that Lady Iona and her family hadn't been so ridiculously eye-roll worthy.

Jo Banks is a ghost exterminator going through an identity crisis.  She's been able to see ghosts since the age of six which definitely throws her into the weirdo category.  After years of longing to be normal, she desperately embraces the anti-normal by going Goth, except that doesn't really fit in with her tall playboy bunny body, blonde hair, and pixie like facial features either.  When she's hired by Wyatt Haines, the stuck up arrogant and hauty owner of a succesful chain of inns, the sparks start to fly.  Wyatt has recently purchased an old Victorian home but everytime he's attempted renovations, something unexplainable happens and the contruction workers end up walking off the job.  Not a believer in ghosts, but desperate to try anything, he lets his secretary hire a ghost exterminator, only when he meets "Commando Barbie," he can't help but show his disdain.  On the flip side, Jo only sees a stick up his butt and treats him equally as bad.  Believer or not, she was hired to do a job, and she plans on finishing it.  When she sees the house, she's knows there's more to it than your typically haunting but she proceeds to free the spirits from the house, only something goes horribly wrong and some of the spirits end up inside Wyatt.  Never having something like this happen before, Jo and Wyatt cannot separate until they figure out how to remove the ghosts from his body, determine what is keeping ghosts in his home, and release them from this world.

This is a great book (along with all his others) that will help anyone at any stage in their financial journey turn things around or take it to the next level. He covers everything from myths about debt and pitfalls to avoid to paying off your mortgage, the famous debt repayment snowball, and also giving back(which he makes it a point to cover in all his books).Highly recommend

Sure, you're going to get politics here (and in-depth analyses you just won't find elsewhere), but you also will find an incredible array of diaries covering everything from issues of national and international import to touching personal stories. For example, I started my day out today reading "In Honor of My Departed Friend: A Brief Tale of Love and Loss," Redstateresident's loving and beautiful tribute to his dog Mobley who just passed away. (Having old dogs myself, Mobley's story really touched my heart.) Diverse people write about what they are passionate about, and so you get a wide array of well-researched, well-written information. Some are super-serious, some are laugh-out-loud funny. Kind of like Keith Olbermann...who occasionally pops into the mix.

  There can be no doubt of the accuracy of Levin's argument. The problem of "Men In Blsck" lies in Levin's adoption of certain cases and movements as evidence. For example, Levin chastises the  Court for holding that burning the American flag is protected under the First Amendment. Well, I consider myself a conservative - and I agree with the Court. There are simply some issues that resonable people can disagree on, but Levin doesn't seem to allow that latitude. This is regrettable, because generally Levin's arguments are strong. Likewise, Levin allows himself to get wrapped up in Roe v. Wade and the entire abortion issue. There are many people, like myself, who believe that the legal reasoning in Row v. Wade is lacking, if not entirely non-existent. Yet it is possible at the same time for even conservatives to believe the ultimate holding is correct. In fact, I know that I am not alone in believing that abortion does constitute the taking of a human life, but that government has absolutely no right to dictate what a woman may do with regard to her own body. In other words, Roe v. Wade is simply not a good way to illustrate the truth of Levin's theme that "the Supreme Court is destroying America." It is: but Roe v. Wade is not likely to get the majority of people to agree with that premise.

In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.

Quick plot summary: Traum-repressed wereGirl travels to the Yukon to join her sister's pack after running away from all things wolf for 7 years following a trauma.  She passes out (chemical imbalance from being a loner) in the arms of her sister's Beta, who happens to be her mate.  She freaks and resists, but he is very patient and understanding (to a fault, but I guess it's a Beta thing) while she figures it out.  Meanwhile, she is randomly selected to join in the Werewolf equivalent of the Olympic games, sort of, which is a team sport.  Of course her mate was selected, too.  They learn about each other while on this hiking, puzzle-solving, racing, canoeing adventure.  He remains patient and eventually helps her reveal her trauma (was attacked by her former pack), thus releasing her wolf, and the hero gets the girl and lives happily evetr after.

It is a wonderful story of three women, each trying to come to terms with life and its vicissitudes, given their own needs, desires, and circumstances, as well as the nature of the time in which they lived.

Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.  Despite his disability, Scott is more than capable of taking care of both himself and the woman he loves.

Sacred Fate is a "modern" romance (man on man pair, male pregnancy...) with an old fashioned development (the damsel in distress, the knight in shining armour, even a bit of cinderfella...); for this reason I think can appeal to a lot of readers, but obviously not if you have something against you men having a bit of female inside.

It looks closely at his life both from childhood right up to his death in Dachau concentration camp - the ultimate price paid for humiliating Hitler. Likewise, it looks closely at those who surrounded Litten, and the consequences of their association with him. To give him credit, Hett (the author) did a fantastic amount of research for the book, basing the arguments he provides largely on documented historical fact, backing it up with notes at the end citing the exact references.

I thought Kentucky Woman wonderfully portrays the struggles of a single parent in a realist fashion that many can relate to.  Alexis was a woman who was determined to provide the very best for her son; however, she wasn't willing to settle for anything just to stay ahead of the game.  She carefully weighed out all of her options before she agreed to marry Jack.  Jack had a compassionate nature.  When it came to Alexis, he was very protective and wouldn't allow any harm to come to her.  The only problem that both Jack and Alexis possessed was the fear of rejection, and because of this fear neither was willing to publicly admit the love for one another.  I really enjoyed the interaction between the couple has they battled to build a relationship beyond their hurtful past experiences.

I read a lot of thrillers and a lot of YA. I thought I'd probably have read this story before, wondered how this author would approach the topics of child abduction, molestation, rape, imprisonment. Suffice to say that Scott was master of the task. The life of Alice in Ray's prison was hell and terror, fright and pain. She was starved, abused, beaten and repeatedly forced to sexual surrender to a man who was himself abused by a sexual sadist (his mother). Alice no longer hopes for release or for any other life, that dream has been destroyed along with her girlhood. As she grows from a child of 10 to a teen of 15, Ray no longer is happy with her body or her attitude. He wants a new girl and has assigned Alice to help him acquire her. Alice is powerless to resist, beaten down by 5 years of submission and only longs for the substitute to release her from this bond. She can't say NO. The new girl has been chosen and then what will happen to Alice? The last Alice was killed, and yet, that is a release of sorts. No one sees, no one hears, no one there to help.
This book quickly evolves into two complete stories.  Will and Evanlyn's tale in Skandia is bleak and hard as they're put into slavery after a harsh voyage.

Seems like everywhere Will and Halt go they're forging new bonds, taking on new responsibilities.  But that's just fun!

Lynne Maris's TAMED delves into what is normally considered a huge taboo - the student/teacher love affair.  Add a BDSM angle and this is one smoldering story that I couldn't resist.  Katrina's harbored her feelings for Derek for years and they've only grown stronger over time.  Derek's careful to keep from crossing over the line with Katrina even though it's obvious that he does feel something for her.  Once they're safely disguised though they're free to act on their impulses - even if he isn't 100% positive that the woman dressed as Kitty is his `Kat.'  TAMED is fast past, full of emotional turmoil and lots of hot sweaty sex and rather interesting use of adult `toys.'

Quick bedroom read!!
The plot moves along at a good pace, with the back-story presented in such a way that it does not interfere with the action; and there is a great deal of action.  The battles are bloody and messy; and one thing leads to another with vengeance. The quest to find the missing Lord of Dor becomes the desperate need to stem an otherworldly invasion which will plunge the world into darkness should evil prevail.

A Cinderella Story had all the ingredients of the original version but came to life into a twenty first century happy ever after fairy tale. From two lazy daughters from the step-mother's side, to the hardworking princess, fairy god mother, the ball and yes, the glass slipper.

- The more I read, the more I liked the tone of the narration. James is honest and intelligent, and there's something rather charming about his resigned attitude toward life. Lanyon also captures the obsession of a scholar very well: when James starts looking at an antique book or manuscript, he completely loses touch with the outside world.

Now Tribe A decides, due to its higher productivity/wealth, it can afford to save more time, adding this saved time to the saved time it used for making fishing nets, and build a boat that will allow their nets to catch even more fish. Being busy building boats, Tribe A allows Tribe B to build the nets--a less productive venture than the new boat-building venture is. Tribe A's greater productivity thanks to fishing boats (and greater wealth thanks to fishing boats) allows for more children, increasing the tribe's population, allowing for a larger labor supply in the near future that will be available for procuring other innovative, labor-saving inventions.

6118	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Right now I'm rereading Karen Rose's Have  You Seen Her?  It's romantic suspense at it's best, with a dark overtone.  SBI agent Steven Thatcher (who was introduced in earlier books) is floundering.  He has a case that involves young teenage girls that go missing from their beds.  And they're turning up dead, and noone seems to know anything.  According to the feedback he's getting, these girls would never have willingly left their homes with anyone.  He's hitting a wall, and more girls are going missing...His home life is quickly spiralling out of his control, too...his 17 year old son is suddenly flunking classes in school, sullen and sneaky...his youngest son, who was kidnapped in a previous book, still won't sleep in his own bed and is just getting so he'll allow himself to be touched again...and Steven's Aunt is determined to fix him up with a woman.  In the midst of all this, Steven meets Jenna Marshall.  Dr. Jenna Marshall, actually~~his 17 yr. old son's Chemistry teacher, who is very concerned with Brads decline in grades and attitude.  The attraction is mutual, and immediate.  But how will Steven find the time for this when his plate is already full?  This is an awesome story, and if you're a romance fan, or a fan of suspense, don't miss it!!  It's loosely connected to Karen's other books, but every one is stand alone and not to be missed.  Her new book, Count To Ten is due out soon, and I can't wait!!

The interactions and development of the characters were very believable. I highly recommnend this terrific read.

The younger son had previously had to grow up fast and act like a man.  In this story he is acting more his actual age and can be somewhat annoying in his immaturity.  But I guess I have to be annoyed with men in general who turn totally stupid in the presence of a pretty woman.  Thank goodness for the men with experience and brains in the family.  Mr. Shaye sure does a good job of raising boys - gun toting rep. or not.
Tribe A saved more by looking for food less, placing that saved time into creating a net that would increase the catch of fish. We can say that Tribe A has a greater productive edge than does Tribe B, whose members are still using sharpened sticks to catch fish--very laborious and relatively unproductive.

As someone else commented: why would the author even involve the ex's in this story if the situations weren't going to be resolved.  That was very annoying.  He just wanted her to trust him on things and accept, but what he was asking was what she had lived with all her life and she didn't want a life like that.
Book one book did a pretty fair job setting up Catrin as a character in my mind. For a female MC, she is very relate-able and can be tough if the situation calls for it- though she has her annoying moments (as do all book characters at one point or another.) She was interesting and I enjoyed watching her grow throughout the book as she adjusted to all the new changes in her life. While some aspects of the book progressed too quickly, others lagged. But for the most part, it was well- paced and I enjoyed the new characters and places as they were introduced. I especially loved the world created by the author. Very original with an interesting blend of dark and light. Fantasy characters are always a joy to read about, and these characters were no exception. I may have had a small problem really clicking with the supporting characters, but I still enjoyed them.
And boy oh boy does this book have sharp elbows. It is a bitter little pill of a novel. Just like its main character, it resists sympathy and identification. Enright uses fantasy, disjointed narrative, unpleasant people doing unpleasant things-- pretty much every device that you can imagine to force the reader back outside the text. It makes for such a strange combination because she writes with such lyrical prose and such a delicate hand that you expect to find the book yielding. The contrast is very interesting, but in the end I am not sure how successful The Gathering really is-- largely for that reason.

Much of this novella hinges on a very epic battle that reminded me so much of the awesome battle scenes on screen in the Lord of the Rings movies.  Those were amazing scenes, and Thayer aptly paints a riveting picture of a very different battle raging, in this novella, at the gateway as warriors fight to close the portal and keep evil at bay.  Some will perish, some will triumph, and some will get away in this awesome fantasy novella that sets the stage for the full novels in the series.  Based on this novella alone, I'd be more than willing to try the first novel in the series, even though I'm not really much into fantasy, as it were.

So you see the author is not attempting to rewrite Pride and Prejudice or give it a sequel. Even if you are critical when it comes to fiction about Jane Austen or Pride and Prejudice, I think you will enjoy this book emensely.  I will issue a warning that some of the language and the style are not like that of Jane Austen. I enjoyed how even though the two main characters met on a ship, certain events or converstations took place that also took place in Pride and Prejudice. For example, the discussion of an "accomplished lady," or Charles Bingley's letting of Netherfield Park.

My Spanish is high school level and I can only assume that much of the vocabulary he used in Spanish (and there was a fair bit) would have shocked the pantalones off my teachers.  To a non-Spanish speaker it ultimately became grating.  The political commentary was a bit heavy-handed, but did serve as a second-layer backdrop for the story.  The footnotes were too reminiscent of David Foster Wallace to feel fresh.  Good, but not great.

That this might indeed prove to be the case does not bother me in the least. However, if the concept of "interaction-at-a-distance" is to be a robust idea, then the interactive effects must be observable not just at the ZPF, or Planck level, but also must be robust above the noise level. Otherwise one could easily argue that the author's demonstration of "interaction-at-a-distance" reduces to so much trivia.
HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.

Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.  Leah Brooke is a fairly new author, but she's definitely secured herself a place on my auto-buy list.

Unlike the movie version, at the start of the story he is already a well known brigand sought by the governor and commandante.

The author spent a huge amount of time actually hanging out at the company and interviewing dozens of people to piece together the well-written account that you get here. While the author isn't afraid to criticize Facebook, this is an authorized book (though the author stresses in an interview that its content wasn't approved by the company) and one gets the sense that he was so awed by the company and the people working for it that he is a little biased towards them. But, he only gives the impression that he feels so warmly towards them because he was so impressed by them.

Diamond got started on this theory when a Papua New Guinea native asked him why the white European races had such advantages over peoples like himself, and why they acquired so much "cargo" in their cultures. As an example, Diamond points out that the Incas were captured by a handful of Spanish conquistadors, in spite of their intelligent civilization. He continues to explain his theory, in which factors such as food production, animal domestication, and differences in germs and technology cause the balance of power against a lot of aboriginal societies.

No-one does humor with the smooth natural grace that is standard inn all her novels. Her imagination and talent has created characters that have grown more defined with each addition to the Argeneau Vampire series. Going back and rereading from the beginning feels like visiting with old friends. Ms Sands continues to deliver entertainment that reaches out and grabs you from the first, providing an enjoyable escape from your cares and worries taking you to the fascinating world that she has created. I highly recommend this series for anyone looking for a fun romp through the immortal world of the Argeneau's with lots of humor, action and romance.

There was a July, May's twin sister, but she died years ago quite tragically leaving May devastated and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders and unable to cope.  The sisters convinced her to build a wailing wall in which to place the things that bother her on a piece of paper into the crevices.  June is a talented cello player and a school teacher who keeps turning down the principal's offer of marriage due to the fact that she was left at the altar years ago.  June doesn't like or trust Lily.  August is full of warmth and kindness and takes them in with open arms and teaches Lily the beekeeping business.

And ultimately the manifesto was used as a tool for a whole new group of people to enslave the same people while taking the wealth for themselves. Look at the legacy that the 20th century left us - two failed ideologies, fascism and communism. And yet when you look at the two, in practice they weren't that different. Communist Russia, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, all became totalitarian regimes under the guise that they were doing it all for the working man. That may not have been Marx and Engels' plan but that was certainly what happened and their convincing (to others that is, I certainly wasn't convinced by any of the empty arguments) arguments led millions of people to their deaths and inadvertently changed the world for the worse, hence my view that "The Communist Manifesto" is demonstrably not a great idea. Their utopia was like all utopias: a mirage and nothing more.

Doyle has become a novelist in the course of writing these three books, rather than simply the creator of brilliant dialogue within sketchy stories, as we see in the first two novels.  His writing acquires greater depth here, and his roots in this neighborhood and his identification with it are obvious.  The three novels, taken together, show the literary evolution of one of Ireland's fine modern novelists and presage Doyle's international success and his Booker Award for Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha in 1993, just two years after this novel was published. n  Mary Whipple

1232	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This is one of those books that while I didn't necessarily like the story itself, I can appreciate how the author wrote and structured it.  Personally, I am very annoyed by footnotes because they interrupt the flow of the story and lead me off on a tangent and then I have to find my way back and remember what was going on before this whole journey began.  This book is FULL of footnotes at the beginning and that just spoiled my attitude for the whole thing.  Once I passed the halfway mark, things were beginning to look up because the use of footnotes went down and the story started to bring itself together.  The characters themselves are very interesting and it'll probably help you to know that it's not narrated by the author or Oscar; most of the time, it's narrated by another character, Yunior (think Great Gatsby).  I didn't realize that until it was explicitly said around 1/3rd of the way through and that would have helped me understand what was happening so much better.  The last thing I want to mention is the history.  Some of this story takes place in the Dominican Republic and the author includes some history as well as some Spanglish.  I don't really know a whole lot about the DR except for the fact that they're on the same island as Haiti and they speak Spanish there (and I got to practice my Spanish by reading this book so that was cool!).  I found the whole history timeline to be really cool.  It's definitely good if you have a basic background knowledge of the DR but Diaz fills you in on the more specific stuff.

As the swing between the two of them, there is also a swing in the timeline of the story: two storylines, one about them at 22 years old and one 5 years after. Something happened in the middle, and little by little, the first storyline give elements to the second to reveal a very dramatic truth, probably the only sad side of the story. Other than that, the story is very sweet, and very sexy: there are some sex scene between Hayden and Josh that are really good, enough detailed but not vulgar, the main feeling I had from them it was of tenderness; in it plays one other of the change of balance between Hayden and Josh, Josh can be the more experienced of things of life but when you narrow the focus on man on man love, it's Hayden the one with the knife by the handle, Josh is a total "virgin" and he needs to be lead step by step by Hayden. It's important for Hayden, it gave him strength and courage; after this experience, nor Hayden, or Josh, or the reader, has any doubt of who the real Alpha is.

This book documents the faults of some, but neglects to cover the Big Picture. The Ruling Class and its corporate aristocracy are neglected in this book. Carr does not even hint at the powers that use and then discard politicians and front men like Billy and others. When the puppets outlive their usefulness a new cast appears in their place. That's show business. Carr gives just a hint about earlier politicians, but not much political history before the 1950s (p. 21). This book explains how the Establishment brought the drug trade to South Boston.

2089	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Anne Enright's "The Gathering" has got to be the worst ever novel to have been awarded the prestigious Booker Prize. What was the award committee even thinking of when they shortlisted it from among possibly hundreds of other worthy titles ? What could they have seen in this rather unexceptional if not downright boring tale about a large damaged Irish family that led them to name it the best work of fiction for 2007 ? The Booker has been rather erratic in its choices in recent years. Unless this trend is arrested, it will become increasingly irrelevant in influencing what serious readers will eventually read.

5011	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I had a hard time with this book.  The narrative drove me crazy.  Alex is suppose to be 29, but she comes out sounding like she's 15.  And a very spoiled, annoying 15 at that.  I also don't think I connected with her because her idea of heaven was a closest full of designer clothes and the perfect guy next door, because in Seventh Heaven you get exactly what you dreamed of.  I did like the idea of earning her right to stay in Seventh Heaven, but not much of her story made me feel like she did deserve to be there.  I did enjoy her reflections of when she realized she couldn't rely on her daddy to bail her out of trouble anymore.  And I was impressed with her desire to move to the other side of the country to make something of herself.  Overall, it was really just the main characters voice that I couldn't handle.  Not sure if I will seek out something else by this author.
The main characters, Kiran and Logan are really the Norse Gods, Loki and Baldur.  A major problem for me in the first half of the book was that I simply could not keep straight which character was which god and had what supernatural powers.  I have read Federal Tax Laws that were clearer.  While the Norse Gods concept was unique, it was also very confusing to the reader unless one was very knowledgeable about Norse mythology in the first place.  The Norse mythology was also a little too much for such a short novel because it forced the author to find a way to introduce the different Norse Gods, their different powers and relationship to each other which just led to MAJOR bewilderment.  Many times things were not clear until much later in the book when the reader was fed a little more background on the Norse mythology which then made a much prior passage make sense, somewhat, sometimes.  The story might be interesting if reread after a "cheat sheet" concerning Norse mythology is made by the reader but quite frankly I still do not think I would be any more interested in the characters or story than I was the first time around.
In the beginning, I kept hoping she would escape, but, much like Alice herself, I later saw the hopelessness of the situation, and (even though I hate myself for it) I hoped her pain would end one way or another. While wishing she would die is terrible, it really shows how horrifying her situation is.
In fact, "life's not fair" is a recurring theme, provided that you accept "unfairness" as equal parts favorable and unfavorable. Abagnale's early escapades are fueled as much by unbelievably good luck as they are by his unflappable charm, bravado, and guile. While his primary scam involved being a pilot who didn't have to fly, he also stumbled into three legitimate jobs--albiet on false credentials--first as a doctor who didn't have to practice medicine, then as a lawyer who didn't have to practice law, and finally as a professor who DID have to teach, but who didn't have to know the material especially well. But his fortune would soon change, as at the end of his five year crime spree, he couldn't hole up anywhere in the US or Europe without being recognized. Then his luck gets even worse.

Put it kindly, This book is a keeper that I will read time and time again and never tire of it! This author has a gift in crafting her story-telling with words that show you images that go straight to your heart...This is a love story that stood the test of death and grew into a lasting love this author wrote with so much passion and heart and ultimately that "essence" was reflected in her characterization of both Hero & heroine! This romance has everything, action, suspense and love story that for those who like their romance to be the sole focus in the book, then look no Further! It pleased me immensely that the romance part was not overshadowed by other plots, but was a constant presence in the book and it allowed the reader to know both hero & heroine! The emotional depth was so well crafted, I was simply "mesmerized" with each word/actins both characters executed and I was glued to the pages not wanting them to end!

Highly recommended.
In the beginning was the ...idea. That is Raymond Chandler decided that he had had enough of sweet parlor talk detectives filled to the brim with logical and deductive abilities to solve the crime, the crime of murder if you need to know, before noon and then lunch at the Savoy. Or alternatively solve the dastardly deed before dinner and then reminisce over after dinner brandies and cigars at the club. Nice stuff, nice except murder and its detection is not quite so simple and linear. In fact it is messy, daunting, and done sometimes for reasons that no logical parlor think could fathom. So Chandler once he decided that he needed to air out the room tried to give us a more realistic appraisal of what solving murder (or any crime for that matter) was all about in the real world. And more importantly what kind of guy, what kind of detective guy, and it was mostly guys in his time, could measure up to such tasks.

3103	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This book is not a straight sequel in that only one of the characters from the first book is in it for any significant portion. As I read Shoe Addicts Anonymous quite a while ago, and all the characters didn't stick in my mind, the direction if this book was not a problem. The characters don't revolve around shoes at all, except to discuss how one's shoes can help a woman feel good about herself! Seriously the story gets into more depth about mistakes women may make, choices they live with, and the decisions they face as a result. Though some of the scenarios were not typical (sleeping with a male prostitute, blackmail due to a sordid past, becoming a phone sex operator, outlandishly weird dates), all in all, readers will be able to identify with the feelings the characters expressed. From low self confidence to fear of failure or rejection to achievement at doing something well, we all have been there at one time or another.

If you like the genre, you'll like this: family, loyalty, friends, and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action, and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it.

The Story: Still far from their homeland after escaping slavery in the icebound land of Skandia, Will and Evanlyn's plans to return to Araluen are spoiled when Evanlyn is taken captive by a Temujai warrior. Though still weakened by the warmweed's toxic effects, Will employs his Ranger training to locate his friend, but an enemy scouting party has him fatally outnumbered. Will is certain death is close at hand, until Halt and Horace make a daring, last-minute rescue. The reunion is cut short, however, when Halt makes a horrifying discovery: Skandia's borders have been breached by the entire Temujai army. And Araluen is next in their sights. If two kingdoms are to be saved, an unlikely union must be made. Will it hold long enough to vanquish a ruthless new enemy? Or will past tensions spell doom for all?
There is so much here that is heart rending, and challenging; mostly for Evanline this time. We get to see who she really is as a person, not just as a princess.

Still is was a really great read and I did not put it down once I started it.

In the first half of the book, as the pilgrims set out on their quest, the surreal horror of the Black Death becomes nauseatingly real, as the bubonic plague drives whole towns to despair and sends Ockham and his band into Hell to recover the Holy Grail and thus rescue the world from this calamity. The plague is almost by definition allegorical, and these early chapters resemble Andrzej Szczypiorski's Mass for Arras in their portrayal of a world gone mad.

Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.
It's medieval days and Aislinn is seven years old but desires to be a knight and take her dead brother's place in the king's "army." Her little seven year old self takes a coach to the kingdom and presents herself to the king. She begins training to be a knight. There is math, reading and writing, horsemanship, archery, weapons, and swimming. Aislinn overcomes every obstacle in her path from a group of bully boys to an ornery horse. She makes friends with two boys, one of them the future king. As they grow up together in this school for knights, Aislinn and Prince Caelan fall in love. But Aislinn must focus on obtaining her knighthood (she is the first woman to attempt it in this kingdom) and Caelan must marry another.
There is no depth to his writing and offers no insight into James "Whitey" Bulger.  Neither does it shed light on his relationship with those who worked for him.

There's a lot here that Kerry Allen could've made into a full-length paranormal romance (and still could at any time [hint...hint]), because her take on vampires and the world they inhabit is intriguing and TRULY fresh. My only serious complaint - though perhaps unfairly, I admit - and the only thing that keeps this being a full five star read for me is the length restricts the flow of good world-building and prevents a lot of development of character - and the romantic resolution seems rushed. I believe I read at the back of the kindle edition book that this was the first in a novella trilogy. I will be looking for those. 4.5 Stars overall and again, possibly the best Novella I've read at this length.

Chandler termed this genre, as opposed to the more genteel Agatha Christy type of mystery, "realistic".  Well, that's arguable.  I don't know about you, but I don't ordinarily find dead bodies whenever I walk into an empty room, nor are the people who knock on my door likely to have guns in their hands, or even on their persons, so I question the "realistic" label.  But these stories are good fun.  The body count is rather high in most of the stories, and you can often figure out who the murderer is by eliminating the characters who get killed along the way.

I try not to read spoilers too much as I want to be surprised when I read a book, so I only glimpse at ratings.
However, I have one major reservation about this book, something that left a bad taste in my mouth when it was all over. First, let me make one thing clear. It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round; I get that. Some folks want to read fantasies about taming the bad boy, bringing the alpha male to heel, or even being submissive to a dominant man; that's their choice. What I don't like is when an author gussies it up as though they have to defend that fantasy and make it "justifiable." And that's how this book comes across, in a really big way. Kadan is extremely domineering, and while Tansy has just enough spine for the author to be able to say, "see? She's a strong woman, really she is" (as Kadan and Tansy insist on pointing out to the reader on a number of occasions), one kiss from Kadan and she becomes "pliant" and "obedient" (yes, words used within a page of one another to describe Tansy's reactions to Kadan).

Without warning Kaylee begins to tremble and sweat as panic and fear assault her senses. Deep inside she can feel the scream beginning to swell, building and pushing to break free to pierce the air. Desperate, Kaylee gasps for Emma to help her. Quickly, the two girls dash down the corridor and take refuge among the brightly colored, towering stacks of bath towels in a department store. Scared and shaking Kaylee slowly gains control, until the frail, boy in the wheel chair turns the corner. This time she cannot stop the impulse and her shockingly, loud scream reverberates through the air. A wave of tremendous sadness washes over her and tears stream down her cheeks. She falls to her knees unable to cease the deafening wail emanating from her lungs. Clawing at her throat and gasping for air until the fog appears and she falls into blackness. Frightening images flee through her mind and then she wakes to a nightmarish reality. Kaylee is restrained to a bed in a cold, windowless room. Her limbs ache and her voice is raw. Where is she?

I agree with Segwick when he says James is confident about sex - in general that's what comes off in Lanyon's books I've read so far - the scenes are part of the story, an extension of the character and the plot - not an extra thrown in to qualify for erotic.

Dialogue is spot-on, with Doyle's use of dialect controlling the pace and giving vibrancy to the story, so much so that this resembles a play as much as a novel. His focus on one Catholic family of eight people reveals the strengths which enable them to survive and even thrive.  With the pub as family's social center, we see the characters' attitudes toward sex and childbirth, their "escapes" from the workday, their daily amusements and sense of humor, and their lack of concern with the dogma of the church.  Both humorous and touching, the novel shows Doyle's growth from a writer who depends on neighborhood atmosphere, quirky dialogue, and fast-paced humor for effects to a writer who is willing to convey warmth and build sincere feeling for his characters. n Mary Whipple

One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance.  If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian.  There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive.  Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is "lustful", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered.  (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with "necking", they won't like this book.  But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)

What I like about Card is he does not claim to know all the answers but instead simply invites readers to share his journey into theological discoveries. In his introduction to The Fragile Stone, Card describes a visit to a church in Romania. There, Peter is depicted as robust, rugged, and strong. Card grew up with a different image instead of Peter. He viewed Peter as being as capable as any of us has showing impetuousness and being weak. The reality, Card goes on to contend is that Peter was far more complicated than either portrayal. While Peter certainly lived up to his title of being the Rock upon which Jesus would build the church, along with being hot-tempered and passionate, Peter also remained entirely dependent on Jesus as his Master. In trying to find a true picture of Peter, Card searched the Scriptures, as well as talked to Catholics and to Protestants. Yet Card fully admits that some of what he writes is guesses. Still, his hope remains that in gaining a better understanding Peter, we might also realize a fuller awareness of Jesus, which is the ultimate goal of every Christian.

No, it is the way the author tells us the story that is important.  Had this work been in the form of poetry we would call it an ode.  As it stands the author's prose takes us completely into the world of the book and we actually feel it as the author writes.  Even when technical aspects such as color, drawing techniques and the like are address, it is presented in an almost poetic manner.  I must admit that as to the colors used by those old monks I learned much from this essay.
James is one of the chief doctors in the emergency room at a London hospital, with a strict rule of never mixing his personal life with his work one. Until late one night a massive car accident brings an unexpected but familiar patient, his ex-wife Lorna, into the E.R. Lorna, also a doctor, but a small town GP looking for a change, was in London applying for a hospital position. With no close friends or family in the city, and in no shape to make a long journey back to Scotland James takes Lorna into his home and personally takes over her care.

For more than a generation the public has been mis-educated about the facts and meaning of Marbury v. Madison.  It is time to insist on a public discourse on these matters in order to put the role of the courts into a proper perspective.  This may seem like a change, since everyone living has been taught that the courts have the final say in our government.  This was not so prior to the mid-twentieth century and was never the intent of our Founders.

Bound by Nature is an emotional tsunami. Author Cooper Davis pulls out all the stops in this angst filled drama of lost love and heartbreak. In Bound by Nature readers take a wistful journey with Hayden and Josh, bouncing between the present and events of five years ago. Bound by Nature is a poignant, compelling love story with a satisfying and sincere conclusion.
Meanwhile, there has been a mystifying attachment to old archeological events and artifacts. At the state level we find Greece and Egypt in legal fights with English and other museums demanding the return of of some of their archeological objects that were captured in the old colonial days when controls were absent. Even at the family level we find people taking pride in  buying  and owning remains of old columns or artifacts even if they go back to more than 3500 years. Thankfully, this has now become illegal in most countries.

Highly recommended, especially to anyone who loved Cooper Davis's previous release, Boys of Summer, as much as I did.

708	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I was delighted to discover Lynsay Sands' Argeneau vampire series.  They're all good reads, lots of fun (if a tiny bit predictable after the third or fourth one), and I'd call them delightful brain candy.  But one would think that an author characterized as a "New York Times bestseller" would rate a bit better editor and proofreader than these books rated.  In other words, there are errors that detract from the reading experience as far as I'm concerned.  Granted, I'm a bit of a "grammar nazi," and I freely admit this.  But come on; with the price of books these days, do we as purchasers and readers not deserve better than to read offerings that include errors such as the use of "past" when the context indicates that "passed" is correct? (No, the two words are not interchangeable.)  Equally, the author's use of "he and Joe" in place of the correct "him and Joe" is disturbing.  Equally disconcerting are the number of comma errors throughout each of the books, print or electronic.  So read the books, enjoy the stories, but don't depend on them for improving your grammar.  And Lynsay, pay your proofreader better - you'll be better served.

I cannot in all honesty divulge much of the book. It must be read and devoured and instilled in the mind to set for later discussion. In Al Kennedy's review in 'The Guardian' he shares this nugget: "The chairman of the Booker judges, Howard Davies, revealed that he had spotted the brilliance of this novel when he said: "It has an absolutely brilliant ending. It has one of the best last sentences of any novel I have ever read." Al Kennedy goes on to say that "mortality becomes the ultimate definition of Love's stupidity - an outpouring of energy towards people who are always destined to disappoint, to be disappointed and, above all, who are compelled to leave us in the most devastating way, by dying. The horror and wonder of love, we are shown, is that it outlives its object."

She creates a dark and tortured, but oh so appealing character in Ryder. I loved how the book opens with him in prison and it's not clear where things go from there. It gave me a sense that this was not going to be the average predictable historical romance. Ryder had a lot of depth to his character and I could feel his pain. When Jessie comes into the picture, their chemistry explodes and the sex is off the charts hot. At about 3/4 of the way in, I thought things dragged a bit as they were both reluctant to disclose their feelings for each other and their lack of communication became frustrating.

So for several days they just keep sneaking off to have sex and nobody notices.  Then on the actual day of the trade the indian's white aunt who used to be a captive comes with the indians and none of the white people raise a fuss about them having a white woman.  The white aunt then convinces the entire wagon train to let the girl marry the hero in the spirit of promoting peace between both people.  The prejudice white people not only allow it, there's a priest on hand who willingly performs the ceremony and then and there and they live happily ever after.

Told from the perspective of the main character in the series, Kaylee Cavanaugh, it gives readers a short glimpse into her life prior to her discovery of who and what she is. In this story both readers and Kaylee are unaware of just what is wrong with her and why she has debilitating "panic attacks" that cause her to scream uncontrollably, to see things that shouldn't be there, and that leave her hoarse, terrified and questioning her sanity.
3117	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Very thought provocative. I am trying the link and balance method. It just makes sense. If you think you may be sensitive, there is a self test which is of great help.
The sex scenes are truly dreadful. They contain such gems as "The sight of her pale blonde ruff and the deep pink, inner lips framing her entrance, took his breath away." and "The slick, wet sounds they made as they came together were just nasty enough to thrill her, and the familiar musky scent and feel of the man working above her smoothed away the edges from her earlier unrest." The language was on par with free erotic shorts and the imagery anywhere from puzzling ("working?" really?) to gross, but never erotic. It lacked the subtlety, the tension building and feeling necessary to convey attraction or arousal. Ostensibly these are people who love each other, yet, beyond saying the words to each other, they do nothing to show me love exists here.

I loved the realism that the author put into the book that tragedy's that most people only associate with women could also happen to men such as what Josh and Hayden went through it was hard to read it but this was something that does happen and to understand the bitterness and dislike Hayden had for Josh the author had to take you back in time to where it all took place.

Glad I did!  The book is grittier than the series and the ending of this book was especially surprising.  The author doesn't hesitate to show the characters with all of their flaws making it much more realistic.  I also like how he weaves in Native American stories, beliefs, daily-life situations on the Rez, and the all-too-common racism that they face.  (The author talks mainly about the Northern Cheyenne in Wyoming.)  I especially appreciated the many examples of very dry Native American humor written into the story and usually said by Henry Standing Bear.  I will definitely move on to the next book in the series....

It didn't have a strong hero that I could get behind and root for, and this made it difficult to lose myself in the story, since I didn't really care what happened to them.  It was also very short and had no resolution.  Presumably this will be resolved later, as there are at least 5 parts to this story.  Since I already 'bought' the next installments, I'll keep going, and I hope it will resolve.
She is Episcopalian, and her sexual identiy as a lesbian (which she retains after her conversion) is peripheral to her story about feeding hungry people. She ministers to "the poor, the weak, the sick and the lonely", and the book chronicles how all this comes about.
Several malicious, cruel and scheming characters keep the drama moving through to the end.
By the time you reach the middle of this book, the pages turn furiously. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, but at the same time I hated to see this book be over with. Steve Peek has a real talent for writing, and I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a complex mystery with a measure of terror and truly original and unexpected twists.

6023	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This is a quintessentially American story that is both important and unforgettable. One reason it is important is that it affirms the adage: "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Another is that, the deep FBI and police corruption begged the question: Who guards the guards themselves? But also, no matter how distorted morally, this story is still somehow a perverse but generic template for ethnic  "ghetto success:" Two brothers from a " "disposable" part of inner city Boston make good; one through "low hard crime" (Whitey was a serial murderer, bank robber, extortionist, and a "top echelon" FBI informant; while Billy, on the other hand, engaged in grafts and payoffs, illegal political procedural maneuvering, patronage, nepotism, "no show jobs," extortion, racketeering, sweetheart and unholy deals, arson and insurance scams, as well as political blackmail and business frauds.). The mantra of Boston corruption at the time was: "Nothing on the level; every thing a deal, and no deal too small."

The only part of the story that I thought was a little weak was the ending.  It wraps up really quickly and there is no epilogue, so I finished the book feeling like I got robbed of my happily ever after.  I also wished for a little injection of humor in parts of the story, particularly from Llew's two brothers.  Lastly, even though the fairy involvement is scattered throughout the story, I would have loved to read more about these characters and their world.

What happens when your dream lover is real and you meet?  Paranormal Payback shows just what happens when one group forces another to leave.  Lorelie's planet has had to pay a very long time for a decision that was made by Earth.  Sevan is a Commission Captain but he knows that if his family secret ever comes out, he will lose more than that.  Lorelie and Sevan first meet in a dream plane and are highly surprised to discover that their dream lover is actually real.  I saw how, at first, Lorelie tried to fight for what she thought should be. It showed me just how strong her loyality was.  However, I really loved how Sevan was not going to let anything stand in the way of claiming his mate--not even her.  The tangled ties of danger and passion were well done and kept me interested.  The humor was a total plus.  The ending proved just how strong both Sevan and Lorelie were at defending their love.  Paranormal Payback is erotic and passionate while having threads of danger and humor that made it a keeper for me.  I will be watching for the next book in this series.

She got pregnant soon after they met so they married.  She miscarried and because they were both young they misunderstood each other's grief and needs.  Words were spoken, feelings were hurt, so she left him.  You find that out as you read the book because the beginning takes place 10 years later after a huge wreck nearly costs her her life.  She was taken to his hosp and they begin to piece together what went wrong.  It could be a "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl" but the writing puts you inside their feelings.

But what happened was not the collapse of capitalism, but its evolution.  The fact that modern readers are as horrified by the conditions described by Dickens as Marx was speaks to the fact that capitalism and social progress are not mutually exclusive phenomena.  The reality is that just as "pure" Communism has never been practiced, neither has "pure" Capitalism.  Remembering that Adam Smith was as much moral philosopher as (political) economist, this is not so surprising.  Indeed, it is interesting that of the ten policies clearly articulated by Marx in the Manifesto, a number of them (progressive taxation, strong central banks, free education, etc.) are in practice in capitalist societies around the world today.  Some have argued that this simply represents the adoption of Marxist ideas into capitalism, but let's remember that Adam Smith advocated a progressive tax long before Karl Marx did.  What's more important is the fact that disparate theories can apparently support strikingly similar policies.  For me, I think it's important to recognize that all systems of social organization have their warts, and that all systems can learn something from the others: no single ideology has a monopoly on good ideas.

While Ranger's Apprentice borrows from already-established fantasy tropes, it has been marvelously popular with young readers of fantasy. John Flanagan's elevation of a ranger character, someone more gifted at stealth and marksmanship than brute force, has fleshed out an often-neglected portion of fantasy literature. His reliance on themes of loyalty, bravery, endurance and friendship leave young readers in safe hands as they learn to navigate dangerous waters on their own.
If you have a Kindle and like to read at all, and why do you have a Kindle if you don't want to read, I highly recommend giving this a try.

I have to adjust the size down one for this book, compared to most others, but that is a tiny complaint.

I agree with the comment that gardenias would have been better raised in a hothouse than planted in the front of the manor.  And by carrying that handkerchief around with him I would have expected many more people to have noticed and to then have commented about the flowery smell.  I love the gardenia aroma but not on a man.  That he didn't notice that smell on his own person when Georgiana planted it in his clothing for the wedding is probably unrealistic.  He was not in Elizabeth's presence so from where did he think that smell was coming?
When a boy is kidnapped by her abusive pack, a terrified Anna finally dares to call the Marrok, the leader of all werewolves. He ends up sending his son Charles Cornick to deal with the troublemakers, and Charles is shocked when he realizes that Anna isn't a super-submissive wolf -- she's a rare Omega wolf, and the disgusting Leo and savage Justin have been abusing and molesting her all over the place.
The Bulger brother's crime wave thus could be rationalized as an existential avenue to societal revenge:  a way of removing the ethnic chip on their shoulders by "thumbing their noses" at a society that had purposely dealt them a bad hand simply because they were lower class Irish. It was a way of calling Boston's illegitimate society to account through "power moves" already tolerated by Boston society, including crimes of all genres that terrorized the city of Boston for a generation. In short, this two-man crime wave taking place at opposite ends of the societal spectrum, proved both that the society that discriminated against lower class Irish was a "moral sham" and that lower class Irish (the Southies") were not deserving of their ascribed inferior status after all, but could play society's illegitimate games as well as (or better than) the next group.

STYLE: In typical Bell fashion, the atmosphere was light and fun and the story is relatively SHORT. Trouble is this DID NOT WORK for this concept, though. Norse mythology has an imposing cast of characters and implies nobility and power- yet it was thrown at you all at once, liberally sprinkled with trite humor. Not only did you have to figure out which god was which, but then you had to remember what their modern names were- who was related to who- who had what power- what they all had to do with our story! It was a mess. Truly a mess. It was MUCH better suited for a more serious book- a longer story where it could have unfolded better.

Chandler wrote detective mystery stories, and became famous for seven novels and a number of Hollywood screen plays, mostly about crime and private detectives in the "film noir" genre of Hollywood black and white films, or what is called LA "pulp fiction". Far from being an ordinary writer of cheap crime stories, Chandler became one of America's best writers from the mid 20th century. His fame was of course helped by Bogat and Bacall starring in the film "The Big Sleep" based on Chandler's first novel.

This book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.

When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.

Melisande Charteris (Lissy) is the only daughter of wealthy attorney and his trophy wife John and Christa Charteris. Their cold and loveless marriage had worked its charm over Lissy who has a strained relationship with her mother who tries to impose her bitterness about men, marriage and love on her daughter. The fashion editor at Denver Independent, Lissy had at first taken an instant dislike towards Will when they had first been introduced when Will had joined the staff of the paper as the new celebrity sports columnist. Thinking Will to be just another brainless jock with ridiculous good looks, Lissy had turned her nose at him only to have her whole perspective of Will do a 180 degree turnabout when Will helps her after she injures herself whilst out running.

I am a sucker for this genre and I do like the Swiss Family Robinson feel of these kids building a life for themselves in the Mountains.  The idea of the Chief, ruling through the concensus of the group rather than brute force or cunning, was a refreshing departure in such tales.  This is not a Mad Max, Lord of the Flies type of story so if that is your cup of tea, you may want to look elsewhere.  The book does not lack for action but there are long stretches where the folks are just busy trying to stay alive and build their community, so be prepared for this.

I found myself chuckling several times and actually laughing at least twice while reading this thing.  The tongue in cheek wit is catching in a subdued and subtle way...the author uses perfect timing when she uses her "punch line."  But, as other reviewers have pointed out, there is a certain reality at play here and we get a very nice peek into the inside of a writer's soul...if that is what you want to call it.

650	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I kept wishing the author had given her total work the attention to detail that she has given to her sex scenes. They were the only fluid scenes in the book. Those were well written. Otherwise the plot was predictable and boring. The only surprises I had reading this book was the number of times Greg found himself tied to a bed or chained up.

There was no resolution or growth in either character. I'm ended this book feeling disgusted because I usually like Lennox books. I'm afraid to buy the next one in the series.  Sincerely disgusted.
Billy on the other hand, operating at the other end of the political spectrum, realized that every angle he played had to be played precisely and opportunities had to be seized with "cold blooded calculation." And then, the gains had to be consolidated quickly through ruthlessness; that is through terror, extortion, graft, patronage, blackmail and punishing enemies. Both brothers thus were playing the same immoral game, at opposite ends of a chessboard stacked against them, with the same corrupt Boston officials. They just did so with different weapons.


2108	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This is a fast moving tale filled with plenty of steam. It would be best suited to mature readers that like "Adult Romance" content.

Overall comments: This is a pleasant little read: not very long, but certainly worth a couple hours' worth of time. There's some intrigue, some sex, some light angst, and a healthy dose of heartwarming romance. What's not to like?
This book made me really hate some of the guys and really love the women! A true chick lit empowerment book!!!!

HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a paranormal romance series that focuses on Norse gods in modern America. Not a good read: awesome concept, blundered execution. I'm a fan of Dana Marie Bell's work. Her "Gray Court" series is my favorite. This, however, was a TERRIBLE example of her work. Awkward and confusing, this story never really evens out and pulls you in. You're left wondering what on earth is going on and how on earth such childish people could be GODS. Please don't judge this author's work by this book!
Truly, the love between all the couples is evident, but this story in particular is heart warming and beautifully written. Its a MUST read from R.G., who never ceases to please me! Great Job R.G.!!

I adored Jena, as a character. I would love to have her as a friend. She's practical, compassionate, grounded, analytical, and a natural leader. While all of the sisters were in turn excellent (darling, brave Stela, wickedly smart Paula, reminds-me-of-me-at-13 Iulia, maternal Tatiana) it was Jena who I was most rooting for.
In particular, something about Kadan grabbed my attention.  Instead of finding his neanderthal persona annoying and one-dimensional (like many of Christine Feehan's alpha male characters) Kadan grew on me  - so much so that by the story's end, I was truly moved by his desperate need/obsession w/Tansy. I thought Tansy, given her complicated history, was interesting, likable and more complex than some of the other "lost girls" from previous stories; and the plot, while more far-fetched than usual, played out reasonably well.
Diaz makes a great many allusions to The Lord of the Rings, the Marvel & DC Universes, game mechanics from Dungeons & Dragons and the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. If you are familiar with one or more of these, you'll find the book even more rewarding (if you were born between 1965 and 1985 and have a few nerdy qualities, this book is definitely for you).
All of our favorite characters are in this story for the majority of it: Evelyn, Will, Horace, Halt and Erak.  They are all likable and the story is engaging.  This is a very solid fantasy book.  This book deals more with war and strategy than previous books have.
Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic "The Forsyte Saga," a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.

I may not expect too much from them, for whatever reason, but if the price is right, I'm usually willing to give it a try. Then, every so often, one of those books turns out to be a fantastic read that I enjoyed immensely, and I'm doubly impressed because of my lack of expectations. The Ghost Exterminator is one of those books.


This fund is for emergencies like repairs, once you use some of it, you stop spending until you have it at $1000. Here is the old story: car breaks down, ask for a credit card with the repair company, get a rediculous rate and pay for years. After Ramsey, car breaks down, pull out the cash and pay for it, stress free, then stop extra spending for a few weeks until the emergency fund is back up to $1000.

Hypnotic confusion which really makes this book a stand out with twist and turns and a perfect ending.


Like Robert Cormier, Elizabeth Scott has dared to take a picture no one wants to see.  This is, without question, one of the most emotionally difficult reads I've experienced. Any parent will cringe at the flawless way Ray is able to kidnap Kyla. Anyone reading this book will be so horrified they won't want to finish it, yet they will not be able to put it down. Scott's spare language, as she speaks through Alice's character, is powerful, gripping and heart-wrenching. The final page will leave you stunned. For mature readers only, be ready for some deep discussions on this one.
I was stunned - threw of me off - it wasn't anything that I was excpecting. I knew it was an Erotica e-book - but it still wasn't what I thought it would be.

Where was the Shared Dreams, the shared pleasure or the need to be together and not be apart from one another? Also there was no shedding of the impurities with the change. I was wondering the whole book if it was going to be a turn given up for the wrong person. I was confused on her sharing her pleasure with others she had bitten, not the mind control to make them not realize the pain but she was sharing the pleasure she was getting out of it? It was like they weren't truly lifemates but did fall in love but without the complete sharing of themselves with each other.  I have fell in love with this series and own all the hardbacks, and look forward to more in the series I just finished rereading the entire collection up to 24. I would love to see this story rewritten to add the stuf that goes with the other stories that let you see the life mate as a true combining of the souls With all the shared dreams etc...

BOTTOM LINE: Not worth the time. Perhaps if you are a fan of this author and find this concept interesting, you might want to go ahead just to see if the series improves. If you haven't read anything from this author before- DON'T start here. She's really very talented! I'm not sure I'll bother with the next book. I just didn't grow to LIKE these people.

Ryder Braddock isn't your typical heroine, given his addictions but I couldn't help but like him. Jessie is also a more than likeable heroine who has a great sassy personality. I would liked to have seen their emotional relationship develop deeper but their sexual chemistry was great and led to some pretty steamy moments.

2114	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I like this book. I like westerners cowboys the best. I have a great many books. I like the way thestory line goes. It was a good read. I would recommend this book.
I also had a few problems with how Jake and Remi, and by extension, their friends and pack, dealt with the very serious threat of Remi's father. Not to mention my utter disgust over Remi's mother's willingness to stay in such a violently abusive relationship. It's tragically realistic - happens every day - but it's not something that makes for a pleasant read. And frankly, with so many werewolves around, I just couldn't understand why Remi's father didn't "accidentally" end up as dead as he deserved before the situation degenerated to the degree it did. Especially with the lives of Sterling and their mom on the line. It's not like precedent hadn't been set in the first book to allow for killing in self defense.

Reading this graphic novel has inspired me to come up with three new categories to critique.

Maggie Shayne's 'Immortality' gives us a more sympathetic view of Puabi, the Immortal High Dark Witch who spent centuries taking the hearts of good witches and torturing her husband for loving another woman. She is found barely alive in the ocean after her final confrontation with her husband and his lover and she at last finds the missing piece of her soul romantically and literally.
Her modern atributes like jogging are really cute, although I was interested to find out more about her former life before she went into the past. I'm sure there was a reason wny this was never mentioned, other than she didn't lead a very interesting life, but what kind of job she had or a bit about any family she might have left behind might have been interesting.

One thing I do need to mention is that this book needed some more editing. Some of the paragraphs were indented and some weren't, and there were several typos. But there wasn't enough of a problem to pull me out of the story. The book was just too good to let the errors bother me.
The author may once or twice delve into the stereotypes of Viking culture. The most notable of which is the fact that Vikings did not wear horned helmets. Its not that big a deal, considering its a fantasy, but it is one of those little things that can nag at the reader.


Over-all, a good book for helping to inspire folks who are not savers and investors by nature.
This is the concept that intrigued me into deviating into the realm of non-fiction.
Ms. Miles conversion is not clean, orderly, instant or complete, in other words, very typical.  She is "captured" by Christ through transubstantiation - the idea that in Christian Communion the bread and the wind literally become the Body and the Blood of Christ.  For those, like Ms. Miles before that Communion, this sounds ridiculous at best and sick at worst.  For those who are experiencing transformation by the Holy Spirit, this remains a Mystery of uniting with the Divine and others.  Ms. Miles became intensely aware that this Mysterious Union was meant to be shared, not kept to herself.  Actually, the only way she could "keep" it was by giving it away.  She was drawn to the Church by being offered, then eating some bread and wine served in a church.  How could she keep others from being likewise invited?
A good premise that falls flat.  I'll give it a generous 2 stars.

At any rate give the book a chance.  I'm glad she is still writing even if the characters have some of the same descriptions...smelling like roses, smelling like leather, herculian men, viking men, all the women stood up to their intended...But it's all nice in its own way in my opinion.

2064	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	How do you review a book that's been in print for almost 2000 years? Many have come before me, so I will be brief. Suetonius was one of the most credible historians of his day, so his accounts of the period have been the source for countless treatises and novels about Ancient Rome,(including mine.) One of the things that distinguishes him was his ability to report the rumors as well as hard, documented facts on the topics of his day, making it possible to get a sense of how Romans actually thought about things. Like opening a window in time and looking into his world. It's always a good idea to cross check any historic account and this holds true for him as well. But the value of knowing the kitchen details of the Old Empire can never be exaggerated. His sense of humor and irony makes a fun read about a colorful age in history.

Much was made of his years of toil and the years of anticipation for this book, but the years do not show. It looks lazy, pretentious and self-indulgent. The Pulitzer Prize is very uneven. There is no way that this book is on a par with The Known World, Interpreter of Maladies, Empire Falls or even The Road. I do believe that there are stories in this novel that should be told and I am interested in reading them, but it looks to me that they need to be told by someone else.

Remi's relationship with his brother Sterling was the best part of the book, you could really see how much they cared for each other and looked after each other. Sterling is young and full of energy and he stole the scene every time he appeared. I'm really looking forward to Sterling and Rhys' book. It was funny to see how this big bad guy was always ready to run to protect Sterling. I'm waiting for Sterling to finally grow up, even if he's quite a handful already.
I have read a book from Elizabeth Scott before, and it was completely different - I had not expected this book to be so "extreme" and so real. I had expected it to be a normal read, with a bit of emotions - I had in no way expected this book to bring tears to my eyes or make me want to burn all the copies of this book.

But even in the first instance, there are still non-trivial concerns to worry about.

And yet many think they don't know a single child in that situation. It's easy to tell a child how they should feel or how you think you would feel to discover a parent was a felon. All a child knows is what sort of parent they have. Is he a good dad, is she an attentive mom? Kids don't really care about the things adults know are important. Your mother or father isn't measured in your heart by their worth to society, only their worth to you. Family feelings are complicated things. So all those children, 2 million at any given time, they grow up. And they learn that the lesson of their childhood - keep your mouth shut - applies in the adult world as well. So the silence continues. There are millions of Americans who have grown up in tumultuous homes, under shady circumstances, with secret families, and they keep their mouth shut. Never Tell Our Business To Strangers breaks that silence beautifully.

With Bridget in tow, Rory goes to find the magician.  According to the magician there is an entire shadow world that coexists with the Manhattan that Rory and Bridget know and love.  It's called Mannahatta, and it's populated by Gods of every kind.  Like the God of Justice, or the God of Sample Sales, or the God of Jaywalking.  To borrow the magicians words: "When a mortal does something great, he is reborn in Mannahatta as a spirit.  If his legend grows enough, he might be fortunate enough to ascend to godhood."

Gregori is hot, funny and a vampire. He turned Nina by accident, and now he has to deal with her. He doesn't like her at all, and I liked that, because it was different from the usual. He hated her foul-mouth and her attitude, but he feels responsible of her. Of course she doesn't want his help, and their relationship was very difficult to start (several chapters). They obviously started to like each other, but both were so stubborn. That made the romance it this book slower, but don't get me wrong, it was still hot, and they do get their "happily ever after".
While these books might be similar in their approach, I actually found myself tearing up at the end of "Believe" and thinking about the message in this story.  I am not someone who reads spiritual books or quotes passages from the Bible (haven't even read it), and as I said it was more the price of the book that hooked me and not the subject. But this one really got to me. Maybe because I'm a bit of a cynic who is originally from New York (where this story takes place), maybe because I recently lost my mother, or maybe just because this is a well written, interesting and engaging tale - I couldn't say.

The authors point out that in 31 of the last 35 years the government in Washington, D.C. has spent more than it collected in taxes.  Our federal deficit now totals $9 trillion, and will escalate as boomers retire and draw upon Social Security and Medicare.  Meanwhile, more and more concern is being raised about the AMT - set to kick in at $200,000 in '69, and threatening more and more "middle-income" families as inflation continues.

Ring in the New Year with the explosively hot The Bite of Silence!  Mary Hughes pairs two sexy protagonists with a race against time to deliver this exciting, entertaining story.  Twyla is an enchanting heroine.  She is likeable, intelligent, and beautiful, but she lacks self-confidence.  I loved that Nikos sees how capable and bright she is and works to make her see it as well, sometimes using mouth-wateringly delicious tactics.  The Spartan general is all reserve on the surface, but get under his skin and watch out - instant heat!  The incendiary attraction between Nikos and Twyla produces erotic results that are every bit as appealing as the tenderness between the two.

Helene is made to feel powerless, open, and exposed. If you like seeing a woman naked and defenseless to a dominating and controlling man who pulls all the right strings; if you like seeing a woman yield to man and, in doing so, yield to herself, you'll like this story. As always with EM, it's well-written, highly erotic, intelligent, and revealing.
- There's practically no buildup, emotional or physical, to the first sex scene, and because there's so little development between sex scenes, they left me cold. They're lovingly described in rather minute detail, but I found them a little clinical. They have a removed, play-by-play feel to them.

The Temujai are clearly based on the barbarian hordes of Central Asia such as the Mongols and the Huns. What can also be learned from them is how the Roman Empire and to some extent modern militaries, worked so well, On his own, a Roman Legionnaire was nothing special in the way of single combat, but when a part of a large, cohesive unit, they were almost unstoppable. A disciplined, ordered force will almost always prevail against a chaotic force even if severely outnumbered. There is something to be learned in that even beyond combat.

I have enjoyed the laconic style portrayed by the actor playing Sheriff Walt Longmire, and though I haven't understood how Henry Sleeping Bear, portrayed by Lou Diamond Phillips, fits into the Longmire story, I've enjoyed his acerbic, overly-precise way of speaking.  The stories have been well-plotted and engaging.
Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out, like in the DVD's, where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.

Now Will, though horribly weakened, is back in his right mind and his return has come not a moment too soon. The spring thaw has finally arrived in the frozen north and Will and Evanlyn must resume their difficult journey toward Araluen and freedom.
What I love about this story the most is that it is very emotionally satisfying. Theres tension, a bit of stress, all amid sexual frenzy. I will freely admit that I had to read this one-handed. But even with all the masturbation material, I got into the characters, into their heads, and connected with them. The main characters got a very satisfying ending, I think, and there is an opening for much, much more  it is a short story, after all. And luckily for me (and you), there is a much longer story that follows this one about the two supporting characters  Brent and Joe.

3542	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	In MEN IN BLACK, Mark Levin, the conservative radio talk host, turns his attention to an area of Americana that has suddenly shifted gears from dry and dusty to hot and relevant.  He notes that the Supreme Court forms one angle of the triangle that in effect governs America.  The Presidency and the Senate over the years have struggled with the Supreme Court and each other in a bear hug that historically was more or less even.  However, Levin notes that the Court has grown powerful beyond the scope envisioned for it by the Founding Fathers, who set it up as a check on the other two.  The Court, they held, was to interpret the law, a formidably strong enough concept indeed.  Yet, Levin accuses the Court of overstepping its bounds in a manner that places it squarely in the camp of a leftist ideology that he fears has turned the United States into a bizarre nation that opposes nearly every precept once held dearly by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.  No longer is the America of 2005 a nation that opposes racism (affirmative action is the "settled law" of a racist ideology that the Founding Fathers would have found abhorrent) nor is it one that will protect its citizens from foreign incursions (the Court now insists that captured Islamofascist terrorists must be accorded the constitutional right to face their accusers in a court of law).  Levin argues that the Court has proven over the last fifty years that the fate of the Democratic party and the fate of the Court itself are inextricably intertwined.  MEN IN BLACK was written before the recent arrival of John Roberts as Chief Justice.  With the looming confirmation hearings of Samuel Alitto as the newest conservative justice, Levin must be heartened by the likely prospect of a reversal of a court that has looked over its left shoulder for so long that it forgot that it even had a right one.

1286	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Junot Daz's Pulitzer winner was a disappointment. This is a like-mother like-son story of foolish, obsessive, unrequited love. In both cases, the obsession is dangerous because the object of his/her affection has connections to Trujillo, the brutal dictator of the Dominican Republic for thirty years. Single mother Beli, her daughter Lola, and son Oscar live in Paterson, New Jersey, but the real action takes place in the DR where their roots are. I found the voluminous footnotes and the slang, often in Spanish, particularly exasperating. Also, the not-always-identifiable narrator changes frequently and is sometimes first person, sometimes third, with lots of backtracking in time. This choppiness robbed the story of continuity, not to mention making it a bit challenging to follow. My favorite narrator, though, was Yunior, also a Dominican in New Jersey, who is Lola's occasional lover and Oscar's occasional college roommate. Yunior grows to genuinely care for Oscar, the bumbling obese nerd who pines for women he can't have. Oscar is too maladjusted and clueless with his Tolkien-inspired and Jedi-infused techno-speak to be a likeable character, but Yunior manages to tell the lovesick Oscar's story in a compassionate way.

Now, there is some debate as to the ending of Living Dead Girl. I'm not going to give it away because I hate spoilers with a fiery passion. But I will say this. Living Dead Girl is the type of book where both a happy and a sad ending would damn it. A happy ending would make it seem sort of fake because the truth is almost every kid that has ever been in Alice's situation doesn't make it out alive. However, a sad ending would make this seem like a story with no type of redemption, with no hope, and would leave you with a bleak look at humanity. Either way, someone's going to be unsatisfied with the ending.
This is a really good book with a lot of evilness, fighting, magic, creatures, and sneaky little jerks all over the place.

The book had many issues which need a tune up. As good as the novel is it is just a little too long; it needed to be edited down just a bit so it wasn't so heavy to shoulder. I had no real beef with the simple writing style. Many might complain that Stan Morris's writing is too basic or undeveloped but for this book. The narrative being that of a thirteen year old boy, I truly thought he hit the nail on the head. The novel was too male centric and desperately needed to be balanced by more active respected female characters. I also felt that despite the pairing of couples that there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason for those relationships. I think he could have worked on developing a better psychological connection between them so it wasn't as dry and clinical as it came across.

Oscar and his family live now in Paterson,New Jersey exiled from the Dominican Republic for good reasons. He is a writer and dreams of becoming the next Tolkein while falling hopelessly in and out of love. His punk sister, Lola, wants to run away, and his resolute mother,Beli, Beli can't seem to let either of them go. We get major footnotes throughout the novel recounting the ruthless brutality of the Trujillo dictatorship of 31 years. The novel is about words, as curses,,superstitiouns, spells,charms or writing. The power of words to fight the silences,the abscences,the lacunae,disappearance:our ability to construct a narrative through the imagination. Most of our history gets wiped out by the anaesthetic of the quotidian or by censorship. In the empty crater of memory of the New World our contemporary world has no Creation myths.

- Vonnie Hayes is a neighbor who inherited a lot of land when her father died.  She's known Walt and his daughter for years as a neighbor and friend.  She and Walt cautiously move into a romantic relationship that both find challenging.  Their awkwardness and guilt are authentic and unforgettable.
All in all, the story was well written, gripping, and very fast-paced. There were no lagging or boring parts. If you hate alpha males lashing out at their wives when those said wives hurt and humiliate them, this book is not for you. To everyone else, I highly recommend.

Brennan seems to really get into the heads of her supporting characters.  She did a phenomenal job of making both The Seattle Slayer (the true villain) and Brian Harrison Hall (the circumstantial villain) very multi-faceted.  Although not as well developed as these two men, the other supporting characters in the book came to life with concise descriptions and minimal appearances.  It was nice to get a picture of Quinn and Miranda Peterson's future when they were included in the story.
She has another book, Miniplanner, that is good, but not as satisfying as this one. She needs to write more, and soon!

Overall, this story is just alright.
He is the one person I have found who openly ridicules credit card dependency , and emphasizes the importance of a zero based budget. And yes I know that both of those things are great in theory, and very difficult in practice.  Yet both of those things are doable - we can certainly live without credit cards, and as painful as it might be at first - we can definitely create a zero based budget.

It's not, while they hint of something in the fog it is never explained, all you know is whatever goes in ends up screaming and me ere coming back out. Instead it's more about how a camp full of kids set out to survive and establish a community. The best comparison I could give is a modern day Lord of the Flies meets Hatchet. These kids manage to not only to survive but thrive and do better than most of the adults you will meet along the way.

1133	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoyed this second installment in this series.  I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of "bits of everything", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the third and final one.

The characters were not "fleshed out" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.
Emma is a huge surprise to all who meet her, she's no pushover to Max and can hold her own with any of the other women. She's even able to teach them a lesson or two. The wise cracks and kitty jokes never stop!



I am not usually drawn to romances between older women and younger men, but the age difference between Amy and Justin never felt like an issue to me at all.  The moment you feel the romantic tension between this pair, you will think of nothing but your need for them to consummate their undeniable attraction for each other.
491	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Every time I read a new Allison Brennan book, I swear that one is my favorite. As this is my seventh book that I've read by this author, it's happened to me seven times. One of the things I love most about Ms. Brennan's series is getting to have recurring characters in each of the books. I've really come to love the entire Kincaid clan as well as all the peripheral characters such as Will Hooper, Jim Gage, etc. who each get to be the main focus of a novel.
2550	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	A classic that really shows the charming literalness, innocence, and adorable self-centered logic of childhood.  The writing really shines when you read it out loud and I enjoyed reading it as much as my kids enjoyed listening to it.
Excellent writing.  A quick read.  Attention grabbing.  Just beware of the content...not for the weak.
Postscript: I've been thinking about this novel in light of the comments it drew from 'a customer.' Possibly I underappreciated the political/historical signifiers. Possibly Oscar is a bit allegorical, a synecdoche of the whole DR diaspora, living semi-lives in el Norte. Possibly Trujillo really is an immortal Dark Lord, reincarnating constantly in what one character means when he says "we are ten million Trujillos." In other words, the novel may be open to deeper readings, if you can keep your eyes off the mammaries.

So a brief take on the characters, oh my squirming behind, those masters!  Hateful, hurtful and totally magnetic, same goes for Tane, the Mountain Lord, this guy is one of the darkest male leads I have ever come across but I couldn't help but be mesmerised by him.

Another thing that Mr. Levin does very well is making it clear that these judges who usurp power have no more wisdom than anyone else and sadly, in many cases, far less.  He goes through some of the horrendous decisions of the Court such as Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, and the the McCain-Feingold Act.
Everyone just starting beginning to earn money should read this as a primer on how to do things correctly from the beginning, but it may not always "take" when the money (or credit card) is in your pocket and those shiny new cars, electronic gadgets, clothing are calling out to you.  I really believe this would be a good book to re-read every few years to either shore up your resolve or to remind you that you can get out of debt and not answer the siren of massive consumption.

So well written that the words quickly disappear to be replaced by the action viewed with the mind's eye (as any well told story will do).

Those are the most common mistakes, and fixing them would cover most of the errors in the story, making the book a much more enjoyable read.

One of the things that really struck me about this book is the way that almost everything is referred to in a highly sexualized way.  The chapter in which Veronica speculates about her grandparents' sex life was beyond creepy.

BLOOD AND SEX, VOLUME 1: MICHAEL is an engrossing and breathtaking suspense and a romance that seizes the reader from beginning to end. Traveling the road with Michael and Tori was impressive and their relationship both and poignant and grew more and more as the story went on. Jonas, a secondary character, will be the hero in the next book who has secrets of his own about him. I'd have loved to have a bit of a dictionary that would help with some of the special terms used for the book. Similar that I've seen in those with the Cajun words. But as the story went on, I was able to grasp those terms better. With a theme of romance, suspense and paranormal, its a combination that makes for a great series.

The characters are well developed and interesting and the story unwinds at break neck speed.  The heroine is a somewhat conservative school teacher, who is so shocked by her own sexuality that she spends a lot of her time trying to control herself, and not jump Special Agent Thatcher's bones.  So much so, that she doesn't realize just how much danger she's in.  The killer is scary, well hidden and until the very end undiscoverable, but it's whose been helping him that turns out to be the greatest monster.

Hot sex, 2 well developed characters who easily grow on you, tender, touching and emotional moments and a nice plot. I prefer this one to Diving Deep, the longer story from Mitchell. The initial setting is really amusing as both characters meet over a rubbish dump. Cade may be the more experienced, flamboyant and older one but his failed relationship with a "jerk" has left him vulnerable and lonely. Elliot is a young man, almost a virgin, but romantic at heart believing in finding one true love. They seem very different and you would have thought Cade would have preferred a more exprienced and older lover. But Elliot's persistence and sincerity would win the most hard hearted.

Just ask DH. I turned to him multiple times and said, "These characters are freaking awesome. I need a book of just them. And I need it now." It was like the literary gods were listening to me, smiling knowingly. Because the next day I find out that not only has Melissa Marr written a story featuring my three favorite characters, but it's free. And available for immediate download. DH took one look at my face, laughed, and then wisely left me alone to soak it up. And that is exactly what I did. There are so many beautiful scenes in this story. So much concentrated awesome packed into such a small package. This is exactly what I wanted. And Irial, Niall, and Leslie were exactly themselves in all their heartbreaking loyalty, love, pain, and longing. And honestly I couldn't have asked for anything more. And I haven't been precisely right since. For instance, I may have spent an inordinate amount of time haunting the Rath forum thread dedicated to discussing "Stopping Time." I may have read my favorite bits over and over late at night. (The caf scene. *dies*) And I may have listened to Johnny Cash's cover of "Hurt" on repeat after Ms. Marr mentioned it makes her think of Niall. And, okay, I may have a problem.

But I absolutely cannot wait for DARKEST MERCY--the final installment in the Wicked Lovely series--to find out what happens to my beloved boys. I, for one, am hoping happiness is in the cards if they're strong enough to choose it. In the meantime, I simply cannot recommend "Stopping Time" highly enough. I am all kinds of in love with it and it has won an instant spot on my Best of 2010 list--a first for a short story. So. What are you waiting for? Go! Soak it up! And don't worry about me.

This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions.

But with "His Convenient Husband," the author pulls off the time honored tradition in romance novels - a marriage of convenience - and does it with style. Because Micah and Tucker had a great backstory, the reader was rooting for them to get together from the beginning. Langley's secondary characters, even the 'bad guy,' felt natural to the plot line and gave the reader an overall explanation of why Tucker and Micah marry not for love but to keep their family's ranch. By the end of the book, you were hoping for more: more plot, more sex, more Tucker and Micah's love story...which is always a plus when reading a novella.

And some of the numbers I question because, for example I gave up 99% of wheat in my diet years ago. And years ago I found that pastas made from things that were not grains, were not exactly like wheat pastas, but were pretty good. And I also noticed that they did not make my blood sugar reading so drastic as anything wheat would do. I realized that the pasta from beans and roots and  pumpkin were what the glycemic index was all about. Only the lists showed they had the name number as wheat pasta.

Strangely, few people ever make the observation that the ideas of Marx and Engels were not at all original. Thomas More (1478-1535) conveyed almost the same concept when he scribed his famous work:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Thomas-More-s-Utopia/dp/1604500301/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thomas More's Utopia</a>.

And so goes "The Communist Manifesto" in actual practice.

Magellas' observations and opinions about rear-echelon soldiers, and the psychology of the higher-ups who did little or no actual fighting, ring true.  He notes that it was the captains and lieutenants who really functioned as "leaders" of combat troops, and it was pretty obvious that Magellas was less than impressed with much of the upper brass.  The British brass comes in for particularly harsh criticism in the context of the failure of Montgomery's Operation Market-Garden.  Magellas also relates an astonishing incident in which British armor refused to advance to relieve besieged units of British paratroopers, which shirking allowed the Germans to massacre them.  The author takes the trouble to say that he "personally witnessed this incident...."

"Dirt Music" is one of those novels that takes us to another time, another place - still, we can recognize the time and place. The time is urgent, the place, anywhere in this planet.
The first part, the left-hand side of Banville's objet d'art, presents a smug, self-satisfied roue. I was thrown off, I admit, by the cleverly planted aside about the "Hebrew" neighbor who watches the scholar as he leaves Arcady, California--itself conveyed sharply and concisely in its summery smells and languid allure. It reminded me of Thomas Mann in Pacific Palisades in exile from the Nazis. Cass, at her entrance, appears annoyingly at his side, as if to whisper calumnies in his ear; at his other side I imagine the older Kristina Kovacs recriminating him with upraised finger and brow before an academic crowd--the whole rarified and curiously solipsistic atmosphere of a lit-crit conference amusingly captured, again by Banville, in only a couple of pages (it took David Lodge, no slouch himself, many novels to do the same--which I also highly recommend!). The scene of the woman run over in the street, which may appear on the margin of this segment, disturbed me greatly; it can be seen only more clearly in retrospect as foreshadowing, I suppose. This section's characteristic passage shows Banville's prose at its customary best: "Flakes of ash from his cigarette fell on her breast, tiny, warm, weightless kisses." (76)

3314	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I've been a Garwood fan since the release of The Bride in about 1973 and her historical romances are my favorite because they are light, funny fairytales that come to life with polite-lady heroines whose gentle, yet courageous manner wins the heart of their warrior husbands. This book never comes to life; Gabrielle allows life to happen to her instead of earning people's respect and goodwill. She watches life but doesn't participate. Cole is reportedly a fierce warrior yet the reader only sees him chasing around like a chicken with its head cut off. This fierce Highland laird submits to marriage with a hated English woman due to a debt, unbelievable. Basically, the plot has potential but is sorely underdeveloped.

Alpha And Omega is one of those stories that just gets better with every reading and I think I have read it almost twice a year since I purchased it. Although this years reading was just as riveting as always the deaths in this story were rather painful this time so thankfully those are near the end of the story. The fact that this is one of my favorites and I have read it several times had me excited to give Alpha And Omega the five-star rating I was planning to give so imagine my disappointment after counting the edits that I found forcing me to give the story a 4-star rating. All the same thank you Patricia Briggs for creating an amazing world of shape shifters
Aislinn came off strong and determined from the very beginning. I loved that she knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go after it even though it was not the accepted norm for her country. Many times she was so stubbornly focused on her goal that she missed or ignored certain aspects of a child's life. This was one of the things that made her so real to me. I could relate to that stubborn focus.

As for the rest of the manifesto, it talks a lot about different kinds of communists which was dull, it repeats the word "bourgeois" far too often (but then this is a propaganda leaflet so they had to hammer home the message that property and individual freedoms are bad), though there are moments of strangely poetic writing such as "the robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe..." (p. 42).
The plot is weak and unbelievable.  The premise for the origins of vampires makes a stab at originality, but is so weakly supported that it is ridiculous in the extreme.  The two central characters may be described as physically attractive, but are not 'attractive' in the sense that this reader developed any real feeling for them or their outcome.  The 'plot twists' are transparent and spotted a mile off.
Now here comes the hard part. The author's overarching hypothesis is that the very existence of the energy exchanges occurring at the ZPF (the wave-based sea of background noise of the universe) implies that all matter in the universe is connected by energy exchanges (as ZPF energy waves) that contain a kind of information (via Fourier Transforms for instance) that can be "read back" to us as they spread out across time and space to infinity.

The author's description and portrayal of life in Roman Pompeii is startlingly realistic.

Marie Harte did an excellent job creating two characters, Gage and Hailey, you couldn't help but love as you laughed at their growing relationship. The added plus for this book is Gage's family; if only we all could grow up with such an eclectic and open mix.
The book contains notes by chapter, a vast bibliography and an index. McTaggart has performed a great service by making the research of a large number of scientists known to a wide popular audience. Sometimes the reading pleasure is lost in the overly detailed descriptions of various experiments and their preparation. Also, the physical descriptions of the scientists under discussion are often a bit irritating and unnecessary, although it might have been done to keep the narrative accessible and conversational.
Often in this book things and dialogue about something comes out of nowhere and you have zero reference to what they are referring to. In fact, you sort of forget that there is a murder investigation that needs to be solved because there are so many sidebars and unnecessary details, these doing little to give you insight to the characters.

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a "dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations?

In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor, Marx writes:

Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting.

What I find so interesting about words and word books--especially this one--is how living languages can't be frozen in time.  Words that once meant one thing often come to mean something else. Take, for example,  three  that are currently worming  their way into acceptability while driving the word police bonkers. 1. "Hopefully," when  positioned at the front of a sentence as a less uppity way of saying "it is to be hoped."  2. "Presently," frequently used to mean "at present" which is wrong but sounds right, rather than "soon" which is right but sounds wrong and  3.  The  "n't" that's so often missing these days from "I couldn't care less."

The question of the existence of emotional and intellectual synchronicity is addressed here. McTaggart also considers developments in artificial intelligence and speculates how these discoveries might influence the future. They are hinting at an immense human potential, validating alternative medicine and confirming some mythical and religious beliefs. The author believes that this scientific revolution has forever ended the concept of dualism.

5. Omissions of Certain Twain Works - Yes, "Letters from the Earth" is missing from this "complete" omnibus edition.  The fact is, Twain's one surviving daughter, Clara Clemens, who controlled her father's literary estate until her death in 1962, withheld publication for fear people might be offended by the work.  She changed her mind in 1960 and agreed to allow its publication only after her death.  So "Letters from the Earth" was first published in 1962 and will remain under copyright until 2032 at the earliest, so it could not be included in this very inexpensive omnibus edition.  Royalties would have to be paid to include it and that's just not possible for something that sells for $2.99 per copy.

By golly, they don't write stuff like that anymore.  This is pulp fiction at its finest, a mysterious heroic figure battling the forces of evil and winning the heart of a beautiful senorita in the process.  Expert with sword and astride a fearsome charger, Zorro goes forth to right the wrongs put upon the less fortunate by the evil men in power.
She ends up having an affair with a Frenchmen who is the watered down version of her husband gets pregnant.  When she is a couple months into her pregnancy she FINALLY confronts her husband who is still at a conference (who knew conferences lasted months) where she finds out he's been lying to her (she can't have a baby and an affair) and says she is done with him.  Couldn't you have done this BEFORE months had gone by.  It was just a bad book.  There wasn't one redeemable character you could latch onto and hope they succeeded.

Any book would give the basics, and the number of pages was also almost identical.  And the cover comments of how wonderful the book was, seemed to all be by authors of almost identical books. And each book seemed to have the last third be recipes.  Excuse me, but I have spices and ingredients thee authors never even heard of and cook healthy and very tasty meals  people are crazy for and I don't need a list of a dozen ingredients to measure and out in separate containers to mix in a special sequence. I grab stuff from where and there and put it all in one bowl, and if they had given me more glycemic numbers for real food it would have been a bit nicer for the diet thing, but otherwise still great.
I also don't understand abusing another person because of color, religion, etc.

Side note on something that was written somewhere within the book: If we're having a problem with something you did or said, hormones or PMS can not be blamed for it. I'm so tired of men discounting what we think and or feel as just a consequence of the hormones. We are all human; we all have hormones that affect us differently at different points in the month. Having to deal with the pain and uncomfortable-ness of PMS makes us less inclined to put up with your BS, you're always full of it, most of the time we just overlook it.
Overall, however, Men in Black isn't quite the incredible work of constitutional writing that some of its endorsers claim. Mark Levin seems upset at the Supreme Court more for the trend toward more liberal thinking than for its supposed violations of the U.S. Constitution. If the Supreme Court was violating the Constitution in favor of a position that he and his fellow conservatives approve, then I doubt he would say anything about it. He also seems to believe that the will of the people is sufficient to trample on rights. It all adds up to a less than average book that fails to convince me of its initial premise: That the U.S. Supreme Court has excessive power and wields too much influence. It's a nice effort, but it doesn't quite convince.
The book also includes flashbacks to his mother's and his grandfather's horrible travails during the time of dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina. His mother's father was a doctor who ran afoul of Trujillo when he made an unfortunate joke about Trujillo and bodies in the trunk of a car.

The three novels are paranormal/fantasy romances that are fairly quick reads [or maybe that was because I couldn't stop reading- at bedtime, at work...], but the books are in no way short on character depth, emotion and jaw dropping sex scenes. The novels blend seamlessly together, each book ending with a sense of closure. However, Alexander keeps a good thing going with the conclusion of the whole story arc at the end of the third book. These are great stories with characters that you love (drop dead gorgeous heroes with flaws, strong heroines- no whiners!, and scorching sex scenes, including voyeurism & menage). The fantasy is written so it is believable (vampires, weres, psychics), but the fantasy setting is not overwhelming to the story. The only catch is that the books should be read in order, which is ok- they're all on kindle!!

I wish I honestly give this book 5 stars.  However, it relied just a little much on coincidence and plot twists you could see a mile away.  How is it that EVERYONE at the circle has a compelling sad story?  Aren't some of them just there to knit?  The twist that finally brought the narrator to visit her mother was not much of a surprise---I knew it was coming.  Even the surprise the mother has to tell was something I had guessed.
The settings are nicely described, allowing for the reader to place themselves right into the story.
In All He Ever Wanted, her tale concerns unrequited love, the results of the somewhat unlikely 'love at first sight.' Maybe this was more commn in the early 20th century, the era in which this book is set, but it was the only part of the tale that stretched my credulity. The story covers a lot of ground: anti-Semitism, ... abuse, women's rights, and academia.

They remain immortal until their gifts have become devalued or forgotten --- at least until lately.

Like Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal (though beautifully realized), he is a character who blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise, with no concern for the consequences, except to himself. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is a depraved and amoral old man living a life of personal un-truth, while she is a sick, avenging angel, striving to connect the disjunctions in her life so that she can become an integrated, whole person.
This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.

The sex scenes were good, but I found myself so frustrated by the lazy storytelling and vague details that I didn't much enjoy this overall.  The author was also kind of fixated on testicles.  The hero's are "set aflame" when he sees the heroine (I asked my husband about this and he said he's never noticed anything like that happening when he sees a pretty girl).  When he notices she has nice teeth, he wondered what they would feel like biting him there.  At one point, he's thinking about her, trips, and hurts himself there.  It was an unusual amount of attention to this area.

I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters.

I am a sucker for angst and this one has just enough to satisfy me. :) I realize there is the absence of females but in all honesty i didn't even miss them. They talked about the one woman leaving the ranch with her brother in law and  leaving her kids behind, so that kind of took care of that aspect of it. But the writing was great and had me hooked from the beginning. I have read this over and over and loved it just as much each time. Tucker is more in love with Micah than he realizes and is just wanting to keep Micah from making a mistake in thinking he has a crush,but Micah knows he is in love and has been in love with Tucker for as long as he has been on the ranch. The marriage of convenience that Tucker thought up to save the ranch was brilliant on his part. He now has the ranch and Micah. There for a while you just don't know if Tucker plans to leave and break Micah's heart all over again. The angst makes it well worth the read and in my opinion there could have been more. Angst is the greatest when there is a happy ending. :)

4237	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	While I do love this book, many of the recipes contain processed ingredients, some of which are higher in sodium.  I've been making the switch to eating a 'clean' diet over the past year or so due to health issues.  I have diabetes, high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia.  Losing weight has never been easy for me, especially now that I have reached menopause. I have to constantly work at it. All that stated, there are days when I crave something that isn't necessarily 100% pure. One can only eat so many plates of salmon, broccoli and brown rice . Sometimes you need plate of nachos and a piece of fudge for dessert. Enter Hungry Girl. While I personally wouldn't make these recipes a main staple of my diet, I certainly see no problem supplementing with a few recipes from the Hungry Girl books. It's enough to take the edge off so that I don't feel deprived, yet without going overboard. It works. As far as the sodium content in some of the foods goes, I've learned to make 'tweaks' to some of the recipes. I never fully follow all the recipes exactly as they are written so I try to substitute ingredients with lesser sodium items, or in some cases, I just make sure that the rest of my meals during the day are low sodium so that I can allow for something a little higher in salt. It's all a balancing act. The bottom line is that I am in the driver's seat of my own health. If you are someone who is very strict about not consuming any processed foods, this probably isn't for you. However, if you need a special treat now and then that won't send you to calorie hell, you'll want to add this to your cookbook collection. I have several of the Hungry Girl books and they have been an invaluable resource in helping me stay on my program. I eat healthy 90% of the time, but the other 10% I enjoy a lower calorie treat from one of the Hungry Girl books.


This whole novel was complicated, gave me hope of a happy ending for the characters, and was bittersweet.  I can't go to much into why it's bittersweet because it would contain spoilers.  I didn't consider the book a light read, well, it was a light read at the start and evolved from there.  To be honest, some of it I didn't understand at all, mainly because, as I mentioned earlier, there was more than one or two genres in it.  But even so, it didn't stop me from liking it.  The book is also longer than most, so it will take more time to read.

At any rate give the book a chance.  I'm glad she is still writing even if the characters have some of the same descriptions...smelling like roses, smelling like leather, herculian men, viking men, all the women stood up to their intended...But it's all nice in its own way in my opinion.

1806	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Steamy hot erotic historical fiction is one of my favorite genres and Scottie Barrett does it well. She creates a dark and tortured, but oh so appealing character in Ryder. I loved how the book opens with him in prison and it's not clear where things go from there. It gave me a sense that this was not going to be the average predictable historical romance. Ryder had a lot of depth to his character and I could feel his pain. When Jessie comes into the picture, their chemistry explodes and the sex is off the charts hot. At about 3/4 of the way in, I thought things dragged a bit as they were both reluctant to disclose their feelings for each other and their lack of communication became frustrating. Hence the 4 star review. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining tale. This is my second Scottie Barrett novel but it will not be my last!

On the whole, I found that The Cold Dish had many more comical moments than the television series.  The book provides interesting background on Walter and Henry including their high school and college years and their time in Vietnam, where Walter served as a Marine and Henry was Special Forces.  But if you're looking for the characters to be an exact match between books and television shows, you might be disappointed.  The book characters don't always look like their television counterparts (Walter and Henry are both much bigger guys, Vic is a dark-haired, olive-skinned Italian, Ferg is much older, etc.).  Sometimes their personalities are different.  Turk (Branch in the show) has a lot less redeeming qualities in the book.  But overall, my husband and I are hooked on Longmirethe book and the show.  And I guess its a good thing that we discovered the books because it doesnt look like the show will be back for season 4.  We are already looking forward to listening to books two and three on our next car trip.

As I've indicated in other reviews, my personal preferences for M/M romantic and sexual relationships trends away from dom/sub behavior and relationships, and that is theme in the sexual relationship between Jake and Remi. On top of that, Remi's willing submission further created an inconsistency in his personality between this book and the first. On a more pleasing note, Remi wasn't effeminate, nor as generally submissive in nature as Keaton was in the first book, even with his Omega status in the pack, so that helped. The surrounding story and the appeal of the characters allowed me to still enjoy the book, even with those issues.

This book was easy to read and understand. The book explains many of the scriptures that speak about Spirit filled living. It also uses stories and events from Dr. Stanley's life to demonstrate the scripture meaning. There is also a chapter about Spiritual gifts.


He states, "No promise of salvation is ever extended to those who refuse to accede to Christ's lordship. Thus there is no salvation except 'lordship' salvation." (Pg. 34) Later, he affirms that he is "committed to the biblical truth that salvation is forever," a doctrine also known as the perseverance of the saints: "the point is... that those whose faith is genuine will never totally or finally fall away from Christ." (Pg. 105)
From the beginning I was drawn into the story by emotional highly sexual dream sharing between Captain Sevan Vasil and Lorelei Janelle.  Sevan is a Captain on a ship for Earth's commission and Lorelei is on a planet hidden from earth's knowledge.
* The fight scene didn't satisfy me. It seemed it was edited away, I don't know how to explain it. It felt too rushed, although it had the potential for something more exciting. Maybe it's because it's a short story, but I found the romance was ok, it lacked a bit of action (or angst, even if I admit I prefer the angst at a tolerable level and mine is pretty low).

9880	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	There is only one story on this kindle version but i got it because it was lora leigh would have loved to have had jaid black's as weel.  Lora's story is interesting and has the feel of a preview to a series but since it was written in 2004 and I can find no others I guess she chanced her mind or it was never her intent.  Good read sorry there is no more short story.
I realize that the story is not an exact parallel, Janet and Charles are married 10 pages into the book, Elyssa's father is dead, and it takes place in America.  But it has its own story that captures you and draws you in. I read it in one day, I loved it so much!
9724	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	When I first began THE DARK FAREWELL I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. It had a slow start-up and with so many characters (THE DARK FAREWELL takes place at a Boarding house in the 1920's) to be introduced in the beginning of the story it took awhile to introduce everyone and their personality types. However, once the story/mystery began I couldn't stop reading. THE DARK FAREWELL caught my attention and held it.
With a much smoother narrative, more realistic dialogue, and a deeper, more complex story, Langley has improved greatly on her With or Without series in this second installment. Remi and Jake are good together, and Remi's brother Sterling is utterly charming (high point of the book for me). Jake's partner Rhys and his friends are all strong secondary and ancillary characters, and the threat of Remi's father is far more intense and well developed than the suspense aspects of the previous book. Remi's past is brutal and heartbreaking, and the effects on his personality and character are realistic and traumatic. All in all the characters are likable and the story is sound.

I also had to suspend my disbelief at the action Jane took when following Larry Coursen ("The Preacher Man" another charicature).

Things definitely turn sour the next day when she can't eat chicken wings without hurling and wants to eat the neighbors' dog as a snack. Not to mention the teeth... oh, I meant FANGS. It seems that Nina is now a part of the paranormal population of vampires... and she is PISSED.

Focusing almost exclusively around the events within a fortnight of the death of brother Liam (with recollections scouring decades of family history), Veronica realizes at the very beginning,"There is something wonderful about a death, how everything shuts down, and all the ways you thought you were vital are not even vaguely important."  Her children and husband can survive without her - leading her to think of suicidal thoughts (They don't need me anyway).

524	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	First off, it took me forever to get into this book even a little.  The romance was boring, and I hated the lovers-from-the-past theme.  The reason they split was stupid and juvenile, and.......really?  You're so in love with this woman (after all, he says he loves her about a thousand times with no response, which after awhile, just becomes pathetic) yet you stay away from her for 7 years, screwing every woman you can?  Then there's the fact that Will's character just didn't match what we've seen of him in other books.  He was a bumbling fool in this book.  And Robin?  Well, she was an immature bitch, and by chapter 40, she deserved to die for being such a weak, spineless idiot.  The plot was so-so, and the plot twist of two different murderers was unnecessary and distracting.  I've wasted a lot of money on this author.  Don't make the same mistake.
9649	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I read alot of fantasy, scifi, horror, erotic books.  I was able to pick up this book and understand the story without struggling to remember what the previous stories were about.  The beginning was inticing, descriptions good enough to get the story across without boring me on details.  It was a fast read, wish it was longer.  Not sure if the price was worth it, since it wasn't a very long story (don't get me wrong, it was a normal length story, but I read fast).

694	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I unfortunately started this series with the most recent book and had to go back and start over. I truly do love this series.

Get some tea, your favorite quilt, and curl up with this book, you won't be disappointed!
Home for Christmas is an absolutely wonderful tale about a mature romance between two friends who have long loved each other from afar.  With a starring couple who are both over forty, Kate Davies offers a realistic look at love the second time around for those of us who are long past the first bloom of youth, but still young enough to entertain dreams of love and forever.

8796	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I love Josh Lanyon and so it was a happy early Christmas present to find this as a kindle freebee. A freebee from a known, reputable writer is always a thing of joy. So 4 stars for that. It lost half a star because it was actually not my favorite of his works, and it wasn't as believable as his previous works. I didn't fall in love with either of the two protagonists - James the disgraced antiquarian or Sedgewick,  the unlikely book owner.  Nor did I find the reason for Sedgewick's hatred for the evil potential book buyer sufficiently compelling. So weaker on both plot and characterization, but a weak Lanyon is still a strong book, and certainly worth a read (or reread)

The story thus enables Diaz to examine how nationality, culture, and language become more and more blended over generations (non-Spanish speakers should note that the book is full of untranslated Spanish words and phrases, which can be a little frustrating at times). The segments of the book set in the D.R. under the Trujillo regime tend to be a great deal more compelling than the contemporary storyline. The story of Oscar's mother's childhood and teen years are far more colorful and dramatic than the on-again, off-again romance between Yunior and Oscar's sister Lola, and are definitely more interesting than Oscar's own geeky problems. Fat, obsessive, and devoid of social skills, Oscar makes it hard for people (including the reader) to sympathize with him and his dual dreams of becoming the "Dominican Tolkein" and losing his virginity. The final section of the book, in which Oscar pursues love with the trademark oblivious obsession that has made him an outcast, is pretty much straightforward classical doomed love, and thus the least interesting and convincing.

So much of children's literature is poorly written and a real chore for parents to read, but this sweet classic is sure to win hearts.  Nothing scary, no questionable morals or language here, just wonderful stories of friendship and fun.  We have read the entire book several times through and I think they love it more each time!  It also appeals to a wide range of ages, so if you've got several little ones this is probably a good pick for you!

The Dickens with Love is a book lover's dream, filled as it is with hope, love, and, of course, an unpublished Christmas novella by Charles Dickens.  Josh Lanyon has an unparalleled ability to write a romance that is incredibly sweet without being cloying.  Both James and Sedgwick are interesting, intelligent men that have that everyman scholar appeal plus a little something extra.  I was drawn to them, without being able to put my finger on why, other than Mr. Lanyon's talent for creating endearing, memorable characters.  Like all of Mr. Lanyon's stories, The Dickens with Love is engaging, tender, and irresistibly sexy.  It also has an extra dash of forgiveness and the joy of new beginnings, making The Dickens with Love a holiday treat that can and should be enjoyed all year long.  Like the Stardust martinis James and Sedgwick so enjoy, The Dickens with Love simply sparkles.

It just didn't particularly appeal to me, too many bright colors for my rather drab personality. The story did though, so I reminded myself of the old adage 'never judge a book by its cover,' and I'm glad I did. It's an engaging story that carries you along pleasantly.

The big However attached to the book are the many familiar elements  which were so familiar as to jar the reading experience. While fantasy  can't avoid some derivative aspects, there are rather loud echos of Tolkien  and Lackey that seem too close for comfort. This is not to say that the  book's overall tone is derivative-- it isn't-- it's just that some of the  specific elements will leave the reader with a nasty sense of deja vu. It  also seems that Karigan ends up too much at the center of absolutely every  conflict far too quickly, but-- okay-- that's an understandable trait given  that she's the only main character.

I have recently started reading Scottie's books-I absolutely loved the Carnal Deceptions and The Viscount's Addiction was fabulouly written.

The story opens on a morning in Stockholm, Sweden, with a man leaning on the rail of his balcony, observing the passers-by while he smokes incessantly.  "He was of average height and normal build.  His face was nondescript and he was dressed in a white shirt with no tie, unpressed brown gabardine trousers, gray socks and black shoes."  We wonder why this individual has so much time on his hands.  More importantly, is he looking for something or someone in particular?  The reader is somewhat alarmed when a little girl, around eight years old, starts walking down the street and "the man on the balcony followed her with his eyes."  Surely, nothing good can come of this.

It is best to start from the beginning of the series or you maybe lost as all the  books refer back to other characters.  This book is very well written.  The characters were believable and the story line enjoyable.  There is sex, drama, acceptance and comeuppance for a nasty female character, which was delicious.  Really enjoyed the book.
I'd recommend Boss With Benefits to anyone who wants something hot and steamy, yet, contains a little something more as well. Aside from some formatting issues that caused me to pause here and there, the story kept me entertained from start to finish. Be sure not to miss out on this steamy novella.
What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.

Born to a white mother and black father, this Philadelphia girl embarked on frequent pilgrimages with her dying father to his birthplace in Jasper County, Georgia, and the small town of Monticello (pronounced Monti-sello), at his request and on a personal quest to understand him and his time and place.

In Pig Candy, his daughter helps us understand why this was and is still an important distinction.

I'm not sure I understood if Rosalind was a debt, or if she was owed a debt, and it is not clear how Nicholas paid the debt to Rosalind, or if he paid it to someone else, or himself. It is very mysterious. I'm willing to accept that magic is mysterious, and if the book was written in a more straight-forward way, it would possibly be boring. Really, I had no complaint with any of that.

A sharp wit and a sharp tongue probably help too.  Sharon Rabbitte has all of these as well as an extra-ordinarily wise head on her shoulders.  None of this prevents her from getting into trouble, but it does enable her to cope admirably when she does and so provide Roddy Doyle with a very special central character for his heartfelt book "The Snapper".  Her path to motherhood was not something she chose, but she embraces the opportunity with courage and learning.  Her journey is matched in the book by her dad's uncertain but increasingly caring re-invention of his own pattern of fatherhood.  Their shared story blends harsh reality and compassion into a moving account about life, love and family and keeps you laughing all the way to the end.

Not things I think are necessary for a nine-year-old to know about,  mentioning these things wasn't important for plot development, I don't understand why they weren't edited out.

The love story was so sweet with a slightly rougher side to it.  I like seeing the start of other characters relationships starting to form.  I can't wait to see what the next one has in store.



Dickens is one of the world's great geniuses; sure, he can have patches that are over the top in terms of romanticising a character, and he can occasionally get into preaching mode, but these small aspects are well compensated for by his wonderful ability to create memorable character after character and to create a universe that seems like the one we live in, but somehow just isn't quite.

4026	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	The intent of this book is to use anthropology and cognitive science to "explain" why religious beliefs developed (and are still common) in humans. I started reading this book with the expectation that it was intended as popular science; but it assumed that the reader already had a background in anthropology and cognitive science. Boyer made his explanations using terminology that was unnecessarily complex; and although the meaning could be discerned from the context, it made the narrative into very heavy reading. Furthermore, he made many bold statements without providing evidence, possibly because he figured his readers had a background in this area and knew where he was coming from. The examples he did provide often fell short for me as a scientist--I felt there were too many obvious loopholes to the experiments described, and it was unclear whether these loopholes were addressed. Overall, I think this book may be interesting to someone who has already read a lot of literature in this field, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone with a casual interest, nor as introductory material.

The sex in this book is so emotive and wonderful between the couple that I could feel the air between them crackle. When J.L. Langley writes a love scene, and that is what she did with Jake and Remi because it wasn't just sex, you are drawn into the minds of these three dimensional characters who tug at your heart strings. The other characters were engaging - from Rhys, Jake's business partner and best friend, young Sterling, Remi's brother who thinks Rhys is hot, and all the others who rounded out the story and made it such an incredible read.

2620	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I think there might be a very good story buried in this book.  However, a great deal more editing is needed to find it.  It suffers greatly from wordiness.  Let me back up my critique with examples: At one point Elyssa reached into her pocket and "pulled out a handkerchief she had earlier placed there."  How else did the handkerchief get there?  She also walked over to her porch swing "that was hung out there."  How could she walk to a swing that wasn't there?  We are told in one short paragraph that the heroine's father died suddenly, unexpectedly and prematurely from a heart attack.  Shouldn't the reader be allowed to infer all these things just by mentioning his death with barely grown children, or his age at the time?  The author seems afraid to let the reader make their own conclusions, even obvious ones.

There is little doubt that archeological  exploration has been increasing steadily since archeology became an official discipline in the 18th century. Greater awareness has been one of the factors behind this. Nations have been taking pride in exploring their cultural and architectural history.

As in other projects, politics are becoming instrumental in setting budgets and  priorities .
This book was a bit more melodramatic than the other Heyer books I've read, with mistaken identities, double-crossing, an abduction, a sword fight in an inn, etc.  This is less appealing to me.  On the plus side, like the rest of her books, this is "clean," without any sex scenes, or even any more than a couple briefly mentioned kisses.  There's also wit in her dialogue, especially in Lord Rule's.  But, I wasn't able to enjoy it nearly as much because of Horatia's character.

Instead of the usual view that starts with religion and attempts to make sense of it, Boyer starts with the human mind and its evolution.  He looks for ways in which the design of our brain, in essence that what has made us conscious beings to begin with, has set us up for religion and religious experience.  In short he believes that spiritual beliefs come naturally to us as an artifact of our thought processes.  As our minds evolved to solved survival problems, they began to process information using certain modules.  They also did so without the conscious knowledge or cooperation of the individual in many instances.  As the author explains some of these modules make the concept of deities and supernatural events more compelling.

Though the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamonds expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. Its not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as not serious. And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.

The thing I appreciate most about this book is that Ramsey doesn't try to present some "buy my 10 step program for $500" pitch nor does he promise that getting out of debt is easy and painless.  If it was, most of us wouldn't have a problem.  What he does do is lay out a series of "baby steps" that if followed with "gazelle intensity", will work to get you out of the mess you might be in today.  The first step is to get an initial emergency fund of $1000.  Do whatever it takes...  second job, garage sales, you name it.  Just get a cash buffer so that you can get yourself off the credit card trap.  Once that's done, you list all your debts and start putting as much as possible towards paying off the first one.  Once that's done, then you roll that amount plus whatever else you can afford to the second.  This "snowball" effect can quickly whittle down the number of creditors you have, as well as the amount you owe.  Couple this with a budget and a hard look at things that have gotten you in debt (like that third car or the boat), and you're well on your way to reducing the financial stress in your life.  Or as he puts it...  "Live like no one else now, so you can live like no one else later".  Each of the following steps builds upon the work you've already done, and it's a very logical progression.  The book is also liberally sprinkled with a number of stories from real people who have followed these steps and eliminated incredible amounts of debt...  Totals that are truly jaw-dropping...

Also... someone at NYT should read these before they go out.  The Bridge column last week made numerous references to the missing diagram.

The bridge column without diagrams is pointless, so it should be added to items to strip out -- or to include diagrams with.
Rumor has it that this will become a film. Rachel Weisz is signed to play Georgia, which sounds fine. But there is a bit of a mystery regarding Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell. IMDB, the movie database, lists Colin as playing Lu. However, another report says Russell would play Lu. The other main male character, Jim, is pretty fascinating: he could be played by Russell but defintely not Colin. So I'm not sure which is accurate. I hope that Russell plays Lu, but he could do the character Jim Buckridge with a bit of a evil streak which might be interesting to see.

The plot moves along at a good pace, with the back-story presented in such a way that it does not interfere with the action; and there is a great deal of action.  The battles are bloody and messy; and one thing leads to another with vengeance. The quest to find the missing Lord of Dor becomes the desperate need to stem an otherworldly invasion which will plunge the world into darkness should evil prevail.

I devoured the trilogy.  The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell.  The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children.  Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, Raybourn usually isn't content with just one crime: there's usually a tangle of them, and always had to wait for the end to see every detail unraveled.
PROS: Lila and Hunter are likable. Their chemistry is HOT. The author does a good job of developing these characters so that you really get to care about them. Excellent plot and story development will keep you hooked.

1006	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Since being offered on the Kindle, I've purchased one or two issues of the International Herald Tribune.  It's a good paper, with a broad international perspective.  Just be aware that it's mainly a compilation newspaper that pulls its stories and features from the world's prominent newspapers and news sources, including many you may already subscribe to on your Kindle.  But if you don't already get items like the New York Times Latest News blog and some of the dollar-a-month wire service news blogs (or won't mind the slight redundancy in articles if you do), go for it.  Like the handful of other Kindle newspapers I've experienced, the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune is laid out well, is easy to navigate, and features a generous allotment of photographs.  I'd be tempted to buy it more often, or maybe even subscribe, if the subscription and/or single-issue price was just a bit lower.  But, of course, that won't be an issue with everyone.

Would like to see more from this world. It definitely has the potential to grow beyond this offering.
Every writer has their own unique storytelling methodology/style, and, if this novel is representative, then Craig Johnsons style is one of slow, methodical, every scene drawn out, and at times laborious pace. Nothing gets rushed. It took me a few chapters to get settled into the slow pace, and the very slow development of the main plot. A lot of that slow, methodical pace is spent in the early going with character development. Slow pace will usually throw me out of a story. but the reason I stuck with this story was because of the writing. The writing is excellent. Character descriptions are well done and very creative. The descriptions of the geography were also well done and worthy of praise. It was the writing that held me to the story, not the character Walt Longmire.
I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend "Without Reservations" and "With Caution" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations). While I enjoy the other two books more, this is still a wonderful and entertaining tale.
While I could not give this book a 5-star rating, I did enjoy the series overall. And I am looking forward to Sterling and Rhys' story, as neither of those characters seem to fall into the previous sterotypes I have mentioned before.

2) Its a fantasy, vampire, romance novel. If you like a steamy romance scene, you can skip through the rest of the book and read just those parts. They are the only well thought out/ well written scenes in the book.
2120	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	I am a huge fan of Native American romance.  This, by far was the worst I have ever read.  I actually stopped reading it because I was so turned off.  I believe that if you are going to write about historical fiction, you should at least use vocabulary conducive to the time period. This was so off.  I am also all about steamy scenes and I am in no way a prude, but the language used here was ridiculous. The plot was silly and unrealistic.

Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.

Just when the Dr. Thinks he's clear to get some rest; there is another trauma call. The local hospitals are full; and they're close to diversion themselves. The call that comes through is about a woman who has been left on the side of an embankment that no one caught before. She suffers from hypothermia being that she was left trapped in her car for four hours. As soon as Lorna comes through on the stretcher the Dr. notices right away who it is. You find out later in the story that the reason they divorced was due to Lorna's controlling parents and deception, along with her miscarriage. Eventually they talk things over and realize they still love each other.
Oh, and one more which just came to mind: anything which uses a reference to botany or zoology as a comment on human behavior or the human condition, and then employs quotes from some book on the topic as chapter headers is right out. Which explains my attitude towards this novel. Fortunately, I got it on close-out, so I don't feel robbed.

9855	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	When starting "Devil's Lair" by David Wisehart, the first paragraph caused me to pause and reflect upon the picture the author had painted.  It is 1349 A.D., "William of Ockham walked barefoot through the carnage.  Slaughtered knights and fallen horses festered on the battlefield.  A thousand naked corpses lay broken upon the earth, and in that multitude a few unlucky men survived, weltering in their own blood, crying out for God.  The fighting was over but the dying would go on for days". The vision is surreal, and I had to think about that for a few moments before moving on.


The original story had multiple punctuation errors, namely placing a period in front of words that did not need one, and frequently mispelling Sergeant Gonzales as Sergeant Conzales. There are often many sentences that do not have an end punctuation, and I found strangly enough, after a sentence here and there a single letter, hanging there. I would have though after over one hundred years someone would have at least cleaned this up?

It really went in depth with the main characters and I found myself actually laughing in the later parts when that were finally realized what they meant to each other. Rocco was a most devine character and it took him time to come to terms with what "love" really felt like. I felt as if I was in the same room with them when they argued, it was all so intense and sad at times too. I really enjoyed this book but then anything by Sarah Morgan will be good. That's why it has 5 stars in my opinion. A very good read.

6163	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	You sort of have to ask yourself a couple of questions when it comes to this book and to this series.  First, does the world really need anther adventure fantasy based in a medieval world...something of a typical quest type story?  Secondly, if I do not like the first book; and this is the first book in the series and the first novel by this author, will I give the following books a shot or will I just drop the series and go on to another?
This one is about Brett and Lisa, Lisa is a vampire and Brett is human. They have lived together and been together and run a nightclub together for the past 11 months. Brett love Lisa, that much is evident in this short story. But one night another vampire, one from Lisa's past shows up and has Brett guessing how Lisa really feels about him.
But my major problem with this book is that it is written for young adults. I don't quite understand the purpose of subjecting kids to this kind of story. It is definitely not a cautionary tale (as it might be for adults) as they would be too old for that and it sure doesn't teach them any lessons. The only thing this book will achieve is to scare them out of their sleep due to endless depictions of various assaults which in spite of their vagueness are quite graphic.

Aunt Val needed a good slap from me...karma is all I will say. As I read My Soul To Take before I read the prequel novella, it made me even more annoyed at Kaylee's aunt and uncle....really how dare they be so disloyal to family. How awful to be placed in a Psych Ward when they knew what was wrong with her. Her uncle really should have known better. I am still a little confused as to why he even let it happen, it's not like it was going to go away. Kaylee needed help from those she trusted who understood.

A very nice introduction to this series with this story. Johnson creates a range of characters you just love with enough suspense to keep you wondering as he writes, pushing you to think in one direction. Only to twist it back.
A personal reaction:  I first encountered this book on sale for a dollar in a used book bin in the Brigham Young University Bookstore.  The cover indicated that Frank had hid out for a summer passing himself off as a visiting sociology instructor at BYU.  He was apparently a popular teacher and taught his classes by staying one chapter ahead of the students in the textbook and making heavy use of in-class role playing and other activities.  Quite plausible--as a graduate student in psychology I "faked" my way through my first classes the same way.  Nobody ever caught me, either...

Although "Me and...." drives me crazy, it may not bother you. Perhaps that is the way you speak and write, and you have no idea it is the epitome of laziness in the use of American English; if so, it won't bother you, and you will probably not even notice.



I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.
This short read was ok, but didn't impress me very much as a large part of the premise was utterly absurd.  The conclusion that Lacey jumped to was not believable.  Instead of the myriad of reasons most women come up with for failed relationships - thinking they are not pretty, too fat, too serious, etc.  The only reason it could possibly be is sex.  We weren't provided any specific reasoning for this such as she was accused of being frigid or something.  I also didn't buy the alpha aspect with Nick.  He was labeled that way over and over again, but didn't really pull it off, and act it.  When he made statements such as "you see me as sexless" and I want you to see me as a man.  With most true alphas, it would never be a question.

The Markhat books are pulp fiction with a lot of humor, a touch of noir and a lot of adventure.  The pacing is quick.  The setting is somewhere between medieval and urban fantasy; it's a world not that far from our own with magic and not a lot of modern.  The Cadaver Client starts out as a sad tale; a ghost wanting to leave his wife some money, money he never bothered to give her while alive.  So why not when he was alive?  Well, Markhat has a devil of a time figuring it out--he gets beaten up, chased and even ends up in a casket over this one.  He has the ever-strange Mama-Hog to help get him into trouble and a woman who speaks to the dead to make matters even more complicated.
I like Walt's character as well for his balance. He recognizes talent and he uses the skills of his people well. He's open enough to realize where he's lacking and where Vic is a definite asset---heck, he wants her to replace him as sheriff when he retires.

The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.
The characters were flat and lifeless. The author was disinclined to give any back story on the main characters, so the reader must draw their own conclusions as to the kids' personalities and how they came to be.
Truthfully i liked the very beginning, I thought it was going to be another wonderful read but found it became one that I gritted my teeth a bit more with each page.

None of Chandler's detective short stories except for the very late "The Pencil," featured Philip Marlowe, the hero of all Chandler's books. Chandler effectively stopped writing short stories (again, except for "The Pencil") after his first novel, THE BIG SLEEP, in 1939. Some of his later short stories resembled the novels to come, and their heroes were sometimes renamed Philip Marlowe in later reprintings, for example in THE BEST AMERICAN MYSTERY STORIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY's version of "Red Wind."

I have enjoyed the Dakota Heat series.  In this offering we are introduced to Dakota, who has had to develop immeasurable strength just to survive.  She has had the weight of the world on her shoulders for so long, she has forgotten what it is like not to live in fear.  She is afraid to believe in the strength and pleasure these men bring into her life.  Dakota is a delightful character written with a hard backbone, but yet she is very vulnerable below the surface.  She is well matched with equally strong men Joe and Colt.  These two men haven't lived an easy life, and even though they have every reason to have hardened hearts, with Dakota, they are whole and loving.  There are some very erotic passages that will leave your blood boiling that the author has crafted within a good story.  This is a recommended read!
There has been no further sign of evil in the side of the destroyed Morgarath - but that does not mean another young usurper to his crown won't stand up and take control of all things twisted and evil in their own doomed attempt to run the world.  Nor has there been any more major (bad) characters for the reader to dislike intensely.  Margaroth was brilliantly drawn and represented in the first two books, and in some respects it is a shame that he was killed off so early.  He was evil, but at least he was fun to read about, and fun to hate.

I had forgotten how much I love Anna and Charles, they make such a great couple which is something you really start to see in the next book but this story focuses more on Charles gaining Anna's trust than any kind of romance. The mystery surrounding what is happening within Anna's pack was engaging and I didn't want to put the book down for any reason. If you're a fan of the Mercy Thompson series then you'll love Alpha and Omega as much if not more and if you've not read anything by Patricia Briggs before then this wouldn't be a bad place to start.

There is no overriding message to the story. Thieves get caught. The author (and central character) was probably the best young thief in modern history. Had he been more prudent, he could have retired at 20 to an anonymous Caribbean or Pacific island with luxurious comfort. Instead, the character seemed addicted to the thrill. Payoffs were stashed in a dozen or more spots all over the world. He logged over a million air miles. Countless women and front-line bank and hotel employees were duped by Abignale's charms.

Chapter 8 is about Thera, an island in the Aegean Sea. In 1969 archaeologists discovered a whole city buried by volcanic eruption around 1920 BC. Did this event result in the story of Atlantis by Plato? The uncovered buildings were sophisticated. Chapter 9 discusses the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. Louis and Mary Leakey discovered a hominid skull from around 1.7 million years ago. They were not primates and not humans. The discovery of a complete fossil skeleton said to be over 3.2 million years old was a huge find. Chapter 10 discusses the Tomb of 10,000 Warriors found in central China when farmers were digging a well during a drought. These terra-cotta warriors are detailed with individual features that represented ten different Chinese ethnic groups. This is the largest mausoleum in the world. It records the advanced metallurgy of China from 22 centuries ago.

This one definitely is a departure from Darcy, Elizabeth, Mr. Bennet and even Georgianna's characters as we have all grown to know and love.  Still, I enjoyed this clever take on what could have happened if.  My favorite line in the book occurs in Chapter 3 when Darcy brings Bingley to see Jane in London:  " 'Miss Bennet, it was not generous of me.  I wanted to give you all that is mine, but to my misfortune, I discovered that I only possessed two things which you wanted: another chance for Mr. Bingley and your sister, and a book.' ... His voice carried finality as he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it lightly, trying to store the sensation to memory." Abigail Reynold's is a master at toying with our romantic sensibilities and this courageous departure from the original novel has much to recommend.

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a "dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor,(5) Marx writes:

4095	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	As the author of a popular horror novel, I was blown away by this book. As readers, we get to watch the exciting action unfold from the perspective of the monsters and the human beings - both trying to survive. The alternate dimension is vividly rendered and nightmarishly creepy. The idea of the stone formations above Indian burial mounds being portals to alternate dimensions is inspired and it is a testament to the author's skill that he makes it seem not only plausible but possible. I give this book five stars for being both a suspenseful horror novel and an exciting paranormal action/adventure novel. Highly recommended!

The physical quality of the book is impeccable, with a beautiful slipcase and large font, and of course the original illustrations. What's also great is that the book uses the original British spelling, rather than being Americanized. Of course, you should avoid any of the Disney merchandising featuring the characters, or any of the abridged or follow-on commercial works. While I might not say that the latter is child abuse, what little of it that I've seen has no literary value and is complete junk. Unfortunately, the book's not quite designed to withstand a one-year-old's pounding, and I've already had to scotch tape the spine back to the book. Fortunately, there's no danger of the book ever going out of print and if Bowen ever wants a pristine copy we can easily buy another copy.

None of this would work if you didn't believe in the emotions and Ms. Haymore handles them beautifully. You yearn for what Sophie and Tristan and Garrett have lost, you'll cry for them. This is not an easy emotional journey and at times, you may wonder how this can all work out. When Sophie says, "I want them both", it's not out of selfishness, but out of a deep connection with Garrett, the first love of her youth as well as with Tristan, the new love she's discovered after the years of pain and loss.

It's rare that I completely abandon a book these days. And when I do, it almost always happens on page fifty, once I've had more than enough of whatever piece of the structure I can't take any more. That didn't happen with Hades' Daughter, in part because when I reached page fifty I was locked out of the house and had no other reading material. In any case, over the past nine months, I have struggled my way through one hundred eighty-eight pages of this monstrosity, or about a third of the first book in a series, before the prose got the best of me. I can't really quote you a passage to show you why, because there aren't many passages that don't involve the kinds of subjects that would get a review censored in the places one normally posts a review. Which, honestly, usually means that book is right up my alley; have can you go wrong with almost six hundred pages of sex, violence, and combinations of the two? In short, by writing a Harlequin romance that's too violent (and long) for Harlequin to publish. The premise is interesting, but the execution leaves a great deal to be desired. I'd like to see a really, really good romance author take this on (Marjorie Liu would be a fine choice, I think), but as it stands, it's just plain silly. (zero)

  The author of this book, Laurie Horowitz, includes a special section where she explains how she came to write the book and why she deviated from the conventions of Austen novels. Basically, she has created a thoughtful, compelling book which takes into account the way society has changed since Austen's time - women actually work outside the home, they may be more independent, etc.

A common theme throughout the book is the primacy of personal relationships over loyalties to one's country or duty. This bears fruit when Erak's friendship with Will and his companions enables them to unite the Skandians and the Araluen slaves to fight against their common enemy --- the Temujai (portrayed as people who put their lives and loyalty to the common cause as secondary behind any personal relationships). With Erak's help and Halt's strategy, along with the skills of each of the companions, they mount a stirring defense against the mounted warriors.

In the words of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall: You do what you think is right and let the law catch up. Only, it's not the judiciary's role to make laws and that's why Mark Levin penned his masterpiece Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America. The book came out in 2005 so, as always, I got to its pages a little late. Unfortunately, nothing is going to change in the immediate future so it remains pertinent. Some of you may know Mark Levin's name, but, honestly, before this year I never listened to his talk radio show. After a month I discovered he's the best host out of them all. He also excels at writing. Essentially, Men in Black mirrors his approach to verbal conservatism: it's insightful, concise, and ruthlessly on topic. There's not a wasted word here. What I found most attractive about its narrative is that he makes extensive use of primary source documents. He lets the justices, in their opinions, tell their own tale. The book is a compilation of history and cogent analysis. He discusses specifically several of the 100 justices who have been members of the Supreme Court, and their flaws were readily apparent. They were men, not gods.

One night was all he could offer her. As the title implies, one night was enough for them to get pregnant, even thought they used condoms. They try living together but all he could offer her were just a few days before he had to go back to his job, chasing storms. In the mean time she has a health scare and he flies back to be with her. He also explained why he has been skittish about the pregnancy. He and his partner were pregnant before he met Jane and planned everything out, bought all they needed and such. Unfortunately she had an ectopic pregnancy [where the egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus]. The tubes ruptured and she died on the operating table. Having been in Antarctica at the time it took Mitch days before he got back home, missing her funeral. As soon as she is out of the woods he goes back to work.

If you're a word junkie, you may already know the truth about much of what they include. The bowler hat isn't named for its shape, for instance, but for Thomas and William Bowler of Southwark, who manufactured it. The jeep of World War II got its name not from "G.P." (supposedly for "general purpose") but from Eugene the Jeep, a popular character in the old Popeye newspaper comic strip. But not every inquiry has an answer backed by evidence. "The whole nine yards" supposedly comes from the length of an ammunition belt for a fighter plane's machine guns, nor has it anything to do with the three sails on each of a ship's three masts -- those have both been thoroughly debunked -- but even the likelihood that it originated in the American space program doesn't answer the basic question: Why not "ten pounds" or "seven miles," rather than "nine yards"?

The problem is, "...absolute power corrupts absolutely," and when authoritarian dictators implement these ideas it always results in two percent of the people having everything and the remaining ninety-eight percent having nothing.
What I did like about the story was that the main woman was not a pushover and an idiot. She had spunk, and she didn't let the main man manipulate her like we see in so many other romance novels. I wish there would have been some more history between them instead of her being a cleaner at his office building and instantly sleeping with him the same night she met him. I just hate that kind of storyline. She was a virgin, until she met this dude who was arrogant and quite rude to her, and immediately fell into bed with him? Then she got her 'dignity' back and walked from him because he offended her about something else. It's a bit ridiculous.
First;  Bravo to Lynne McTaggart!  In a world that is overwhelmed with opposing views, black vs. white, conservative vs. progressive, science vs. religion, we have a reporter who not only realized that there is a middle ground that lies unfurrowed between science and religion but a person who took years from her life doing the necessary research and self-education in order to help define what this area is.  Her book is well foot-noted and while her scientific language usage has developed past that of common understanding, she defines this middle ground with well thought out examples and the concise language that it deserves.  I, likewise, have spent the past thirty years of my life attempting to comingle science and spirituality and this book has served as an excellent summary for the travails I have undergone.

I LEARN about new things almost every day on DailyKos. Think of the Kindle subscription as a portal into a much larger world. You will have to turn on the wireless to pursue links to online material, whether it's non-Kos sites or links to the "High Impact Diaries" and choice comments compiled by each day's "Rescue Rangers" (who monitor the universe so you don't have to). However, most of the day's best material is downloaded to your Kindle for off-line consumption, so you'll be able to read "Your Abbreviated Pundit Round-up" (a pointed, sometimes hilarious summation of what the media biggies have written that day) in the lead-lined hospital waiting room. If you want to follow links to the original articles, just turn on the wireless.
But Patricia Briggs explores the opposite end of the spectrum in the novella "Alpha and Omega," which also serves as a springboard for her new series (a sort of spinoff in the same universe as the Mercy Thompson series). It's a tightly written, open-ended little story about an abused Omega werewolf and the unexpected love between her and a very powerful alpha.

1547	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I've become a big fan of Faye Kellerman, mainly after reading this early novel (I had read I think one other, later Decker/Lazarus novel before The Ritual Bath).  In some ways it's quite different from some of the later novels. Kellerman's next-to-last novel, Gun Games, focusing in considerable part on the relationship between 15-year-old "adopted son" Gabe, a musical prodigy, and a 14-year-old Persian girl and precocious opera lover, verges on being creepy. The Ritual Bath, however, is an engrossing introduction to Orthodox Jewish life combined with a solid murder mystery.  It introduces and lays the ground work for many of the characters who are in Kellerman's later novels.  I strongly recommend that you read it first, or at least early on, in your exploration of the generally excellent Decker/Lazarus series.

In Chandler's case he drew strength from his startling use of language to describe Marlowe's environment much in the way a detective would use his heightened powers of observation during an investigation, missing nothing. Marlowe was able to size up, let's say, a sizzling blonde, as a statuesque, full-bodied and ravishing dame and then pick her apart as nothing but a low-rent gold-digger. Of course that never stopped him from taking a run at one or two of them himself and then sending them off into the night, or to the clink, to fend for themselves. He also knew how to blow off a small time chiseler, a grifter, as so much flamboyance and hot air not neglecting to notice that said grifter had moisture above his upper lip indicating that he stood in fear of something if only his shadow as he attempted to pull some caper, or tried to pull the wool over Marlowe's eyes. Or noticing a frayed collar or a misshapen dress that indicated that a guy or gal was on cheap street and just maybe not on the level.

So I recommend the reader enjoy the story as historical fiction. Even if half his exploits in the book are true, it's still an astonishing tale of the expert con.  More importantly to me, I can see how in everyday life--in the workplace, politicians, etc--the confidant talker always gets ahead of the shyer guy or gal who actually knows what the heck is going on.  The USA at this time suffers from a crisis of leadership at all levels in all arenas, as we the people rush to follow the smooth talkers, ignoring the quiet facts.

Chapter 5 tells about the discovery of Machu Picchu in the Peruvian High Jungle in 1916. It is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, one of the most perfect examples of Inca architecture. Chapter 6 discusses Pompeii, discovered in 1748. The eruption of Vesuvius buried Pompeii in two days. It preserved Roman architecture and artifacts. The fields around Pompeii were rich and fertile from aged lava soil. The eruption buried the town in a few hours so the remains are intact and complete. Chapter 7 tells about the Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1947. They provided information on biblical manuscripts. They were hidden during the Jewish revolt against Roman rule in 70 AD. This discovery was complicated by political conflicts.
This is well written, the story is believable, characters are real, all in all a good sit in the shade with a cold drink book.
And, furthermore, I agree with others who present that the inclusion of 21st Century social issues, while of importance seem out-of-place, even awkward, in this story.  We are becoming more aware of handicapped issues and the inclusion of such in our educational systems but can't seem to wrap my mind around why they are presented in JAFF.

3887	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	It was so hard to get through the first few chapters of this book. The author introduces you to the lead characters by having the hero basically kidnap their baby from the heroine. Granted she had run away from him in her ninth month of pregnancy and he wanted revenge four months later and many man hours of tracking them down. The main hero is probably the cruelest male lead I have read in a long time and by the end of the third chapter I was yelling profanities at the heroine to find away to get away from him, but at least I was into the book! However, once they get into Los Vagas their chemistry burns off the pages. Anna desperately loves her baby and Nikos, but she believes he betrayed her and rejected her, so she leaves him. Nikos tells Anna that he would never lover her or be faithful and he plans on revenge due to the fact that he tried to still his baby from him. but as time goes on he finds out how possessive he his towards Anna and the baby. There are some really cute scenes with him, Anna and the baby where he is learning to hold the Michelle. This story starts out really rough, but if you can get through the first few chapter of the male lead's jerkiness the book turns out to be a pretty good read. Not the best in the world but pretty good.

My rating is a 4 to 4.5 star book.  With Amazon I have to go with a solid number and in this case I'll round it to 4 stars.  Given the fun Mr. McCullough has with this book it might be a little hard to believe that I'd round down to 4 stars but the action was a little slower than it was last time and there was a certain predictability to the book.  I was a little disappointed with this and wish things would have flowed a little different.  A major disappointment was watching Eris whimp out.  I was also disappointed that Ravirn didn't grab toward Raven sooner than he did.  Despite these minor disappointments, the ending is very good (the action picks up and brings some interesting opening for future books ( namely Athena, I'd also like to see him work Nike in).

I' am very relieved that John Flanagan has provided us with a re-boost of electricity since the last installment of his, The Icebound Land, was a bit dull of action. This book could had easily ended the series on a happy note... oh, I wasn't suppose to tell you that. But, anyway, be prepared for a lot of hardcore action (although not graphical, since this series is for young adults/kiddies), a bit of fowl language and on-the-edge-of-your-seat-drama!

He's functional and works, so she could escape anytime she wants, but she's afraid to, because she knows his previous victim was killed.  The book is very minimalist (which I love) and a quick read, partly because you won't be able to put it down.

This installment followed two main storylines, jumping back and forth between Will and Evanlyn's predicament and Halt and Horace's journey to rescue them.  Skandia is the "Icebound Land" where the inhabitants are mercenaries, and where Will and Evanlyn are forced into slavery. Halt and Horace must face knights and ruthless warlords that challenge them along the way. With plenty of adventure and suspense, this is a fantastic, fast-paced fantasy series.  The main characters are chivalrous and brave, with high ideals.  This series has become a fast-favorite of mine and my family.

The mystery involving the serial killer has a limited number of suspects but it still was a challenging case with a few red herrings thrown in the mix. The crimes were pretty gruesome and heartbreaking as the victims were only 16 years old. I was able to figure out the killer about halfway through but continued to challenge my choice almost to the end. This is a very suspenseful story with just the right balance of romance. Steven and Jenna are sympathetic characters who seem well suited for each other.  His children and Aunt Helen also provide some much needed comic relief to the story.

Georgiana is in such a state that it is decided to correct her impressions about the engagement when things are more settled. Bingley arrives and his and Jane's courtship proceeds quickly.  Lizzy is kept busy tending Mr D and she is becoming friends with Miss Darcy, but something else happens: she realizes she has tender feelings for him. Darcy awakes and he is shocked to see Lizzy, accusing her of abusing Georgiana to promote Jane's romance. Georgiana is devastated that she failed her brother again, and she feels betrayed by Lizzy. Elizabeth leaves immediately, in tears, but she reconciles with Georgiana first.  Georgiana discovers why Lizzy refused her brother, and because she feels Lizzy is right for him, she starts him on a course for a better appreciation of those whom he takes for granted, and of those he feels superior to. This schooling is very hard for Darcy and we have a few chuckles  at his expense, but he is willing to do anything to win Lizzy. They meet again at Jane and Bingley's wedding; Lizzy tests him and Georgiana is creative in throwing them together!

The indian hero wants to take the white girl captive but can't because it might ruin trade with a passing wagon train and cause his village to get attacked....what?  So for several days they just keep sneaking off to have sex and nobody notices.  Then on the actual day of the trade the indian's white aunt who used to be a captive comes with the indians and none of the white people raise a fuss about them having a white woman.  The white aunt then convinces the entire wagon train to let the girl marry the hero in the spirit of promoting peace between both people.  The prejudice white people not only allow it, there's a priest on hand who willingly performs the ceremony and then and there and they live happily ever after.  The whole story was idiotic and contrived.
Then there are the years of pressure from Lady Catherine for Darcy to marry Anne, the weight of managing an estate with money matters, investments, servants, etc. and the stress of rearing a sister, basically alone.  Yes, we see a side of Georgiana that we do not read of in the canon.  But I think about the age of this teen and of her isolation from a sister, an aunt, a mother, a female friend, etc. with whom she could discuss her budding sexuality and her attraction to or her acceptance of Wickham.  Darcy rarely saw Col. Fitzwilliam, due to the latter's military career and his other close ally, Charles Bingley, is not one who could discern that 1.) Darcy is troubled or 2.) Offer up good advice about any number of situations Darcy had to deal with, much less, his love life.

This novel is really about how fate turns out, and how fate may be meddled with. How gifts may not be what they imagine, and that the time it takes to repair old ills could be forever.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Maya Banks delivers yet another captivatingly emotional read that promises to stay in your memory long after you've finished reading the final page of AMBER EYES.  Hunter, Jericho and Kaya have deep-seated fears and issues which have dictated how they handle situations.  Trust doesn't come easy for any of them but with a lot of patience, understanding and love they all have the possibility of finding happiness together.  AMBER EYES is one of those stories that draws the reader into the plot, allows you to fall in love with the characters and warms your heart with each new revelation.

He also points out that we are concerned with what others may know of us and our activities, particularly of that we might prefer they did not.  The issue of access to information, so important to the social animals that we are, is then projected on these invisible beings, who being invisible have easy access to all information. They become omniscient judges of our activities.

This novel has some of the fantastic world-building I expect of Marillier, but lacks the historical detail I would have appreciated. I didn't really feel the space of the castle, or the thickness of the woods, instead it was more about Jena and her character progression. Nothing wrong with that at all, I'm glad she didn't stagnate like Cezar.

So how does Calvin relieve the tension that everyday life is causing him?  He conjures up elaborate and sometimes morbid road rage scenarios that I'm sure many of us have daydreamed about.  Beware!  The other drivers on the road are about to get what's coming to them.  If you thought Kathy Bates slamming her automobile into a teen's car who cut her off for a parking space in the movie Fried Green Tomatoes was bad, then you haven't seen anything yet! But as our protagonist spirals out of control with no means of hope in sight, reality and fantasy begin to mix and Calvin finds himself behind the wheel and eager to make his vengeful dreams come true.

The author discovered an irresistible urge to "feed My (Christ's) sheep" as she journeyed deeper into this Christ-Life.  This memoir is about how she saw the Gospel as needing to continue to be incarnate - the Gospel is about people touching people in community.  The best way to for her to "preach" this Good News was by opening a food pantry in her Episcopal Church (it is good to know Baptists are not the only ones who get freaked out by such actions).  The struggles, joys, rewards and difficulties experienced in "doing" this part of the Gospel are commensurate with the promises of Christ, i.e. those who will understand this message are the poorest among humanity, those who are most threatened by it are those who have "it all together" and this will NOT be easy.  People are real, dirty, hurt, crazy, hungry and play by their own rules, even those who "get it" will be difficult to love, at times.

Bennie takes the case and then begins to uncover a conspiracy between the cops involved an attorney and even the judge. A retired cop, named Lou, is very helpful. I hope he is used again. The case goes to trial, you don't know until the last if Connolly is guilty or not or is she is a twin to Rosato or not. And after the trail, what happenes to Connolly. It all has a very good twist to the ending, at least one I did not expect.  The action moves better than some of her other books and I enjoyed it very much.

My Soul To Lose, being both the introduction and the shortest, focuses mostly on a single event and a small group of characters.

Given the epic, brilliant, overwhelming cliff hanger type nature of the ending to book two, however, ICEBOUND LAND opens up in a way that, it must be said, is relatively timid.  Sure, Halt and Co are all worried sick about the plight and welfare of Will and young Evanlyn as they are hijacked by some of the storys baddies, and led (presumably) into a life of depraved, mind bending and back breaking slavery, but the two young characters in question are not showing all that much physical or emotional hardship over the matter.

The backgrounds and situations painted by Banville here are simply marvelous.

Also, as one could expect from a medieval fantasy, this book is a bit on the violent side, considering that its about a war.

Montgomery wrote in the standard magazine format of the day, which required a hero or heroine and a happy ending, but she was inclined to stretch the formula in all kinds of directions to maximize the humor, romance, or drama of the story.  Fans of her writing should enjoy the samples in this collection.  Some are as seemingly simple as "Kismet", in which an estranged couple agrees to let their future together ride on the outcome of a horse race.  Some are as heartwarming as "Aunt Cyrilla's Christmas Basket", in which an elderly woman's careful packing for a trip saves the day for a group of trapped travelers.  Some are as terrifying as "The Running Away of Chester", as a young boy flees an abusive situation, not knowing what fate might hold for him.  And there is no end of Montgomery's specialty, romances for star-crossed or even unlikely lovers.

I think that's a valid point, to an extent. I can see how this book set imaginations going and gave hope to the downtrodden, much in a way that the arrival of Methodism in the 18th century gave cause for optimism among the working classes of England. I think given human nature, something like a Communist experiment was unavoidable. Communism had high ideals but human greed and sadism condemned it to failure, and now it should be abandoned and laid aside as a relic of the past. Communism studied as yet another misapplied utopian blueprint is a fine subject to read about, but the real tragedy is that a billion and a quarter human beings are still shackled in the year 2005 to the chains of this hopeless, fatally handicapped nineteenth-century hypothesis.

5901	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Empowering.... That is the word i think, for me, describes Fated by Lauren Dane! We get to feel and go through everything with Megan and Shane. The roller coaster of emotions and the fight for them to make it. Megan is a strong and fierce character and something all of us women should dominate in our own personal lives. It was captivating to see the main male character, Shane, to be the person to have the fears and anxiety of everything that was going on and surrounding him. But for this book, that was a refreshing change. I loved finding out about Shane's family history, which helped explain the reasons and fears he had. Me personally, i will be grateful for all the little snippets that Lauren Dane gave us for the other members of The Warden Clan in Fated. It has been a pleasure finding out what they are doing, where they are in their lives and how much they have changed an adapted. Once again, Fated is a 5 star book that i will recommend to anybody and everybody.
Secondly;  The only people who do not make mistakes in this lifetime are the ones who willing to do nothing more than repeat their past victories over and over again.  Those who dare to probe into unknown territories, peek into truisms to see if they are valid and risk being labeled as being eccentric in their theories and concepts are the only ones who will actually make mistakes.  But they, too, are the only ones that will make incredible breakthroughs that move our world in a forward, evolutionary fashion by their courageous insights and daring.  The reviewers who have degraded this author for her taking questionable experiments and off-the-wall scientists are the ones who are stuck in yesterdays science and are only willing to accept thoughts that have proven themselves over the decades.  While science, during the Enlightenment Era, had been able to move the world slowly away from religious dogma, they now are creating the same ignorant and immovable atmosphere that they originally found themselves into.  They, in fact, have their own set of dogmas, their own set of beliefs that cannot be questioned and have created an atmosphere that there is no reality that exists outside of the small sphere that they have defined.  We live in a world that is not at all the manner that we see it to be nor in a world where we are fully knowledgeable.  We live in an atmosphere where we are trying to measure eleven dimensional space with primitive three dimensional objects.  We live in a world wherewe ponder, but never truly grasp, the simple definition of the words consciousness nor that which is eternal.  No, dogmatic scientists do not meet weekly for Sunday service.  Instead they simply control the reputation of their colleagues, the purse strings for experimentation and the publication power for future writings that prevents new and unique concepts of reality from receiving the attention they deserve.  Please, let us stop locking Galileo in prison because he does not agree with our 1850 Newtonian concept of physics or that Einstein is the final answer for all space-time concepts  We are ages away from complete scientific understanding.  Why must we pretend that we are fully arrived?....

I think my pockets are getting full of the guys I want to keep from the last several Arend books I've read now that I've added Ryan to them.  He was a bundle of everything interesting - contrasted with Max's innocence, his experience everywhere was exciting, from picking places to eat, to the bedroom.  His grief over his brother's accident and even his frustration about whether there'd be any sort of place for him in a life with Max really emphasized how much more mature he was than her (not sure if that was the idea, but it took me there).  He tended to go a little overly-alpha on Max about the vandalism thing, but then she was a little too ditzy about it, so I balanced out the points there.

The book is very straight-forward and attacks things that for years have just been very very annoying to me.  It answered almost every "Why do girls do this..." question that I had quite thoroughly and a even couple that I'd never thought of before.

Set in roiling north Dublin, where humor and family togetherness are the keys to surviving the tumult of the neighborhood, this novel, nominated for the Booker Prize in 1991, depicts real, working-class Dubliners leading real, hard-scrabble lives, often centered around the pub and sports.  Dialogue and dialect make these characters come alive, and the relationship between Jimmy and Bimbo is depicted honestly.

2856	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	The three most interesting books I have read recently concerned occupation forces during WWII, two about the German occupation of France and this one about the Japanese occupation of Malaya.  This particular novel pushes two of my buttons, an interest in southeast Asia since reading Somerset Maughan stories decades ago and a longing to know more about the world into which I was born (1940) and which killed my father in the Pacific Theater of war.  The basic theme of this novel also hits another of my reading interests, the intersection or clash of cultures.

Anyway, Tansy doesn't want to help. The way her talent works is that she touches an object and can see into the souls of those who handled it before her.  But handling that energy takes a serious toll, especially if the soul she encounters is evil or violent. The voices of the victims linger in her mind; at one point she even had a breakdown --and that's why she quit helping the authorities. And why she doesn't want to help Kadan. She is in no hurry to get away from him, though.  He is an anchor, which helps calm the constant barrage of energy that is always flittering around her. She can even touch him without discomfort. And touch him she does.

I was both thrilled with the contents and impressed by this author's ability to transport his reader to another world and make you forget yourself while reading his work. This story is amazing. Steve Peek has a unique talent for building believable characters that you can't help but identify with. This story is very complex and has a lot of elements that I had not seen before, and was not at all what I had expected.

Now Tribe A decides, due to its higher productivity/wealth, it can afford to save more time, adding this saved time to the saved time it used for making fishing nets, and build a boat that will allow their nets to catch even more fish. Being busy building boats, Tribe A allows Tribe B to build the nets--a less productive venture than the new boat-building venture is. Tribe A's greater productivity thanks to fishing boats (and greater wealth thanks to fishing boats) allows for more children, increasing the tribe's population, allowing for a larger labor supply in the near future that will be available for procuring other innovative, labor-saving inventions.

In the final chapter on belief, Boyer discounts Robert Nozick's widely held explanation of religion as `a particular feature of the human mind that creates the whole of religion, a central metaphysical urge that is the origin of all religion, an irredeemable human propensity to superstition, myth and faith'. Yet, rather frustratingly, Boyer admits that the `central question: Why do some people believe and not others? . . . is very likely to remain unsolved'. Overall it seems that the varieties of religious experience rest on the varieties of mental experience and the social utility of following such beliefs within a religion.

There is a deep and wide pool of selfish, helpless, imbecile heroines out there in fiction, but the main characters (Jena) sister, Tati, takes the serious biscuit.

This is the only flaw in an otherwise very enjoyable story, and the only thing that stops me giving it top marks. As Darla reappears in the follow up book, on re-reading "The Cadaver Client", I was inclined to feel more kindly towards it. But on first reading, I felt horribly cheated, and it's that initial reaction which makes this one drop a few points for me. If you love the Markhat stories, you'll enjoy this one, but if you don't read it, you won't lose any continuity with the latest novel. The Cadaver Client sits in its own leg of the Trousers of Time (as Terry Pratchett would call it) and while not essential to the Markhat canon, is well worth the effort. An amuse bouche, perhaps, rather than a proper main course.
I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated how he conveys how much God cares about man.
But I think the thing that aggravated me the most was that I knew who the bad guy was, before there was even a bad guy. I hate when authors lead me around by the nose, like I won't be able to figure it out for myself...or even worse, like I don't like surprises. It also felt like the said bad guy was there as an after thought, just to move the story from point A to point B, with no true substance. Because sometimes he was there, and then he would be forgotten for large portions of the book.  Snooze.  I don't know, maybe there was some deeper meaning there and I just blindly missed it.

'Dead Man's Rain' is a horror story and a narrative about venal instincts, greed and guilt. The set up is a little Maltese Falconish, and Markhat's weary cynicism is pure Spade as he deals with the snobby Widow Merlat and a incredible tales of ghosts and hauntings. But then, just as Tuttle sets you up thinking the plot will be resolved one way, he takes you down another. We learn more about Merlat's family, and her, and her servants, and Markhat reveals the qualities that kept him alive through a bitter and destructive war, in order to save the good and punish the wicked. This is not a romance - there's no pairing in this at all - and that's how it should be for our tarnished hero.

Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first.

When readers today think of County Wars, the Lincoln County War and the Johnson County War are the two that come to mind.  Hough refers to the county war in Wyoming as absurd, probably because the version of the story that he knew best was the sanitized account by the Wyoming cattle ranchers association.  The independent ranchers side of the story in that dispute did not come out until later.  Hough dedicated a chapter to the Lincoln County War and another chapter to the lesser-known Stevens County War.  The Stevens County War, a struggle between Woodsdale and Hugoton for the county seat in southwest Kansas, was a land-boomer struggle that is largely forgotten today.

But, the remaining characters of the novel, without a doubt are some of the most colorful and unforgettable that the reader will ever encounter.  Grandfather Smallweed, who has to be physically 'shaken up' periodically, is the greediest and most opportunistic of mankind.

8456	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Jo Nesb writes, in his introduction to the reprint of 1967's "The Man on the Balcony," that "artists stand on the shoulders of those who have come before."  Indeed, the husband and wife writing team of Maj Sjwall and Per Wahl, in their Martin Beck police mysteries, helped set the standard for crime fiction that is often imitated but rarely duplicated.  "The Man on the Balcony," skillfully translated from the Swedish by Alan Blair, is based on a real case that occurred in Stockholm in 1963 in which two small girls were abducted, sexually abused, and murdered.  This chilling story brings home the obstacles that law enforcement officers face when they attempt to identify and apprehend a suspect who lives beneath the radar and leaves few helpful clues.  Even as they sift through mountains of data and telephone tips, the jaded detectives fear that all their efforts may ultimately prove fruitless.

The first two books in the series concentrated on either the main characters involved or family members. Even Maggie was only mentioned in Wolf Flight. Who knew what Vivian Arend had in store for readers in this really sweet and quick read?

In this volume are 67 of Lovecraft's stories. I would argue that this collection is not necessarily "definitive," but at least it provides a good overview of his work. Here are many stories in his Cthulhu mythos. For the uninitiated, these are stories of ancient gods who are at best indifferent to mankind's existence (and at worst outright hostile). There are also stories that stand alone and are creepy in their own right without the presence of ancient god-like beings. Many of his stories were originally published in the early pulp magazines, but don't let that questionable pedigree scare you away.

The first aspect of this book that stood out to me the most would have to be the writing style by far; the author writes in a way that combines concise, insightful advice with a relaxing and almost 'conversational' tone that keeps the read from feeling chore-like in any way whatsoever. Admittedly, I have read many self-help and positive thinking related books over the past few years, but I can definitely say that "The Science of Getting Rich" is one of the highest quality ones that I have had the pleasure of coming across so far and I would even say it comes close to being on par with my all time favorite "Think and Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill. Highly recommended!


Sevan is a lion shifter whose lion DNA is so watered down it doesn't show up on the Commission scans, enabling him to work for them without being discovered and either killed or sent off planet. He knows he can't shift anyway so he'll probably never be noticed. In fact, most of his crew, including a number of his relatives also fall into this category. This is good news for the inhabitants of Sargaidia when they find out because of a prophecy they hope will come true, but bad news for the vampire sorcerer, Stegian, whose ship crash landed there and has spent the last hundred and fifty years trying to control or rid himself of the inhabitants, especially the Janelle family.

Craig Johnson (at least in the first two books of the series I have now read) is a patient writer whose work demands a certain amount of patience from its readers.  While the highly atmospheric Longmire books require that the sheriff deal with the worst kind of criminals imaginable, it all comes together for him and the reader at a very methodical pace, a pace that perfectly fits the remoteness of the sheriff's geographic location and the limited tools he has to work with.  In the meantime, the reader intimately gets to know the little town and many of its inhabitants.  Then, finally, when all hell breaks loose, the reader feels as if he is right there watching it all unfold firsthand.

It was amusing and I really liked the book and I recommend it.  However, the book title really has nothing to do with the plot.and I had issues the the reality of some of situations the women got in.
The first thing that crossed my mind when I started reading this was "whoa, Dracula meets The Godfather". But let me tell you, I never enjoyed either of those books as much as I did this one. Once the scene opens on the first murder, it's a case not so much of whodunit, as how are they going to stop the one whodunit.  Cameron's characters are clearly defined, but there is a fine line between evil and EVIL.  The good guys and the bad guys are all, or at least mostly, vampires. What makes them different from each other is the basic premise that our hero Michael states in talking to Tori: a vampire is only a magnified version of the human that he or she was before being turned. If they were bad as humans, they are really bad as vampires.

5605	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Edgar Rice Burroughs is best known for two creations: John Carter of Mars and Tarzan of the Apes. A lesser known series is the Caspak Trilogy contained in this work, but in many respects it is his most creative and provocative of all of his formula fiction. Imagine a land where all creation and evolution is taking place simultaneously, and you have the germ of a great story. Burroughs does not use this theme well, falling into his repetitive formula of placing his characters in constant peril at the end of each chapter, but that was a staple of pulp magazine writing in the early 1900s, and it certainly paid off for him, so I give him the benefit of the doubt. The sheer magnificense of the concept alone makes this a valuable work despite the formula writing, especially for Burroughs fans.

I enjoyed Gabriella in that story, so I wanted to read about how her relationship with Drummond came to be.  In the editorial review section of Amazon, they give an excerpt that involves Drummond spanking Gabriella.  This is the heaviest that the BDSM gets in the book, so I am surprised that it was chosen as an excerpt, as it is a bit misleading about the book.

Where this book shines, though, is the dialogue between the characters and the inner monologue of the characters. I chuckled and laughed out loud in several places, and that's so incredibly rare for me, as rare as it is prized. Both characters have a bit of a potty mouth, and Jo in particular has a very...earthy way of describing things, and I found it likable and amusing. I found Jo likable and amusing, actually. There were even moments in this book that surprised me with its insightful observation.

The only thing I don't like about the books is the rather stereotyped Indian mysticism. Walt gets visions or prophetic dreams on a regular basis and I generally could have done without all of this. Well, with one exception.  I did rather enjoy Virgil in HELL IS EMPTY, his latest book.  To give as few spoilers as possible, the book relies heavily on themes and images from Dante's INFERNO, and so it is appropriate that Walt should have a Virgil as his guide, even if Walt himself is well beyond the middle stage of life.
Macho hotties with a heart of gold add up to Trouble Comes in Threes.  A common plotline made more interesting when you have three Alphas pitted against an intelligent, seemingly demure newscaster.  Trouble Comes in Threes is a predicable story yet the writing brings the characters alive and gives readers a fresh, sexy tale.  Pleasing and fun, Trouble Comes in Threes is an altogether enjoyable story.
Anya Bast's TAKEN delivers on all those `out of this world' fantasies woman possess.  Anne's spunky attitude and refusal to blindly accept everything Caleb and Van tell her kept me chuckling - and kept her men guessing at what it would take to convince her to stay.  I was expecting a fun read when I selected this story but in no way did I anticipate the emotional impact it'd have.  Caleb, Van and Anne are a trio that truly capture the imagination and leave you salivating for more.

Bengen's and Bierwirth's studies back in 1994 were seminal events in financial planning in that they found 4% was the maximum SWR (Safe Withdrawal Rate). If the stock market experiences a prolonged drop early in a retirement period, SWR's higher than 4% will cause the retiree to exhaust his portfolio before this death.

As the author writes in conclusion, "Human minds did not become vulnerable to just any odd kind of supernatural beliefs.  On the contrary, because they had many sophisticated inference systems, they became vulnerable to a very restricted [italics]  set of supernatural concepts: the ones that jointly activate inference systems for agency, predation, death, morality, social exchange, etc.  Only a small range of concepts are such that they reach this aggregate relevance, which is why religion has common features the world over (pp. 324-325)."

A whole lot happens in this book from point 'A' to 'B' and a good deal of detailed steps that add many dimensions to the large cast of young adult characters. Eventually, they come into contact with more people and their camp becomes the village of Petersburg--named for one of the founding members who helped establish peace at the camp at the start of the story. The happenings during the expansion will disturb many readers brought up in the black and white societal view delineating when a child becomes an adult. Also probably rural and urban upbringing will see the relationships that occur in this book differently as well. Many people will be offended or have argument with the later portion of the story.

Max and Ryan have great chemistry from the moment they meet.  One of the things that I loved about their story is that there was a real progression to their relationship.  Even though they were immediately attracted to each other the reader gets to experience how their relationship progresses from mere attraction to a lasting type of love.  Max meets her brother, Ryan meets her family and friends....my point here is:  They get to know each other as they fall in love. Discovering why and how the characters fall in love with each other as it happens to them is one of the reasons why I love reading romance.  Sadly, that isn't always illustrated in words in every romance novel.  Especially in erotic romance where the loves scenes tend to make up the entire relationship.  That's not to say that Turn It On doesn't have its share of steamy love scenes...because it does, but it also has scenes that bind them together as a couple too.

This book was written to enlighten people about the United States federal budget and it accomplishes this goal with both simplicity and style. As everyone knows, the federal budget of the United States is gigantic- the largest government budget in the world with revenues and spending levels that make it several times larger than even the largest corporation. These larger than life numbers often create confusion on the part of the public, and one of the main goals of this book is to put the numbers into perspective so that readers will understand them. Through the use of graphs, charts, and comparisons, the authors succeed at making the numbers understandable. For example, there is one section that helps the reader understand how much a billion dollars is by showing what this amount of money could buy. To quote one example, a billion dollars is enough to pay the college tuition for 45,000 people at a private university for one year. To understand how large a trillion is, you have to multiple this figure 1000 times, resulting in some mind- numbing figures. Now, when you consider that the United States total debt is more than nine trillion dollars, you can understand more fully just how serious the problem is.

4656	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	The Knitting Circle is a searing portrait of a mother's loss, of her grief at her five-year-old daughter's death from meningitis, and of her healing process...she joins a knitting circle and slowly unfolds herself, awakening from her grief, as she learns to not only come to terms with her terrible loss but also finds kindred spirits amongst members of her knitting group, who each have their share of stories of loss, hope, and survival. It is a heartfelt story about how one learns to go on after enduring a tragedy, the loss of someone dear, and the fact that the story is semiautobiographical [the author herself lost her daughter to illness] makes it all the more real and poignant.
I don't really want to say anything about the plot beyond what is stated in the blurb. Since this is a novella going beyond that would give too much away. I will underline that the main character is a teenager, so I'm assuming this is a start to a YA series.

Nicholas Van Tassel is a stuffy professor at a small college in New Hampshire in the early 1900s.  His stuffiness, at first, rubbed me the wrong way.  But I've been pleased with Anita Shreve's past books and was determined to keep going, despite this.  It was also a little difficult to get used to the way the book is written.  The stilted words as Nicholas tells the story of falling in love with Etna and their life together was an initial drawback, but after the first 40 or 50 pages, I was at ease with it.

During the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.

My only objection was that she killed off Elizabeth's sister Jane early in the book but at least this disaster served as a way to bring Darcy and Elizabeth together so they could get to know each other better. It allowed her to see the kinder, more caring side of Darcy which made her falling in love with him more believable.

The story is told from both Lilith's and Lincoln's point of view, which gives the reader an insight into their thoughts and feelings. I was completely engrossed from the first page and struggled to put my Kindle down long enough to eat lunch! Thank goodness it was the weekend, else I would have been rather annoyed if I couldn't get back to reading it until later! I picked up the book again, and was quickly pulled back into the story. A different prophecy has come to light, which involves not only Lincoln, but Lilith herself, and needs to be fulfilled. The surprising twists and turns kept me turning the pages. Lincoln has a few secrets of his own, and has a very interesting back story; I was intrigued by it. There are also some other interesting characters in this story, and a few familiar faces make a welcome return. Daniel, Lilith's boss, is another one keeping secrets and Mark, her boyfriend, is a total jerk! Meeting Lilith's father was an interesting experience - I would love to know his story one day. It was also nice to see Prophecy, Valentine and Venturi again, even though it was only for a short flying visit.

Caleb's Woman is a wonderful story about love, adoption, acceptance and determination, all rolled into one fast paced erotic offering.  I liked how Ms. Vaughn gave us a bit of the background as to how Sommer came to be living among the Wulfen, or as some may joke, raised by wolves.  I also thought she did the story justice by not making the characters go after each other when they were younger, but to let them both mature to know what they want.  I thoroughly enjoyed the lessons that Ms. Vaughn wove into the story about how over protective parents can sometimes seem suffocating.  I think Caleb's Woman is a solid addition to the Torrid Tarot series.

In the mean time, Halt, who shows more of an emotional side, goes off the deep end since the loss of his apprentice and ends up being banished. Taking advantage of no longer having his ranger duties, he sets out after Will and is accompanied by Horace (who received secret permission to join him).

Normally all of that would make for a disaster of a story that ends up not working well on any of those levels.

I did get a number of important points out if the book. Fotr example, all the years of carb counting I read books that hinted alcohol did not have carbs as such, but anyone with sense would avoid it if all possible.  I believed that authors were just raining on the parade instead of saying 'GOOD NEWS, GET AS DRUNK AS YOU LIKE ON THIS DIET!!' the glycemic index I assume is the same in every book showed the same  < 'less than' sign it did for the meat and other protein foods as having no carbs to speak of . the text dais that alchhol could make you want to eat more, but that was all.  So let me give you the good news, you can get as drunk as you like on the diet!!  Now I don't drink often so when I do a very small amount works real good.  And given some very disturbing things happening at the time (what the I Ching calls 'misfortune from without', not something I caused to happen) and I was finding one a day of those little bud-a rama fake 8% margueritas for over a week  and binge watching historical costume Korean soap operas was making my life a lot less stressful.
For the most part, what kept me reading it till the end was the prose. As a writer who is new to the industry, it was more of an exercise in adjusting my mind to great writing by reading quality writing. You write what you read just like you are what you eat! With me just working on my first work of fiction, it was not about the content but more about a lesson in "wordsmithery" and "verbal tapioca" as it's been called.

It's difficult from a reader's point of view to read about a slightly trashy, morally questionable heroine. In the hands of most other authors, this girl would have been the 'bad guy' trying to break apart the hero & heroine. I applaud the author for making her as gritty as she was portrayed. The down side to this book was that it felt wrapped up too quickly at the end. The end felt like there was still more that needed to be talked about or the scenes needed to be broken up / expanded / what-have-you. That's the main reason why its a 4 star (actually, I debated whether if it really desereved the 4th star - but the hot 'scenes' made that extra star a no brainer).

It's actually a book filled with 'gossip' about the caesers more than their military exploits. Filled with intrigue and scandals. If that interests you then you will find this enjoyable.
While Ranger's Apprentice borrows from already-established fantasy tropes, it has been marvelously popular with young readers of fantasy. John Flanagan's elevation of a ranger character, someone more gifted at stealth and marksmanship than brute force, has fleshed out an often-neglected portion of fantasy literature. His reliance on themes of loyalty, bravery, endurance and friendship leave young readers in safe hands as they learn to navigate dangerous waters on their own.

The only real unbelievable part of the story, for me, was the 'Chief': a thirteen-year-old boy who took over as the leader of the camp.  During the age (adolescence) when testosterone abounds, an older boy most certainly would have tried to capture the flag from protagonist Mike.

All of these faults would be easier to cope with if the book were simply bad, and therefore easily dismissed--but it's not. The setting is under-explored (the magical elements in particular often feel like a pseudo-Celtic fairy world), but Transylvania is a pleasant change. A number of sub-plots and a sense of magic keep the reader interested, even when the direction of the story is obvious. And most promising of all, Jena and her sisters have the potential to be spirited, independent young woman--interesting characters in any setting and any sort of novel. There are just enough promising aspects to keep the reader hoping that the book will improve, and so it's all the more frustrating when it does not. I can't possibly recommend Wildwood Dancing. It has some good bits and has the potential for many more, but it never becomes enjoyable. Instead, the story is bogged down by frustration and predictability, and it never rewards the reader for the labor of its 400 pages. Avoid this book--there are many similar novels (even if not set in Transylvania) that are far more successful.

These typos should only trouble the most demanding and don't hinder the telling of a very insightful story. I look forward to reading more from this author.

Outside the bars of prison and facing his new life in Christ, Preacher is confronted by the enemy on many levels.  First, he has a secret that may ruin his friendship with Barnard Jenkins, who has been instrumental in showing him the way to God.  The secret is one he shares with Barnard's wife whom he wants to give an opportunity to come clean first. Then, there are his living arrangements.  How will he be able to stay in the same home with the mother of his children in hopes of building a family and still remain close to God?  And lastly, his sister is still in the business and desperately wants Preacher back as her partner and she will do anything to get him back.
Now what would really be nice is to have a story about Rodney and Maribel.  Plus it would be interesting to find out if Tiffany's life was really as perfect, as she pretended.  I seriously doubt it since she was such a witch to Tamara.  I would also like to know if Renata really divorced her husband.  It would be interesting to find out if he cheated because she was so shallow.  These books leave a lot of room for spin off stories about the supporting characters.  I think Jordan and Natasha's story would be really interesting too.  Although I wasn't crazy about Man of Fate, this book more than made up for it.
The story is well written and has some interesting characters and plot twists along the way.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre and for [...] why not give it a try.

The idea of the stone formations above Indian burial mounds being portals to alternate dimensions is inspired and it is a testament to the author's skill that he makes it seem not only plausible but possible.

8897	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	It's not likely that you will find a mystery that hews more closely to the classic format  for "Murder in a stately mansion with a domineering, tyrannical old person who controls the money". This is the variant in which the relevant group are made up entirely of family members or old "retainers". Most every author of classic mysteries has resorted to the device at least once, some have made it their favorite setting. In 1942 Heyers penned this version which certainly has one nasty Master as its dominant beastly one in addition to the usual quaint, weak, theatrical, determined, overawed, frightened, frustrated dependents. Heyer draws the characters well, although the number of them make the less relevant somewhat difficult to separate from each other. The story moves along at a leisurely pace, giving the reader a chance to sort out the players and get a feel for their traits. We know who dun it before the crime is committed, or.........that you will have to find out for yourself.
That said, I read Dead Man's Rain first and had so many questions that I emailed Frank. What's a Jerk? Which war was this, where is this set, etc. Silly me, still forgetting that this is a fantasy.

3303	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I've been reading a lot of World War II books lately and needed a break from the heavy reading, so I ordered up this book for my Kindle. I'd heard of Faye Kellerman but never read any of her books. I always like to start at the beginning rather than dive into the middle of a series. For one thing, when a series begins oftentimes the author's protagonists are fresh and more 3 dimensional. As time goes on, too many times in a series the author gets tired of their creations and simply write to satisfy their fan base. Anyway, in this book Kellerman introduces a duo that is definitely different from any other two protagonists I've seen...one is a detective in a sex crime unit, and the other is the female target of a crime in a yeshiva (which makes her a very religious Jew). This introduces the reader not only to a good mystery/crime but also to a chance to learn about another culture, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The history and the religious information made the people become more alive in the book, and a lot of the problems of the growing attraction between Decker (the cop) and Rina (the woman in the yeshiva) becomes more understandable when the rules and laws of the Jewish religion is explained.

Desperate to provide for his family, he decides to sell the mules and take a job elsewhere in Kansas building a castle.  He loves his wife but sees her growing discontent with her lot in life and wants to prove himself to her.  They are both stubborn and argue before he leaves.
Doing Dave Ramsey's money makeover isn't easy.  It requires sacrifice and maybe even being ridiculed by friends and family when the rest are enjoying the good life while sacrifice might mean driving a beat up car while paying things off.  The magic words are "in cash" and not credit. Credit cards have been touted as the way to go, but they are our worst enemy.  He talks about the illusion of wealth of the middle class or even people who have expensive cars and homes, and reminds us "not to try to keep up with the Joneses, because the Joneses are broke."  Pretty good advice in my opinion.  Making a budget is crucial and sticking to it is even more crucial.  All the forms for budgeting and other financial forms are in the back of the book.  I have no credit cards and pay only in cash now.
There is very little downside to this entertaining book, but I will mention blood and gore beyond what I consider moderation, so I reluctantly withdrew one star. I was a bit confused by the ending section (did I miss the toll booth signs?) and wondered if it was primarily to calm us readers down after the last carnage.

But why do our minds work in this manner? The social interaction among chimpanzees is highly complex, yet they aren't religious. Why did natural selection favour the evolution of a religious-prone mind? Boyer's response is that it actually didn't. Rather, religious ideas are parasitical upon our cognitive processes. Natural selection favoured, say, our ability to decouple or our moral instincts, and religion emerged as an inevitable but unintended by-product. (If you pardon my teleological language!) Thus, religious ideas aren't really necessary for survival. However, they are more or less impossible to get rid of, being rooted in our very brains. In a sense, the atheist Boyer thus draws a pessimistic conclusion concerning the future of religion. It will always be around! He also admits that there is no good explanation for why some people, like himself, become atheists. It's some kind of natural variation, and that's all we can say.

These people were all you, and you are them. I was you before you were born and you will be me after I am gone. That is the meaning of family." This reminder from an old Chinese man to his half-caste grandson is a likely point for anyone who reads A GIFT OF RAIN to enter its spirit, no matter who you are. This novel is about family, and a very complicated one. It also is about one's sacred self whom must be obeyed.

"Kossacks," as the members call themselves -- an ironic fun-poking at uninformed people who believe it when they are told these people are communists -- are an independent, spirited bunch with wide-ranging interests, talents, and employments. Hardly "just a bunch of kids," many are professional people (even some famous ones), and most of the diarists who rise to prominence behave professionally no matter what their age. Sincere and honest glimmers of personality shine through, however, which gives the writing a spirit, depth, and humanity that you'll never find in homogenized, regurgitated talking-points fare.
The Qur'an states that Muhammad is dead and in the grave, whilst Jesus is in paradise.
Personally I'm sick and tired of "forced" relationships wherein magical forces MAKE the characters have a relationship. It's usually a sign of a writer's laziness in writing about love, or worse. But Briggs actually pulls it off -- despite the mystical wolf-mating between Charles and Anna's lupine sides, their budding relationship is a genuinely touching one, full of protectiveness, respect and growing trust.

This brilliant novel paved the way for others that followed it.  Not only do the authors underscore the traumatic aspects of police work, but they also emphasize the changing nature of society.  People no longer look out for one another as closely as they once did.  We are anonymous faces in an uncaring universe.  Ironically, with all of the time and energy that the police expend, sometimes it takes a lucky break, not brilliant deductive powers, to solve a tough case. With its sardonic humor and psychological analysis of the sickness afflicting a small number of twisted individuals, "The Man on the Balcony" is as disturbing as it is mesmerizing. Over forty years have passed since this book was first published.  During the late sixties, there were no cell phones and no DNA analysis.  Computer technology was in its infancy. Nevertheless, this novel is still as fresh, timely, and compelling as it was back then.

Three pages into Lisa Scottoline's sixth novel, Mistaken Identity, I wasn't sure I was going to make it to page ten. Scottoline opens the novel with her protagonist, Bennie Rosato, walking into the county prison where her newest client is in residence, mentally rattling off statistics that we've all heard a million times, most of which are, to say the least, on shaky ground as far as their worth is concerned. It is a horrible opening; thankfully, it is also short. The book improves tremedously on page four, and stays improved for the next five hundred plus pages.

The list of suspects is unusually long. Two years earlier, Pritchard and three of his high school classmates had been tried on charges of sexually assaulting a mentally challenged Native American girl. The four were convicted but received only minimal punishment and a lot of local people, including the victim's family, are still hoping that justice will be served, one way or the other. It now appears that someone seeking revenge may have all four of the young perpetrators lined up in the sights of a Sharps .45-70 rifle.

This is a dark and haunting book. It will not make you happy to read. Page by page, Scott shows us more sadism and mind control, how he makes Alice fear not just for her life, but for that of her family. How he controls every aspect of her life, from what she eats to where she goes. This is a disturbing book that utterly lives up to its name as Alice floats somewhere in between true life, her previous one, and the one Ray has made for her, where everything from her name to her clothes to her size has been altered, distorted, turned inside out.

Love it or leave it, Facebook has done what Zuckerberg intended it to - it has changed the way we conduct our social relationships - and thus changed society itself. Employees, employers and public figures are re-evaluating how they manage their very public profiles on Facebook, with some pundits predicting that rather than people tending towards circumspect and professional Facebook profiles, society will just come to accept that Facebook will reveal certain aspects of our lives that we don't necessarily want public, and not judge too harshly. Even if you don't have a profile yourself, there is no way you can prevent others from posting photos of you, or revealing personal information about yourself (although one might question why said acquaintance is doing so) so perhaps a society that doesn't judge our drunken photos too harshly is more preferable to trying desperately to keep such things from the internet.

You must remember there is no nice way to present child abuse. A young 10 year old girl is on a school trip to the zoo and is separated from here friends. She is found by Ray who takes her and for the next five years she has been his slave, having to endure repeated sexual abuse daily. Now despite starving her to keep her thin and underdeveloped, waxing to keep the appearance of youth, and hormones to prevent her from maturing, she has grown up and Ray doesn't like that. It is time for him to find her replacement just like she was a replacement when taken. And this means her days are numbered as she knows Ray killed the last girl. She is a Living Dead Girl - dead inside and soon to be dead outside.

In Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.


I also had trouble digesting the names of the characters.  The author used a close approximation to pretty much every single character from Pride and Prejudice.  Janet for Jane, Chad for Charles and so on, even naming the company Pemberleo.  This was way too cutesy.  I think it might have been better to let the readers discover the parallels on their own.  Another way that the story was spoon fed to us.

It almost seemed to me that this was written by someone who really didn't have a grip on the original story, or who maybe heard it as a child only and never went farther than that.

He was so attracted to the h and when he planned to dump her, she dumped him first. The h was lovable but not spineless and I liked that the H was affectionate. A nice, enjoyable and quick Harlequin read.
So when he meets Tabitha, it's like he's almost single minded, but at same time, he wants nothing to do with her, because he knows what will happen if he involves himself in her life.
4) The gender issue. Hey, I'm a girl and I once was a teenager. I will admit at one point, all I cared about was getting a phone in my room. I was extremely shallow with my clothing, makeup, friends. So no surprise at some of the girls' behavior in this book.  However, for ALL of them to be such sheep? The two girls who join the "inner circle" (the group in charge) admit that most of their acceptance by the guys  is because they're the "girlfriends." and then the Chief blurts that fact out loud. Reaction?  Nada. I think a few girls toss their hair and/or stomp off to pout. But that's really about it. Geez would it kill to have the girls actually gang up and retaliate a bit?
Before I dive into a deep though provoking, off topic tangent - the book. A girl just my age is walking her pup and is hit by a car and they both die - tragic, but she ends up in heaven and what a heaven it is! She is surrounded by all the things she wished and coveted while on earth plus more. BUT she has to write an essay about her ten best days and prove that she deserves to stay where she is. This is where the meat of the story unravels and you learn about her from her childhood to the day she dies.

Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? [W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? [W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel? In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a unified synthesisa unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.

I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.  I've got a real fondness for Jane, Antonio and Santos, but I have to confess it's Lily and Jean Jacques battle of wills that really holds my attention and makes `angry sex' so very appealing.

Horace and Halt's trip through Gallica (France) is an absolute blast.

She lived in an tight knit community centered around a school, and was one of the few who had outside experience.  When there was a brutal rape, she ended up being the one who worked best with the police.  The sense of community and its isolation from the mainstream plays a large part in the story.  Some of the locals are indifferent, some curious and some hostile to this community. There is mystery and even murder and hints at a blossoming love story. I found it a satisfying read.

He could have completely cleared her mind if he would have just told what he told the reader, that of the 2 years she has worked for him, he has not been with another woman sexually for at least a year and a half. That would have let her know that those women were just set ups by his mom and that he only wants her. Another thing was her constantly thinking that his family would not approve even though they are nothing but nice to her and include her in everything. Also, the fact that he would not just tell her how he felt. He knew she thought some of their together time was work related and just kept laughing about her questions about notes instead of just saying we are on date. It was good in general though.

But each book has gotten better, the characters are developing and the wordsmiths skills are improving. It's as if the author's writing skills are growing as his characters are growing. This book adds delemmas that come with growing up in the interpersonal relationships of the main characters. Plus its a fun read!

Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.
Dakota Cassidy is back with the 2nd book in her 'Accidentally' series, "Accidentally Dead".  The same three heroines from her first book "The Accidental Werewolf" are back and this time it's nasty-tempered Nina's turn.  After deciding selling makeup just wasn't her thing, Nina went to school and became a dental hygenist.  Her first day on the job, one of the patients has a bad reaction to the anesthetic and BITES her.  Two days later she wakes up with some wickedly long fangs!  What to do, what to do?  She calls her recently werewolfed friend, Marty, because, HEY, werewolves and vampires...close enough.  So Marty, Nina, and Wanda (the only normal one left) decide to beard the vampire in his lair...er, something like that and off they go.
I enjoyed Rosalind's personality. She is very sensible and good-humored, even when dealing with trying circumstances. I loved the way she stood up to her step-mother-in-law, who was dreadful in a very satisfying way. You could tell she grew up among Sherbrookes. She had the Sherbrooke "voice".
I read "Cry Wolf" about a month ago, and at the time I was confused by the beginning.  It felt like a whole chunk of the story had by-passed me somehow, and since "Cry Wolf" is the first book in the Alpha and Omega series, I wasn't sure what had happened.  The answer is that Briggs wrote a prequel novella called "Alpha and Omega," which covers the critical period of Anna and Charles's first meeting, and her rescue from a twisted wolf pack.
Henry Standing Bear as Walt's best friend is there to assist him in finding the suspect. But Henry is also a suspect as he is related to the brutalized girl.

The cover is just as disturbing as the book. I loved it. How messed up can a human being be? How can awful experiences change you, shape you?

Definitely a must-read.

Although Cherney ends up scaring the heck out of readers and teaching you to probably think twice before flipping off some little blue haired lady driving with her blinker on, his overall story is very real and likable.  His everyday characters are believable, and as I've said, almost maybe a little too real.  Anyone who has ever been stuck in traffic will probably think Cherney is a mind reader.  He has highlighted something as everyday as road rage and used it to pen a nice psychological and entertaining thriller. Despite some minor editing problems, Red Asphalt is a joy ride to read.

2) So, teens will be teens. Referring to my comment #1, the sex between the teens, though slightly unsavory, is realistic in the end.  Now, oddly enough, the premise for bringing them all together is the fact they were all attending an abstinence camp.  Whizz goes the irony! sorry, though, there were no religious connotations at all in the book. Nor did these seem like your bunch of bad behaving kids sent to labour camp. Is there really, really such a thing as an abstinence camp that is not related to the church? Did the author just choose this setting for the irony?

 "The house looked as if it had never seen a coat of paint. The gray planks warped and strained against the rusty nails, which bled dark-red streaks from years of rain."

  What I found intriguing was how Horowitz managed to have a strong, independent female (Jane Fortune) at the heart of this book while still maintaining the mannered tone of an Austen novel, quite a feat to pull off. She does this by setting her tale in Boston, a city which still has its share of people who care about social class. She shows the subtle distinctions between those with old money and those who are newly wealthy, but does so with taste and a deft touch. Jane Fortune is one of those who come from old-money aristocracy but who is feeling more and more out of date, feeling that managing a trust fund and the family foundation may not be her life's goal. Her "charmed life" is beginning to feel more and more like a cage and not the Eden it used to be. She also misses the love of her life (who, thank goodness, is about to appear again).

Since it was taking me forever to get to the print version I had of this, I actually pulled it from the library on audio disk so I could listen to it on my daily commute. I quite liked the reading voice at first, since it seemed to match the character, but I discovered after several disks that I probably wouldn't want to spend much time with this character if all I ever got out of her was this flat, rather monotonic slightly southern twang which wasn't so peachy after a while. Nevertheless, I managed to listen all the way through which was more than I can say for several other audio books I've had to endure!
5838	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Michael Card gives us an inside look at the oft-overlooked Simon Peter.  It's rare to read a book about Peter particularly from a Protestant perspective. Card focuses on Peter's emotional life. Card does a good job of getting readers to use their imagination to understand what Peter went through at key points. His insights on Holy Week are particularly profound.
Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: quiet, shy older men, sexy clever ones, blunt ones, generous honest ones, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).
I really enjoyed this book and I actually ended up liking this book better than Carnal Deceptions, book 1 in the series. Ryder is betrayed by his own family and put in jail for a crime he did not commit. Sadly, Jessie's family is just as deceitful. So, neither want to give their trust to another person after being so betrayed. Add to that Ryder's additions problems and it's not easy path for these two. However watching these two learn to trust while giving in to their explosive chemistry definitely made for an excellent and entertaining read. You won't regret getting this especially if you are a looking for a sizzling historical romance.

There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.

The narrator Caroline Hunt has a pleasant voice, but the recording was hard to hear - as if too many low tones and not enough treble.

It is a testament to the O'Brynes that I enjoyed the story as much as I did despite having one of my number one literary pet peaves in it. This is when main characters are presented as more morally advanced than their peers because they adhere to normal modern civic mores. It comes through in little things like insisting on bathing regularly in a historical time period when hygiene was neither understood nor appreciated, or expecting fair labour (or gender) laws in what would otherwise be a feudal state. Express a desire to see change, sure, but surprise that others adhere to what would be the norm of the day, no. Like everyone else, the main characters would know no different. I generally find it smug and condescending, and Fayne's story is no exception. Despite this one major drawback for me, I really liked Budding Magic.

McTaggart's writing is easy to read but full of well-documented, cutting-edge science.

Reading through the Manifesto one can see the basis of a system which was not only an effective for mobilising political movements, but came to influence intellectual debate for the next century.

I LEARN about new things almost every day on DailyKos. Think of the Kindle subscription as a portal into a much larger world.

3917	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This book is good and advances Langley's werewolf universe nicely.  The characters that she created in "Without Reservations" appear and continue to develop, especially Jake and Remi.  Langley made clear that they were intended mates in the previous book, but kept Remi from discovering that fact.  He learns it early on here and Langley does a good job of developing a credible plotline for the two to become lovers and mates, and much more.  I won't give any more away other than to say their relationship affects their wolfpack in ways that show Langley developing the "rules" and "facts of life" for her fictitious werewolves in ways that were not clear in either of her two previous works in this series.  In fact, the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that in several ways, characters in earlier works were not consistent with some of the "rules" she brought out in this work.  Also, the Remi we see (and become quite fond of) in detail in this book is consistent with the Remi we saw late in "Without Reservation," but does not seem like the same character who pitched a royal fit when he walked in on Chay and Keaton making love in the earlier work.  That made me a bit uncomfortable in the last book, but it worries me more in this one.  Still, both quibbles are minor, enough to downgrade slightly to four or four and a half stars (instead of five), but the characters are a delight, many interesting new ones introduced, a despicable villain introduced, and the way paved for at least one more (probably a whole series) of additional books in this universe.  If you like Langley, you'll enjoy this book and should buy it.

What part of me did this book pique? I don't know-some part that responds to faith and hope. The narrator calls faith biological. Is it really? Is it caught up in the coding of what makes a person who she is? And do some people lack it? Do we need nothing more than the right words at the right time, or the wrong words at the wrong time to fill this biological urge? Is this the reason why some people believe in nonsense, because the wrong words filled them at the wrong moment? And is this why other people eschew faith, because it isn't in their biology?

In fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism couldn't have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based, interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.

The only thing I didn't like was the way the story dragged on in Will's half of the novel, which is what took one star out of the rating. Half the book to narrate sailing and slavery?  Not the wisest decision. But I have to salute Flanagan's accurate description of seasickness and drug addiction, which I have experience with (the seasickness, not the drug thing).
This book, and her other award-winning novels, deal with life choices and the promise of unconditional love God offers.

Big mistake.  Missing pasta, I tried the Fettuccine Girlfredo.  I searched high and low for those darn shirataki noodles.  Not living in an urban area, I was out of luck, and had to resort to online ordering.  It ended up being very expensive.  Ah well, I thought, if it satisfies my desire for fettuccine without a prohibitive amount of fat and calories, it'll be worth it.  So I hopefully commence.
FINAL DECISION:  I loved the relationship between Tansy and Kadan.  They are in such need for love that it is beautiful to see them both blossom when they find one another.  I dinged the book only because it is more violent than others in the series which is something that diminished my enjoyment.
But alas for romance. The _Analog_ space-drive articles petered out after the middle of 1962. The Dean drive came to naught. We never did discover a Tom Swift or a Dick Seaton.

All you need on a blistering cold day is a hot cup of chocolate and a steaming hot book to cuddle up with. Enjoying the Show provides the steam with whipped cream on top. A total chick book with its quirky comedic parts: a group of women who put the ladies from Sex in the City to shame and a man even a grandmother would drool over. I found myself with an uncontrollable grin as I read how two beautiful people with less than stellar social graces came together for one fiery encounter after another. Marie Harte did an excellent job creating two characters, Gage and Hailey, you couldn't help but love as you laughed at their growing relationship.

8988	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	The first half of this story reads like an early Greg Egan, posing questions on topic ranging from the nature of our experiences, ethics of euthanasia to politics of drug control. Despite some part of exposition being somewhat flat, mostly delivered through monologues, the reader does get drawn into considering those problems*. The end, sadly, devolves into a plain vanilla cloak and dagger story of megalomania and corporate greed, but does leave the protagonist, and the reader with him, with a tough if a touch contrived dilemma at the end.
And of course over a series of books Chandler expanded the Marlowe character, expanded his range of emotions, detailed his growing world-weariness, his growing wariness, his small compromises with that code of honor that he honed back in the 1930s.

The guy who sometimes had to dig deep in his office desk drawer to grab a shot or six of whiskey to help him think things through.

9694	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	The book was very imaginatively written and gave a good description of alien life in a parallel dimension. The beginning of the book did drag a little as the author spent a little too much time on the minutiae of daily alien existence before getting to the meat of the story. The description of the alien's technology and their ability to project their inner power (yar) to sense and control the world around them is fascinating. Also fascinating was the description of this world we live in from an Alien's perspective. There are a lot of spiritual and progressive concepts in this book as well as enlightened ideas about how we should treat each other and treat the world we live in.
The thing I love about Halt is that he will find ways to get things done without breaking his code of honor.  That makes him the best of friends and yet the most implacable of enemies.  He will let nothing stand in his way - not even duty or a friend.  I felt badly for him when he had to stand before the King, his friend, and be judged for his actions, but at the same time I was proud of him.  That's the true sign of a writer bringing a character to life.  In my mind, Halt lives.

by Linda Wisniewski
Saul Bernstein, a Jewish history teacher originally from Baltimore, and Patsy Carlson, a dancer from Chicago, have recently moved to the town of Five Oaks, Michigan --- one of the many "dusty, luckless midwestern cities tucked away inside the folds of the map" --- out of Saul's youthful idealism: he wants to bring high education to the plains of rural America, to reverse the simpleness of middle-class life. It's an unrealistic, outsized, almost elitist dream, but it's also one of the few things about which he feels sincerely. Yet, as a well-educated Jew in a small midwestern town, he feels hopelessly out of place and unable to relate to his students or even his neighbors.
And so the fun begins.
But always his writing is both an exhilaration and a challenge. Whether you will enjoy it or not depends upon your tolerance for Spanish slang and ubiquitous sexuality. The reward is getting to know a slice of history, a vibrant immigrant culture, and a hero who, for all his faults, still manages to arouse our sympathy.

Remember, Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth despite her poorly-behaved family. No matter how lusty he may feel, she is going to be Mistress of Pemberley and his sister's mentor.

Shreve is one of those rare great authors who is equally at ease writing about any period. One sees the clothes, the furniture and the architecture in lively, captivating detail. Even in sharing his want, Shreve shows the reserve appropriate of the time: "Had it been at all within the realm of possibility, I would have crossed the distance between us and forced her face to mine. I would have dug my hand into the small of her back so that she was pressed hard against me. I would have lifted her skirts and run my hand along her thigh and tucked my fingers into her stocking. I would have done all those things, and perhaps she saw this, for she drew herself together in an instant, as if she had plunged her wrists into icy water. Of course, I did nothing, but I cannot help but wonder what might have happened between us had I been bold enough to touch her then." Such restraint is palpably evident throughout the book --- and rightly so. It is the tenor of the time and Shreve is a master of time.

Through much of the book it isn't clear where the story is going - what is Mia's ultimate goal?  Compare this to a typical mystery, thriller, or romance where that goal is obvious early in the book.  With New Coastal Times you're guessing as Mia aims at a series of intermediate goals.  Initially it is to survive and reunite with her husband.  As each goal is met Mia aims for something a little bit better.  In retrospect, the logical story arc takes Mia to a point at which she settles in a life as comfortable as she can find given the circumstances of the vastly changed world.  In the beginning, what that is or will be is a mystery to Mia, just as it will be to the reader.  We have to discover what that is along with her.

Jake and Remi are a great couple and I think they were much more interesting than the couples we met in the previous books in the series. The only thing that I didn't really like was Remi's submission to Jake: it was pretty hot to read, but I think it was overdone sometimes, the way they switched to the sub/dom mode wasn't always smooth, but it's really a preference of mine and it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.

An entire Temujai army is camped in the wilds of Skandia in preparation for a killing assault on the capital at Hallasholm. More to the point, they are blocking the Araluen party's escape route.

6644	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Initially from the prologue this seems to be a science fiction story about alien invasion however that is really a clever ploy to set the scene where a mountain community is stranded and have to survive with only their own resources. Unlike most "survival / stranded / desert island" stories because of how this is set up civilisation for this mountain community is not destroyed so they have the resources that are there and do not have to build from scratch exactly. Initially the story is set in a teenagers' camp with no adults where a resourceful 13 year old becomes "chief" and leads the camp through a number of adversities. The story is simply written and the problems encountered are too easily overcome but all of the characters and locations are well described so that I can visualise them. Although there is some killing it is not too graphic. I thoroughly enjoyed the book even though there were little twists to the plot it all held together very well and perhaps because the problems were easily overcome it had a feel good factor that is rare these days.

I won't talk about police procedures, I'm not an expert.  But I am a librarian--and just a quick look and I could find out that Illinois uses States Attorneys not district attorneys.

Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.
Gregori is hot, funny and a vampire. He turned Nina by accident, and now he has to deal with her. He doesn't like her at all, and I liked that, because it was different from the usual. He hated her foul-mouth and her attitude, but he feels responsible of her. Of course she doesn't want his help, and their relationship was very difficult to start (several chapters). They obviously started to like each other, but both were so stubborn. That made the romance it this book slower, but don't get me wrong, it was still hot, and they do get their "happily ever after".

I found Seventh Circle to be very exciting. Although I liked the Prophecy Trilogy very much I liked this one even better. I cannot say anything about Heaton I have not said before. She is an amazing storyteller. One aspect that I really enjoy about the series is that the vampires do not cater to the human race. They are driven to survive, and that means there is no guilt over the kill. They have the ability to mate and love, but their species is not sugar coated.
For example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.

If I want something more in depth, I can go look it up later on my computer or buy a whole edition of a paper. This is an extremely good value and I recommend it to all of my friends who are Kindle owners (I even recommend it to Kindle owners I don't like).
Up Pops the Devil, is a realistic story of God's love and our choices.
I definitely felt for the lonely child so caught up in her parents dramas, though I thought the book itself could have been more tightly edited.  It does get repetitive in places, and seemingly builds toward narrative peaks that then somehow are revealed as only plateaus.  I also didn't appreciate Mascia's moments of self-loathing when she speaks of wearing size 14/16 pants; it was off-putting and didn't seem to fit into the narrative.

25	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This is a terrific period novel by the author, and she very capably captures the social mores and customs of the times. Dealing with desire and obsession, secrets and betrayal, the book certainly delivers a rich reading experience that will keep the reader riveted to its pages.
I highly recommend this book and all of Ramsey's products to anyone needing a financial makeover.
There are issues in the book with which I disagree with Mr. Levin.  For example, he seemed to be contradictory in his commentary on Korematsu v. U.S.  A main contention of the book is the problems with judicial activism and the Court not deferring to the Executive in areas in which it should.  Then he cited Korematsu, which was essentially a case where the Court did defer to FDR regarding the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during WWII.  I think that internment was terrible, but I do not think that this decision was judicial activism.  It certainly seemed to be a case of deferring to the Executive.
8580	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	OK there is a disturbing trend starting to develop.  In the 8th book in the series, her own dog Rusty was violently injured.  Now in this 9th book, her clients cat was murdered.  This animal cruelty trend is very ugly and not needed.  I hope the author stops the animal cruelty and killing in her books or I shall stop reading everything by her.

Also good "what ifs" and/or continuations of P&P are those by Kara Louise, Susan Adriani, and Pamela Aidan.  Linda Berdoll has written 2 very saucy books that continue the P&P story.  Her first, Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife, I started reading several years ago when I was a JA purist.  I didn't finish it because I thought it was too smutty.  I recently read it all and enjoyed it.  I read it with the mind frame of something Moll Flanders-esque.
5943	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I tripped over this novella and only read it because I love Briggs' Mercy Thompson books.  Wow.  I put it down, thought about it, and re-read it.  Anna  and Charles have become two of my favorite characters in the Marrok's world!  Anna lives and breathes from the first page, where she's walking home from a dead end job as a waitress in an Italian restaurant on Thanksgiving Day!  By the time she's home and reading a news article about a missing boy, a boy she knows was changed without his consent and sold to a laboratory, her character is revealed in spades.  She picks up the phone and calls the Marrok's number, knowing he will do something about it, also knowing that if her Alpha finds out she told, he'll kill her - or worse.  Then there is her first meeting with Charles, the Marrok's son and enforcer, at the airport!  It's a scene you will never forget!  It's the start of the most unlikely - and the most tender love story, that I've ever read!  By the way, Science Fiction Book Club had an edition called ALPHA AND OMEGA which starts with this novella and includes the next three full length novels.  You can also find it second hand on-line, or all of them are on Kindle.  Just don't miss it!  It's that good!
2438	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	It really was not fair, I was (am) enjoying a novel, I pick this book up (it looked so lonely sitting on a table in our den, I am such a sucker) read the Prologue then was unwilling to return to the novel until I had finished reading the remainder of this book.  The story of how Sara Miles, Granddaughter of Christian Missionaries, daughter of avowed Atheists, Liberal-war correspondent-activist-homosexual-Atheist herself went into a church, took Communion and could not stop what that meal did for/to her is a one that is difficult to be halted once the telling of it has begun.

Sadly, It suffers from 1 slight problem. The characters felt a tad flat. They were well rounded enough for the purposes of the story but when you actually think about it they don't have much depth to them. Mating is all that seems to matter to them. Not to mention that the male character doesn't go through any growth, character-wise, in the story. But, as I said, because this story doesn't actually need to go to those lengths to make it's point, the characters are good enough.

Dani is a believable character, that is easy to like. The men in this book are sexy cowboys through and through. Rowe is a hard worker while Justin was always a hard player. The differences make each one appealing in their own way. The sex scenes are very erotic. This is not the story of a traditional love, but it is just as strong and romantic. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes hot Texans! - Ammie

8758	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I love this series, but I can't say I really "enjoyed" this story. However, it is absolutely the finest portrayal of the dense male I've read in a long time. This guy doesn't get the concept of "Actions speak louder than words," or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you're making a few mistakes you should listen to them. But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.

There is also a sweet romance woven through this book. I didn't feel like it was the main focus, but the back and forth between these characters is so natural you can't help but be swept away by it. When it looks like there is no way they can ever be together, you ache with Aislinn.
4619	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I can't express how much I loved this book. It is most certainly not for everyone but if you give it a chance, you'll find great beauty in it. It is about a young mixed race boy in Malaysia right before WWII. Then the Japanese invade Malaysia and it shows how horrible war, all war, is and how many innocent people are affected. Like now in the Middle East.
The facts of the story are a mysterious set of papers and a couple of buried keys belonging to a 16th century alchemist.  Hot on the trail are modern fundamentalist Christians who believe the papers hold the secret of the exact date and time of the 'Rapture' and a heart surgeon's family to whom the keys and papers have been passed down for 17 generations.  Complicating the search is the surgeon's involvement with a transplant patient who received his dead brother's heart and the brother's fiance and best friend. References to cell memory, windows between the 16th and 21st centuries, numerology, astrology, British history, the Masons and Rosicrucians make this a very different and interesting story, indeed.

All in all this is a wonderful romantic suspense novel. This is the first 5 star rating I've given a book in a long while, if ever and it is well deserved.

Some of this is stuff you may know, but Dave uses real life examples of folks who have transformed their lives - providing inspiration and a sense that you're not alone.

I don't know that I would have expected Darcy to host his servant's son's wedding breakfast in his home - that seemed just "over-the-top".

Jeff tells it like it is and lays everything out in an easy-to-read manner.  Their research is extensive and their surveys were done by a professional team of analysts.  Even though it is written primarily for men, I learned a lot on why I think the way to do and that I'm not alone.  I would suggest everyone engaged to be married read this book during their pre-marital counseling.  It could save a lot of marriages and couples a lot of grief.

- Lots of fun, accepting secondary characters. Jake's pack is awesome; I really enjoyed reading about their camaraderie and their loyalty to each other.
Additionally, I very much look forward to reading the other 5 novellas containing the exploits and romantic conquests of the other members of the "Archangels."

 The movie is worth viewing too. But, as the author reveals in an interview at the end of the book, the film is not completely accurate and is "Hollywoodized" in certain scenes. Abagnale, according to himself, actually conned more people, banks, airlines, and ladies than the film portrays. At the completion of this book I felt not only better prepared to become a con-artist myself, but to also aid in their capture as well.

Veronica's first-person narrative jumps around over four generations. The earliest passages tell how her grandmother Ada may have met her future husband; the latest ones extend some months beyond the funeral, and relate to her own family life with a college-lecturer husband and two daughters. Several things gradually become clear. First, that much of what Veronica narrates as fact may be misremembered, reconstructed, or the wholesale products of her imagination. Second, that her main concern is to trace the causes of her brother's failures, which we begin to recognize even through the glow of her fierce love for him. And third, that Veronica herself is also in trouble, struggling with a crisis in her own life and marriage, that only the act of writing may help her to resolve.

For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.

Court Appointed takes the stereotypical "important person needs protection and falls for the bodyguard" story and gives it an interesting twist.  Making both parties men changed the dynamic of the story considerably, especially when Jackson thinks Trey is overreacting or treating him like a woman.  Sexy, determined Trey and stubborn Jackson are both likeable characters.  The love scenes are hot.  The suspense angle was well done for the most part, and coincidences and red herrings kept it interesting.  Really, the only flaws in this book were Jackson's father, whose over-the-top, controlling behavior seemed a bit much, and the resolution of the stalker angle, which I thought was abrupt.  Overall, Court Appointed was a hot and entertaining read, and I give kudos to Annmarie McKenna for turning an old romance clich into something new.

  However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, thats no error. He didn't pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.

Every bit the loser and misfit, Oscar's story is told by a funny, streetsmart and omniscient narrator, Yunior, a college roommate and sometime boyfriend of Oscar's older sister, Lola, a Siouxsie and the Banshees-styled athletic goth , who also takes on part of the narrative to give a more rounded perspective of Oscar and his mother Beli, as well as the love-hate mother-daughter relationships that are passed down the generations just like the alleged fuku.

It is a warm story in that two people, each with a considerable amount of what our "helping professionals" gently label as "baggage" meet and over a period of time move to a successful conclusion.

Dom is an absolute `force of nature'. He is handsome, brilliant, driven and has an innate ability to comprehend people's motivations and to predict how they would act in a certain set of circumstances.

Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge takes place while Myers is getting settled in the mountains after moving back from Arizona.  Jackson does a great job of combining the the everyday, seemingly thousands of little things that have to be done during a relocation, and the investigation of the death of Isaac Starling's best friend. I really relate to the Myers character as a real person; she's not  perfect, just someone who likes horses, likes gardening and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty doing real work. I'm not a big fan of flashbacks (there's one really long one) but Jackson handles it beautifully so the reader does not lose sight of the current story.  My own love of doing research in graduate school makes me admire Myers' determination to leave "no stone unturned" to find the killer. This one may cause me to buy my own Kindle.

The erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.

Communistic ideas had a few good things though, they wanted to get rid of the poorest as well as the Bourgeois.

9914	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I loved the first book in this series and was applauding the author in my last review. Then the author must have fallen down the rabbit hole and started writing just like every other romance author because this book was terrible. First of all, it wasn't a romance. It was a mixture of never ending plot twists that weren't cohesive at all thrown together with a sex scene which was totally out of place. How many misunderstandings can one couple encounter? This author would have you believe weeks could go by where the two main characters couldn't have a two second conversation which would have solved everything. Usually this kind of thing doesn't bother me but this book DRAGGED. Very boring, very poorly written characters and a HUGE disappointment when the last book was so good. Sometimes you just can't make a sequel.
4856	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I'm a Janeite, so this was my kind of book.  I think it would be too slow and repetitive for anyone not in love with Jane Austen, her people and her time and place.  I liked being in on her somewhat snide evaluations of people she meets and situations she encounters, and the letters do soften the 'authoress,' Jane Austen, for me and let me see more of the daughter and sister, Jane Austen.  I loved the little details of daily life, writing to her sister and asking for two pair of stockings or some gloves from a particular shop or supplier, the contemplation of new dresses, the yardage to be purchased and then given to the dressmaker, the women of the family sitting in the parlor at their 'work,' making a dozen shirts (by hand with tiny stitches) for a brother soon to go to sea, the breakfasts, teas, dinners - with the food and drink seldom described.  You'd think they didn't eat!  But then, this is England, not France.  Anyway, the book is a time travel vehicle.  People die.  Babies are born.  Mothers die.  Fathers remarry.  There are constant flirtations and courtings.  There is the endless finagling for the right mate, someone of equal status with money, and not too awful.  Jane and her sister don't seem to take the deaths very hard.  I suppose with someone always dying, and untimely death being so much harder to avoid,it was a matter of course.
For the price it's sold for, it's overpriced. Wait until it's down to a dollar. Better yet, when it's free.

Wisehart finds words you had no idea existed. His writing is well-suited to e-books because you can highlight a word and find its definition if you so desire (a word of warning, the dictionary function does not have many of the words in this book and you need to use the Google or Wikipedia functions to track them down). Or you can save yourself the trouble and simply enjoy the novelty. You may never have encountered the word "costrel" before but when the character unplugs its stopper and takes a drink from it, you can easily conclude it is a pouch for carrying liquids.

Ultimately, this book left me feeling hopeful. I've read my share of literary books, and most of them are filled with hopelessness. The author could have ended this book in so many bad ways, and she chose not to. I can't give away the ending, obviously, but I wish I could because the image Enright employs is a perfect one for bringing a detached heroine back to herself.

The trouble begins on page 5 when we are shown the first of a set of graphs. All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.

The concept of time travel and the explanations of the paradoxes is very clever. Character development is almost always excellent. Some of the characters are a times a bit shallow but some are also very well fleshed out.
It's been months since Leslie walked away from the allure and abuses of the Dark Court and the two loves of her life and went the equivalent of solitary fae. Going to college, seeing a therapist, and trying to make new friends, it hasn't been anything resembling easy. But it was the right decision. And Leslie knows that. She just wishes her heart would remember. That it didn't race every week when Irial sits across the street from her study group and watches her, silently letting her know he's there. That he loves her. He will keep her safe. Depending on the day, the hour, the slant of light passing through her empty apartment, Leslie wishes just once she could break one of the two defining rules that form the shape of her life now. No talking to Irial. No seeing Niall. With the former and the current Dark Kings, the guidelines "look but don't touch" and "listen but don't look" may be exquisitely hard to follow, but they go a long way toward keeping Leslie the kind of safe and independent she relies on these days. Meanwhile, Irial and Niall circle each other warily, quietly dancing around their loss of Leslie and the impossible chasm that is forgiveness and reconciliation. The three of them push on every day until an outside force alters their routine abruptly and it becomes clear someone who knows the intimate details of Leslie's past is intent on using her (and those who love her) for their own purposes. And Leslie realizes she may be forced to break one of her rules in order to protect herself and the two men she loves.

Although Ky had been certain she would pursue a career in the military, she quickly turns to the family creed of making money.

Calvin works a boring job as a courier, and just getting to work on time adds to the misery of his existence.

From the descriptions of the people in the cars next to him, to people on their cell phones, ladies applying make-up, to Calvin flipping through the morning show radio stations, it is a scene all of us know all to well.

Levin does a very good job of showing many areas where this has occurred including citing specific cases and providing hundreds of footnotes.

I submit again, you have nothing to lose. The promise it makes is that you have the power inside you to make things happen...Sounds like a good idea, even if a little brainwashing is involved.

While Scott does a tremendous job of relaying Alice's story, it is one that is extremely difficult to read.

Ryel has been living a lie, but have no fear, all of his misconceptions and preconceived notions are quickly unwound and rectified when his long lost uncle (who just happens to be a wysard) comes to take him back to Markul where he belongs. Being thrown headfirst into "wysard" training is draining and (to be honest) a little daunting, but not as daunting as the very sudden death of his mentor. Finally realizing that his mentor is stuck in the wraith-world (or held captive by a malignant sorcerer, as it may be) Ryel sets out to rediscover a long lost spell and set him free.  Can he pull off the unimaginable? Who can he really trust? And more importantly... when he finally gets what he wants... is it really what he wanted?
Although this is the third book in the series, it can be read and enjoyed without reading the prior volumes.

Ryder's immediate reaction is to assume all 3 have swindled him and from the looks of his estate impoverished him as well. As punishment he kicks out his cousin Lewis and tells Jesse he will be taking advantage of his marital rights-she will also have 30 days in his bed before she will be in prison with the others. She protests her innocence in the whole affair and tries to show him she was taking care of things the best she could. Opium, Laudnum and alcohol are never far from his reach, making it difficult for him to really see things clearly. He does not trust her and she is falling in love with him. When she starts actually making references to her absence in 30 days-he starts to feel he would rather not lose her and asks her to stay and help rid him of his addiction.

The trouble with husbands, Margo finds, despite their skills in plastic surgery, is that they can become snippy, bad-tempered, verbally abusive, and generally a pain in the proverbial.  Margo's husband goes a little too far whilst driving to Cannes for a medical conference, and his reaction to her deficient map-reading skills is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Impulsively, bravely, and perhaps a little uncharacteristically, she leaves her irritating husband of ten years when they stop at a motorway filling station.  With no real clue where to go or how to get there, this action marks the start of Margo's French `adventure' and the path to self-awareness, confidence, and love.

 There is a saying that there are no new stories, only new ways to tell old stories. Ms. Silkstone took the original Alice in Wonderland, and deftly wove it into something uniquely her own.

In fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism couldn't have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based, interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.
Another aspect of Mr. Johnson's writing is a tendency to write quite a lot about the area where the story takes place. Depending on your tastes this can be wonderful, or drag down the story. If you like that sort of thing you'll learn about the weather, the land itself, the Cheyenne, the Crow, and even the architecture of the buildings from that area. Of course, you'll learn quite a lot about guns and rifles. If you don't like that kind of stuff, reading about another storm working its way through the mountains will drive you nuts. I'm fine with that stuff since it all went to character development and helped set up some of the more dramatic scenes.

This book really had SO MUCH potential.  If only the author had expanded the book by putting in some subplots about the other groups that where drawn to the gathering place.  Then the conflict at the end might have made more since.  I am glad I got this for free and being a short book, I didn't end up wasting too much time reading it.

3637	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This third book picked up where it ended on the second book.  It entailed the life of Will and Evanlyn as slaves in Skandia, and the journey of Halt and Horace upon rescuing Will and Evanlyn.  There were times that my heart was in my heart due to the suspense on Will and Evanlyns escape from slavery.  I got a little frustrated when the chapters on Halt and Horace were longer than Will and Evanlyn.  I guessed the author was illustrating the prime of Horace in battle while accompanying Halt to rescue his lost apprentice, Will.  The book was a page-turner and an easy read.  Its suitable for young readers.  The plot was stirring and entertaining.  I felt like I was transported back in time.

It wasn't until she hit the British Isles that her obsession with food lessened and she became the writer I loved from Under the Tuscan Sun. I did question some of her reviews of British food. I have rarely eaten anything to rave about in England, Scotland and Ireland. It is good solid food and enjoyable, but not something to send one to lala land over the taste and texture and experience. She also managed to bring the beauty of the gardens that the UK is so famous for to me through her words. That redeemed the poorly presented first half of the book in my eyes!

I like the premise - a lot. This love probably comes from being a "Buffy" fan since the concept behind the show was for the little blonde girl in the dark alley to "take back the night." One of the themes of the show was how, because she was tiny and cute, she was continually underestimated. Anyone who is a blonde, or knows some capable ones, will appreciate the inherent humor and girl power message here.

Like in the other books in the series, the family (in the case of werewolf, the pack) is a main value: old good feelings and the idea that you are stronger if you lean on your pack. And they are also a great source for other stories in the series (I will look forward for Sterling and Rhys's story, and who will be Matt's mate?)

593	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I enjoyed this modern rendition. I wondered how it would all come about. It had to be hard to come up with a way to do this. I had a hard time envisioning how a more updated version would go but I thought the author had it pretty spot on. No amazing letter however.....I don't imagine that would have been possible. The characters were well filled out. I could feel their anguish. I loved Isabelle. Jane was great as a foundation executive. Jane is our Anne. Winnie the younger sister was just pure fun. I liked her much better than Mary Musgrove. There were definite parts where I laughed out loud. My only real complaint was some of the language. Yes, most people do swear, it's just one of my pet peeves. I don't care for it whatsoever. I don't like descriptions of male intimate body parts and in the one scene that was sexual (that comes to mind)I felt it could have been left out. Otherwise I liked this authors attempt at modernization. I'll still probably read the original version much more but it was enjoyable, I'd read it again, and for my more youthful friends they could probably relate better.
The Wallflower is a book not to miss for readers who are looking for a hero and heroine who can make them smile, sigh and outright laugh. It's a vibrant and rich world of likeable characters and an interesting courtship between a hunky eye doctor and an adorably sassy shop owner. I had so much fun reading this book that I simply have to find more by Ms. Bell. Her writing is becoming an addiction I can't wait to indulge more in. I absolutely recommend reading this impish and delightfully saucy book.

Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.
What I can tell anyone reading this review is that I don't think you'll be wasting your time (which is infinitely more precious than your money) in reading "Believe". If anything, you might find yourself actually smiling and feeling good at the end of this story. And it's not a bad thing if you find your eyes getting a little moist because someone manipulated your feelings in only the kindest way possible.

Bliss St. Clair thinks she's stumbled into some kind of nightmare.  She spies Cadan sinking his fangs and himself into a woman which disgusts and arouses her, and then Cadan tells her about symbiots and her possible role as a host.  Although he is reluctant to bring Bliss into his world and the inherent danger Cadan doesn't think he has a choice. Not only does he desperately want her for himself, his father would like nothing better than to have a viable female host.  Somehow he has to be strong enough to give her the options and protect her from himself and others as she makes her decision.  Time is running out.

1792	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	In MEN IN BLACK, Mark Levin, the conservative radio talk host, turns his attention to an area of Americana that has suddenly shifted gears from dry and dusty to hot and relevant.  He notes that the Supreme Court forms one angle of the triangle that in effect governs America.  The Presidency and the Senate over the years have struggled with the Supreme Court and each other in a bear hug that historically was more or less even.  However, Levin notes that the Court has grown powerful beyond the scope envisioned for it by the Founding Fathers, who set it up as a check on the other two.  The Court, they held, was to interpret the law, a formidably strong enough concept indeed.  Yet, Levin accuses the Court of overstepping its bounds in a manner that places it squarely in the camp of a leftist ideology that he fears has turned the United States into a bizarre nation that opposes nearly every precept once held dearly by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.  No longer is the America of 2005 a nation that opposes racism (affirmative action is the "settled law" of a racist ideology that the Founding Fathers would have found abhorrent) nor is it one that will protect its citizens from foreign incursions (the Court now insists that captured Islamofascist terrorists must be accorded the constitutional right to face their accusers in a court of law).  Levin argues that the Court has proven over the last fifty years that the fate of the Democratic party and the fate of the Court itself are inextricably intertwined.  MEN IN BLACK was written before the recent arrival of John Roberts as Chief Justice.  With the looming confirmation hearings of Samuel Alitto as the newest conservative justice, Levin must be heartened by the likely prospect of a reversal of a court that has looked over its left shoulder for so long that it forgot that it even had a right one.

Maxine "Max" Turner decided she needed a security system installed in her huge family home when vandals broke in and the new client for her brother's company and her web design services is an expert in the field.  Forget sparks - what was a flicker when they first met turned into fireworks by the time she and Ryan finished going over the security needs at her house later.  Neither one plays any games - they start dating immediately, knowing starting an affair is going to happen soon.  Their relationship is complicated by her huge family intruding (something similar happens in Turn it Up - it's funny), his responsibility to his handicapped brother and the ongoing vandalism at her house.
Unfortunately they didn't feel anywhere as good as they used to. I'm giving it two stars and not just one because in its own day it probably wasn't as bad as it is today. The wooden dialog was almost impossible to bear.
Lincoln is a very powerful Vehemens vampire and is four hundred years old. I really liked him.

All of these faults would be easier to cope with if the book were simply bad, and therefore easily dismissed--but it's not. The setting is under-explored (the magical elements in particular often feel like a pseudo-Celtic fairy world), but Transylvania is a pleasant change. A number of sub-plots and a sense of magic keep the reader interested, even when the direction of the story is obvious. And most promising of all, Jena and her sisters have the potential to be spirited, independent young woman--interesting characters in any setting and any sort of novel. There are just enough promising aspects to keep the reader hoping that the book will improve, and so it's all the more frustrating when it does not. I can't possibly recommend Wildwood Dancing. It has some good bits and has the potential for many more, but it never becomes enjoyable. Instead, the story is bogged down by frustration and predictability, and it never rewards the reader for the labor of its 400 pages. Avoid this book--there are many similar novels (even if not set in Transylvania) that are far more successful.

However, Elizabeth Kelly is a strong, tough, fierce wordsmith; I often found myself reading metaphors out loud to share with others.  She possesses a deep wellspring of talent for wordplay and is quite beguiling and wry.

As fiction though, she dismisses it as "an overwrought, overwritten novel that misses conveying the war's terrible reality and the courage of one woman."

Carrie, her husband, John, and their slaves were all drawn into the unending demands of the retreating armies and overwhelmed with the men left in their care.  Carrie's two young children romped about among amputees, the sightless, and the mortally wounded with gaping parts of themselves altered or missing.  The events following the battle remake Carrie into the person she believe God has always expected her to become.  She, helped by her life-long servant, Mariah, and to a lesser extent her husband and Zachariah, the soldier she inexplicably falls in love with, finds an inner strength and goes on through the rest of her life to save and protect both the living and the dead who fall in Franklin and find themselves in her charge.  She reburied almost 1,500 dead soldiers on the grounds of Carnton to protect them from being plowed over in their original graves on the battlefield.  Until her death in 1905, she walked the cemetery daily and oversaw the graves with loving attention.  Her cemetery is now maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  In the 1980's, the foundation began efforts to restore Carnton.  There are wonderful photos of Carrie, Mariah, John, the cemetery and Carnton in the author's notes at the end...worth reading.

Unforgiven is seriously smokin' hot! Emotions are running high in Unforgiven. Cutter is so angry not just with Katie for cheating but also at his sister Dani for marrying Justin, a man he hates. Don't even get him started on the fact that everyone knows his baby sister is actually in a relationship with two men. Cutter's anger fuels the hot passionate sex that he shares with Katie. They may decide on no-strings sex, but you can only deny your true feelings for so long. It doesn't matter how great the sex is between Katie and Cutter in Unforgiven, they can never have a successful relationship if he cannot forgive Katie for her indiscretion with Justin. Unforgiven will leave you breathless.

775	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I used to get the Post on paper and switched to Kindle for the last couple of years.  The paper has gone downhill: the writing has suffered, analysis is almost gone, and the paper has become more and more biased.  While the navigation is good, the Kindle version frequently has typos, and it will refer you to the website Post for many interesting articles which are clipped short.  As I am a local, I expect the Post to also cover local news, but it is deficient in what it selects.  There are some major issues going on, but they prefer to go back to some crime that is unsolved and happened years ago rather than dig into current issues--it's probably cheaper.  The Post covers politics, but the reporting is typically he said, she said with little or no research or analysis, and the editorial and news selection slant is decidedly pro-illegal immigrant.  I am not a conservative, but I would like more balanced reporting regardless of what the editorial board has to say.  To be fair, the Post occasionally has a fact checker article that is useful. For the last several months, I've found myself skipping over the much of the paper.  Many of the writers have an annoying habit of launching into an article, but failing to give you the key information until the last couple of paragraphs.  I suppose that is to peak my interest or something, but it's like listening to Bolero.  I am in the process of cancelling the subscription.  By all means, try a free subscription though.  I subscribed for years.  Who knows, you might like it, especially if you are pro-illegal immigrant.

They've shared women before but Jane's the first one who's really brought out the possessive and protective instincts in both of them.  The men are stunned to learn about Jane's previous relationship with Peter and how long she'd been deceived.
Oh, and one more which just came to mind: anything which uses a reference to botany or zoology as a comment on human behavior or the human condition, and then employs quotes from some book on the topic as chapter headers is right out. Which explains my attitude towards this novel. Fortunately, I got it on close-out, so I don't feel robbed.

The story is non-linear and covers a time span that goes from 1944 to 1995. There is a part that follows the life of the Cabrales American children in the USA following a natural chronology and line of events, while another part tells the story of their parents and grandparents from the present to the past, in reverse order.

The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.

This is an unusual book, and there are often science fiction and fantasy references - which are helpful if you are familiar with them. Books such as Lord of the Rings, or Dune, or the Narnia series to just name a few. There's also mention of Twilight Zone episodes, and various role playing games and video and movies. I recognized most of them, and thought they were used brilliantly to take us into Oscar's mind and world.  Also helpful is knowing Spanish - which I (sort of) do.

In spite of Men In Black's faulty reasoning, there are some parts worth reading. The best chapter (by far) is chapter 10, "Silencing Political Debate". Here, the book accurately points out the very unconstitutional and un- American McCain- Feingold act of 2002 and how it silences free speech by making it a crime to talk about politicians in the days leading up to an election. How this ever became law and survived a review by the Supreme Court, I will never know. Levin is one- hundred percent correct in his criticism of this act and I share his disgust. Besides this chapter, there are some other good points made regarding certain individual laws (many are mentioned in the book) from over the years and how their fate was decided by the Supreme Court and they also make for good reading.

It isn't even very good.  Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her "master" is married (I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him, but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was).  After a year, she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner.  This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic.  First of all, a guy was throwing it for his half-brother.  Who throws a party like that for a  sibling?  Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do.  It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like "You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene?"  Well, if that's the case, then maybe try talking about what she wants, what she is looking for in the scene, what isn't on the table for the session?  The whole reason Jane got into a bad situation in the first place was because she didn't talk to her "master," but she's going to get right back into that same mistake again?  This was like somebody's poorly thought out fantasy, not anything close to how this would play out in real life.

- The story's villain is about as one-dimensional as they come: he's evil and disgusting and horrible...so much so that his continued cruel actions repeatedly drew me out of the story. I kept thinking, "At least show me a reason why he's so single-mindedly vicious."

The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his "talent", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.

During the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.

Starting in 1899, Van Tassel is a professor of history at Thrupp--a small college in a small New Hampshire town of the same name.  Van Tassel is eating dinner at the Thrupp Hotel when a fire breaks out.  He gives aid to a number of other patrons, and is immediately smitten by the lovely Etna Bliss.  Van Tassel embarks on a crusade to win the hand of Etna. While he's passionately in love with Miss Bliss, she shares a fondness for the professor that falls short of love.

Of the two brothers, Whitey's story, not surprisingly, is the most compelling. He is truly a brutal man, not caring who he killed, be it man or woman. One of his killings was so brutal I cringed while reading it. His dealings with the FBI are mind boggling and not very reassuring. While Billy's story is less compelling, it was still interesting to read how he maneuvered his way through Boston politics and managed to snag himself a nice sized pension from U-Mass Boston. What was especially interesting about all this is the numerous mistakes he made politically and still came out on top for a long time.

Hero was all wishy washy: he claims that no man in their right mind would claim to understand the workings of a woman's mind and yet you catch him thinking to himself that he was always arrogantly, confident in his ability to understand women.  I liked that he NEVER really knew her at all let alone understood her.  He tried to catergorize her with the other women from his past.  I liked that she did stand up to him in some aspects.  And it brought him up short near the end when he was convinced that she would tell him she loved him . . . only she didn't!

Lower-priced sets have BRIEFLY appeared in the Kindle Store in the past several years, only to be yanked. Why? Probably for copyright reasons; these are not (all) yet in the U.S. public domain. So why hasn't this set been pulled? Is this one exclusively authorized by the copyright holder? Nowhere does it say, but as long as this publisher holds onto its monopoly, those who want to purchase a complete set of all 12 Philo Vance books for their Kindle have very little choice other than to purchase this one. Of course, from time to time some individual Vance ebooks also appear in the Kindle Store, but not all 12, and for what you'd pay for some of them, you might as well buy this set. And in truth, the overall quality of this bundle is good and the cost per book averages only $.83, so while it isn't as great a deal as some other ebook collections of "old" mysteries in the Kindle Store, the price is certainly fair for what you get.

3356	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	There were so many bad reviews about this book, that I almost didn't read it, having enjoyed the first two books in this series so much I didn't want to ruin it. I am so glad I did read it, and I loved it as much as the first two books. I am honestly confused about everyone's displeasure. Some thought the story took too long to get going, but I didn't notice undue delay and felt the extra background information was needed for the story. Others felt Brodick's character was unrecognizable, and though I admit he had softened a bit from the first two books, I felt it was already happening at the end of the second book and largely due to being married. One of the things I really liked about this book was Gabrielle's guard and their interaction with Colm and his men. There is something enjoyable about the banter between a group of men that are close to each other, particularly when they are all protecting the same woman. I enjoyed the same thing in the second book with Brodick's guard. I enjoyed Colm and Gabrielle, and felt they were likable, engaging main characters. I also enjoyed the explanations and references to the title, Shadow Music. I highly recommend this book and series!

33	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	In this period novel, Shreve so adeptly transports us to the world of academia, staying true to the time and place through dialogue and descriptions.  The main character had me alternatively feeling sorry for him, disliking him, pitying him, rooting for him, and not knowing what to think about him.  Most of the time, however, I wanted desperately to find a way to free his wife of the yoke she had taken upon herself. What a talent to lead us through such an array of emotions! Interesting characters and plot - and, as usual, one doesn't want to put this book down.  I was so thankful for the satisfying ending.  This is one of Shreve's best and, for me, stands side-by-side with my all-time favorite, "Fortune's Rocks".

When I want a story that's hot, emotional, and satisfying, there is one author I always turn to. K.A. Mitchell. I know when I open a K.A.

In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin.

I have the strong feeling that Remi's character is changed a lot from the previous enstallment. In Without Reservation he is an interesting supporting character, but apart the physical beauty and a cocky attitude, no more else gave you the real impression of him.

The ebook is only $2.99 and it's well worth the price. Alpha & Omega is a great story and the start of a great series. I loved the novella and love the two novels in the series, Cry Wolf and Hunting Ground. I re-read them all the time. This series is set in the same world as Patricia's Mercy Thompson series, and has the same worldbuilding, but it follows Charles Cornick, the Marrok's son and his mate Anna. Anna is a great heroine. She was turned against her will and her pack tries to beat her down, but they don't succeed. Even though she doesn't have much confidence, she somehow always manages to save the day through sheer grit and determination. I can't recommend this series highly enough. I just wish Ms. Briggs would write faster.

Overall, this was a well written book with good characterization of the two protagonists and a comfortable paranormal setting.  And I continued thinking about it after finishing, which is usually a good sign.  Though this one was dark, I enjoyed it enough that I would definitely read another book in what I expect will be a "Forces of Nature" series.

248	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	In her best novel yet, Lisa Scottoline has once again mined her knowledge of all things Italian and the result is pure gold.  "The Vendetta Defense" is the story of "Pigeon Tony" Lucia (he breeds and races pigeons), an elderly Italian gentleman who admits that he has killed his enemy, eighty-year-old Angela Coluzzi, in order to settle an ancient vendetta.  In a series of flashbacks, we learn the story of Tony Lucia and Angelo Coluzzi.  These two men were neighbors in a small town in Italy sixty years ago, and they were rivals for the hand of the beautiful Silvana.  Silvana chose Tony Lucia over Angelo Coluzzi, and Angelo, a rabid Fascist and a vicious thug, never forgave this betrayal.  Coluzzi spent his life doing everything that he could to destroy the Lucia family.  For over half a century, Tony has restrained his anguish, until the fateful day when he and Coluzzi finally have it out.  Judy Carrier, a hotshot lawyer in Bennie Rosato's all-female law firm, decides to take on Tony Lucia's seemingly hopeless case.  While trying this case, Judy risks her life, weathers exciting and nerve-wracking courtroom battles and finds love with Frank, Tony's gorgeous grandson.  Scottoline's novel is at times achingly poignant, especially during the flashbacks, and at other times, it is laugh-out-loud funny.  Scottoline is politically incorrect in her depiction of the old Italian men and young Italian mobsters who live in South Philly.  "The Vendetta Defense" works as a light and entertaining mystery, and I recommend it unreservedly.  Fans of Scottoline will fall in love with Judy and Pigeon Tony, and they will enjoy this wonderful novel immensely.

Remi is the poster child for abused children. His father is a psychopath whose idea of fun is terrorizing his family and because he is a Rez Policeman with lots of power no one dared question him until Jake shows up on the scene. Remi's character is very vulnerable and submissive and the hint of BDSM in the story went well with his persona. I really felt for him in his fight to protect his brother and his mother, while at the same time keeping his relationship with Jake a secret from his father. His turnaround in standing up to his father was precipitated when Sterling shows up with bruises on his body and he knows that he can't close his eyes any longer to the abuse, so he asks Jake to help him bring his father to justice.
Easy 5 stars.

 Many do not know that Zuckerburg was offered millions for a software program he and his partner designed in high school. He turned it down and went on to college. Through the book you see that it is really not about the money. Like many entrepreneurs it is about creating, following a dream, and making a difference. He just didn't care about the material things, living in a bare apartment and donning blue jeans,a T shirt and sandals even while he was a billionaire on paper.
While at times the complex storyline made the book drag a little - every sentence had a reason for being there, you just might not realize it yet.  Definitely not a book for those wanting a quick run through a fantasy land, this book requires a bit of concentration - but it's well worth the effort.  About half way through things just started falling into place and I had a hard time putting it down.

5405	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Ok, so I know the premise was slightly ridiculous. And I know that Lila pretty much prostituted herself out to Hunter to save her father's business but, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was just a well written story.  Parts that would normally make me roll my eyes somehow didn't.  Even though Hunter is demanding and seemingly merciless to Lila in the beginning, the author does a good job of getting us inside his head so we know he's not just being a jerk for being a jerk's sake.  In a way he was right,  it was a business arrangement and they both knew why she was there.  Lila is no pushover and I found her resolve refreshing without being overbearing.  The sex scenes are HOTTTT, yes, even when Lila can't stand him or so she thinks.  I loved the gradual progression of their friendship and the realization of their feelings.  Loved the scenes with Lila and the dogs, which allowed Hunter to first get a glimpse into his feelings for Lila and I enjoyed their dinner conversations.  When things got comfortable between them, it gave me the warm fuzzies.  I pretty much loved everything about the book. I knocked one star off because I thought that the way that Hunter chose to end their contract was unnecessarily lame and only served to throw in a twist. There was no need for that and it was the only thing that spoiled the book for me.  Of course, they got back together so all's well that ends well.
One of his most salient points is that we are able to think in a fashion that decouples us from reality.  That is, we are able to think about things and people who are not present, who may not even exist, make and test alternative plans of action and all without enacting on any of them.  This allows us to accept that there might be those whose presence and actions we can not see.

The King makes him his Leman or mistress. later the King is forced to marry his cousin.

The most controversial aspect of this tome is how Will becomes addicted to a drug called Warmweed, that the Skandians use to keep their slaves in line. It turns Will into a shuffling, mindless, drone. Leaving Evanlyn to care for him.

Also, the fact of dealing with drugs in a series intended for young readers could turn off many readers.

3814	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	How do you review a book that's been in print for almost 2000 years? Many have come before me, so I will be brief. Suetonius was one of the most credible historians of his day, so his accounts of the period have been the source for countless treatises and novels about Ancient Rome,(including mine.) One of the things that distinguishes him was his ability to report the rumors as well as hard, documented facts on the topics of his day, making it possible to get a sense of how Romans actually thought about things. Like opening a window in time and looking into his world. It's always a good idea to cross check any historic account and this holds true for him as well. But the value of knowing the kitchen details of the Old Empire can never be exaggerated. His sense of humor and irony makes a fun read about a colorful age in history.
CHARACTERS: Undeveloped and silly. These were supposed to be Norse gods, but they somehow all came across as the cast of a bad tv series. There was no depth. Their actions felt forced because they weren't given room to develop and they were almost all interchangeable.

Also, given all of the various relationships it seemed vaguely incestuous...

I adore the series completely because it's not typical.  The vampires and the wolves aren't standard for this industry, uniquely drawn with their own internal problems within their kind and a deep history that weaves them as protectors for humanity until things go screwy.

2947	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Okay... at first I wasn't to sure how I would feel about the book given its stalkerish description. But I loved it. I found myself laughing a lot in the first couple of chapters while at the same time believing the chemistry. My only complaint is that it is rather short.

I've read a few of the reviews that say his blog is too heavy with (insert genre name here) and I can only think they haven't give the blog enough of a chance. I see books offered from most categories at some point. The funny thing is, I'm pretty sure he mentioned that he's not a sci-fi fan, but I've ended up liking a lot of his selections...he has a good method of deciding which books to include in the blog, I guess.
Nick has been Lacey's best friend for the past 5 years so when he heard that she was finally single again, he didn't waste a minute.  He wanted to be with her, to console her, but also to take the opportunity to make her see him as more than a friend.  He has loved Lacey for so long that he would do anything to show her how good they could be together.  He would do anything for her, even if he had to pretend to be her "sexual teacher".
Strong willed and independent Jenna has a good heart and a lot of compassion for friends and students alike, but has a tendency to assume too much responsibility and fails to let those who love her take care of her...even when she needs it. Steven is utterly at a loss with one son who suddenly seems to hate him and another who hasn't recovered from his trauma. His aunt won't stop setting him up with blind dates and the very thing that makes him so good at his job - his dedication - is causing so many problems with his family he feels almost like he's hiding from them.
156	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Elizabeth Moon is always on the top of my to-buy list.  I actually bought this copy for my son.  He's liking it a lot.  EM always writes well written, well researched, believable fantasy/ "space opera" and I know when I buy something she's written I will like it.
This series continues to captivate. Mr. Flanagan has a real knack for describing the strategy and actuality of skirmishes and battles, as well as for building an interesting and detailed world. Best of all, the Ranger's Apprentice books tell stories you WANT to read about characters you truly admire.
A quick read and would gladly read this author again.

I admit.  I prefer my vampires to be traditional, but I can adapt and have enjoyed the True Blood Series (early books)&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dead-Until-Dark-A-True-Blood-Novel-1-Sookie-Stackhouse/dp/B0037471TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dead Until Dark: A True Blood Novel: 1 (Sookie Stackhouse)</a>, Black Dagger Brotherhood&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dark-Lover-Number-1-in-series-Black-Dagger-Brotherhood-Series/dp/B004LX0DKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dark Lover: Number 1 in series (Black Dagger Brotherhood Series)</a>, I can even do the comedic in the Undead series&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Undead-and-Unwed-Undead-Queen-Betsy/dp/0425242269/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Undead and Unwed (Undead/Queen Betsy)</a>&nbsp;.  However, this felt like one of those old black and white movies where one of the gang has a problem and everyone gathers together for a sing along and by the end everything is fixed and everyone is happy even the old curmudgeon.
9647	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This book as well written, which is greatly appreciated.  The characters really have some depth, and there was some action and minor conflict as well.  The romance was exactly what you expect in a shifter story (the standard mate thing), which was well played out and not overly obtrusive, although it served as the basis for the entire story, of course.  I enjoyed this book immensely, and would recommend it.  My only minor complaint is that it could have been so much better if it were longer.  I read the whole thing in about 3 hours.
1698	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	I like Catherine Coulter's FBI books.  This book was complicated, and for me not easy to follow, and some parts just too strange.  I never quite figured out who the female character was in relation to the current "hero", or why the character in the past owed her a debt.  In comparing to a favorite book, "Secrets of Witches" by D. Hearkness (not sure of spelling her name) this just falls way short, and short of the FBI/CIA series.  Her characters are somewhat predictable.

The glycemic load does more than look at what is in the foods you eat, but also in the serving size that it comes in. As Dr. Thompson puts it, "Low carb dieting suddenly becomes a pleasure" when you take into account the glycemic load.
Hot-Blooded Husbands ~ Book 1 of 4

3707	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Often, the best fiction stories are those that transport us to distant lands and take us away from our mundane lives.  The Icebound Land accomplishes that goal nicely.  The narrative follows two stories.  In one, Will and Evanlyn deal with their new lives as captives of a Viking-type society.  In the other, Halt and Horace travel through a Malory-inspired land replete with knights issuing challenges at bridges.  The prose is straightforward enough to be read by young readers (my daughter devoured the series while in fourth grade) yet is by no means too juvenile for more mature readers.

9106	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Being honest here. Thought the book was great. Yes, William and Jenny had great connection. This book does a good job in describing and having a connection between the two of them- as far as dialogue, and sharing emotion. Not just hot scenes (although, there is that!)
4479	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this out of curiosity and I couldn't even finish it. This is one of those books that will scar you for life, like Cryer's Cross by Lisa McMann. It is by far a horrible thing to have to go through and i felt pity for the girls..

All in all a good read.

Hailey and Gage figure it out with the help of family and friends, just the way it should be.
In the novel, Walt Longmire is a grumpy, overweight, gone-to-seed aging man with a creative sense of humor and a big heart. In the TV series, Walt isn't so grumpy, not overweight, and has not yet gone to seed, with a sense of humor and a big heart. I think the TV series wouldve failed miserably if the producers had cast the novels version of Longmire. Its one thing to read about a, fat, grumpy, gone-to-seed character, and quite another to watch them be grumpy, overweight, and gone-to-seed on a TV screen.
Some of the stories told in this volume were dense with names and required a private scorecard to keep the names of the players straight.  Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 are two examples of such a phenomenon. The tally of the Dalton Gang at the Coffeyville robberies are easily computed from the story as described in Chapter 21.  By my count Baldwin, Cubine, Brown, and Connelly were the four citizens killed and Reynolds, Ayres, and Gump survived - despite Ayres getting shot in the head.

1123	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Lady Jessaline Nolan has lived a horrible life at the hands of her father, the Lord of the House of Nolan.  Jessaline lives like a prisoner in her home, and is beaten or whipped at any display of defiance.  In a final display of his control of Jessaline, Lord Nolan has arranged her marriage to the bastard son of a Catholic Bishop.  However much Jessaline may want to leave her father's home, her betrothed is not a better option.  He has shown himself to be equally as cruel as Lord Nolan and he will be able to hurt her in more ways than beating.
This book does much more then lay a foundation for a new series.  It is a very good read in its own right.

I will definitely check out other books by this author.
