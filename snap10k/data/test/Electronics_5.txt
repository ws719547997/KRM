5290	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I've owned my GE superadio III for about 3 months now.  I'd heard a lot of (mostly) favorable things about this legendary series of radios, and had to get one.  I'm glad I did.  Here's what I think.....

666	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Used this for a Panasonic 32" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier.

6216	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The CD player in my car went haywire. CD's were skipping and others wouldn't play at all. Thought maybe it may need a "clean up."  WOW! Put this in the CD player...ran it twice. That's all it took. And to think, I was ready to pay to have a new one installed. Have to agree with others...don't buy a new CD player before trying this. Besides, the music on the CD isn't so bad either...yes...there's music on the CD cleaner.
Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.
8428	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV, movies, etc.  However, in terms of comfort, they leave much to be desired.  The flat, hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin, somewhat scratchy "cloth" material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of one's ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton, or even a foam covering would be an improvement.
I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!
7572	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good price and works fine.
1323	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	For me the most important feature is the pdf support and on that account, Nook wins. Its pdf support is much better than Kindle, supporting reflow. that way, you see the page as the native format with real page numbers. it is quite readable if your file is basically text. I don't know if Kindle has improved in this regard but when I bought and returned Kindle DX six months ago, this feature wasn't there and pdf looked more like an image than text. Even DX's large size did not help me read pdf books because it was small and dimmer than regular text. Now on Nook I can read them as though they are in native format. no conversion is needed. but again these are mainly text-heavy pdf files, not complex, graphic-heavy ones.

6295	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	What can i say yes i still use my vcr an these tapes work .
Only thing to make sure is hold a steady hand when using or use a tripod.
The only con about this product, is that sometimes I forget that there's a mic near my mouth.  Case in point, when I drank from a water fountain or from a cup, sometimes the liquid hits the mic before my mouth, but after numerous times doing that it still works, picking up my voice whenever I press the button.
5207	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this tape recorder for use as a study aid, and it has performed very well for this purpose. I like the fact that it uses full size cassette tapes, as they are readily available, and can be played back on any standard player. I have made several tapes, and have played them back in different decks with good results. The only thing I would recommend is the addition of an external microphone, as the internal mic seems to be too sensitive. It actually picks up noise from the tape drive mechanism. If this unit cost a lot of money, this would be a serious flaw, but for just over twenty bucks it didn't seem like a big deal to me. I picked up a decent mic at Radio Shack for around ten dollars, and recording quality is now flawless.
5971	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	i bought this at rite aid hoping to fix my game and i was excited and then later disappointed it didn't do what it said im pissed.
I have been running with my brightness turned down quite a bit (wish I could tell you what level, but there is no onscreen display for brightness).  Since it hasn't happened in quite a while, my theory is this:  More brightness draws more power and something is heating up and going into shut-down mode.  It then needs to be reset.  As the solution, I am leaning toward the plugging/unplugging of the power supply.

The sound is much, much better than the Sony.  It has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and music.
674	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.
A sturdy, quality mount at a fair price!
Doubtful, but any sellers reading this? Your 10-15 year old overstock hi-bias tapes aren't gold, jerks.
My complaints are relatively minor:

Thankfully, the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the AM band: "narrow" for pulling in those hard-to-tune stations, and "wide" for getting extra fidelity from closer stations.

4429	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I ordered 6 of these a couple of weeks ago and had to order 6 more. These area great. I have been converting family VHS tapes to DVD and hundreds of vinyl LPs and cassette tapes to CD. The DVDs and CDs fit perfectly! I can pull out a group of CDs at once and not worry about the rest of the group falling over. It's easy to slide CDs from side to side as I alphabetize my collection, and commerical CDs fit right in place next to the slim-line jewel cases. Double CD cases are no problem, either. Also like the stacking capability of the units. Mine are going into a large multimedia unit where my vynils and cassettes used to be. These can't be beat.
476	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	For the price it works fine though i have to admit it worries me.  It says it can fit a 55 inch T.V, i put a 48" TV on it and it by all means fit, but the thin metal bars which bolt to the TV are obviously bowing under the weight.  I'll give it this though, my TV has hung on it for probably over a year now and it hasn't fallen yet, though i can say each day i am waiting for it too.  The full swing motion is nice works as expected, we occasionally turn it toward the kitchen when we are all in there doing things.  I would give it a 5 star but the thin support bars always worry me so that keeps it at a 4.
3758	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works great.  Very happy with it.

Other than that, it is very convenient to be able to move around my room without leaving my phone by the wall to charge.
I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.
The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N's ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.
7671	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	As described
It's these bands that cause my only complaint with the Moleskine cover; the on/off sliding switch at the top of the Kindle is partially covered by the top-left elastic band.  I fiddled with the position of the Kindle to put the band to the left of the switch, but it makes finding the left-edge of the switch somewhat harder.
2535	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great thing to have  in your car, has 2 usb's its working good and its very nice i recommend to buy it
6201	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Always Great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable. Belkin's Products are very consistent in both quality and price. They hit it all with this one. We have used several of these at work.
With this cartridge, it won't separate the two, making it very, very hard to removing the backing. Not OK
at 800-842-2665.
 Two other downsides are  the included wired remote control and the included headphones.  I suggest  dumping the included phones immediately - they're ok sound wise, but only  ok, and the cord is too short.  The remote is cool - it features a backlit  display that mirrors all of the information displayed on the unit itself  (and strangely, the unit itself does not have a backlit display) - but the  controls on the remote are too small and ackwardly positioned to be of much  use - also, by touch they're pretty indistinguishable from one another and  since you often use the remote in your pocket, this is a big disadvantage.  Also, the remote has a small aligator clip on the back so that you can  attach it to your clothes, but it seems to be facing the wrong way which  increases the ackwardness of the remote.
6182	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	My car's 6 CD changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel.  Because the right channel remained OK I did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue.  I figured both left and right channels should be affected.  I lamented over my player for weeks because I could ill-afford whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy Bose CD player embedded in the dashboard of a car.  I gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred. Finally I figured, what have I got to lose just to find out if this is a "dirt" problem?  $8 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay. Hola macarola...I'll be darned if this disc didn't cure my player immediately! I wish I had given this thing a shot a lot sooner.  Technically there was problem though.  The instructions say the CD has sound.  It's supposed to alert you when it's done cleaning or whatever.  My product produced no sound at any time.  I inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc. It ran, and ran, and ran.  It never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own.  I simply had to eject it. I deducted one star only because of this "technicality".
4995	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed this after playing some really old tapes on [2] of my VCRs, which essentially trashed play back on both.

6851	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I just bought my second pack of these wipes. I bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them. I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside. I truly think they are amazing.

4351	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I am writing a review for a "Premium 10 feet Canon HTC-100 Upgrade Replacement Mini HDMI cable A to C digital cable supports 600Hz and all 1.3 standards" from A Days Tech, sold by VEER2 and fulfilled by Amazon.  Isn't that a mouthful for a product description?  I'd have thought Canon HTC-100 would be enough.  I'm compelled to say this because if you search Amazon for "Canon HTC-100", you'll find 1.5-, 2-, 3-, even 4-meter cables, supporting HDMI 1.3, 1.4, you name it -- often from the same manufacturer.  There's even a genuine Canon HTC-100 for sale -- except half the reviewers warn they didn't receive a genuine Canon cable.  Amazon needs to take some responsibility for creating major confusion over generic replacement products like this sold by a third party and fulfilled by Amazon.  And Canon shares some blame too since Canon Direct doesn't list any specification for an HTC-100 -- for all I know they get them from Amazon.

In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.

Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.
5177	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have used this particular item before and with very good results. I have checked this purchase out and it works just as well as my old one. I would highly recommend this unit. I will install this unit in my sister's new mobile home, as it has only one telephone jack, which she had to have ATT install, at a high cost.
4268	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	terrible product, don't buy

1669	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Once I started this book, I couldn't quit. I was sure that Jack would find a way out of his predicament and I had to find out how he managed it. I loved every single page. Although the emphasis of the book description is on the supernatural elements of the book, Nightfall does not really fall neatly into a single genre. Yes, the supernatural figures prominently, but the book is, at heart, a mystery, with Jack, in true private investigator fashion, doggedly following one lead to another to another in his efforts to unravel the puzzle dropped in his lap by a man who claimed to be his father. Add in a few discussions of philosophy and religion (What happens after you die? What is the meaning of life?) and more humor than I expected and you get a pleasing, well rounded story.
Purchased three cables.  Very satisfied!

I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.
The author did a great job of setting the background in an unobtrusive way, and then just giving us the stories.  If the author was so inclined, she could easily expand into full length novels where we could learn the hows and whys of the world, but really she does a great job giving us just enough that she can stick to the shorter tales, and the shorter tales feel complete.  And naughty.  Did I mention naughty?  These are a little naughty.

It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value.

Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter "library."  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.

> Folders play in the order loaded.  So, load your albums (folders) in the order you want them to play.  Tracks (within folders) play in alpha-numeric order.  If you want individual tracks to play in a different order, then add alphanumeric prefixes, such as "a", "b" or "1" "2" to the names of each track.  If you stop play and turn off the player, the player restarts where you left off.

6995	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Pretty good for the price.  It is accurate but it takes a few seconds longer than my other thermometer.  I like the fact it starts up in Ferinheight instead of Celsius.
It does not provide super fidelity but such a device can't ever be compared to a direct connection.

7646	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It's an Ethernet cable. It does its job, I've seen speeds of 100mbps without a problem, and it's a very durable cable. It's lasted several years with no problems in connection. The only negative thing I could say about it is that it is somewhat difficult to take the cable out sometimes, given the clip and plastic covers on the side . This is mostly a problem if your device is pushed against the wall, its hard to clip the ethernet cable out. beside that, it does the job well

I ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them...so I was totally horrified by this information. I currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician. No problem with scratches but more expensive.

Fast shipping, what else should I ask for it?

Now, for this cable to actually work, you'll quite likely need some kind of powered hub that can handle the extra impedance.  My computer's onboard USB could not.  I tried it with an external DVD drive (Though that may have worked if I used the external power supply.) and my iphone.  The DVD drive would just spin up a bit, then die and reset, over and over again.  The drive was never accessible to the operating system.  The iphone just gave an error about how it couldn't charge from that device or something like that.  The iphone did, however, accept it when I plugged it in to the little AC adapter thingy.

9278	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great quality. Used them to label my frames. We made Chinese calligraphy names for our students as a fundraiser, and I used these to label the frames with their English names. The gold came out really well. Does not look cheap and flimsy.
8354	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I guess you get what you pay for in some cases, because this headset worked wonderfully for a little while then a couple of months later, didn't!  I purchased it for my Vtech cordless and conversations were inaudible on both ends until it went dead altogether.  The garbage man is probably enjoying now!

7164	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this in February after discovering that DISH Network was billing me five extra bucks a month because I didn't have a phone line connected to my DVR. The RC930 was a little less expensive back when I bought it than it is today, but it was well worth the cost. Now DISH doesn't bill me the five bucks and as a bonus I get caller ID info on my TV screen when someone calls. Hookup was straightforward and worked the first time. Highly recommended for caller ID-capable DVRs.

-VERY inconvenient and not reliable! Especially if you are on a trip! it leave u with a dead cell in the mid of the road or job!
Also, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called "NuBlood" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.

I also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down. Either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as well.
After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.
Enter power line adapters.  I've been using them for years in my house because wireless has been spotty with my PS3 and home desktop.  This Belkin unit even ups the ante as far as security.  Right out of the box, you get two adapters, two cables and a setup CD.  Basically, plug one network cable in your router and into one unit.  Plug it into the wall.  Plug the other unit somewhere else in your house, like near your tv and connect up to your tv.  It's that simple.  It's an automatic network right in your house.
Then I found the Lautner. I read reviews and ordered it online and it has made my simple Nook into a wonderful library. This is a highly recommended case.
4180	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The microSD Card and adapter were received quickly, however, the microSD card is a HC and the adapter a standard SD, not compatible with an HC card, I returned the item for an exchange, and received the exact same thing.  Amazon was great in processing a refund, but was disappointed with Kingston for overlooking this "minor" detail.
Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.
7286	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I prefer the silicone brush/baster over the traditional brush as it is much easier to clean. Just need soap and water and it cleans up all the grease much quicker. We have been using the regular brush before and it was always a mess. I often have pieces of bristles ended up on my barbecues.
6348	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Bought to connect DVR to wall plug in, ordered with 100 Ethernet cable, so price was a factor.  Saved $$ buying it online versus the store where it was $14.00.

I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)

8653	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Forget tnt2 , it is slow and its 32 bit support is the only thing keeping its head above water . With a clock speed of 183 mhz and overcloaking potential that allows you to exceed 200 mhz with no problems ( install  extra cooling )this board is the fastest on the market period . the v3 3500  actually uses 32 bit internal calculations and then displays in 16 bit ,  the results  are brilliant and unmatched . Sure the board is exspensive but  the Philips TV tuner and FM radio makes the board great value for money  .

Remeber, Kindle owners, how much of a presentation opening the Kindle box was? The big reveal, how well put together the presentation was, the little touches? Well it's the same here. Inside the FedEx box was another 6 x 10 box with a black ink band about the middle around the box reminiscent of the Moleskine notebooks themselves. "Kindle Cover + 2 Volant Notebooks," then to the left of that a drawing of the open cover with Kindle and notepad, and below that, "Limited edition for Amazon Kindle."

7567	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering, including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.
On the bright side, the cable did work for charging; just not anything else.
2817	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is an amazing monitor for the price.  If all you want is decent 30" monitor on the cheap that displays significantly better than DH at 2560x1600, this is a great choice.  However, you should be aware that it only supports DVI input, and has pretty much zero other choices or options.
3561	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is really great. As soon as I got the sd card I clicked it in and just as quick, the phone read it. Works great with the right apps.
8507	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	will purchase again from this reseller
3582	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Good deal. Works as expected.
This book or something like it should be included for any new users of MacBook users upon purchase.
Incidently, it runs off AC also.  It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.
Jack Nightingale himself is a bit of a clich; he's an ex-cop whose career ended under controversy and ended up as a struggling PI.  What makes him shine is that the character is charming.  He's witty, intelligent, and competent.  He sets his logical mind towards solving the mystery around the appearance and suicide of a man claiming to be his father, the sudden windfall (and debt surrounding it), and supposed curse.  He is a rational man who doesn't believe that his father could have sold his soul.  However, as people start dying around him, he is shaken.  I found this easy to relate to; no matter how logical we may be, circumstances like Jack's would likely shake our foundations.

5277	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So, If CC Crane is listing this along with their awesome collection of MW & SW radios - wouldn't you get it too? I looked long and hard - Crane was ok, but I already had a Grundig PE 400 and wanted a radio for primarily AM reception (I like to DX from time to time) GE Superradio III does the trick, and I got it from Amazon for 39.00!! Target doesn't even carry it anymore, and Sears does for $70. What a ripoff!! Thanks to Amazon - they paid for the shipping (Got it before Christmas) and came in tight packaging with no problems whatsoever. This is the best radio in the business, I get KGO from SF like a local LA station at night - no static like my other units. Thanks. JG

360	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Does the job we ordered it to do. I followed the instructions for 400x400 and have "bunny ears," as we've been calling them, sticking up past the top of the TV. The holes on the back of our television are not centered though, so I don't think it's the mount, or anything we did wrong. If the four holes were centered on the back it would be fine. We have an LG5600, 42inches. Full motion mount. TV tilts up and down, side to side, along with arm that moves side to side. Great for corner mounting. Easy installation using stud finder, drill, and level. Will be buying another for a different TV. Also have another mount by Videosecu bought 6yrs ago that's held up well. Haven't given it any thought since we put it up in our living room with a 47in Samsung.
it was just an empty box. there was a postcard sized invoice inside, some packaging material, but nothing else. i also noticed the bottom of the amazon box was slightly torn (glue holding the box together was ripped off)

When I got a RIO 500, my musical freedom grew.
FYI - Seller was 5 star all the way.

5291	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This radio does have excellent reception, it's a great size, it's not overly greedy with power and is dual-powered.  Unfortunately, build quality leaves much to be desired.  The stations are nowhere near the index markings on the dial.  The knobs are quite delicate.  I'd have happily paid twice the price to get a radio with a digital tuner and sturdier cosmetics.  In the meantime, I'll certainly enjoy this one and congratulate all of us who made an excellent buy!
754	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Sweet little device enables you to use USB flash drives and hard drives with your Galaxy devices.  Be advised it does not send very much power over the connection, so some external hard drives may not function.
2557	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this so I would be able to have 2 USB ports in our vehicle. I thought I was getting a good deal. It broke in less than a month. It split at the seems and wouldn't stay plugged in. It was poorly built. Buy the PNY car charger. It's much better. I have bought 3 of them already. Much happier

But. The next time I plugged it in, if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling. I gave up after a few more tries. I should of sent it back (Amazon is SUPER about replacing items) but didn't really think about it until the warranty had expired.

BOO HISS ON B&N.
4983	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I followed the instructions exactly and have used a similar product before with success. However, this caused my VCR/DVD combo player to power down. Try another brand or read your VCR manual first to confirm how to clean it. In addition, Amazon will not allow a return because of the liquid cleaner which is flammable. Would have been helpful if Amazon had said so in the description. Why is Amazon still selling this defective product?

4668	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this after much searching.  I ordered this one to go in my Toyota Sienna 2001 which has a cassette deck. I chose this brand because I trust it more than the cheaper ones.  It plays good through my car stereo.  The sound is good enough, not as  great as when you have earphones on, but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway. So far I am satisfied with it.
103	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this thinking it would be a great replacement for my worn power cable.  It charged my nook HD+ and my son's nook for a few weeks and then my son said it stopped working.  Sure enough, I did not even get 6 months of use out of it even though it was an original cable (it came in an OEM box).
9910	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Not sure it's just mine, but mine seems to have a crappy range.  The person I was trying to talk to had to be within line of sight in order for it to work.

If you want the best AM reception possible and demand the convenience of digital tuning, get a CCRadio for about $150-$165.

"problem" stations I had before were perfectly clear. With a Terk loop antenna, I spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kW "clear channel" stations I could get. With care in tuning the antenna and the radio, I got the Hartford, CT, station on the first try. Didn't last too long, but I got it. This from *Sunnyvale, California*. It's relatively easy to get stations in Wyoming and Nebraska on good nights. Seattle, LA, Salt Lake, no problem anytime, even with the internal antenna.
4115	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have been trying to update my Garmin Nuvi 1450 with the latest maps for quite some time with no success.  I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download.  On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time.  I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter.  For the low price and free shipping, this is a great deal.
9282	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this cartridge for use with the P-Touch labelmaker. They are easy to peel (but cannot be re-positioned easily once you have placed them). The ink also does not rub off of them which makes them more hardy. I purchased them on Amazon at a fraction of what they cost at my local retailer (Office Depot).  The gold with black print makes them a bit fancier than the black on white ones that I have been using.  Perfect for making lavels for files or other household and office items.

The mic is not good and the construction is not for commercial use.
Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.
6385	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	No issues with this cable at all. The ends hold firm in my switch, and have survived about a half dozen unpluggings/repluggings. The molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible. Will buy again if need more

8092	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought several (five) of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expected.
1707	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Not that well crafted. Grammatical and spelling errors were distracting and errors in the plot took away from the interest in the story line.
THE BAD: the ergonomics of the unit, the "human engineering", is pretty awful. The rotating pots for volume and tone are often sticky and gritty right out of the box. The plastic toggles for band, AFC, narrow/wide AM, are as cheap and cheesy as can be made and still function most of the time. The big tuner knob is pretty good, though. I don't get much drift once I set a station. The calibration of the dial is comically inaccurate, however, so the frequency markings are pretty much just a rough guide.
8663	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Pros: It's actually a relabled Vicam, which has been favorably reviewed in the past.  Excellent low light performance.  Detachable USB cable is easily replaced with a longer one.  Comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web.

Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product.
So, what we have here is a truly excellent piece of hardware with a fantastic eReader infrastructure capable of doing so much more than it is permitted to do by Barnes & Noble. Their motivation is to force users to buy only from them - which as Apple have proved - is perfectly okay if you make the selection big enough. Problem is, the selection is totally, hopelessly, unbelievably inadequate. Barnes & Noble will still have a huge hit on it's hands because many people have relatively simple needs. The pity is it could have been a massive home run in their battle to stay alive in the space they compete for with Amazon.

I record lps onto these tapes, and listen to them in the car. It took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording, as in where I should average the peak decibels to record at. I eventually came to five plus, which means the bars never go above four decibels. I believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound, that while the directional booklet for my cassette player (a tck670 sony three-head) says record at plus three, letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3, means you're getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums. They also say to record two decibels below the distortion point, and for me that's like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels. For instance Prince sign O' the Times is very loud, and I record at around five+ or below, while the smiths queen is dead, the newly remastered version, is softer, and I record at a 7 recording level. Recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium, while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is].
6247	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The quality of this cable from Belkin seems to be good. They fit my router and are easy to install and remove. I have had trouble with some Ethernet cables in the past so I bought 3 different sizes of Belkin  and they all worked great. I even tested the cable and it was fine. I'll definitely buy these again in the future.
Once your phone is placed inside the case, it is safely protected by the cover. The cover is tightly held in place by a metal snap. Most case covers just fold over without offering any added protection, this is where this case stands out. On the back, the camera and flash cut out is just the right size. The case can also be used in landscape mode to view movies.

I would have had to drive somewhere that was an AT&T hot spot to even use it for the first time (who knows if it would work in a Verizon hot spot)! And since there is no Barnes & Noble store in my town I would have had to drive a minimum of 30 miles to use their in-store "lending" feature.

Obviously the card is OK but the adapter is defective so I've returned it for a refund and I am going back to sandisk.

4386	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed a high visibility, well made, low cost back pack for my daily commute to and from work. during the winter months I may get caught in the dark on the rides so a reflective hi-vis bag was needed (along with lights on the bike of course). For the money, this is the bag to get. The reflective taping and straps are durable and the bag is high quality with enough pockets for all you stuff, including a laptop. It's not waterproof so a cover may be needed and I would suggest a reflective hi-vis cover which can be purchased for about $20 on the internet if you look under commuter equipment.

One thing to note about the packaging.  On Amazon it says for LG G3, but when I received it the box does not explicitly state support for LG G3.  My assumption is LG uses the same connection setup as prior LG phones - thank goodness LG stayed with their standard connection port.

And to think they're not putting cassette players into new cars anymore! I rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is, if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue, and most importantly vinyl, which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work! It's what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody. They wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again, and look where it has got them! People listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing, where they never really listen and wouldn't spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear. The labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp.

Conclusion:

Pros:
Nothing against the Kindle -  I got my first experience with it when I bought my g/f one for her birthday last month and thought that it certainly was worth getting one. I actually first bought the original NST at a great price - but thought that that Kindle would be a better fit for her needs - and this is how I ended up with two NSTes -  and then this one with glow light last week after I was not too impressed with the Paperwhite. Since I was able to get the latest Paperwhite at a $50 discount I - and jumped on it.  I do not know if I have buyer's remorse - it is more that from the start - my very first NST provided me with everything I wanted in an e-reader.  Then the light technology came around and I wanted that - but was not willing to pay the price for this item - just a year after I had purchased the original one without light for $149.  So, I waited.  I do buy most of my books from Amazon simply because they have better prices -but truth be told - once I figure out how to get that Kindle app on my  NSTes - I might just go ahead and sell the Kindle - unless some of these  extra features it has wows me so much that they heighten my reading experiences.  So far, this has not happened.
The software works perfectly for how I use it. The touchscreen works better than you'd expect. I've had no issues typing on it in the rare cases where I do need to type, and everything is simple to navigate. One minor touch I love is that when the device sleeps or when you lock it the screen shows a classy black and white drawing of a famous author. I'm sure the Kindle has something similar.

I always have the "black ice" tree air fresheners in there, but they weren't cutting it. I was originally looking for an aerosol odor eliminator, but I didn't know where I'd tuck it away in there, and I also didn't really want to experiment with having some sort of chemical sitting in my truck when it can be below zero in the winter and 100+ degrees in the summer. Luckily this product popped up in the search results.

3833	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This appears to be a generic charger, not specifically designed for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 GPS, at least I could find no data with the charger that tied it to this GPS.  I decided no to use the charger on my GPS for fear I may damage it.  To return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worth.
4958	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	It was recommended that I use a dry type cleaner, I have, and love the Maxwell dry type. Maxwell is presently doing research to see if the one I purchased was defected, or if it was something that I did wrong?
I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.
1310	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	After reading many technical and customer reviews of both the Nook and the Kindle, I purchased the Nook.  I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it. Test drive the Nook for yourself before you make a decision.
603	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!

  Overall, a good value as long as you don't demand or expect more than the product can deliver.

With that said - I have had zero issues over the last several days with my Galaxy S3. The card appears to work flawlessly. I'm not inclined to return this item based on the flawless performance.
3306	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great memory card it does what it is supposed to do.
I took it to the Apple store and for $120 they were going to change it for a new one. I wanted to do some research online before committing to paying that.
But don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Excellent read. Time well spent.
-eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle)
Setup could not be easier. Simply plug one unit into an outlet near your router, and plug into the router. Plug the other unit into an outlet near the computer you wish to connect to the network, and connect it to the network card there. The job is done. As opposed to early devices of this type which were spotty at best in their operation, I found this network connection to be much like a wireless connection for reliability and speed.

Anker products are generally high quality but I am disappointed in this leather case.  Either it is not real leather or the leather is so thin that it literally rubs off of the corners and edges.

6225	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed a very short Ethernet cable to connect my new iMac to my AirPort Extreme router.  All my other cables are many feet long, and I simply didn't want coiled cable cluttering my desk. I wanted a branded cable to ensure data throughput.  I've always had good luck with Belkin products.  This is no exception. The cable is a bit longer than I need but the price was good and I didn't have to pay shipping (I'm a Prime member). I would have ordered the white one, but it costs more and so I settled for the grey.  I'm sure it will work well for a long time.
Still need more?  Buy it if you need it.
2365	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good
4639	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Totally disappointed with this product. Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon but the disc did not work in my car. The car CD player kept on displaying werror while reading this disc.
8902	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Fast shipping and unlike many cables out there, the strength of the cabling is strong and does not split open

Opening the box you're greeted with the same clean packaging style we're coming to know from Anker and the subtle, faint smell of the leather breathe over from the box when you pick it up. Its cleanly constructed with so exposed seams and everything seems fit right, nothing out of the ordinary here and nothing to mark it down on either.

One thing: the reason for the long battery life folks like here is because it takes C batteries. I used the AA rechargeables I was using in my old radio, and it works fine, fully as advertised. The battery life is satisfactory--not impressive, but OK for my purposes. But when they die, they don't fade or give warning, they just die.

Here are a few quibbles that aren't as widely known: The battery insertion is fiendish:  every cell seems to go in the opposite direction of the one before.  It doesn't obey the intuitive rule that the spring should always go at the negative (-) end of the cell.  NiMH rechargables work well, but there is no NiMH setting on the battery type.  It won't charge your NiCD or NiMH cells while running on the car battery.  You need to do two resets to really clear the trip computer.  The trip computer isn't as useful as it could be (eg: multiple 'trips' and gas milage computation).  The internally calculated routes often don't agree with routes done on the computer using the MapSource software.  Did I mention it's bulky?
 I did my research on e-readers and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and Kindle.  I chose the nook.  Why?...
7812	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It is working fine and I like it. This one have 330 clamping voltage! So it is hard to find one like this :)
2919	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased two of these and returned both. I tried to get them to play on my iMac and MacBook, but DVD's would skip and then completely freeze. I tested both players and had the same problem. It couldn't play burned DVD's or store bought ones. Junk.

Remember, you have to hear a shower radio over the shower and the bathroom fan, so it does need to be loud, especially if you listen mostly to NPR like me. I had to turn my old one all the way up, and I still couldn't hear interviews well.
You are just pouring your money into a hole in the ground when you buy a Nook. Then one day it will freeze up with all your apps and files like a BRICK. And you'll hold that BRICK by your couch, week after week, waiting for a replacement that NEVER COMES.

4620	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything. But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.

At least, I didn't care until now, when I'd like to upgrade iLife and OS X...  So, I did some research and discovered that the progressive loss of ability I had probably meant that the lens was dirty, and a cleaning disc would be the answer.
8364	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	These are very comfortable and light.  They come with a 3.5mm plug and a 1/4" adapter to fit into most MP3 players, computers and keyboards.  They seem to be well constructed, especially for a pair that cost just over $10.  The sound is good but I think that while the mids and bass are great for a headphone of this price range, the highs are a bit too bright - even harsh - for my overall preference.  I must admit that I have a $1299 pair of HiFiMan Edition X V2's that I normally listen to so it's not a fair comparison.  I use these Yamaha's to listen to music and audiobooks when I'm on my treadmill and they do just fine.
1360	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Was working fine until they added google to it. Constantly adding google+ and other apps you can't delete. System slowed down and started to get kicked off the web so it could synchronize my library with the new google updates. So google killed my fun and my nook. Traded it in getting a Kindle Fire HD instead. Nook sold out and it didn't get better for it.

1454	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I consider myself a well educated electronics purchaser who did a lot of homework over getting the kindle fire or the nook tablet.  Being a tech geek, I decided to go with the nook because of its superior specs and the fact that I prefer the nook reading experience better than the kindle one.  After doing my homework and playing with the tablet in the store I felt I made the right decision until I got it home.

1683	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful book suitable for many age groups.  It's part fairy tale, part fantasy, part action adventure.  The non-stop action made me thankful for the more sedate portions, which were not overdone. It would make a GREAT movie, with the characters rivaling those of the Harry Potter series.  I found myself becoming quite fond of many of the characters, and was sad for the book to end.  Never fear, though, the end leaves room for a sequel.
6684	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	These work great for removing any possible fiber or dust on your disc.
7837	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	First of all, I LOVE this product. When I bought it my husband jokingly said that it looked cute and small in the picture, but was really HUGE in real life. Don't tell him I said so, but he was right. It is huge and the cord is really long. Although I wish it was smaller, I still love it. It works really well when we travel and need to plug a lot of things in and although the length is annoying, it's very useful.
Unfortunately, these tapes still cannot produce 100% the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these Maxell cassette tapes will give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.

  You will buy only the things they sell and you will pay their prices. There are so many free apps and ebooks available, but you will not be allowed to have them, if you purchase a Nook. If I had it in my power, I would have everyone to buy some other brand and teach the "Big Guys" a lesson on how to treat people. Had I known about this "Hi Jacking" of my property, I would not have purchased it. I hate to sound like I'm pissed off, but I am pissed off.

The floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer, and thus gets high marks for portability.  All in all, a great camera, and if you're like me, whenever you take it with you, carry some floppies in your pocket, because you will be taking a lot of pictures.

8674	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	After reading many of the reviews on this product, I chose to get it. After receiving it, I knew that it was going to do a great job. Overall, the sound output does a great job and even when the volume is turned down you are still able to hear it clearly. The cord isn't that long, which can be a con for some of the bigger people out there, but for me, it fit perfectly. Overall I am very pleased with this product. You should get this if you are on the fence about it. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!

Update to above review: I went to move my laptop from my desk to use it as a true off line laptop (no internet connection).  Removing the cable from the ethernet jack was difficult.  It was a bit of a fight to unplug the cable.  I'm all for good tight conectivity but not so tight that the cable is hard to remove.  When I connected the cable again it required a bit of force for the cable to lock into place.  No problem if the cable is permanently connected but it's enough of a problem to reduce a five star rating to a four star.

5259	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this radio in order to listen to an AM station in my area that is very weak.  Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house.  Now, I can get it very strong and clear.  The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off.  Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem.  It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels.  It's pretty lightweight plastic.  But, the only reason I got it was to receive this one station, and it does that job well.
otherwise, it's a good product...

I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits.  For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells.  For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time.  If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.

4960	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner.  It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved.  Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music.  Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs.  If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.
2465	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	made with cheap looking plastic
As far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount.

Understand: you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today, these speakers will, out of the box, work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.

6284	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have to give Belkin credit; the cable really does appear snagless. I used this short cable to connect an Apple TV directly to router. I try to avoid wireless when I can, but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center. The texture of the cable's insulation, coupled with the cable's supple flexibility, made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled mess.
6775	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed an extension cable so I could use a USB controller with my PC.

This cable performs exactly like I need it to with no problems.
1699	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This engrossing tale is told entirely in first-person narrative, from the perspective of Tom Ryan. It is the story of Tom, told by Tom, starring Tom ... you get the idea. It's his world and he's the only important person in it; the other inhabitants of the world -the bit players - only matter if they are of use to Tom. Though not entirely original, Tom's tale is well-paced and suspenseful, with the exception of the last few chapters, which dragged a bit, with unnecessary details and flashbacks that didn't contribute to the story. There were times when I almost gave up and quit reading - I admit that I go overboard pouncing on mistakes I find, from typos to inconsistencies and implausibilities in the story, stubbornly refusing to finish a book over obvious or egregious errors. I caught on to some apparent discrepancies, but plot exposition neatly accounted for most of them. It was tempting to skip to the end as the pace got sluggish (the flashbacks were getting tedious and I just wanted my questions answered), but I didn't, and it was worth the effort to keep reading. The problem with writing a review for this particular story is that I don't want to give away any of the plot twists or revelations. The plot twists are inventive and although I had a general idea of how the mystery was going to turn out, the end still held some surprises. There is some foreshadowing of the final reveal, but the author holds enough back so that even the most astute reader can't guess exactly what's coming, but not enough that a novice reader will feel misled or cheated. Overall, I would recommend this book for its premise, readability and believability, even if it falls short of being perfect.

You will love the developing story line as the characters wind their way to friendship, and then to true love between 2 very different people.

1) The units have teeny-tiny lights on the front, and one of them represents when each unit sees the other one, but the instructions aren't all that clear as to which light is which.  But, I kinda figured it out - but the lights and the pictures next to each one are just utterly miniscule, and so it's really hard to see what's what on there.

I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says "Nook"Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a "Nook" is not required, it should say, "Not intended for Nook Devices". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to "DeskTop Study", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).

This is NOT a tablet, and as such, you can't surf the web, download apps, or play games.  What you CAN do is eliminate the tens, if not hundreds, of pounds of books that sit on your bookshelf.
Web Browsing.  The Tablet has a good web browser that supports Flash Video, which means you can watch YouTube videos.  You can keep bookmarks and open HTML pages stored on the media card.

2982	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to watch movies on my computer monitor using this external USB DVD/CD drive. It comes with the USB cable and connects to the USB 2.0 port and plays without any problems. It is easy to use and it is portable and well built. This drive does not burn media, and it does not work with Chromebook or with a direct connection to a monitor. You need to interface with a laptop or computer for this to work, but the drive does not require any external adapters. I have rated this product four stars for overall satisfaction.

4505	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Please please don't waste your money on these headfhones.  I didn't exspect great sound for under ten dollars, but I did not exspect to have know sound all, which is what I got.  Going into the trash as it would cost more to return it then I paid for it.

This system works great! The catch is spring loaded, so it will not bounce the door closed again. Once the door is opened, it will stay open. It takes just a very light pull to close the door again. I had everything installed in under ten minutes. Even the people with limited mobility are able to actuate the door stop, and then close the door again. We are ordering more to put throughout the house.

Voice quality is great in 33 minute mode. I frequently use mine  in the car with the radio on and get excellent results.  In 90 min mode,  however, a deep voice is hard to make out clearly (I agree with the  reviewer below:  a 60 min. mode would have been a good compromise).

7592	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	People have been saying for years that tapes would die, but fortunately, they never seem to. I know a number of people who have the car stereo that has BOTH  cd and the cassette. For that matter, I am starting to see cassette walkmans again. If you follow my reviews, you know that because of the dangers of cd rot, I prefer to make tapes of my cds and use them when possible. For those of you who don't know about cd rot, it is capable of wiping out a whole collection of cds. What happens is that heat and moisture turn the cd purple and make it unreadable. (In extreme cases, holes in the cd are prevalent.) If your cds are not so over the top, they may actually transfer well onto normal bias cassettes such as Maxell UR or TDK D. A previous reviewer pointed out that if you are making tapes of your cds to use in your car, a lot of times a normal bias cassette will suffice, since most car stereo speakers are not designed for high output. (He called the Maxell UR a perfect workhorse tape.) But moving to the high quality TDK SA tape, these tapes are superb and capable of holding the material even from high intense cds such as "Metallica's" 'Ride the Lightning,' "Megadeth's" 'Rust In Peace,' or "Exodus's" 'Tempo of the Damned.' I'll conclude by saying that TDK SA will not only give you excellent travel friendly copies of your cds, but using them when you travel will keep your cds safe from cd rot.

8854	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	For several years my brother had a similar (though significantly less durable) in-car trash bag. It was slightly larger but, not having the elastic top, simply spilled things if you filled it up. The velcro on the bottom also wasn't "fold-over" like this. Not that I intend to try myself, but I've seen liquid poured into these with little to NO leakage! That's wonderful! Heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an ALMOST empty soda in upside down! lol I also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely! This prevents ANY spilling and makes for easy disposal! Tie the top, unvelcro the bottom, and slide out your sealed trash bag! Works MUCH better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter! (also doesn't take up leg room in the passenger seat!)

I tried using it with my MAC, but it did not work.  Called technical support, gave me instructions to follow.  I followed them to the letter of the instruction, but to no avail.  It has worked for lots of people, and maybe there was something I supposed to do that I did not do.  Maybe the unit was defective.  In any case, if the product has so many issues it is not good.  Amazon was good to take it back at no cost to me, but I would not recommend it.

I was skeptical at first because other reviewers couldn't get the S-video to work.  It works fine for me with my philips 42 inch LCD TV.  The dreamcast is my favorite classic system and it will be getting more play time now since I can look at the graphics and not be disgusted.

The drive features a slide-tray and works decently. I used it to install Microsoft Office 2007 and Star Wars Battlefront II on my Asus T101MT tablet pc without any issues. Plus, LG is a name-brand you can trust! I highly recommend this DVD drive as you get the best bang for you buck!

8610	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works well, especially for pet odor.
3834	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The price was certainly right!  However, at ANY price, the product was worthless.  The adapter size was OK and the cord was long enough... BUT the connector end was wrong.  The shape was correct, but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the GPS device it was intended for, even though the Amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 it was bought for.  Since the cost was nearly nil (other than a couple of bucks for shipping), I did not pursue replacement.  I am still without an AC charger.
So to recap, Barnes and Noble only gives you 250mb (yes, that's megabytes) of storage on the device for your own books. The rest of the space is reserved for Barnes and Noble purchases. I was okay with this because you can add your own MicroSD card up to 32GB (WAY overkill for books lol) for storage. But Barnes and Noble has gimped this feature with this horrible glitch and refuses to fix it or even acknowledge that it even exists! It seems to me that they have found another way to force you to buy books from them instead of other sources. Isn't that a little sneaky?!

Always like Belkin Products but this one is a big Fiyasco!!!

Despite the complaints of other reviewers that the "manual" is poor--in fact it is better written and more complete than most inexpensive Chinese electronics.  Oddly the instruction "manuals" vary between the colors.  If the three players I purchased (red, blue, black), the black one came with the most complete instructions.
3992	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Seems to work fine for me.  I plugged it in from the computer to the TV.  The picture showed up and sound came through.  Not sure what else you're looking for.  It's a 1080p signal with sound.  The ends appear to be relatively solid.  No idea if this will work for high-end gaming or tons of detailed video work.  But for use as a monitor cable, did the trick me.  And the price was right!
>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.

7184	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is just a high speed USB cable and is of Belkin's normal good quality.  It does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellent.

The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)

Maxell is an excellent audio tape, and I have not had any problems with it.  Beyond that, both blank and prerecorded audio cassette tapes are getting harder to find as the audio cassette as a recording medium has pretty much faded from consumer use, and is now mainly used as one of the  backup mediums in computer centers.  Making personal recordings of elderly family members, and recording radio programs, are fast becoming the only consumer uses of audio cassette tapes, which many manufacturers no longer produce. I have bought 120 minute blank tapes at Radio Shack to record two hour episodes of "A Prairie Home Companion" on PBS radio stations for my personal library. The ones that I don't care to save, I record over the next Saturday evening at 6 pm.  It is sad to see audio cassettes fade into history, and I have not cared to keep up on the latest gadgets and recording mediums.  I will continue to use my audio cassette recorder and my VHS video recorder as long as I can.  Five stars.

A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right.  I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed.  If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold.  For the few notes I take on paper, it's really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so.

106	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It works!  I was skeptical about ordering it because the ratings weren't great, but short of buying a new Nook or replacing it with a Kindle,  it was the best short-term option.  The original plug-in part made a sizzling sound one night and stopped working.  My husband tried to plug the USB end into one of about 20 USB to plug-in wall chargers that we have around the house and none of them worked.  We're assuming there must be some proprietary thing with the Nook USB end that won't let you use generic wall chargers which really sucked because he couldn't use his Nook for weeks.  If you are contemplating purchasing a Nook,  it may be something to take into consideration.

This book would be best for someone with a new MacBook who is not that computer savvy on any platform.  For someone who is reasonably computer literate, this is much too simplistic, predominantly covering Snow Leopard topics that I feel most computer-literate people could readily figure out themselves...even if they've never had a Mac.
I chose this for the super saver shipping and the fact it seemed to work fine for other reviewers.

It is a nice cable very good purchase!

I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured, It has 2 thick arms, rather than the 2-1 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive, but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture, it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26" so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55" would fit on it too, but I have a different mounting configuration for that one.
 Also, the rechargeable batter is nice - I find it  lasts about 7 hours depending on volume, skipping songs etc.  This is more  than adequate for even extreme situations - like an LA to NY flight.
5816	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this because the optical drive on my Mac laptop started kicking out the disks. I read that the cure could be as simple as cleaning the drive, so I gave this product a shot. It worked fine at first  and I was able to use my disks. The next time it kicked out again, so I tried the cleaning disk without success. In the long run I bought an external drive rather than try to open my laptop and replace the bad drive. The external drive works well and I still have the cleaning disk just in case. The disk has tiny hairs on it to whisk the dirt away (at least once). I can use the external drive on any other computer with a USB port. All's well that ends well.
7968	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works well, and a good buy for the price.

overall kinda useless, but whatever.  at least it's not super-expensive.
In addition to set-up and basic instructions, the book takes on some daunting subjects such as networking, sharing and wireless connectivity in a calm, non-intimidating way. In addition, a complete explanation of MobileMe and Airport Extreme are both very helpful.

9183	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Having waited around to see how the MP3 standard would evolve, I felt the time was right to jump on this bandwagon. I bought the device to include it as portion of a Harley Davidson motorcycle stereo system (helmet installed headphones, with amp). I was concerned about vibration, among other things. Completed the install yesterday, and works like a champ.
8754	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Mine is a just over a year old. Guess what? Yep, it's croaking. In fact, every Sony product I bought the past decade -- a phone, 2 portable CD players, a TV, and now this -- failed just after the warranty expired. I've finally learned my lesson.

8307	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this item to go nature viewing and must say that it really is a great binocular for the price. The items viewed have a really nice 3-dimensional look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself. The focus for this model (16 x 50 Wide Angle) is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it VERY convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers. It gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups, which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades. The binoculars do shake a little b/c of the power of the magnification. And it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time b/c of its weight. It weighs about as much as one of Michener's hardback novels.
413	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	easy to install- works well
Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.
6624	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed a patch cable, and this one is great quality.  The price on Amazon is a fraction of what you will pay for this same item at Best Buy.

Have to say that I own SONY everything - they never wear out, especially picture tubes going on 20 years.  Why can't all companies be like that?!!
Sadly, the cord is so taught and tightly wound, there is no possible way to have the radio at waist level and the mic at shoulder level.  After months of trying to stretch the cord, it remains as short and tight as the day I received it.  When it was attached at shoulder level, the radio often jumped off of my belt (and survives only because the cable did not detach, and the radio did not ever strike the ground).  I have been relegated to attaching the Mic to my tie at about sternum level, which works but requires a higher audio level output than if it were on my shoulder near my ear.

5335	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought these Belkin cables. They are very nice quality. They seem heftier than a lot of the other cables. My system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the 1000 foot roll. He runs them to wall outlets, then uses the 7 foot or 14 foot snap in cable from the wall to the PC. That way, you don't have to buy a 40 dollar crimping tool.
No problems one month later.
EDIT 10/8/13: I recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable, and has a volume control and mute button, and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback (buzzing/humming noise).
My only complaint (and it is an exeedingly *small* one) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker (volume and on/off) and the sub woofer (base volume) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit (i.e. on a satellite speaker).  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.

*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.

For me, it was just too heavy.  Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.

6885	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great price and good quality, Belkin is always dependable.  The length is perfect for some temporary work areas and I have used it many times.
8290	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	They aren't wide-angle as advertised. They don't fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses, so one always sees double. I had several friends try them and they all said the same thing, so it isn't just me. With a name brand like Bushnell I thought I couldn't go wrong, but apparently their quality control is non-existent. I ordered these while traveling out west and couldn't send them back until I got home. I tried to return them, but Amazon said the last return date was one day before, so I am stuck with these useless binoculars. I need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them.
 So, consider my experiences before your eyes get deluded by its cool blue design.

I've had mine for 11 months now and I anticipate many more tunes to come.  Everyone who hears mine asks, "Is that sound coming from just those speakers?".  The highs & mids are transparent bliss and the crossover point just delivers the right response on the low end.  There is plenty of headroom on the low end to give you a good clean thump without breaking up.  I will recommend these to anyone.  Very nice.

7214	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This review is for Premium Stainless Steel 5 Piece Kitchen Essentials Knife Set with Stainless Steel Knife Holder Stand.  This set is really sharp with the metallic looking butcher block.  Definitely a change from the standard wooden ones. As for the knives themselves, they are quite sharp and have a quality feel to them. I am hoping they will hold up like my ceramic ones do. They really do look good sitting on my countertop.  I have stainless steel appliances and black and brown granite -- so this really fits right in.
7093	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It gets the job done. I've never had a Belkin product fail on me; not that there's much that could go wrong with such a simple device.

5345	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My vehicle Nav GPS/Mapping system was telling me I had a defective DVD.  Used this to clean the DVD sensor in my vehicle (sometimes off-road can't use the smartphone apps due to no service).  Worked perfectly even though designed for devices with user selectable tracks.
That having been said,  these speakers are ideal for the purpose.  After side-by-side comparing  them at a store with several other more mainstream brands, I was impressed  at the amount of what those audiophile glossies call 'presence', especially  at the low volumes appropriate for apartment dwelling.  Beat the Altec and  Labtec speakers hollow - dunno why, particularly.  A Bose system was a  little better - and about 10 times the price.

3378	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.
9059	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great

Edit update:  Lowered this to one star.  It says it provides 2.1 amps on one USB outlet and 1 amp on the other, but, after using this a handful of times, it doesn't even provide close to an amp on either.  I get a warning from my phone that says it isn't providing enough power to charge AND have the phone on at the same time...I have a 650 miliamp charger that doesn't do this!  Stay away!

5268	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Cleveland is lucky to have two public radio stations and one of the nation's oldest and best classical music stations - WCLV. But about ten years ago WCLV moved its transmitter from the east side of Cleveland to the west. The move caused most of us on the east side to have great difficulty hearing WCLV clearly. The solution for me (and many others) has been the GE Superadio III. I needed an external antenna (bought at Radio Shack for about $25) but some have have good results with the telescoping antenna only.

I would not buy this product again.
The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard.

Fact is, if you need to be mobile  with your ZIP, you should go the USB route these days.  Every new PC and  Macintosh comes with USB connectivity, and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost.

7181	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	It is always risky buying a semi-expensive product on-line, because if you have to return it, it is a lot of work/hassle for the amount of money you get back.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!  SPARE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION!  FIrst of all, I didn't even get what I ordered.  I ordered (and payed for) the more expensive Caller-ID compatible RC930 wireless jack, but they sent me the cheaper, non-caller ID compatible one.  I decided to go ahead and use it and after carefully following the directions and the troublshooting guide IT DIDN'T WORK.  Then after calling tech support and CAREFULLY following the automated trouble shooting directions it still didn't work.  So then I called back again and waded thru the automated directions again so I could finally be connected to a live technician, ONLY TO GET A BUSY SIGNAL.  So now I have to go thru the hassle of returning this product to get my $53.79 back, and I still don't have a phone jack where I wanted one.  Looks like hardwiring a new phone line will be easier.

And it is highly adjustable. Just clip it to the last pages and back cover of your book, bend it to your heart's content, and read as late as you like. Good product.
7576	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my daughters room in hopes of organizing her entertainment center.  We needed a long multi plug extension cord because the plug is about 6 feet away.  This worked great.  It was plenty long and had the right amount of plugs to plug everything in.  We are very happy with our purchase.

I am hesitant to give it 5 stars, because the first time I tried using it, it did not work.
1809	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This book was free. And I am so glad it was because otherwise I would not have read it. Love this series. Sweet romance, good story, a little intrigue some drama but a happy ending.
Weak points? Well, the cheap build quality and you have to suffer with a less than precise spin dial. Also some don't like its huge size. But for the price I can't fault the radio. For strong AM/FM reception with a big full speaker than can fill a huge room, look no further. Buy a Superradio III for one-fourth the cost of radios that won't give you as much bang for your buck.

844	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It does what it is supposed to do! not much to write about a micro disk
7319	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It was a pretty good format while it lasted.  I jumped on the high-capacity storage (remember when 100MB was a lot a storage?) bandwagon back in 1996 and for several years afterwards, ZIP disks were my preferred archive choice.  Considering I just bought some&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/new-disks/dp/B00004Z6PR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">new disks</a>&nbsp;in 2014, it should give the reader a hint about the influence that the ZIP format had.
After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit. As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.

This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)
108	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this so I could carry it with me and recharge my Nook when I am out and about. It works very well for that. The prongs of the charger fold down, so they don't tear holes in my bag or anything in the same pocket with it. The charging cable is plenty long enough to reach the outlet at my local coffee shop. It's an official product, so I don't have any worries about it overheating my Nook and causing a fire like knockoff brands can. And if anything happens to my everyday charger, I know I have a spare.
Rating: R for violence, language, and sexual references
But, even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low, though without background noise.

* Buttons are in bad positions. When you press the buttons the whole unit tips over.
*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.
1845	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great book!  I used the Snatcher project to help my Grandson build this Robot.  We built it and it worked very well.  Highly recommend this book.  I only give it a 4 out of 5 because the illustrations are not as clear as they could be.
9908	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what I paid for the whole unit with a couple of these. Overall, it works as described so I only docked it 1 star for the price.

So, if you've ever seen "What the Bleep Do We Know?", or are familiar with Dr. Masaru Emoto's work, then you have heard about water crystals supposedly being affected by words or sounds, etc., nearby. I have not proven this (or tried to disprove it), but I think it makes sense (in my mind). It is for this reason, that I like to drink/eat from containers that I like, whether due to color, design, material, "eco"friendliness, etc. Even if it doesn't affect the contents, it affects my mood :)
2202	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my daughter so she could read books in the back seat of the car. It's almost too bright for that because it can be a little distracting to me as the driver-- I have to remind her to angle the light straight down at her book so I can't notice it.
It has a shoulder strap that I don't like (because it makes me look like a tourist).

1308	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle. I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)
6962	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this so I could charge my iPad over a longer distance. Being that this is a USB extender, I just plugged the male end into the wall wart and the female end attached to the iPad charging cable. It does charge slower than the original short cable does, but that's understandable as you lose power over distance. I've also used the cable for extending a mouse and keyboard and it works just fine. Great price, solid product.
2228	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	GOLD is good. Makes the best quality connections for data trans. Length is more than adequate (6ft), as length can attenuate (diminish) the quality of signals. Also, sheathing to reduce/illuminate cross-talk or interference both in and out of the cable. Used to connect BluRay player (Wi-Fi) to 45 inch Plasma TV w/o a hitch. Amazon Cables are just as good. I think they all come from China. The thickness of the wire and the GOLD plate are both factors in quality data links. Like the size of a hose for water, and how much pressure it will endure. With FREE shipping you can't go wrong, and they are guaranteed. It took about three weeks for delivery.
Recently I decided to purchase a new GPS and considered selling the GPS 12.  But after a few days with the new unit, I decided the GPS 12 still had plenty to offer me for my type of use (Off-road driving).  I think it will be with me for many years to come!
I've had the device for a year now and I have never had a problem with it freezing, losing my place or being unfairly slow to open. The page turning has never been an issue either.
  Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.

I sent an email to the seller....since I had to pay for the cheap product +shipment! don't think much in return!
Having said all of this I did purchase the Rio 600 and I give  it two thumbs up. The volume rocks and it has more functionality to the  controls and the layout. Since the 600 cost over $100. and has only 32MB of  internal memory it's more expensive but in the long run I think you'll be  happier.
5332	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	The sound quality is good, the fit comfy and the close-fitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the NR on.  When you turn on the NR, though, you'll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum.

8460	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I used this headset for about 3 years, first using it on a t289, then upgrading to a t6400.  It was used as a convinient way to listen to radio broadcasts in a crowded situation and with a touch of a button, I can easily respond to any transmissions I need to.
this will last for a long time and it supports all the platforms d3d ,  glide and opengl meaning complete compatibility .
It comes with no directions and is not plug and play.
I use these bands to exercise on the couch using a cycling, rowing or curling motion while on my back.  They work well for resistance training.
I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.
57	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.
I have also recently purchased this case:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UXNHRS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Which is decent enough for the price, though I can't fit the nook with the silicone case in there which is a bummer since with this case, it's kinda awkward for me to turn the page with the buttons since I'm so used to the extra width of the silicone case (I know I can just turn the page by swiping the screen, which I do at times, but I enjoy clicking the page turning buttons.)So in general for this case, you get a decent case for the price, but if you want to invest a bit more money for a higher quality case, go right on ahead. I'm only 16 and paid for all of these with my own money so I wanted to save as much as I could (which is why I had originally bought the used nook).
Throughout the novel, Jian must improvise.  His tale intertwines with that of Ding Ming, an "indentured servant" of sorts.  Ding Ming has been smuggled into England with his wife, hoping to make a better life but finding it torn to shreds.

However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.

4)  No presets, no clock, no weather band, no SW
6186	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Wished I would have read the reviews closer before ordering.  The adapter is absolute junk and a complete waste of money.  It does not work!
1255	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.
8269	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The number 1 reason this is terrible? The design for going over your ear is just plain stupid. It doesn't stay on. It more or less dangles on your ear and if you bend over or tilt your head it basically falls off. Maybe if you have huge ears this MIGHT stay on, but who knows. I didn't test the sound quality because honestly, if it doesn't stay on your ear then who care how superb the quality is.
If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not "locations" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.

7034	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this keyboard adapter in order to use an old Hi-Tek RT-101+ DIN-5 PC-XT/AT keyboard with "space invader" style keys (gotta love them clickies!)  However, when I plugged the keyboard in and booted my PC, POST displayed an error message: "Keyboard/Interface error" "press F1 to continue".  I proceeded to troubleshoot using the various PS/2 to USB adapters that I had while wondering if I had received a defective product or if my keyboard was broken.  It turns out that there was a switch on the underside of my keyboard that lets it operate in either PC-XT mode or AT mode.  I flipped the switch to AT mode, and my computer was able to finish POST.
9230	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Amazon's review still touts this as a "top of the line" camera when Nikon released the third generation CoolPix 990 months ago.

If you have a long drive trip, you may need a bigger one, except dump it often.
UPDATE:  Since the time I originally wrote this review, Brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces, making the backing easier to remove.  However, the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricity.
2257	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Currently returning this product because the sound doesn't come through the speaker consistently. Sometimes the sound works in both ears, sometimes in one, then the other. Not reliable at all.

The unit is very well made and I expect many years of good service from it.
8251	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Yes, this unit does work remotely - provided you have good coordination and a long stick!  It would only "learn" one of my A/V device remotes (all happen to be Sony).  To Amazon's credit, they are selling at a price $... less than the competition, which makes it competitive with other non-remote (get up off your behind - walk over - push the button) type switches.  If you're just looking for a good switch with lots of connections, this could be a good choice at Amazon's price.  Just don't count on getting it to work from across the room.

I have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.

6551	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So, a buddy of mine lives in an older house.  In this house, his internet/wireless router is set up in the basement.  The problem is that his house has a firewall built in.  "Isn't that a computer thing?"  you are asking yourself right about now.  No.  Well, yes, but before the internet was invented, a firewall was a concrete floor placed between the basement and first floor in an effort to slow or stop the spread of a fire that started in the basement.  The odd side-effect being that this now computer-related term is also an excellent method for stopping a wireless router signal.  My buddy has always complained about this.  I don't know why he doesn't move his router, but I didn't want to ask.  I thought, what BETTER place to test my new toy, the Belkin VideoLink thingy???
There were originally two ways that NT owners could enhance the tablet but B&N are now attempting to close both of these paths with their latest operating system 'upgrade' (version 1.4.1) that is automatically installed on your Nook Tablet when you connect to the internet. They issued this 'bug fix' release on December 23rd. Bah humbug is right.

Features: Power switch (button) is separate from the volume control.  So you won't be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on.  Bass and Treble controls.  A mono headphone out (meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear).  Loud.  Easily fills a good-sized room with sound.  On AM, it has an optional "wide" mode which can give you really great sound on some AM stations, at the price of selectivity.  On FM it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong FM signal (you may wish to turn off AFC for weak FM signals near strong stations).  It has terminals for external FM and AM antennas.  It has a nice, 36" long FM antenna, and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for AM.  It has a nice handle on top, the kind that bangs into the FM antenna if the antenna is extended, so be careful.  There's no light on the tuning dial.  Again, you must tune by ear.

The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long. It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won't stick to the label. I would not recommend this product.

- I have used BN customer service before, and it wasn't that bad. The ereader screen had stray black lines running thru it shortly after purchase. We called and the CS rep had us exchange it in-store for a new one. No big deal.
2094	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I use this every night.  Works great, doesn't run through batteries, flexible and durable.  Would recommend.
Surprisingly, the unit shows up assembled in its box and ready for a quick and easy installation. I did not need the extension arms, and these were not pre-installed for obvious reasons that fewer installations require them. Of the TV wall mounts I have installed in the past (quite a few for myself, friends, family, and neighbors), this one is by far the best and at a fraction of the price of other less-quality units.
My main reasons for purchasing a Nook over the Kindle (or anything else) is that this Nook has a glowlight, a micro sd slot, and it has a lot of 3rd party support for hacking. I rooted using NookManager (look for the thread on XDA forums) and it was very easy.
The Samsung Series 5 550 Chromebook I then bought proved to be and excellent computer.

9006	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I love the digital music channels provided through my cable TV service, and I wanted to be able to listen to this music outside. I just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing CDs--especially when I had great music playing inside the house.
  THE VERBAL ON THE CLEANER DISK PROMISED SEVERAL THINGS BUT INITIALLY THE PROGRAM WAS NOT PER INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN NOTHING ON THE DECK THAT DIED COMPLETELY

7966	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Really struggled with this one, I'm pretty sure it's a good product but came broken lacking tab and rubber thingy.
6381	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy, takes being stepped on etc. The color helps me differentiate one line from Another. Good connections. What else is there?
7052	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have always had good service and good mail time through Amazon.  I needed this cable and they had it.  thanks
1. The actual reading:
The only downside of this unit is  the headphones;  the ones you get with it are about as good as you'd expect  if you bought them for $2 at a flea market. You'll need to buy another  pair, and they'll need to be the same ultra-sensitive kind you need for  newer Sony MiniDisc recorders; otherwise you'll need some sort of add-on  headphone amp, like the Boostaroo.
For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit.
3402	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great love it
I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.
6889	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Seems to work very well and I bought a couple because I thought it would be a throw away item, but surprisingly works pretty well.
12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.
9577	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Best price for the product.
2889	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	A bit clunky, but a great deal for the price.  I'm using a Mac, OS X, and it really did work without any setup; couldn't get it to work on a Linux machine.

"Hello,
I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products.
7815	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I grabbed this quick on Cyber Monday not noticing it was a table top unit. I have too many electronics by my bed and had one of those small white strip surge outlets. The problem was 3 of the 6 items I charge there have those transformer big plugs so I hade to plug and unplug all the time. With this one I can plug in my decorative lamp, floor Ott light, alarm clock, tablet, nintendo DS and breathing machine. Everything is now neat and I don't have to keep switching things out. At most only 3 items are in use at one time. I like the quick on and off button I can lean over and hit should I choose to.
8436	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Not good.

9788	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	WORKS GREAT
695	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time.
6802	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I don't know where these tapes were manufactured, but they are very poor quality and eventually ruined one of my VCRs.  They dirty the heads in no time flat, and no amount of cleaning helps.  I definitely would not recommend buying these Maxell tapes.
3498	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Installs easily.  Pre-formatted for Motorola Droid Razer.  Works flawlessly.  Great buy.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Needs no user inputs or actions.  Great value.

3828	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time and as described.  Plugged directly from my Canon DSLR to my TV.  Pictures were clear and bright.  Great price when I combined this purchase with other cables I needed.
997	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this micro SD card to use in a contour+ camera that I have mounted in my vehicle (I often make interstate drives) and wanted to extend the record time greater than the 32gb cards that I have.  I have not made a long trip with this card at this point, but it tested to be 64GB and has quick speed for video.  I generally get about 8 hours of recording on a 32GB card so on a drive longer than that, I have to change cards.  I expect this card to far exceed record time to cover any driving time I will make in a single day.  It immediately formatted to use in the Contour camera and works great.  I recommend this card if you want a higher speed/higher capacity card.
1401	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Its not the best, but it works.  I've had it for 2 years now, still runs fine.  I don't really play games on it, I use it for books, twitter, facebook, netflix, or surfing the web.  Its cheap for what it is, and now has access to the Google Play store for apps.  I highly suggest it amongst the cheaper tablets!
8090	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Works as expected and quality seems good.  No problems so far. Nine more words are required so I am fudging to fit.
UPDATE Oct 28, 2010
6540	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This item was well made as one would expect. Performed well. Used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem. This in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles. Did the job.
You can probably put something sticky on the end to grab onto whatever slipped down into that narrow space.
To the gamers out there, loaded up counter strike, awesomenauts, eve online, all ran at this resolution, full screen, no bars.
1119	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Best E-reader I've owned This model no longer produced was happy to find this one!
Conclusion: B&N completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update. It is definitely not worth the money right now.
9885	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I use to but this Black on Clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me. The Clear part was really clear - now it's sort of a matte clear but it's OK for most things you put it on.


The access speed is pretty good. Not as fast as the stock 8GB I got with it, but I was expecting much worse. In the end, the extra space was a good trade off with a little bit of loss of speed. now I can put my whole music collection on it ;)
The Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.
7565	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Can't confirm it as to surge protection but it is a nice heavy duty power strip.  It has a long heavy cord.
The fact that the player is unskipable (it's not like MiniDisc  where they SAY it doesn't skip and it really does) and extremely  lightweight makes the Rio the perfect exercise companion; I take it on  every run.
Doesn't need a mouse pad, or even the desk space needed to move a regular mouse around
1151	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Easy to download and easy to read. Hods a charge very well.
9266	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This tape is great!  Very crisp text and very easy to peel off backing and past on to "things"
54	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said "Construction Ahead" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.
i would recommend this.
8495	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	GOOD
4523	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this head cleaner for vhs to dvd transfers and it does what it's suppose to. The alternative is to open the case and clean the heads with a cloth & alcohol, which I've done before. With old vhs tapes, I've found that you need to clean the unit once in every 30 hours of play. You will know this when there is static on the screen when the video is playing or when you hear squealing noise while the tape is playing. Also, old tapes get "stuck" or hard to turn in the cassette housing. Gently drop the cassette on a flat surface from about 1/2" a few times on each side to loosen them up or find an unwanted vhs tape and swap the tape reels & tape out between the cassettes. Goodwill has vhs tapes for $.49. This should last you while you do the tape transfer.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!! It was so much fun. Yes it did remind me a lot of The Devil Wears Prada but Taylor became a cherished character and I very much wanted her to succeed. I even loved the snarky Quinn. She was a spoiled brat but she had a good heart and I was rooting for her too. This is a fun breezy read that I recommend to all chick lit lovers.

6573	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	While I have wireless internet in my house, the router is in my basement and the signal strength in the upstairs bedrooms isn't the greatest.  I actually had a second wireless router that I wasn't using and thought, it would be great to set up a second access point in the upstairs bedrooms.  With the help of these ethernet-over-powerline adapters, I was able to accomplish that perfectly.  Basically, you just plug one into your router (or switch depending on where you want it on your network) and a wall outlet.  And then you plug the other one into another wall outlet and viola!  You have an instant network!  It really was that easy.  So I plugged the second one in to the upstairs bedroom and plugged my other wireless router into it.  I had already pre-configured that second wireless router with it's network info and key, etc., so it was just a matter of plugging it in.  I ran a speed test back to my provider (using a wired connection into the second router) and the speed was perfect and although there were some additional hops, the latency was still good.
2187	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	OK, not dramatically brighter than the one-battery light it replaced for me, but I presume it will last a lot longer before replacement batteries will be needed.

2361	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Yes I think you are sexy and this spreads the power around.
4489	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Oh darn, I should have read the reviews before I bought this. Tried everything I could think of to make this work short of ripping the tape out of the cassette and rubbing it on the vcr heads. The cleaner wouldnt play more than a couple seconds and eventually locked up the player. Had to unplug the vcr and plug it back in to eject the cassette. Amazon said this item is non-returnable so all I can do is eat the money spent and give this item and the seller one star. Stay away from this item!

The downside of this model is that Logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit, and no parts are available for repairs, and no one I know repairs them.  To get a part, you must cannibalize another Trackman Marble FX, and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components.  There are no new FX's anywhere.

P.S. If your battery compartment clips on your super Superadio 111 don't all snap into place, and if you haven't thought of it yet, fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the 'V' of the offending clip(s) and voil, the compartment is closed tightly. Now it's a 5 star radio!
3203	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I have been trying TP-Link products for over a year now. So far, so good. They perform as advertised and the the price is really good. If you look at their printed color ad stuffed in the box with one of their products or go to their website you will see that they make a lot of stuff for networking and computer usage. This little box is working just fine. I needed it to allow a mix of XP and Win7 boxes that are all tied to my router/network to use the same printer. Just read and understand the instructions and you will be fine. It's not that hard to install. The only thing that I missed is that it will not allow me to use the scanner on my all-in-one printer but that cannot be blamed on TP-Link.......this is a print server not a scanner/printer server. Yes, I would suggest this to an associate.

] I bought this mount on Feb, 2014. Today is 20 Nov, 2016!!! I never thought I would write something for a TV MOUNT again, after 2 & half years!!! Well, here I am! Amazed AGAIN! I was watching a 32" Samsung LCD. Its a old TV, today I replaced it with a 50" Samsung 4K LED. I didn't use those 4 extender arms on my 32" TV, so I kept it on my basement store room. Today, fortunately I found them with all necessary screws!!! Mannn! This thing is amazing. Within this price, they delivered a very sturdy, swivel mount with all necessary screws & washers! My 50" TV needed a different & bigger screws and I found it in this wall mount's box!!! This is awesome, this THE best ever $30 I've invested. The mount holding my bigger 50" TV without any problem! & I can adjust it easily. Once again, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this inexpensive yet amazing wall mount to any one.

2681	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This charger will charge my iPhone 4 and make a cool BRIGHT blue LED (Make sure the LED light is not directly to you eyes). But the major problem is it will make a loud noise itself and also interference with my car audio system while in charge. I tested this in both of my cars and this problem consists, therefore I conclude this charger is useless. If you can stand loude noise while playing music then this might work for you otherwise this product is worthless piece of crap. I suggest not to waste your money here.

The GPS III Plus has detail maps that can be uploaded to it, and programs like Street Atlas from Delorme add the routing before you leave the house or  from your laptop on the road.

5001	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Who still uses VHS tapes these days?  People that haven't converted their beloved old school workout tapes by Jane Fonda to DVD.  I do not fall into this category, but, I was responsible for getting a VCR to work.  The old one was eating tapes, received a "new" one from a friend.  Didn't chew up tapes, but it only showed a quick 2 seconds of a tape, then everything was garbled beyond recognition.  No matter how much I played with the tracking, it did not improve.  Ran the Maxell VCR cleaner through a few times, seemed like a slight improvement.  Ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole, applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon.  Put it back in the VCR, ran it a few more times, BINGO, works again.

1484	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	My wife received a basic Nook for Christmas.  Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to "Buy me a book". As the nearest B&N store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N site I discovered a little free program called "Nook for PC". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.

As far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning, maybe I just lucked out, but I had these things tuned in about three seconds. I've also never lost a signal randomly, or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained.  I will say, though, that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob, and it's very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones, or when one wants to adjust the volume.  But this is a minor complaint (though I would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume, or in some other less easily accesible spot).
** EDIT a few days later **

2564	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I like this charger because it charges my android phone fairly quickly in a few mins (not full battery but enough when in a rush).

My first thought about that is oh geez, I got ripped off (granted that looking around at different places, this seemed to be the average price of lens cleaners, so it is not that big of a deal..).  Here is where my rambling of my Sony D-NS707 comes in.  I am not going to say OH WOW, THIS WILL FIX ALL YOUR ISSUES... though I have tested it for a bit (not as long as I should have probably) and NOT ONE SINGLE NOISE OR SKIP in even the most problematic disc (prior to cleaning).
6328	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	happy with this.
Looking more closely at the cleaning cassette, I find it only has a very short stretch of cleaning tape. And the spool it's on is very loose in the housing, it wouldn't rewind in the machine (again, a very reliable machine without a lot of use). I tried rewinding by hand and it was very stiff and hard to do. But I figured I have nothing to loose and tried it again. It wouldn't even run for more than 10 seconds.
Really great bang for the buck, I don't regret my purchase at all.
Get er done at 1:1!!!!

But, for the price, I have no complaints.
Another very important factor is the quality of the MP3's being played; the better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a MP3 or other digital file.  After all, some people are happy with 128 kbps MP3's (which are pretty low quality to begin with) and none of my MP3's are less than 256 kbps ... even those I've purchased from Amazon.
The radio is made in China and has been re-branded as Eton recently.  I have one of the pre-Eton Chinese-made models but I wonder how much better the old Taiwanese version was.

I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).

As far as the sound he says thy are pretty good. Mid-range sound quality - a good value for the quality. The cord is a little short since he is standing while recording, but I'm not too worried about that because I am sure the tight coil will relax over time.
514	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My application was to set a 50" TV right under the ceiling in my sports room. Plus, the location was above the closet's sliding doors leaving only 17" of vertical space on the wall. This mount allowed for such a tiny foot print with no problems. And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets. This might save you $500 - $1,000 on a Sound Bar.

Great Buy!
So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine.

Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !!

1465	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books. My plan was test it out and buy 3 if it worked. I planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books. Barnes and Noble requires a credit card to activate this unit! That is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it. They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information. The answer from 3 people was you can not delete your account information. I can not recommend this company.
4822	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I am shocked by how terrible these sound. It reminds me of listening to an AM station on a portable transistor radio, if you're old enough to remember that. I'm surprised Maxell would put their name on these. I won't look at Maxell products the same way again.

7449	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I'm a computer consultant, which means I use my PalmPilot all the time.  I had a Palm III, but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket.  I switched to the Palm V series for its solid construction and rechargable battery.  I searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the Palm V hard case for this reason.  It protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package.  Even with the case, it's still smaller than a Palm III.  You have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to HotSync while still inside the case.  I had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish.  Other than that, it's perfect!  When I beat up the case too much, I'll just buy another one.  My Palm V still looks brand new!

Cons:
6991	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my portable speakers for my mp3/mobile phone.  The cord that came with the speakers was not long enough to reach under my desk to the wall (only one outlet in the room I am in).  I figured I don't really need 10 feet for that but for other areas of my house where wall outlets are scarce this would come in handy.  Please note there is a female and male end, like any other extension cord.  This is perfect for the price.  I recommend it.

The NST is also much more comfortable in my small hands - although it is a wider device. This is because part of the back of of it is recessed - giving about an inch of a border all around it for me to grip onto it.  I never feel as if the device will slip out of my hands.

557	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have a 42" Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount.

- While the touch screen is one way to go, it is not really necessary. And you really need to adjust the brightness on it pretty much from the get-go.

Update: I have to return the item because it doesn't work for go pro. I get SD Err. I tried multiple times and it's pretty easy inserting a ad card into a go pro so it's definitely the cards fault.

Installation was easy, all the parts and hardware that we needed (and didn't need!) were in the box.  We had it up in very little time.  It's great.  One person could hang it alone, but two makes it much easier.  It has multiple points that you can level the television, so it doesn't necessarily need to be perfectly level (the installation person for me got it right).  There is no list, and it holds position really well.

5328	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	In today's world of shelf system stereos and boomboxes, the radio tuner component is usually an after-thought in system design.  As a result, radio reception is generally not a priority, and AM reception is dismal, at best.  The Superadio series is just what its name implies: sensitive reception and good sound reproduction.  It's not stereo, but the positive aspect of that is that instead of a pair of junk speakers, you have a single good quality unit.  Great for kitchen, workroom, garage, etc.  A real bargain!

Video.  NetFlix and Hulu work good over a wireless connection, but you may get lower resolutions due to the bandwidth limits of a wireless connection.  Playing stored video files requires using the media player. Even though the web browser supports Flash video, the media player does not.  As long as you convert your videos to .m4v format, you can put anything on the Tablet (Handbrake or RealPlayer is perfect for converting video on a PC/Mac).  The image quality is great, although I seem to notice a slight flicker in converted Flash videos like they are playing at 28 frames per second rather than 30.  The media player does not support scene selection/jumping to chapters in movies and has no bookmarking feature.  Unlike the music player which will play in the background, you cannot multitask.  If you leave the media player to use another app, your video will stop.  Unfortunately, videos get lumped into the media gallery with photos and the thumbnail appears to be a random still image from 1 minute into the video.  Verdict: PASS (it's a book reader, not a movie player)

If your digital camera is similar in size to Kodak's DC3400, get this bag.  It's simply the best balance, between compact size - and having enough room for all your accessories.

8802	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Very dissatisfied with this, the earphone (earbud) is fine, but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone. Even a females voice, usually more clear than a males voice, is very hard to understand using the microphone. I have also not been able to get the iVox feature to work with this either.

The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest.

1300	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.

Compared to wireless networks, this is slower than 802.11n (300Mbps) - but people rarely get 300Mbps from n. It's typically closer to 200Mbps. So you basically have "n" speed without the interference and connection issues. Wireless "g" maxes out at only 54 Mbps. It's twice as fast as the standard 100 base T network.
8638	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Wonderful accessory to my Motorola walkie's!  I've had them years but needed a replacement because I lost one, not because it broke.  It's taken a beating with exposure to snow while I ski.  One thing not documented is that the voice quality depends on the sender's walkie volume setting.  If the sender has the volume set really high, their voice comes across very garbled, so they have to turn it down a bit.  Also, when talking, don't put the mic right up to your mouth.  These tips are true when both using the mic and when not.
5627	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	They do not have any attachment to keep it on the wire unless its velcro'd.  Would have been a lot more useful if I didn't have to keep track of them when unrolling and rolling up the cables.  You get what you pay for
It's super clean, great craftsmanship though, and keeps my limp wrists from getting too limp because of its soft goodness.

While on a particularly troubling case his negotiations failed terribly, resulting in the death a a child.  Jack was then suspected of causing the death of a 'person of interest', a person who had made a very interesting statement to Jack before falling to his death, which had resulted in Jack leaving the police under a cloud of suspicion.  Now, just as Jack was beginning to re-establish his life events began to unfold that lead Jack to question everything he had known to be true about his life and himself.

I found this to be rather stiff and didn't readily bend to conform to the cables I was wrapping.  8" is a nice length, but much longer than what I needed, so I ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it.  You could probably cut an end off, but I like longer ties, as it seems I'm constantly moving things around and I get very frustrated when I find something a few inches short.  If the 1" hook part were not as stiff I'd give it the extra star.

The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.

I contacted B&N. They gave me an 800 number, which turned out to be a couple in Ecuador (I asked) on a crackling dial-up line, who took my credit card number before they would ship me a replacement unit, then just as they were issuing the RIN, the line conveniently went dead, after an HOUR of international long-distance.
I did get good AM/PM reception within the city limits but I can do that with almost any radio. SW modes were limited, even on a clear nights, on top of a mountain. Its a weak radio, probably good in a very civilized part of the world but worthless out where you really need it. Small size is nice but why carry a radio around if you can't pick up anything once the city lights are no longer in sight??

The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.

7253	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	First of all these are a good value for the money. They feel nice in the hand with good cushioning. The handles have metric hex holes that can be used as wrenchs in a pinch. The hanging hole is a 12 point wrench as well. Nice feature, I haven't measured the sizes of these extra wrench points so I can't report those. The chromed surfaces are non reflective sand finish. The adjustment wheel moves smoothly through the range and are a bit looser than the High End and more expensive adjustable spanner wrenchs I already owned. Be aware that if the wrench isn't snugly attached to the nut or bolt slippage is possible due to the looseness of the adjuster. Finish is overall pretty good I do however object to the sharp milling burrs at the ends and flat edges of the jaw of the wrenchs. This was common in all three of the wrenchs and it appears deburring is a skipped step in the manufacturing process. Nothing that a moment with a fine metal file cannot remedy. Be aware you may get a cut from these sharp edges if you are useing these tools bare handed. Overall a good serviceable product that I expect to use for many years. For the $12.00 I can recommend this wrench set with the listed minor caveats. These are most appropriate for the home handiman on a budget and might not be what professional mechanics want in thier toolboxes.
The connectors are nice and soft and I love the blue color.
2682	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Functionally, this product works fine.  However, the indicator light is so bright that it is annoying to have plugged into the dashboard receptical at night.  I put electrical tape on the surface to cover the light.  It helps but should not be necessary.

Lastly, the DVI plug on the back of the monitor is in a really inconvenient place. It's really hard to plug anything into it without laying the monitor flat. And you better screw it in very well, otherwise it's sure to fall out. Also, you have to bend the DVI cable a LOT to get it into place, which again is just poor design.

278	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	If you are a Mac OSX MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook AIR newbie or have used these laptops for some time without really "digging into" the system then this is a good book for you. The author does a good job of very clearly outlining the essential operating elements of your Mac laptop in an easy to understand style that may bore the more advanced users but is spot on for us beginning and intermediate users who will find the book to be a useful reference. He does a very nice job of walking us through the screens necessary to connect to wireless networks and even has a section on how to use your iPhone to tether WiFi to your laptop. He does a good job of taking us through the basic programs included with OSX including Mail, Safari, Address Book, iCal and the rest of the lot including the ins and out of iTunes and MobileMe. The book goes into linking the Mac laptop with external devices as well as providing some solid advice on how to keep your data "safer" through activating the firewall and how to use Time Machine. The troubleshooting section is OK but he doesn't go into much detail on how to utilize some of the software tools available for diagnosis but does provide a listing of helpful tools and where to obtain them. In summary, this book is really "The Missing Manual" (as many Que Publishing books were called previously) and should be an essential purchase with any new Mac laptop in order to obtain the most out of your system.

6717	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Around 2003, I purchased a 10 foot Belkin USB extension cable.  It has been awesome.  It also works flawlessly extending my Apple wall charger to my iPad.  It's just a 10 foot gray cable, with the name Belkin on it.  I ordered several more extenders with the Amazon brand to charge other Apple devices, and none of the deliver a full charge, for reasons I can't understand.  The iPads all say "Not Charging".  Though, not with my 2003 Belikin.  So I send the Amazon cables back and order 5 of these guys, which look exactly like the one I've had for years.  Yet somehow, none of these work either.  All say 'Not Charging'.  And indeed, they do not.  They charge when the iPads are off, but if you use them, the battery will drain while the device is plugged in, making these cables nearly worthless.  So what happened between 2003 and now?  Why is this old cable so much more versatile?

  Therefore one cannot keep the TV properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles.

There is little in this book so specific to laptops that I would hesitate to recommend it to a desk-top only student. It is really about the OS, and it does a beautiful job introducing the power of OSX 10.8. Almost every page of the book contains numerous full-color illustrations that hold the reader's hand while marching them through operations on the Mac. I am experienced in printing costs, and I wonder that a book so laden with color can be offered to the market at such a reasonable price. It also happens to be very well laid out. Clean and simple. You can read it in a crowded, noisy restaurant and follow the argument easily.

The plot is "different".  If you're a traditional mystery follower who expects certain things to happen in order, you may be slightly disappointed.  But the plot is unique.  A true literary art, as it is subtle, and perhaps somewhat hidden in the Legend's mind.  And the purpose of a mystery is to lead the reader down a path of intrigue, throwing out subtle clues and yet revealing nothing that will allow you to grasp the conclusion--therein, Mr. Enright has excelled.  I, as a mystery writer, applaud myself on being able to figure out early on "what's going on".  That didn't happen here.  I was tempted many times to move to the end of the book, but as with all books I enjoy I denied myself that pleasure and kept turning pages.  Searching for the clues that would reveal the end.  I was astounded.  I would never have guessed the ending.

I had a couple ones from Radio Shack before this one that didn't hold up for very long, and broke after a short while.  The problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player.  This Cassette Adapter uses a much more durable cord, which gives it better reliability and sound quality.  I have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone.  I have a discerning ear for sound quality, and this exceeds all other units I've tried.

Had problems in NT4 as well as Windows 2000.  In frustration, I spent a little more and bought a 3Com 3C905 and it's been rock solid.  Great price and probably a good card for most people, but I had zero luck with it.

9253	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have only ever had one of these break on me, when it jammed, then the tape broke and i was unable to re attach it.  Other then that one time (out of probably 30+ cartridges) they work great.  I would prefer to see the price come down a bit as they are overly expensive, and the machine does waste alot of tape by default (no doubt intended)

Sound Quality: Well, they sound good to me. I've had some headphones sound tinny or "weird", but these sound pretty normal. Mind you, I'm certainly no audiophile and I abhor "bass" in my music and whatnot, so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.
I readily admit I am not the target user Barnes and Noble (B&N) had in mind for the NOOK Tablet.  I spend a lot of time flying for work and my needs were for a supplement to my laptop. Tablets, including the vaunted iPad, are meant for enjoying media (music, video, casual games, reading) and not for editing or creating new content.  The 7" tablets are even more hampered by their limited screen space.  So why did I choose a 7" tablet instead of an iPad or 10" competitor?  Price.  The large tablets start at $600 and after adding peripherals your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is $900 - $1000, which is the same price as a good laptop that does everything...except run on battery for a 6+ hour flight.

Determined that it was a defective cable and ordered this one.  Have not lost a connection since installing it about a month ago.  Belkin makes good stuff.

9020	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This radio has very good sensitvity to FM, MW and Shortwave.  Its sensitivity is almost as good as my Grundig 400PE, but some of the other specs aren't quite as good which I would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the 400 PE.  Its power consuption is better than  the 400 PE too.  It's smaller size (than the 400 PE), very good designed,  easy to use controls, good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value.  I like this radio's abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency I am interested in.  This is a fine little radio--- four stars.

I have a keyboard, a Yamaha MM6 that I wanted to attach to my computer, so I can record through Cubase LE. I started tripping over the standard size cord, so I added this Belkin extension, and now it is safely tucked away. Sure beats having to replace the USB port in the computer from abuse. Belkin makes nice stuff, and this is one of those things that they make well. Highly recommended.
467	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I am loving this product, it is what I was expecting and more.  I was worried about those extensions on the end and didn't even have to use them, but they are thicker than they look in the picture.  Was worried a bit about getting caught with you get what you pay for and a lot of cases that is true, but I think this will hold up as well as the ones you may spend $100's for.

When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)
Just to note, even though the card is not technically fully supported on the Rezound - meaning that you won't get the full 30 MB/s write speed, you still get a ton of space for a pretty good price.

1482	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Just got this refurb Nook as my first ebook reader, and I am very happy.  Like any other refurb electronic device I've bought in the past, the only way to tell this was a refurb was by looking at the receipt.  Otherwise, it looks brand-new, perfect finish and screen, and so far, it works fine.  Downloaded a couple free books from the B&N Store, a bunch of Project Gutenberg books, something from the Google bookstore, and a PDF, and they have all worked fine.  Even tried out the web browser.  It works, but with the slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen and the small size of the color LCD, it's more of a novelty than something you would use as a primary internet device.  Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support downloading, so you can't go the Project Gutenberg website and download a book directly from the site to the Nook.  Hopefully that gets changed in the future, that would be nice to be able to do!  But this is not a make-or-break issue, just a convenience I would like.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase!

This may sound simple for all you computer experts out there, but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that, it can get very confusing.
Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.

Previously I've used other USB lights which were either inflexible and small, or such a concentrated light that they seemed too bright to use.  The Mighty Bright isn't overly bright and the light is a 'blue' light; softer than most, which is easy on the eyes.  The on/off switch on the head of the lamp is good placement, and a nice feature - some you have to unplug to turn them off.  I also like that it's easy to twist and you can tilt the light to many different angles very easily.  Overall it's a good device, which works as advertised and seems to be a quality build.

If U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.

Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable
I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.
I will try both of the lights for a while and write more on this review.

I expected a cleaning disk that had a full width brush or set of brushes that would clean the laser and pickup mechanism.  What this is a CD with 8 very tiny 'whiskers' made of what is listed as 'carbon fiber'.  Maybe but the miniscule size has NO chance to contact the laser/pickup.  Might work okay in a tray-type CD/DVD player where you could force it to move from track to track but its totally WORTHLESS for an in-dash CD player.  And the details on the Amazon ad are very vague on what it is and what it does.  And that appears to be on purpose.  Don't waste your money on this product.

1499	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.

1309	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with the purchase of the nook.  Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).  All in all, worth the price.
1424	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love my Nook HD+.  I bought two for myself because it was such a great deal.  I purchased them through the Barnes & Noble website for $170 and never regretted my choice.  My husband now has one, as does my my sister.  I use it mainly for browsing the web, but also for reading books I have purchased or borrowed on Overdrive.  My two kids (3 & 5) got the 7-inch Nook HD and it comes in handy for our rare restaurant visits, to keep them quiet and occupied.  The micro-sd storage option is wonderful.  It would be great if other tablets offered that, but I guess they want you to use their cloud for backup.  This is simply a great deal for the money.

2668	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Item actually arrived sooner than expected and works great! Small and sleek and only extends from the lighter socket about a half inch. Awesome price as well. Would absolutely purchase again if I need one.
To sum up, for me the deal-breaker was pdf reflow without conversion into native format, user changeable battery and additional memory slot. These features are available on Nook but not on Kindle. Nook should improve on user interface to rely less on LCD during reading (such as dictionary), make LCD less reflective, international 3G access and ability to buy books. It is a four-star device.
430	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Had major surgery, which left me having to spend a lot of time in bed.  Needed something to mount a new flat screen on to help with recovery and this did the trick.

If you want you can call up support for the device, complain about it, and they will send you another one for free.  Takes 2-3 weeks for it.  OK cool so I get one for free.... but my battery won't last 2 weeks and it will be the same defective product that will last me a couple months.

  One thing that I didn't see in the other reviews, or anywhere else except the instructions, is that the radio is capable of being set to use 20 kHz bandwidth instead of the usual 10, meaning you get a lot better sound than normal. The speakers stink, but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed. Of course you want narrow for long-distance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit.

THE REVIEWS START IN 1999, PEOPLE.*  There's no way Logitech will provide a Windows 7 driver for this.
No complaints here. Now I have a 10' so I can connect to the TV and still reach my lazyboy.
After my purchase, I immediately opened the Nook while in store and the device simply connected to the B&N hotspot without user interaction (NICE!). Since I already have a B&N account from the many books I have ordered online, my registration literally took 30 seconds. I just signed in and it was done.
Setup is just as easy as it sounds. The Belkin VideoLink Powerline Internet Adapter took me less than three minutes to connect in every case, and all I had to do was plug the Adapter into an electrical outlet, then plug an Ethernet cord into the Adapter on one end, and into the Ethernet router on the other. And presto, a new way to harness one medium for another. The Adapter comes packaged with its own ethernet cords (two of them), too, so you won't have to get anything separately for connection. It's all there.

4638	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It really worked for me I noticed a difference after the first application but I actually had to run it maybe 5 times total but now no more skips!

Just a fantastic product get it!!

728	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	UPDATE: I have now have purchased 3 of these for work and home and with the lighter LED TV's this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount TVs. I haven't found another one that is so useful - even if you don't need it to extend this is still a great mount

8977	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this tripod stand recently from Amazon, and I must say, I am quite impressed by the product - light-weight, yet sturdy, and able to handle my bulky Canon EOS 300D (DSLR) can't come naturally to tripods, but this one does the job just fine. I recently made a trip to the Niagara falls, and I happened to be there at 0300 (local time), and used this gadget to take snaps of the river in the natural light mode, and they have come out simply awesome!

It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.

I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got "overdrive", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:

5767	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	love this set of magnetic steel door stoppers!  From a Mom who does not like to yell, making sure the doors do not easily slam is a priority and this was the solution.  This is one less thing I have to worry about yelling at the kids about, and that makes us all happy.  It was also irritating that when the air would kick on in the summer, the bed room door would be pulled shut.  I like to keep the doors open in the hallway during the summer, the air circulates better in the house when I do that.  These keep the door from that suction effect that I do not like.  These were easy to install.  I just stood there and watched my husband work.  But he said it was super simple as well.  He marked where he wanted them to go, one small pilot hole, one plastic anchor inserted, one screw put in.... repeated a few times.  Super simple.  And they work great, not to mention that they look like an expensive add on.  They are definitely a high quality and durable, made from stainless steel that is corrosion and rust resistant.  We mounted these to the wall but they would have just as easily been mounted to the floor.  Each of the two door stops that came in this package, came with a durable rubber ring around them.  They are pretty small and will fit anywhere.  I did get a discount on this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and that is what I have provided for you here today.  Thank you for taking the time out of your shopping to read my review in it's entirety.  Have a blessed day!

5871	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This seems to work, although there is not way to be sure except, perhaps, by inference. That is, if a drive that was not working is suddenly okay again, it probably helped. Best not to set hopes too high as, if you are having trouble with a drive, cleaning the lens may not be the most likely cause of the problem. For the drive we tried it on, the problem persists, and I am now fairly certain that it is the drive itself. So, if nothing else, it can tell you that a dusty lens is or is not the problem. The price is fair. It did not seem to cause any trouble, so is presumable safe. Also comes with a plethora of sound tests, which some may find valuable.

I've been able to convert VHS tapes into decent MPG, Real, and Microsoft Windows Media files in size 320 x 240, but not without some hassle.

8759	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Good case. It has minimum padding that makes the phone feel secure but too much to be burdensome. The card slots are convenient.

Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.
The material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.  This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time.

7466	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This one is a good extra investment if you're buying a Palm V.  The little leather flap that comes with the Palm is really not adequate to protect your machine.  This hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows.  It looks elegant and it's not too big - the Palm will still fit in your  shirt pocket when in the case. I recommend getting this one - you need to  get something to protect from scratching anyway, and this case protects  from much much more.

*Bad Traffic* is suspense all the way, replete with situational humor and subtle twists on the genre. What Jian lacks in local customs and comprehension, he more than makes up with police brutality, Red Guard training, and the cunning of a Chinese social strategist. Simon paints him as an over-the-hill Asian Bruce Willis, with less emphasis on the guns and more on the bullheaded rampage through the English shop, er, countryside. Jian's struggles remind him of his own country's dark and often murderous past, as the search for his daughter leads to desperate actions.

To mount the monitor on the monitor mount, put the backend on first, then put the big base on the 4 feet, screw them in (recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it.  The DVI connector is a good length.

The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.

7288	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Very funny gift idea.  Set contains several different cat breeds, all presented from that special angle.  Why does the sight of a cat's butt anger women so much?  I can't say for sure but this funny little reminder was a delight for the children as they snickered and shrieked at the sight.
The plastic housing isn't the thickest, but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement.  The feels very sturdy and durable.  Only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel.  Some may want this but if it weren't as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be better.

8571	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The first two times I plugged this into my projector, it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected.  Now I can't get it to work at all.  Unfortunately, I had it over a month before I tested it, so now I can't return it.
2838	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I used this recently while on vacation to charge two iPads, two iPhones, and a back-up battery pack and it worked great.

8607	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Works great
8794	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Excellent case. Fits my Samsung Note 3 snugly. It has 2 slots for cards. I feel that 1 more slot could be added. Overall a good looking and high quality case. Also it does not interfere with the performance of the S pen. Good purchase.
The quality is fine and the price reasonable. (Wish I could say the same about their electronics though. - but that's a different set of reviews sometime.)
6. Sony's decision to require 3 C batteries insures long-lasting life between battery changes.
The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.
Regardless, I love this product. I've been moving my whole home-office setup to a wireless environment, but I wanted to keep this printer for large print jobs.

632	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall.
3292	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It's very nice
5317	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I previously had a pair of Sony noise-cancellers.  The big downfall of the Maxells are the battery pack.  It's about half-way down the cord.  If you use them at a desk and move much, you'll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it'll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones.  The Sonys only used a single AAA battery but the Maxells use two.  So, Sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation.  Oddly, the Sonys seem to have much better battery life for me.  The Maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds, but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use.  If you wear them for hours at a time, the similarly priced Sonys are easier on the ear.  I'm not wild about the way the Maxells fold up, either.  The Sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage.  Another problem with the Maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic.  Often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plastic-on-plastic noise that comes through quite loud.  With a slight re-design, Maxell could have a nice set of headphones.  Wait until then or try another brand.
4559	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Use this to play music from my phone in an old F150 with only a tape player input.  Works great!

3257	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I had a previous SD card and AT&T tried putting it in but the windows phone wouldn't recognize it. So they suggested a card that was more windows specific since windows phones can be picky. I bought this one and it worked like a charm. No problems and now I can store pictures and what I need without worrying about space.


4673	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The very 1st time tried it looked like it was going to work but stopped after 10-15 seconds. Now, the Samsung VCR SV-5000W stops and ejects it after 1-2 seconds every single time.  No FF or REW working either, although by hand it doesn't feel like it is stuck. No cleaning was achieved, judging by the picture quality not improved.
For positive, well, overall image quality is very good, colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes, you will still need your Photoshop, but in any case, even with high-end professional models, you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photo-quality A4 (I'm in Europe, that's about the area of a 17" monitor) prints that people will mistake for normal photos (matched with a good printer of course). The firmware is very effective, but a few features have been improved in the 990, which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me, you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldn't work as good.
4544	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Cheaply made stoped working after 3 days!!
EDIT 10/1/2013: Nope, the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone, as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaply-made $9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus' OEM charger, it worked just fine. I do believe I'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.

It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big "n" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.

3958	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	As everyone should know, any HDMI cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so I bought this cheap HDMI cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores, etc. I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product. You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I haven't tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but I'm sure it would work.
2096	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Very happy with this light. Comfortable to read with and the neck flexes to where ever I need it to go. However, I don't think the on/off switch will survive long, as it has already come off once.
4459	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I use this in conjunction with a demagnetizing tape head cleaner cassette.  Both are the same exact thing except that this one has no rotating magnet in it.  I wet this cassette with plenty of cleaning fluid and it improves the quality of my playback after playing filthy old cassettes.  I play it with the dry demagnetizing tape to dry it off and polish it while demagnetizing it.  I recommend this tape in conjunction with a demagnetizing head cleaner cassette as well.

40	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great.
3864	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	First of all, this product charges my Garmin 1450 very slowly. I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.
- vernier (non-digital) tuning and no ability to pre-program stations; at the same apparently due to excellent reception, dial range for stations is very large, so tuning to a station is not a problem at all.
The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.

3741	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I use this to connect my 60D to my laptop when I'm filming video for my blog so that I can see how bad I look and I can focus, etc. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that while the cable is HDMI the camera will only go standard def to the laptop or whatever device you're using. So for focusing and making sure everything is keyed in you should be good, if you need to view stuff in HD I think there are some apps for the camera you can get to update the firmware.

As a person with around 800 sideloaded books, this is completely unacceptable. I need the organization. As a girl with Aspergers Syndrome, I REALLY need the organization. I even contacted Barnes and Noble's customer service online, but their reply was practically calling me a liar. "Thanks for contacting us....Shelves only erase if you reset the Nook or deregister the device....Thank you, Goodbye!" Really, how are you going to ignore a problem that I can replicate on demand?! A quick Google search will show that I am not the only one, and others are having the exact same issue.

From his appearances in previous Miles' novels, I knew he was a good ol' boy who loved good food, but beyond that not much more.

7487	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This I can not recommend. Although the price and shipping fees were reasonable and the item arrived on time, it does NOT work. I own one already and I know how to use it properly. I have attempted to use it to charge multiple batteries and it will NOT charge them at all. The unit is supposed to charge a battery until fully charged, then turn off automatically. It does not do this. When plugging a battery into it, it lights up indicating that it is charging. However, after charging 2 different batteries for over 12 hours each, it neither charged the batteries nor turned off as it is supposed to do. I have no problem exchanging the item if the seller contacts me as I do need a second charger, but I definitely need it sent back. I need instructions from the seller on how to proceed. Until the item is returned and credit paid back or the item is exchanged. I can NOT recommend the item or seller positively.

As much online shopping as I do, I just fell into a lull because I was shopping at Amazon.  $30.00 for a $5.00 pack of cables seems a bit out of line.

Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.
With all that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Nightfall.  Laced with black humor, the story of Jack Nightingale, former police negotiator and current private investigator takes a turn for the supernatural when some very strange and dire things start to happen to him and those close to him.

4. Screen glare...not so fun with a reading light.
All-in-all great product, but the setup required a little bit of research.  I hope this helps someone!
We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian "ger" (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!
Problem that this product solved: My kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop, and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop. I wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side, for cooking appliances (in the kitchen) or for plugging in my iPad or Kindle (while using them in the den). I can't imagine why an outlet wasn't thought of when my house was first built. I was going to call an electrician to add one, but this power strip seems to work just as well.
Once connected, your monitor/projector/display will basically mimic exactly what you see on the phone. With NO lag. It's like working on a giant phone. I was especially happy to find out that if you use the built in Video playing app on the LG G3, it knows you have connected an external device when playing videos and will let you turn the screen off to save battery while playing a video. The projector is even smart enough to change the orientation based on how the phone is held.

I've had head cleaners in the past, but normally they stop working after 10 uses. That was just the way things went in the 90s.. Clean VCR.. tape gets dirty.. Cleaning becomes less effective..

1307	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So after reading numerous upon numerous reviews about kindle vs nook....I took the dive and got the Nook...I could not be happier. After reading all the reviews, pretty much all of them talked about sluggish performance...sluggish performance that no longer exists with the new 1.4 update. That is pretty much the selling point right there. B&N can constantly fix all of it's bugs through a simple software update. Is it perfect? No. At least now my pages turn quickly, there's an internet browser, I can always connect to the bookstore via 3G or wifi, I can use the buttons to turn pages or simply just swipe the screen to turn, there is also a nice cover flow to help search through books. Anyway...overall I am happy. Can I sit here and say it's better than the Kindle? No...for I have not tried the Kindle. I do suggest that if you're curious about the whole e-reader craze of late, just head into a B&N and take a look for yourself. If you don't like it, don't buy it...if you buy and decide it's not for you, then just return it since there are no restocking fees...and if you end up buying and keeping it, there's also that piece of mind that if anything does happen to your Nook, all you have to do is take it to your local B&N and have them take a look at it for you...

1296	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I was given a Barnes and Nobles Nook for Christmas.  I live in the Middle East and current books are not easy to come by.  So my family gave me the Nook so that I could order the latest books to read.  They accepted the overseas credit card and money without informing us that you have to be PHYSICALLY present in the U.S.A. to buy NookBooks.

Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card). The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.

The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.

The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.
-Bass and Treble would be nice,but if not CAN'T WE AT LEAST HAVE A TONE KNOB? Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one! Why not? The hi/low switch is better than nothing,and does an ok job.
6377	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	They are hard to find these days. I still prefer my VCR to DVD because I simply do not want to keep 90% of what I record and VCR is still the best way to go. DVDs are too expensive and I do not use cable or satellite or things like that. I get over 100 digital channels with my rabbit ears  and have very little time to actually watch TV, so I still rely on my good old VCR/DVD recorder to help me eventually view shows I want to see -- when I get the time.

8356	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	These speakers do not sound bad, don't get me wrong.  If the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner.  However, even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of Cambridge Soundworks/Creative Labs computer speakers I have that cost about the same price.

745	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I'm using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 10-15 degrees of vertical tilting capability, but what is available will be fine for most applications.  I posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted.
9013	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this player about 3 months ago, and have had great luck with it. I have a Zenith 27" TV, so the speakers aren't all that great.

1298	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.
9866	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this silver tape when my original cartridge of white tape ran out.  As others have mentioned here, it's really a gray more than silver.  The standard white tape provides labels with a little more visibility and contrast, but this silver is better when you don't want the label to stand out quite so much - I used it to label some components in my a/v setup and like the more understated look.  The black lettering is still very legible and the labels end up looking a tad more elegant on the gray.  If high visibility is priority one, go with white tape.  If you want more subtlety, pick the silver.

6113	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	For quite a long time I believed that the CD player in my truck was broken.  Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work.  It did!  The cleaner is extremely easy to use.  You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.  After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too.  I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila!  It was working again!

It is now probably 8 years old and it is still trucking like when she first got it, despite being subjected to 40 minute showers daily with no bath vent on to dissipate the steam.

I hadn't read anything before from author, Dale Roberts, but I certainly will be looking for his other books. It really was a "Who Done It." One of those books that I just couldn't put down.

The second problem is this card was brittle. So brittle in fact, it broke in my fingers while trying to wipe the contacts clean when the computer decided the card was corrupted and would not read. I don't know if this is a widespread issue but I've never had a card break in my fingers like this, SanDisk or any other brand.

553	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)
One other caution regarding these tapes; the backing can be difficult to remove.  The newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing.  Even so, a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backing.

I can now read until my heart is content and my husband doesn't complain about it.  I take it with me on international trips and can read without disturbing my seat mate with the overhead light.
Some friends complain that the  earpiece flops around a bit, but indeed, it never falls off. (Unless you  have really small ears).

Still a must for any reader.
My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.
You have to remove your Palm to  use the HotSync cradle -- Not true.  Just move the cradle to the edge of  the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge.  Just be careful you  don't knock it off the desk accidently.  Others have suggested placing a  book under the cradle.  Either works fine.

6694	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	If you have an original Microsoft Force Feed back Sidewinder joy stick you have probably been in the dumps since XP came out with out support and Video cards stopped supporting joysticks. I was shocked when Microsoft stopped providing software for these great joysticks in the XP and Vista operating systems. Unlike newer joysticks, the Sidewinder was not Plug and Play and needed it's own software to be able to configure it. You can use this item to change it to plug into a usb but it will not work in XP or Vista on the Flight Simulator. Save your money and buy a new joystick. It will not not last as long as the rugged Sidewinder but it will work out of the box. ( For only a year or less with regular use.) They do not make joysticks like they use too.

This was n of what I expected, but definitely worth reading about. I have the rest of the series and will be reading it soon.
solution was simple - it needs to format by the phone and after just hook it via USB and transfer files one more time,
2352	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Get what you pay for. Don't waste your time with this item.
Overall, a great product. I'd buy  one for a friend.
The key word in the product description that I missed is water RESISTANT, not water PROOF. The battery compartment was in no way sealed to prevent water leaking in, just a standard battery door you find on your remote control. I'm sure had I kept it, water would have leaked in quickly and corroded the thing.

8973	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I've had this player for about six months. About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player, when that happens  the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button, none of the  other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic, half of the  buttons are hidden by a cover, and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and  fast forward functions are combined on a single key, to fast-forward you  must hold down the skip button for several seconds, if you don't hold it  down long enough it skips to the next scene. The skip backwards function  doesn't work, it can only return to the start of a scene, not an earlier  one. So if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie  from the beginning.
I only gave it four stars because Belkin's support is literally non-existent.  They show it in their product section, but not anywhere on the support section (browsing or searching).  No driver download available, so you're hosed if you don't have the CD and need driver.
Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.

8120	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	the product just works just fine. One thing you'll notice about quality ethernet cables is where the insulation stops on the ends of the cable. If you're cable is filled with the plastic on the ends(like this one) you're getting a pretty good quality cable.

Pros:
6607	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This cord is priced great and is of great quality; something that can be pretty much assured when your buying a Belkin product. I was looking for CAT 5e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on Amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase. I don't regret it. The cable is of good quality and the cables-as advertised-are completely snagless; so much so, that it'll take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer it's hooked into. This was actually frustrating for me when I was troubleshooting my router, but then became a plus when I realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord. So, the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time, but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device (in this case, it's probably more convenient to get a "snagging" one. Otherwise known as...a regular RJ45 cable). I can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature.  Oh yeah, the length of this cord is a beautiful thing. I got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that I was thrilled when I discovered this on Amazon. I had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short, so, that was actually the deciding factor for me. I'm happy with this purchase.
We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco...

8009	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Yet another example of Belkin getting it Right! This is not a unique length-it's the right length. Printers or other devices that are not immediately adjacent to all the other equipment need this length. Another great product at a good price by Belkin.
1359	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	If you bought one of these from BuyAccessories call the  one eight hundred number of Barnes & Noble to find out if yours is a refurbished or used product. Give them your SN and they can tell you. Mine did NOT come sealed in B&N plastic, No screen or back covers. I found out mine was used and I had paid $109 for it. Used is under $40 these days.
115	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I was very curious if it's really genuine or just pretending to be because it seems like almost every cable and charger sold in Amazon is labeled as being from the manufacturer.  Anyway, mine did not come in a B&N Nook box, it was in a tiny zip lock bag with a piece of ordinary paper obviously printed with a low-resolution inkjet printer that explains what Nook devices will work with it and what will not.

My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.
I've done both BIOS and Nvidia graphics card driver updates. Sometimes this gets it working again for a while, sometimes it doesn't, but it always, always, always glitches back out again.

After a lot of online research, I settled on the NOOK Tablet.  B&N has a 14-day return policy so I put the Tablet through rigorous functionality testing to determine whether to keep it or not.

We needed to use this printer with a new computer, but the printer did not have USB and the motherboard did not have parallel.  Staples only had the Belkin F5U002, so that's what we got.

Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.

Also for those that will suggest the GPU - other monitors worked fine on the same card / dual-link bypass mode.  Spent a good hour reseating gpus and different combinations.

Lam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and "the delightful Senora Cool" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia.


This was an extremely imaginative tale that takes place mostly in the dream world of Nod. There is even a surprising explanation for why it is called `Nod.' Although this is listed as a YA novel, it is just as enjoyable for adults, if not more so. Younger readers would possibly miss many of the subtle nuances of the work.

Be aware that the TV channel reception feature will cease in 2009 when all transmission goes digital. Until then, enjoy it!

Enjoyed this book very much. I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren when they get a bit older. I would compare it to the Never Ending Story, Alice in Wonderland, and a Twilight Zone episode All wrapped up in one. This would really make a great movie.
*Bad Traffic* is violent and profane, but not graphically so. Lewis gets the point across--often in a deft lunge at the unsuspecting reader--with just the right amount of f-bombs and twitching limbs. He has an old fashioned appreciation for the dashing hero and the damsel in distress, while his story remains cognizant of the treatment of gender in Western societies. Objectification is limited to the bad people point of view, and female distress is largely de-sexualized. Most of the male characters, for their part, are neither muscle-toned Bruce Lees nor romantic rogues, but often pudgy and middle-aged working men.

710	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a great TV wall mount. After reading the reviews decided to purchase for a new Samsung 32" for bedroom.  The mount was easy to assemble and mount to wall. Although instructions call for finding a wall stud to mount, the hardware package includes large dry wall anchors and screws.  I opted to purchase "Toggler" high performance drywall anchors/toggle bolts.  These cost a couple bucks for a package of two at any big box store and they hold up to 240 lbs each.  There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.  Would highly recommend.
Both of them find out that they are not the people they appear to be.
In order to get the best result it is imperative the tape deck you use has clean heads all the time.  Failure to keep dirt away from the internal parts will result in sub-par recordings even with first class tapes.

Attaching the base to the monitor requires about 10 screws, and mine were rattling around loose in the box, with a couple missing.  (They did throw in a Phillips screwdriver.)  Not a huge deal but they should have been in a bag.  There's an external power supply, which is one more thing on your desk.  The power cable is Korean with a 2-prong adapter to make it work with US outlets, but it's a standard computer power cable so you can just substitute your own if that bothers you.

The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.

It has very useful features: it has a small pigtail antenna for short range communication) but has a SO-239 connector to let you install an external antenna to increase the coverage range.

My first night in Italy, it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery (in regular outlet) and ipad (using the USB port). Unfortunately, after the 2nd night, there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights?  In short, great idea but very little durability.

Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.
Luckily I browsed around and found this cable, which was a lifesaver.

As for quality... there is none. It's the epitome of "Made in China". It's extremely flimsy and I was so afraid to keep my TV mounted on this thing that I returned it to Amazon.
The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy "HOME" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.

5103	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Update: I've had the unit now for about two years. It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a "shower radio," this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).

We got a 3rd gen Paperwhite with the same resolution of the Voyage. I actually don't notice the difference from the 2nd gen. It is slightly nicer than the Nook. I still read on my Nook frequently as I might have two books going and just read one on one and the other on the other. I hated the ads on the Paperwhite so ended up paying the $30 to get rid of them so even on sale it cost $130 in the end. So the really issue is... is it worth the price difference. $70 vs $130 (or $150 vs $100 when not on sale) They both work for library books.

1249	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.

When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.

3082	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.

Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3, then after the music on the cleaning disk stops, remove the disk and your done. Unless they came out with a better product, I don't know why they stopped selling this one !

Essentially this product enables you to "make" a really long network cable.  For example if you have your network router in one room and a wired webcam in another.  This device lets you hook them up without running a super long cable between rooms.

My advice as someone that has tried the cheaper lights, don't waste your money, buy this one and be done with it.

My brother and i tested this radio in our hometown of about 4,000 to 8,000 residents.  There were no tall buildings or other large structures hindering our transmissions.  For the test, i used the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Midland-18-2442-Mobile-CB-Antenna/dp/B0000ATNH3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna</a>&nbsp;mounted at the center of my car roof (location matters).  As my brother drove further away, he called out landmarks as he passed them and i dragged the Google Maps distance measurer to his locations.  We could talk up until 4 miles.  That's when the voice volume became weak and static grew louder.

4334	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Worked great for awhile but the connection has become loose. After using it about 6 months to charge my Samsung Galaxy S4 with my computer USB port, it has been disconnecting/reconnecting itself, causing the computer to make the "hardware connected/disconnected" tones repeatedly. I tested with other similar cords connected exactly the same way to the same devices and it does not happen.

For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.
4754	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Used on a year old Bose Wave IV single CD system that was occasionally skipping and it resolved the issue after one use.  We live in a high wind, high dust area and I suspect that had I tried this CD lens cleaner on our older Bose Wave II, I'd not have had to replace it.  Just pop the CD into the player with the label up and listen to the approximate 30 seconds of verbal instruction and music.  When the music stops, advance to track 3 and the same voice will soon tell you that cleaning is complete.  You can either continue listening to the music on the disc or remove the disc at this point.  We heard a small amount of soft whirring and clicking during the entire process which lasted less than a minute. Note that when removing the disc, you want to avoid handling the underside of the disc as the two tiny microfibre brushes located there will pick up oil and debris from your hands.  Store the disc in its jewel case and away from any extreme temperature and high humidity areas to keep it clean and functional; it should last years.

Installation started out well, but due to poor documentation I had a few problems setting up the printer on the reset of the PC's and laptops.  The quick start guide cover configuring the server and setting up the printer all as one process.  What is does not specify is how to add just a printer to a PC without setting up the server.  Trial and error showed me to take the "no update" option and, then the wizard would proceed directly to printer install (Duh).  From there it was easy.  Take note that if you see the printer in the list of devices on your system, even if it is shared from another PC, select it as the printer to install.  It will configure the printer on the PC and make appropriate port assignments and other settings so you don't have to.  Another item that is not documented is that once the wizard is run on a pc from the diskette, it self-installs leaving a short cut on the desk top.  So after installing all the machines in your home/office, and subsequent changes can be made from the installed wizard.

690	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion.
585	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.

We finally "side loaded" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).

7318	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This item is supported on Windows 95 and earlier operating systems :( I bought this to transfer data from old disks only to find that this device isn't supported on anything later than Windows 95. Iomega has gone belly up and any support links take you to the Lenovo website. This zip drives also come with USB connections, but I haven't had good luck with those models and they break easily. That's why I bought the older parallel port model. This one worked like a champ back in the day and I subsequently replaced it with a USB model for 250MB disks. Also, just as any FYI, the 250MB zip drives will read the 100MB disks, but the 100MB drives will not read the 250MB disks.
I can tell you the Nook I just purchased came with release 1.2 and it absolutely rocks!
Check the Epson site for details to see which kit if any will fit your printer.
Optically, these are absolutely built to the price. Definite chromatic aberration here giving a nice blue/yellow fringe, especially at longer distances. But for the price, I kind of expected that. Diopter correction works well.

5903	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	didn't meet my needs.  used to split cable use to two computers.  lost download speed.
1483	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Enjoy the nook for reading- fairly simple to use once it is set up, and light and enjoyable to read. I started to read again after a long time without enjoying reading. The internet is fairly frustrating to use on the nook (for webbrowsing, for example) but that is not what I bought it for. The access to the B&N store is awesome on the nook, though- search for books, buy it, and it appears. That is awesome! However, I haven't found near as many free books as they bragged about. I found several hundred, some duplicates. Where are the rest hiding? Battery life is fair, pretty good if you turn on airplane mode (allows days of reading a couple hours a day without charging), but can die quickly (4-5 hours) in an area without wifi if you don't use airplane mode.
7599	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This worked well after I moved and having all my stuff in different spots and I needed another outlet strip and this works great. Used it during the holidays to with my christmas lights.
The remote  is a real nice feature, this allows you to have the player itself in a  backpack or bag, and use the remote on the headphone cord to handle the  volume and skip forward or back.

If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined "reader" and "Android tablet" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the "Nook Today" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just "back" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can "override" the Nook UI and install other "launchers" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]
4369	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	These are not OEM cables.  I bought two of these, neither one allowed me to connect my Sprint Epic 4g (Galaxy S) to my PC.  I had drivers installed and everything, they still didn't work.  I could not transfer files or root my device, it was completely unrecognized.  After doing some research, I read that many other people had this problem as well.  The solution is to buy real Samsung brand OEM cables.  I ordered the OEM cable from amazon and it worked on the first try, just had to plug it in.  This is the cable I bought:[...]

5789	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The CD player on our boat started skipping.  First, only here and there.  Then, the problem became annoyingly frequent.  Bought this, figuring I'd give it a shot before replacing the stereo head.  To my surprise, it worked.  Took the skips out of our CDs.  A month later or so they came back, but I just cleaned it again. Now, I just leave this stowed on board.  I'm happy to clean it once a month.  Even if I replaced the stereo, the new one would get dirty again and I'd be right back in the same "boat".

8814	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it.  I had to shut the radio off, then turn it back on again.  Just a slight movement from the male plug (that goes into the radio), would cause the radio to be unusable.
5902	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I did notice my internet speed jump from after connecting the cable. My original cable is probably 5-6 years old. I bought another one shortly after getting this one in blue.
This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's "wade in the weeds" and look at some of the features in detail:

Pros:
5621	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great
6626	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I'll make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works.  First and foremost:  it works and works well.  It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it.  If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect.  I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin.  It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient.  Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable; however, when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work.

The extras that are included with this radio cost almost as much as the radio itself: a quality AC adapter that doesn't introduce that annoying 60 Hz hum, a reel antenna, a carrying case, earbuds, and a lanyard that is actually really handy (the radio is much smaller than you might imagine from the pictures).  It runs on 3 AA batteries for what seems like forever in FM, and only a little shorter when always in AM or shortwave (cheap off-brand AA batteries are included).
The wallet is on the left side of the case when opened. There are two slots to hold ID cards or credit cards. Underneath the card slots is a pocket, which is perfect for holding dollar bills.

5950	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It's not often a simple patch cable can catch your fancy and make you all sweaty and tingle all over, but when I opened the wonderfully packaged Belkin RJ45 Cat 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable, my eyes began to sweat.  The blue is so dark and rich it reminds one of the mystery and allure of Versailles.  The magnificently engineered snagless connectors are so well made, and the actual RJ45 spec plug fit so nicely in my router, it was like a horse and carriage or even love and marriage.  You cannot go wrong with this cable.  After you are bedazzled by the vibrant royal blue, and the admiration of the snagless clip design wears on you, the thing will still send data from device M to device K.  I have only tested it on devices M and K, so if you are going to use other devices, please disregard this entire review if you are concerned about efficacy.  If, however, you are easily impressed with rich, bold colors and imaginative engineering, you cannot go wrong.

-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.

9114	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is not something you need every day, but if your CD/DVD player seems flaky, it just might be simply dust on the lens.  If you look at this cleaner, it's basically a blank CD with a number of very gentle brushes attached to it.  Just inserting it briefly (the players often self-eject it after 10-20 seconds) should take care of any foreign objects.  If this fixes a player for you even once, it's probably worth the purchase price right there.

9941	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This label cartridge is great. It prints white labels with black ink. I was out of stock and couldn't find them at CVS, Walgreens, or even Officemax. So I bought a few of them in bulk at Amazon.
It works.  Good value, I would recommend this to anyone.

827	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great!
7741	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This thing is great! A little pricey but it's exactly what I needed. You've got the 16ft cord, an on/off button and a reset switch in case you overload it. Plus, the cord can be wrapped around the diameter of the unit and plugged into itself so it has a small footprint when transporting it. Unless you are trying to plug a massive power adapter into the device, most people should be able to utilize all 6 plugs if needed. It also has decent rubber feet so it doesn't slide off the surface you place it on. I believe you can also mount the base to a wall or table if desired.
Be particularly wary of the photo showing the "cans" flipped around, suggesting a flexible swivel design. This is not the same item I unfortunately bought.
7662	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased hundreds of these Belkin cables. They always work and are always consistent. Gigabit speeds all around.

5030	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	As Americans we all know where this is made and how bad they are at making ANYTHING worth buying. Like our sneakers being made so cheaply. and never in our sizes.  or widths. BUT... this little smuck uses up battery life like nothing you have ever seen. It has had a few problems where it would not play the entire list of songs and I had to erase everything and reprogram it. It does not give us the sound or the quality it would had Germans or American workers had made it. It's ok.. but not quality.
The first eleven chapters move very slowly. They mostly contain background details and I found it very hard to connect with the characters during this time. I had nearly given up on the book when things really turned around. Chapter twelve begins a most wonderful story that will touch your heart. The characters that seem so dry at the beginning come alive later and draw you in. It ends up being a very richly written book.

1285	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a good item. Even though it's old, it's sticks to what an reader should be. It really is good for just reading books. It has great battery and the 3G works everywhere
Issue #5: UI Inflexibility
-I only wish the case covered more of the top and bottom of the phone. Unfortunately the phone gets scratched easily in those regions more than others.
2396	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	died on me within days.  Charged iphone fine, charging ipad caused it to smolder and smell like burnt plastic, before it stopped working.
- has a built-in power cord, may use batteries as well.
THE BAD:
7070	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly, and you can buy several for the cost of one charged at Radio Shack.
The writing was fine, and the pacing good.  There were fewer plot twists than expected and in truth this was more like a police or detective procedural than a heavy-duty occult fantasy.  Still, I enjoyed it.  One could read it and not feel trapped into following up with the rest of the series (when they become available in the US), as there is pretty good closure at the end.  On the other hand, there were clearly plot threads left untied at the end and I was not surprised to find that there were more books in the series.

These Video 8 Tapes are nicely priced and allow you to pass over the above two probems.

8681	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	These webcams are excellent and it is a shame that they no longer make these web cams anymore... You will be able to buy them from Auction sites (e.g., Ebay) or here at Amazon... but most likely, you will have to search endlessly for the Drivers of the item!  When you find the Drivers that you need to run this item... You will find an excellent, high quality webcam and worth the price!  I use webcams for a living (conference calls..etc...) and own top-of-the-line video conferencing cameras... and for the price of these cameras... they are worth it!
1462	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad. Serves more than one purpose ...while its primary function is reading. The original nook is a whole family experience. Its size and durability give the nook, nook color, and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity. This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school. She wanted something to read her books on, and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Barnes-and-Noble-NOOK-eBook-Reader-WiFi-only-Black-White/dp/1400532620/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White </a>]

Only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately, but it'll work to get it on at least. All hardware needed is included, I had to use a few adapter pieces on my first TV. Getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall, both are 32" screens. I feel confident they will be there until I decide to remove em.
Packaging was very good.
7869	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	No problems.  As advertised.
7344	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This extension fits into my older PC's PS/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard! The connection is snug, but not too tight. It works just as well on my new self-built Win 8 computer. I've got an old keyboard that is really great, so I'm using it alternately for both computers.
7030	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	It doesn't say anywhere in the listing that I could find that this isn't USB 2.  My mistake for just assuming it was, I guess.  Still, I think they should make it obvious that it isn't 2, since that's pretty much the standard today.
I have been blown away by the durability of this $250ish tablet (what it cost when I bought it brand new 3 yrs ago.) Thanks, B&N!
7617	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Very useful product.

7077	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great bands!  I bought two red ones for some resistance training on the barbell, these are a little smaller but with the right use you can get what you need.
With 14 channels and 38 privacy  codes on the Motorola TalkAbout 250 you won't have to worry about listening  to other peoples conversations.
- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.
7674	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I got this hub in the mail, plugged in the power, plugged it in to my DSL modem, plugged by PC and laptop into it, and everything just worked!  No configuration or anything (despite my DSL setup), basically no problems of any kind.  Can't beat that!
2230	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to replace a $13, 3 foot cable bought from Target which would cause picture glitches and dropouts regularly - this one works flawlessly, is twice as long and a fraction of the price!
Time will tell if it lasts like the original OEM belt.
In any case, we like this -- aside from the durability -- you can print LARGE FONT so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance (saves having to take everything out etc.)

7042	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product a few weeks ago to use for my keyboard. I considered getting a wireless keyboard, but soon realized that this is less expensive and will fulfill the same purpose. I've read some of the 1 star reviews where people complain about this being a USB 1.1 and all that. I'm not sure i found any misleading information under the prouct description. I use this extension cable to connect my keyboard to my XBOX 360, Laptop and PS3 all for convenience, and it works for all three systems. Can't really knock the product after that....

Not only was this story captivating, it left me with memorable characters and a story line that will resound with me for time to come.
7359	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	GREAT!!!!!!!
Highly recommended.
7999	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the cable to use with another item I purchased. The other item came with a 4 Foot cable which was long enough. However I keep the 7 Footer as it is nice to have an extra cable on hand.
Easy to read - Stick tightly.. Waterproof
My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very "anti" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.
7375	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good quality
2134	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This light is perfect for use with my Kindle.  I can't believe how bright it is. It's made way better than you would think for the inexpensive price.  I also like that it uses only one AAA battery instead of a lithium.
Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.
7464	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool.  I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box.  If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit.  I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.
9619	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I thought I would be receiving a generic compatible tape cartridge but it was the Brother brand and $10 less than what Office Depot wanted to charge me. Definitely keeping this in my Wish List for future orders.
338	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	These are fantastic.  I purchased one because I had a new flatscreen and paid someone 60$ to install it.  After watching how fast he did it I purchased two more and hung the other two myself!  Please note I have ZERO skills.  This takes less than thirty minutes to hang and really moves smoothly.
3241	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Not only is this a must for charging your kindle but anything that has a USB plug.
3918	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	saves me time on keeping my information stored
The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.
9346	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Does its job as expected  main point is it saved a car trip to Staples.
Cons: Placement of elastic bands at the top left corner can affect how easily the Kindle is turned on/off.  Also, I wish this product was available in other colors, such as brown.

Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.
2040	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this USB light after a cheaper one I'd previously purchased decided to go bad.  This Might Bright appears to be of far higher quality, and doesn't seem to be suffering from the problems of the one I had before.  It's bright (and has both low and high brightness settings).  The switch is also more conveniently located (on the 'hood' which houses the LEDs) and seems to be of higher quality.
1943	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have tried many book lights.  This is very bright and works well.  Very happy with this book light.
3784	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Does what it should, nothing spectacular.
660	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The product is very nice as described, and i am very happy with the purchase. recommend this to anyone who is looking for sword holder.
2869	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Super for the cost
2636	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.
6974	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Easy to fly and the kids love it.
Brother's "crack and peel" tape makes it very easy to remove the backing from the label to expose the adhesive surface. The backing for the label is split/pre-cut along its entire length of the tape.

One warning - if you have other Netgear hubs and equipment,  keep the power supplies separate.  I had a single-speed 100Mbps hub and got  the power supplies mixed up.  The unit looked like it was working but  actually wasn't.  The power supplies look similar, the plugs are the same,  but I think the current and/or voltages are different.

You do need to set the i.p. address and if you skip this step during the installation it will not work. In which case go back and repeat the installation process  took about 3 minutes. The default i.p. address is 192.168.0.10. You will need to change this to something that works for your router.
2791	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Since the resolution is great at 2560*1600 you can view magazine like HBR or Scientific America in dual page with crystal clear, flicker free. you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous Dell 24 inch. The brightness and IPS performance so stunning. For Thailand friend, they send direct to your home and pay custom for 1700 B. Then this monitor is much cheaper than any 27 inch with same resolution selling in Thailand.
6282	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I needed only wee little cables to connect computers to switch and these are just the right size.  Handy to have the light blue, everything else is grey or black so I know which cable goes to what at a glance.
The pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv.
2488	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered 5 of these thinking I could save some money and have one in ever vehicle but 1 of the 5 worked when I got them(4 weeks after ordered).  Just spend the money and get the one from Monoprice. works great
2839	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This multi-charger eliminates all the myriad transformers that I used to have to take when traveling, and cleaned up my nightstand.  It charges five devices simultaneously including my power hungry iPad.  Two thumbs up!

No camera

So, this guy is coming back.
2940	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Device stopped working after one month. Most likely because I put it in my backpack even though it was protected in the box with foam. It did say no vibration. I managed to take it apart and unplug and replug everything back in. It started working again! But that was short lived. I'd spend a few more bucks and get a quality device. This one was pretty cheap quality.
1961	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The size is perfect. It has 2 brightness'. Its the best light I have ever purchased.  I should actually buy another one. For a spare.
165	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7" to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.

It makes the public library a whole new experience and that's great because, guess what...your tax dollars paid for it !  and the author gets their cut too.
4211	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Replace the stock 256MB card with this.  Works just as described.  For those types of products, brand doesn't really matter.  But you can never go wrong with Kingston.  The actually capacity of the card is 3.6GB, same as all other 4 GB microSDHC card.  As a class 4 card, it is much faster than those cheap SD cards that came with your phone or other gadgets.  For blackberry users who enjoy some music on the go, you will be pleased to find that you can cache around 25 Slacker radio stations on the card.  The card won't transform your phone like what it says in the advertisement, but it is certainly a nice addition to any gadgets depending on your usage.
Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.

The Belkin F3U134-10 is a 20-gauge 10' USB cable, A plug to A receptacle.  I use mine on an older PC that only has USB ports on the back of its tower. Thanks to this cable, I no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my USB memory key.

1134	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Good product for the price. Not an Apple I-pad but close. Biggest advantage is the ability to connect to a PC using the USB port. Not many tablets can do this and it is a huge advantage..
1039	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have more room than I know what to do with. I bought this for my G-Note 10.1 and it is great! It even works on my original G-Note phone. The only thing I don't like is that at first it couldn't be read due to it's format. you first have to reformat it to another file type. I can't remember if it came formatted in exfat or fat 32. anyway, it works now. I would recommend this product to anyone!!!

3284	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I like the idea of packing it with a CF card converter. Works a treat!

1826	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I read Ava Miles' other popular work, Nora Roberts Land, and was not disappointed by this later relation. The story starts very slow, and feels shallow for the first quarter, but it quickly evolves in a story that deals with serious issues. The characters and their problems are written about in a manner that allows you to actually care what happens beyond the simple male-female relationship aspect.

As Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up. Competing against Kylie and the other assistants for the promotion, Taylor proves willing to use darker methods to advance.
It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this "bendy plastic" business.
3048	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have only burned a few discs so far but it works well considering the price tag, we'll see if it holds up but as of now it's 7/7 with no issues.

Overall, great noise-cancelling. Get these and hear the difference!!!

9226	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the Nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer.  It is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera.  I have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother, the quality was so poor.  This camera is the best I have seen and I would highly recommend it.

Precise control
1844	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Got more than I asked great buy :)
I bought this to add memory to my cell phone (Motorola/Android). Stuck it in, followed a few prompts and done.
(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).

4896	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I  wanted it to work for my auto CD player but my CD player has different problem.
1418	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good, great Nook HD+, that is keeping me very happy. I have been truly blessed, this Nook tablet is the best. I am watching movies on it via Hulu and Netflix and other apps for movies etc. The video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors. I do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there, this tablet is sufficient to my needs. There is no camera, if you need one get another type of tablet. I recommend for those who do not need a super tablet, however, this tablet can do a lot. I just have not tried it all yet. I will  again say this, the video playback to me is awesome,it is truly HD. I am very satisfied with my refurbished Nook HD+, II am getting a lot for very little. I recommend buying thNook for a few dollars worth a  lot of fun.
C) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence. You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers (speakers). Fine tune them for the best reception in your location. This may take a few adjustsments. Remember, cellphones, WIFI etc can all interfere!
We who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard, DIY recorders using analog 4tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for OLD overstock hi-bias tapes from the 90s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like Walgreens is a 5 pack cheapo Maxell normal bias (even these are being hard to come by). This is the case with Amazon and eBay - all I can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping - Neither TDK nor Maxell make Hi-Bias anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact. I'm not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time (please comment if someone knows), but regardless, I don't recall paying these prices when they were new!
5251	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	OK, could be better.......

Black letters on white works on all surfaces.  I have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface.  If surface is dark it is hard to see the label.  Black on white is also the cheapest most common tape.

The design is well planned and thought out. There is a hard shell case attached to the right side of the case/wallet that holds the phone firmly in place. There are cutouts to access all buttons and the "S-Pen".
2405	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Worked as described. Fits perfect in the cigarette lighter socket. It has on and off red light.

Now, for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.
199	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	So this is a very simple, paper-bound album with a nice photo of a retro camera for the front cover. The covers are thick and strong, but the sheets and film to hold the photos are thin, so you wouldn't want to replace the photos often.

6960	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Sub standard cables, not the Belkin quality I have come to expect. It took almost 3 weeks to get them, and now that I have tried both of the cables I am not impressed with the quality of the product or the shipper. A consistent connection is iffy at best, not like the other cables that I currently have, so the problem is not with my system it is with the cables. When I finally received them, the plastic package had yellowed. So these units were either old or had been exposed to sunlight for a long period of time. Save your time and money, order them from somebody else.

931	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this SD microCard for my GoPro Silver, and it has worked perfectly.

Now that I've used the case for several months, I have to say that I'm not impressed with it. The plastic that surrounds and holds the phone in the case had broken off on both sides on top. There is no protection for the plastic, so if you plan to carry it in a pocket as I do, I would look at a different product.
4677	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	How do audio cassettes load in your car's cassette deck? Do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side? The problem is that most cassette adaptors can't accommodate both types of cassette decks.
636	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy.
602	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I used this mount for putting a 42" LCD screen on a wall.  It is a solid and sturdy mount.  I was extremely pleased by the quality.  Hex head lag screws that are included which are a breeze to drive into the stud.  I purchased a mount previously that had a phillips head on the lag screws and that really made them a job to drive into the stud.  Since the TV was rather large (400x400 vesa mounting pattern) I had to use the extension arms off of the main plate as shown in the picture.  They were surprisingly very easy to attach.  A nice plastic cover is included which slides back over the wall mounting plate to conceal the mounting screws - I thought that was a nice touch.
7317	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive-  My university's graphics computers have zip drives, the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers, my parents even have a zip drive now.

Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without  damage.

5731	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly.  True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.

Second, it's very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches, and are well built.  Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.
8836	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a very inexpensive case (just look at the prices in the retail stores) to protect a very expensive phone.  Everything fits fine; all buttons and orifices are accessible. It feels like a safe way to carry this amazing little pocket computer.  I did read the negative reviews about the plastic holder breaking, and it's hard to see how that can happen.  The plastic seems very durable and flexible to me, but then it has only been a couple of weeks.  If something happens poorly in the coming months, I'll try to remember to chime in here, but I don't expect it to.

8199	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is a very high quality leather case with good hardware.  My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isn't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.  The velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone.  A few snaps would have been much better.  Other than that the quality is first rate.

9162	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I really like the Maxell laser lens cleaner.  I think it is better than some of the other brands on the market.  I believe the Maxell cleaner cleaned my DVD laser much better than another one I had purchased.  You can't see the underside of the disc until you open the package, but the Maxell disc has a little brush embedded on the underside, whereas the other brand I had purchased did not.  Perhaps, this is why the Maxell cleaner did a better job?

If you want ties in different colors and you won't be using them much (e.g. wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it) then these might be ok..but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized, pick something else.

What's just plain bad: It loses data. All the data, right back to factory settings. I let the battery run down, then didn't use it for a month or so. When I came back - gone. All those dozens of books I'd collected, folder organization, notes, and all the rest - gone. And this has happened more than once. C'mon, guys, that's flash memory in there. It holds data even when there's no power. That's why we use it, or didn't someone get the memo?
5718	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is cool and all, but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price.
5375	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.
Even so, this is a  fine mouse at a fantastic price.  As someone who has spent a ridiculous  amount of money on pointing devices, I wish I'd started with this one  first.
921	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It has been working like it should for about a month now. It performs as expected however I would look for the most current model for this product before you complete the purchase.

9994	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought the Midland 74-822 with the corresponding Midland 18-2442 antenna.  I read all the reviews and being a ham radio operator knew which ones to filter out.  So here is the nitty gritty on this CB Radio.  It's pretty slick.  What you have to do to get the most out of it.  Tune the antenna with a SWR meter.  I had the top part of the antenna about halfway down into the slot before I got the best numbers.  My channel 19 (where I will spend most of the time) SWR was 1.1.  I marked the spot on the antenna with a black maker so if it slips I'll know where to put it.  I had a hum when I first hooked up the radio (before tuning) and it got worse when I backed out of the drive way slowly.  Turns out the neighborhood is full of EMF interference with all the telephone wires, electrical source, etc.  So that was good.  Remember you have to tune the antenna in an open area.  I went to the beach and found a big empty parking lot.  I tuned with the engine off.  I used the Astatic PDC1 SWR Meter.  It's a tad confusing because it is not clear which switch is reflected/forward.  There is a power/SWR switch.  Put it down on SWR and use the switch to the left FWD/REF and ignore the 10/100 watt notation.  I don't get why there is a 10/100 watt if the max power is 4.  Who is using a CB at 100 watts?  Ok, so the radio itself is plenty loud.  I have documented hearing loss and have to have subtitles on movies on the Roku box BUT even I easily heard the chatter on the radio.  So disregard those reviews of speaker volume too low.  Totally Bogus.  The is no background light for night operation- you have to push the light button manually.  This was not a big deal for me.  I have this radio in the box between the seats in my 2015 Nissan Altima.  It's tucked in there with the Yaesu FT-60R.  They both run off the 12V in the box and have their separate magnet antennas.  I was hearing people way out on the Interstate bridge about 10 miles over water.  I did a radio check and all I got back was "it's working".  Nobody gives their 10-20 these days.  When I get a certified range I'll come back and update this review but I like it- and I'm hard to please.  CB is AM and more prone to picking up interference but it's also HF and that is a good band for the distance. (yeah the Hams think it should be our band lol)  Ham radio is nice but CB is better for getting traffic info on the long trips.  While on a recent 2K mile trip my iPad running apple maps had warnings pop up on the screen "Warning Accident Ahead" or delays etc but it would be on the other side of the road or already cleared-not timely precise info.  A trucker would have given me better info and we all want to know where smokey is-have you seen what a speeding ticket costs these days?  It's nice to have someone a 1/2 mile either side of you to watch out for you.  And some of those truckers a too damn funny and the laughter makes for a faster trip too.  So go ahead and get this multi purpose radio.  I haven't tried it as a stand along handheld - what an antenna that small the range is going to be short, so short I don't want to even bother- for walk around I'll use a small FRS radio if I need to.  But this radio is in the box between the seats.  If folks want me to post some photos I can do that.  If you buy a Nissan Altima then you can have the same setup - out of sight killer custom install.  Cheers! and don't worry about those bogus reviews, this is a nice CB for the modern car.
After buying a switch for my college dorm room I needed an extra Ethernet cord. Since the switch box was about a foot from the Ethernet plug I needed a small length, and 3 feet seemed adequate.

Posting here for any who are trying to decide between Nook and Kindle - my 4 1/2 year old Kindle has been dragged all over the world in airplanes and is in and out of my computer bag pretty regularly and still works as perfectly as it did the day I bought it FWIW.

1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.
battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby.

2970	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Worth it, very good!
5080	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This product gets used 20-40 minutes per day on average. I also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets 1-3 hrs of use maybe once every other week.  They say the battery life is 80 hrs, but that must be if you use it 80 straight hours.  We received the radio in early March, put in 3 batteries, and they are still going strong (it is now December).  Amazing.  Sometimes I am shocked when I find a consumer electronic product that works well, works simply, and works reliably.  This is one of those products.

That's right! I got both on this Tablet.
Where the cord plugs into the Nook itself; that's where the problem is.  If it gets even the slightest pressure put on it the it starts coming apart.

I understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality.  Probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device, specifically, the playback heads.

Anyway, I'm really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me, I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I won't really ever want to read again (like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart). Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread, I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! I've never tried the kindle, but honestly I'd say they're probably fairly equal when it comes down to it (I mean really reading a book on a screen doesn't vary that much). If you just go with whichever one sounds better to you, then you'll probably be happy, I know I am!
The Mavica MVC-73 is okay for taking outdoor & social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably well-lit, and the proper picture-type settings are being used. Unfortunately, the flash function for darker occasions isn't all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject(s), and has a limited range of about eight feet (approx. 2.5 meters). Beyond that, you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.

 this little  gem  does the trick...i use this to play  my mp3 players (sony and an ipod )  the audio quality is superb.. its  crystal clear..  i  also use this in the house on my stereo system...

What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.  I expect to practically NEVER make a purchase from the official store.  Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every. single. time.  Unbelievable shortcoming of the Nook.

8684	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear. so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio. THIS IS A 1 PIN REMOTE SPEAKER. YOUR RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE A SLOT FOR 1 PIN TO USE THIS.

The installation was straightforward and fairly simple. The only point at which I needed some help was in balancing the TV while I attached it to the arm; otherwise it was all me.

After my deployment I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it until I discovered it after I recently moved to my new town house. I would recommend this for anyone who want's a cheaper tablet for reading and does not mind not having sound or video. I currently have the finances and the means to get a much fancier and expensive tablet but I still love using my paper white. I do a lot of reading in the evening and I like how my eyes don't get strained from looking at a lit screen. I'm the type of person who can sit down and read for hours and hours.

3379	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Unfortunately, there is no practical way to test a travel adapter until you are in a foreign country and need to plug something in. If it doesn't work, you are then stuck in your hotel room with devices that can't be used unless you go out searching for a store to buy a new adapter. That is what happened to me. I intended to use this adapter to charge my laptop and iPhone simultaneously on a trip to the UK. The USB charger port never worked at all. The USA AC plug worked briefly, but then it made a popping sound and stopped working completely. I just threw it away. It wasn't worth packing home to try to get a refund. The cost was trivial, but the inconvenience was much greater than the money lost. I wish I had paid a few more dollars for a reputable brand instead of trying to save money with something cheap.

7413	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have no idea how good they are.  They are Maxell, and they work fine.  I wouldn't know how good the quality is because I make tapes and send them to people.  I don't have time to listen to them to check them.  No one has ever complained about them or commented on the quality of them.  A tape is a tape.  I don't know that there is any difference in any of the tapes.  There was one brand that would drag.  These do not drag.  They go through the recording cycle smoothly.  They were a good price, and came quickly.  I will certainly buy more of them if I need more.

I have contacted Kingston, and they have a lifetime guarantee on their products.  I have sent it in for a replacement, but I just wish it had worked properly the first time.
7261	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Big and beautiful - love it.  Installation was smooth - nice braided lines, color-coded.  I added a stabilization bracket (Delta Faucet RP37490 Victorian Stabilization Plate) to help it from a slight wobble.  I may further add some kind of jury-rigged bracket to brace it against the plywood frame holding up the sink itself, but as it is, it's pretty stable.  I had to get used to the dribble that comes out after the handle/valve is closed, but that's what's inside the gooseneck and falls out from gravity - not really a complaint, though.  This is clearly meant to be installed with the valve handle to the right of the neck, and not in front.  I have it installed in front only because I only have 4-inches separating the faucet hole from the sprayer hole, and the handle would hit the sprayer.  Best solution would be to have sprayer mounted further than 4-inches out and get the handle on the side.  With handle in front, it's noticeable (but not terrible) that the handle will go down to 10-o'clock for cold, but only 1-o'clock for hot, making "noon" hotter than what is true middle, which is at about 11:30.  With handle on the side, this makes sense - you wouldn't want to have to push the handle that far back to get full hot, or it might hit the wall or backing.

Update. I forgot to add in my review that kindle books do work on here. I was reading books on the Kindle app. I took some screenshots of the features that I used, but for some weird reason its not letting me add photos to the "customer image" section or into my review. I'm not sure if its a glitch on Amazon or something, but I will check into it. Look out for another update.
411	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for a very long arm to support my 32" LED screen.  This product is excellently constructed.  The packaging of the mounting screws was the best I have ever seen.  The instructions were clear and the mounting went flawlessly.  The movement was initially very stiff but by adjusting the various bolts I was able to get the freedom of movement I desired.  I would highly recommend this inexpensive wall mount TV arm.

1432	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	So many choices are out there it is dizzying.  You just have to figure out what you want a 'tablet' for and what features are important to you. Found it cheaper by goin direct to B&N (no case comes with it).  You can boot to or buy AFN for JellyBean 4.2.2 via sdcard (you can root to). Very happy with it.

6801	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Recorded and rerecorded on this set of 6 for over a year.  A good quality tape.
9267	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Black on white is the best. It is easier to read than white on black (the letters don't come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes) and black on clear. Black on Clear requires that the background is light or clear. I used to label an old Power Mac G4 Cube computer and it looked great. Other times I tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read.
FRAME RATE: Terrible.  There are 3 settings for picture quality vs frame rate.  On "high" quality, you get a nice smooth picture with so-so color, and a frame rate of 7 fps (I measured it).  On medium, the picture is very grainy, so you can turn down the sharpness, which helps "somewhat" - frame rate is now 15 fps.  On "low", the picture is downright awful, with grain, and jagged lines, and the frame rate is still only about 19 fps.
450	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great product
4895	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works fantastic and is everything that it was advertised to be.  If you listen to a lot of cd's, this is a must to own.

8803	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these to use with the Motorola TalkAbout and the cases while biking to work.  I sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch.  This was a good purchase.
Pros:  Good reception, solid design, handy controls, good sound.
3017	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I would have given this piece of crap ZERO stars, but then I wouldn't be able to comment.  DO NOT BUY....I should have checked out reviews before buying.  Got my money back promptly from AMAZON, but this product should be take OFF of Amazon so others don't buy it.

8308	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this item to go nature viewing and must say that it really is a great binocular for the price.  The items viewed have a really nice 3-dimensional look to them and the diopter comes in handy even for someone with very bad vision like myself.  The focus for this model (16 x 50 Wide Angle) is a flat tab between the barrels that makes it VERY convenient to use without having to look or stretch your fingers.  It gives a very nice field of vision and has roll down eye cups, which is good just in case you want to wear your glasses or shades.  The binoculars do shake a little b/c of the power of the magnification.  And it can be a chore to hold for long periods of time b/c of its weight.  It weighs about as much as one of Michener's hardback novels.

EDIT 7/14/10: After the latest software updates, my nook experience has drastically improved. Page turns are much faster, and though the Etch-A-Sketch effect is still there it's nowhere near as noticeable. B&N has added general browsing to the wi-fi; it's a pain to navigate, but the option is now there for people who need to access the internet. Games have been added- Sudoku and Chess. Battery life seems to have improved for me, as I can now run the nook several hours a night for about a week before it needs to be recharged. And, best of all, the slowdown issues I was having have disappeared entirely!
4003	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Item as expected. Painless transaction.

[Update 10/27/2014: I left the phone in the case on the lavatory in the rest room and an office cat knocked it off. The phone was protected, which should probably be what I concentrate on, but the plastic inside backing of the case was cracked in two places so it no longer holds the phone securely in place. I will probably try another brand for my new phone case.
1557	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	We bought this for our 8 year old who has a great deal of trouble falling asleep at night. It has the perfect amount of reading light to allow him to read without waking his younger brother and it is so light! They have a great selection of books for his age range and though the battery says it will last a month I think t was anticipating only and hour of reading a day. I had to recharge today so it lasted 12 days with him reading almost 2 hours a day. Best gift we have bought him ever, hands down.
8054	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Bought these to connect my router to all my home theater stuff. Rasberry pi, etc. Love the vibrant off beat colors.
1. Very user friendly. Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.
I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.
Installation was fairly smooth. Took my husband and I about 20 minutes maybe. We weren't timing it but it didn't take long. Actually, the hardest part of the installation was lifting the tv onto it. The directions are pretty straight forward, at least we didn't get confused. It comes out of the box almost completely put together and you actually have to take it partially take it apart to conduct the install.

2325	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Well, I got this 3 years ago for $2.30 and used it regularly.  Every so often, it would get dislodged anytime you plugged a cable in/out.  At first I just got used to pushing it back in the lighter socket whenever I saw it wasn't charging, and I was even OK with that as long as it did the job of charging my phone while I was on the road.

2387	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	i loved this
This is a stable, solid, very well constructed device. Highly adaptible to the many VESA as well as some non-standard mounting holes out there. I was worried that since I was using the VESA 100 holes the mounting plate might stick out to far, but even on the 21" it doesnt stick out at all.
The build quality could be better, if you move the HDMI cable it tends to drop the signal for a second, but if the phone is not moving around then you are good.
5946	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	OK
Since using daily I've not had a problem at all.  Arrived on time, well packaged, and as I ordered.  Solid good product.
1855	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	From his infectious enthusiasm for the Mindstorms NXT System it might be easy to guess that Laurens Valk was introduced to Lego Robotics at age 13 just five short years ago. But, from the careful logical pedagogy of this book and his interesting approach mixing successively more advanced robots intermixed with a clearly arranged taxonomy of parts, programming tools and motor/drive train and sensor categorization, I would have imagined that this book was written by an excellent teacher with many years of experience bringing engineering concepts to youthful learners.  Not only does the book offer a clear top-down beginning to end approach to both the NXT Parts Architecture and NXT-G Programming Language while combining this end-to-end approach with interesting projects of increasing difficulty, but he stimulates the reader with building and programming challenges to increase their skill at independent thought in robot building and programming.  Just how far and how thoughtfully Laurens' teaching approach goes is indicated by by his unique system of flowcharting/state diagrams which both provides the logical decisions involved in programming this system with a graphical correspondence to the NXT-G Programming language.
825	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I had given this item a 1 star and bad review because I wasn't giving any instructions of how it worked.  Now that I know how to properly use it I changed it to 5 stars.  The proper way to use it is #1 you need your phone charger to plug it in the small port of the slim port to give it power to display it on your TV.  This does not mean it will charge your phone at the same time too.  On some phone it will charge your device (G4). Now #2 this one is important, you have to put your phone on airplane mode in order not to lose connection from your device to your TV.  If you don't do this video from your phone to the TV will be cutting in and out all the time or won't display it at all.  On some phones it might work without using airplane mode.  But I know that on mine (G4) it won't work unless I put it on airplane mode. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your product!!.. I was pretty close to throwing mine away in frustration. Glad I did not!

Only newer model cars seem to have a direct line in, or USB input, so I needed to purchase this or an FM transmitter.  I found the audio quality of this device to be superior to the FM transmitters.  However, the adapter worked very poorly out of the package.  It would cause my car tape deck to switch back and forth from "side 1" to "side 2" and eventually eject with an error.  It would fail to play successfully about 80% of the time.

Although this is not the current glowlight reader, I feel that it is the better choice.  You have physical back and forward page buttons and a SD card slot which the current model lacks.  Although the new one supposedy has better screen resolution and a better glowlight, it is not noticeable to me.  Altogether, I feel that you get more bang for your buck with this model.  And, the included $5 B & N coupon is a nice little bonus.  The Nook reader was well packaged and quickly shipped.  I highly recommend this Nook and this seller.

8713	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Not sure if these tapes are knockoffs, but these tapes jam in our Sony BM-575 portable recorders.  They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.
2743	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Pretty color and very nice touch. I broke a few keyboard. With this I don't have to buy new key board replacement.
The two that work, perform great.  Good looks, blue LED to make connections easy in the dark, and great power for my iPad and iPhone simultaneously.
Enjoy the music and be well,
The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.
The Glowlight is awesome!  Clean, even lighting across the screen and it's easily adjustable.  The lookup function for word definitions is very handy, battery life is phenomenal, memory/storage is generous, and it's very easy to navigate the B&N website for new books.  I guess some folks have had issues with the screen cracking and such, but I've banged mine around quite a bit and never had any problems.  Overall I've been very impressed with my Nook and highly recommend it to someone looking for a simple, easy to use e-reader.

7273	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I just bought this set on sale for 10 bucks and have to say they are definitely worth it. They are heavy duty, not delicate. You do not have to be afraid to use them. The short stem and the foot are thick as well, so no worries there either.
Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.
9395	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Just a great product.  Very easy to use and real nice and clear printing and a nice sticky back when exposed.
7036	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Nice Propss i love them !

If you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable, be aware of recommended USB cable length limits.  Low-density devices (e.g. mice and keyboards) should not exceed cable lengths of 10', while high-density USB devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of 16 feet. If you plan to extend your current USB cable beyond these limits, consider getting a repeating cable such as the Belkin Active Extension USB Cable.

7338	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	works well as I needed this extension. good quality cable.

2174	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My wife loves these - and goes thru them 'cause they are not intended for the rough treatment she deals out - ie, don't drop the book they are clipped on
This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H.
3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.
The description above needs to have the specific cable length mentioned somewhere. Any with a different length needs its own entry, or at least Amazon or the seller(s) should provide a drop-down menu allowing the purchaser to choose which length is preferred.

5768	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  I installed these at work on two doors that always would get the normal kick down doorstops broken.  These have been up a week and are working great.  There wasn't any instructions, but it was easy to figure out, If I could do it anyone could.  Install only took about 10 mins for the first then a little faster on the second.  Even slamming the door open these make it safe.  There is a spring in the little part that withstands damage.  I put the long part with the magnate on the door and the little part on the wall, I don't see any difference switching them.  I will be ordering more to out fit the whole building.

1066	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Boy do I feel burned with this SanDisk 64gb MicroSDXC card. Product 'worked' in my Motorola Photon 4G phone for about 6 weeks but then failed in the strangest way. The card has been loaded with roughly 47gb of data, some very personal, and it is now in a permanent READ ONLY mode. I can access what's on the card; read it, play it etc. but can no longer delete, erase, format or otherwise to anything to change the contents. This I have tried to do while memory card is in the phone or in a thumb drive adapter attached to my PC. All fails. So I am really stuck when it comes to warranty. If I want to submit for a replacement I'll have to send in the old card but since I cannot erase anything I would have to send it back with some pretty sensitive information...
5753	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I used this to clean the lense on two DVD players that were skipping bad and it worked.  I had to do it twice on one of the players but they definitely helped a lot.

3840	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Needed it so I can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time. Basically just got it to share fast and it does the job.


484	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32" TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price.
6029	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Can't find these in the store anymore so this was great.

3038	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Myself and a friend both bought one of these. I have a Windows 8 laptop, she had a Windows 7. Neither device works on either machine, and the included driver disc includes a home burnt CD-R with drivers for Windows 98. This is a cheap knock off device. I found a Samsung external drive for $5 more at MicroCenter, it works flawlessly. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS JUNK.
9856	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It just works, it's really trouble-proof. I have no concerns about it and i would recommend it to a friend.
5261	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought 4 prs of these about 6 years ago for an extended trip. 6 plane rides later, we were all happy with the purchase. I don't think the stewardesses were happy that we didn't have to buy headphones though... but, they worked well and we were able to hear the in-flight movie and the movies on our portable DVD players. 4 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home. However, two pair are still functioning quite well. Saw these at this reduced price and I just bought 5 more pair for some travelling this Summer. I don't get into all the techie stuff that others do... I just say if it works well, great...
Some of the pluses:
7695	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I got this strip because I was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer. This did just that.
Disliked:
3098	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It works.  Only problem is that I purchased them thinking they were antennas.  Only did I find out way later that they were mics.

4984	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good.  quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd

5302	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This baby is about the size of a couple of laptops stacked and turned on edge. It's hard to miss almost anywhere you put it, and probably too big to look OK on your desk.
I like the bag. It is attractive to look at. It is a bit big for the camera I bought, but too big is better than too small!
Took 1 star off as the adapter doesn't work out of the box with Windows 10.  Only took 1 star off as a simple shunt with a twist-tie makes it work just fine.
I applied for a return on Amazon and have to wait up to 48 hours for approval from Vendor.  Manufacturer does not have a US website.  I guess I will just cross my fingers and hope I don't lose the second monitor before I can get a replacement.  This is a work computer.

-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.
Chrome browser loads faster than the regular browser. The reader is great. I downloaded PDFs and books from the kindle and nook store. There weren't any issues. The services I used are Spotify and Prime Music apps. Spotify locked up maybe twice so far, which isn't a deal. And Prime music is good, but the artwork is really blurry for some reason. Its not a big deal either. They are both good for listening to music. TuneIn Radio worked well.
Then I flamed B&N that I had a BRICK with all my files trapped on it, that it was well within WARRANTY, that I had wasted TWO HOURS with desperadoes in Ecuador stealing my credit identity, and I wanted a REPLACEMENT.

When using this card, Android will think that it is broken and needs to be reformatted.  I let the phone format the card and it worked!
If you want to set up a network without spending much, these hubs work well.  However, I suggest you buy a 10/100 Mbps hub instead.

This story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.

7914	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	These chargers do not work. Most charger cubes are 1A and not powerful enough to push thru this long of a cord. They end up charging very slowly or not at all, even over night. Buy shorter cords and more powerful cube.
The SanDisk Ultra Micro SDXC card with adapter meets my dash cam needs handily. Experience with the SanDisk brand gives me confidence it will keep working. That's a 5 star performer for me.
2224	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	works just like it should.  Seems well made.  The length allows it to be used for a wireless looking wall mount.


6294	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	A good package all functional y for a good price. Still I can use these tapes for recording some show and programs in 4x9 format and it is far better than record shows in other media because at max definition I can have 3 shows of 2 hours each instead of one DVD with one hour each.
5018	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	take care
The story is very well told, and not so dark as other stories I've read. There is an undercurrent of hope in this story, even in the darkness of the beginning, so you  know that somehow Mary will be able to dig herself out of the pit she's in. If you missed this story the first time, you won't want to skip it now. Pick up your copy of NOT A SPARROW FALLS for an uplifting story of hope.

7498	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	CF readers with USB cords? Why bother? Say goodbye to those bothersome cords! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE. One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading. I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing! It's so simple to use, light-weight, compact -- and incredibly inexpensive! How simple? Plug your CF card in one end, plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive. How sweet is that?
8239	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to read some old Zip disks I had lying around. I wanted to save the old files. I bought my Zip drive from third-party seller ElizabethLeeHR and even though it was used, it ran on my Win7 laptop flawlessly. No driver needed; pure plug-n-play! Of course, Zip drives eventually all develop the click-death syndrome, so I can only rate this 4 stars!

2193	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Had a blue mighty bright for a year before and that one worked great till my grandaughter stepped on it. But the one I purchased here on Amazon the silver Mighty Bright light, just didn't work well for me. It constantly had to be adjusted when switching from the left side of the page to the right, it just couldn't illuminate both sides. The final straw was the on and off button broke off, never to be found,  so much for the Mighty Bright, its in the trash and I'll order the Eveready this time.
I would not have wanted to open my Google Chromebook without it. If you get a chromebook... this book is a must read/musthave < for ready reference.
8218	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My cable modem makes for great, fast internet access... for one computer. But what about downloading updates for my iBook without disconnecting my iMac? This hub has done that with ease. Easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes. Never a problem since.
Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!
It worked fine for 90 DAYS on post-production of one of our lastest e-books ... then the screen went black, ... just white letters NOOK slowing fading, fading to black. With my production files now locked inside. Que?
8698	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great quality and durability. Holds up great beating around in the Jeep and on when used on hikes. I keep the radio in a top pocket of my day pack and clip the mic to the shoulder strap for easy access. Works wonderfully. Clear and crisp transmissions. The nly con I have is that if the cable were longer it would be a little less restrictive when used in back pack mode, but it seems to be the right length when in the Jeep.
One station that has always been problematic for me (KBAQ 89.5 FM transmitting from the other side of Phoenix) came in loud and almost perfectly clear. Unfortunately, selectivity on this radio's FM band is poor (GE chose fidelity over selectivity in this case), so 90.5 FM in Tucson is completely drowned out by 90.3 FM here in Phoenix. After opening the unit and replacing the stock IF filter with a 150 kHz filter (please read the Superadio FAQ on the Internet for more information), I can now pull in 90.5 as well.
6387	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I love to buy Belkin products because they are well made and trusted.  I am afraid to buy electronics and cables from unknown companies because of unknown manufacturing standards and fire danger.  Belkin might cost a little more, but is worth it for the peace of mind.  The 10 foot length is perfect to reach from the charger to my bed so i can read while my kindle is charging.
It's quite a bargain and packed well. Very good quality for the price
1643	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Well, at a certain point enough dead bodies are enough for raising the stakes. Quite frankly, I was surprised he was released so easily every time he happened to find the victim (refraining from plot spoiling details here). It was like, really? The police aren't even going to consider he might be an exceptionally brazen serial killer who makes all his victims look like suicides, then brazenly happens to discover the body? I know, I said brazen twice. The sequel gets even a bit more implausible...mixing the supernatural and detective novels is fine, but I am tough on works that don't follow their own internal logic. Anyway, if the third one is inexpensive or cheap I'll give it a shot...the writing is good, it is just there are a few too many implausible plot points, and some inconsistent characterization.


You will need to manually install your printer driver, if said installer is waits for the USB printer to be plugged in; Which can be an issue if your drivers are only part of a setup package. Which then means you may have to search for them on the internet.
595	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Good quality.  Must mount on a stud.  I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37" TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!

Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.

Moral: If a USB cable does not explicitly state that it is USB 2.0 (or USB 3.0) then it's probably a USB 1.1 cable that won't support most of today's peripherals.

One thing ... I noticed another reviewer complained that they were not able to get the liquid out of the bottle because the bottle was too stiff to squeeze ... I also had this problem until I realized that you have to stick a pin inside the dropper to break the seal - after that it worked perfectly.
It is a great product, but it puts a lot of the cables suddenly to the edge of usability.  I would recommend its use with shorter (3 feet and under) USB cables.  Otherwise, you might be better off getting a shorter extension cable, or an active USB cable like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tripp-Lite-U026-016-USB2-0-16-Feet-Certified-Active-Extension-Cable/dp/B0002D6QJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tripp Lite U026-016 USB2.0 16-Feet Certified Active Extension Cable</a>.

1891	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet. Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet,so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.
4905	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Product is as described. So for product works as expected. No issue as yet. Would recommend item.
-1 star because it has a Windows-only config utility.
1878	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	The item looked like it had been handled before like it was most likely in a store and the package had been opened  but everything was there and it was in very good shape. Only did not give 5 stars for the fact that it was defiantly fiddled with and on the back there was a very tiny mark like someone had pinched it too hard with long nails.. BUT, For under 8$ and being much MUCH cheaper then buying one in store I think it was well worth my money! Shipping was VERY fast! Got it next day with Prime shipping. I'm just glad to find a cheap good case at last that will look good and keep my nook safe too.
984	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Can't beat the price on Amazon.  This is a San Disk product.  I have used San Disk product for years without any issues.  This is also, the super fast read and write card.  You won't be disappointed with this one.
2181	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	it doesn't cover both pages so I have to move it around as I read, but it moves so easily it's not much of a bother.
  These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from Radio Shack that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to Home Depot (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.

6257	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have found Maxell to be one of the reliable VHS tapes.  (Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120.  When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime.  The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too.  :-)  Long may the VCR's survive.

Just a warning, unless you root the device it's basically useless. It would not let me put any fanfiction I downloaded on it until I rooted it. Even now, I can see the cover photos but no descriptions because it was designed to only read B&N books. I found ways around this by just clicking on the book and having the summary the main page, but it's still annoying.

5046	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've always listened to news radio in the mornings and I like to take long showers. This is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower. I've had it for over 2 years now and it has been through just 5 batteries. It comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower's wall and reception is amazing. Buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local TV stations so you get the audio. Sometimes I do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise, but I never go more than half way up. This shower radio is excellent, get it now.

GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.

The only thing I really didn't like was the anti glare coating, but I have gotten more used to it after a few days. For anyone wanting to use this with their macbook pro go ahead and buy it. If you own a display port to dual dvi adapter this monitor will work great without any issues (that I have noticed).
That's about it. My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.  I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

NOT A SPARROW FALLS was originally published back in 2002, and I'm fairly positive that I read it then, but if I did I didn't write a review. The book seems very familiar to me. Mary is a desperate woman, tired of living a life on the wrong side of the law, and yet knowing she is too far gone to return to her roots and the innocence she once knew.
Cole could have been developed more as the reader really doesn't get much explanation for what he is really feeling. As a child, we understand that he loves his brother, but we don't get a feel for how this boy feels about having his mother die and being abandoned by his father. This is not expressed well from the adult Cole's viewpoint, either.

1658	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I am going to get right to the point, this wasn't the book for me. The blurb sounded right up my alley, but the writing style was not. The premise for the story is solid and interesting, and the technical aspect of the writing is top notch, but my problem was the pacing. It couldn't keep my interest. It took me two weeks to read because I just wasn't motivated to pick it up once I put it down. I wanted to DNF it, but I also wanted to know how it ended.

Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.  For the price you simply CANNOT go wrong!!!

Turns out there is a reason the author has received all those 4-5 star reviews, he really knows how to write a solid book, and does a particularly good job of balancing tension and plot advancement, while crafting interesting characters and realistic dialog.  All too often, books of this genre have dialog that is jarringly bad in spots (aka nobody talks like that in real life) or plot devices of the worst sort of Dues Ex Machina kind.  Leather does not fall into either trap.  Its clear the Nightfall series benefits from the author's experiences writing his previous books, as in the wrong hands this could have been a terrible book.  Instead, it ended up a well written, terrifically executed take on the genre.

At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating.

What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.
Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.

The other product this competes  against is MP3 players.  I think Minidisc is better suited for most people,  because to listen to different songs you can just put in a new minidisc,  you don't have to be near your computer and download new songs.  As  portable products are made for people on the go, this makes more sense.  And of course it's still possible to record your MP3's to minidisc, it just  takes more time.

5013	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I mainly purchased this product because it records FM radio. It's been extremely difficult finding a product that records FM radio in high quality without playback issues. This is my 4th unit and the results are bitter sweet. All the previous units did record FM radio but all of them also skipped during playback. With each unit the audio skip was actually recorded into the file and was frustrating to listen to during playback. Some of them did not record in high quality either.

7227	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I find this brush great for a complete thorough cleaning of my grill after barbequing. I hate to say this but after a barbecue party, I am tired and I hate to clean the grill. I usually give the grill a semi-clean job because it takes so much effort to clean the grates when I am tired, and on my next barbeque, thats when I give it a good cleaning before using because I have more energy then. But after my brush fell apart on my last barbecue, I bought this new one to replace it and had the opportunity to use it just this 4th of July. When I fired up the grill to clean the grates before use, like I always do, I find the brush easily scraped off all previous food particles from the grates. After the party, I was tired and expected to just brush off some of the food particles but everything came off so easily. I proceeded to clean the entire grill. The twisted steel wires corners of the brush was great in scraping the corner areas of the grates. When I saw how easy all the food particles were coming off, I was encouraged to keep going until the whole grill was cleaned. Im extremely pleased with how my grill looked after cleaning. Now I know how important a good grill brush is to the ease of cleaning the grill.

First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident.

Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.

This book covers only the Mac OS itself, including topics such as various settings and preferences, attaching devices, networking, and backing up, and use of a few of the built-in programs (mail, contacts, address book, itunes, ichat, etc.)  It does not cover any of the well-known third-party applications such as Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  The information is crystal-clear, thanks to carefully done page layout, and there is lots of good explanation and guidance.  Occasional red-box warnings of important gotchas are not overused, thus effective.

Next, I got maybe a year and a half of use and started having the EXTREMELY frustrating 'black screen only". I can plug any other monitor into the graphics card and it will work just fine, but NOT this one. Then a few days later, it would start inexplicably working again. Then, black screen again. When you turn the monitor on, it will immediately go into a sleep mode (orange LED still lit indicating power to the monitor, but no display is shown on the monitor at all).

My problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into "connected" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems ("Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  I am hoping that it will update on my brother's XP laptop. we'll see when he gets back home.
6237	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It's good, but bulky.
The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.

I would say that this book would be helpful to both someone who used to use a Windows based system and transitioned to the Mac as well as someone new to computers and bought a new Mac. People already familiar with the Mac won't get too much out of this book though.
but this device has an extra feature that others do not offer: built in encryption - and this is important in at least one regard:
My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the "n" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.

I put it in the bedroom for a couple of weeks to dry out and it worked again. Then I put it on the window sill in the shower where it would rarely get water on it but it didn't last long there either.  I let it dry out again and put it on a self over the sink in the bathroom where it would never get wet but apparently the steam condensed inside it because there was water in it again (I could see tiny little drops on the inside of the display). After that I threw it a way.  Needless to say I was very disappointed in a Shower Radio I couldn't even keep in the bathroom let a lone the shower itself.

The story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!
My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4" since there is only a screw on the bottom.

I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the "tablet" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.

Most of the  the cables I found on Amazon had suspect success. This site had the best success rate. These work great and seem to be well made. I am jazzed that these cables seem to be OEM compliant.

619	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Mounted 42" Samsung LED in home office with this mount.  The arm that leaves the wall is longer than the others I've used and pivots in the middle, so it's easy to get the TV in whatever position you want it.  I was concerned it may not be as stable when it is fully extended, but that wasn't the case.  Very stable when fully extended.
The batteries seem to last forever in the radio so it is a perfect back up emergency radio for power outages.  I gave my first radio away to my daughter so she could stay informed during Hurricane Isabel,  bought a new one, and my mother-in-law in Florida fell in love with it, so another radio gone.
  It uses no fewer than 6 "D" cells. But the radio is so big you hardly notice. Most of the size comes from the 6" diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it. It probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic. There's also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers. All the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment, and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable. It has a handle, and while you can carry it around, it's a "portable" radio in the same sense that the original "beige toaster" 128k Macintosh was portable.

One thing that is almost worth deducting a half a star is the limited articulation of the screen from the mount.  It only swivels.  I am used to swivel, tilt and about six inches of vertical travel.  Again, not a deal killer.

Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say "Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!").
The other reason I bought the Diamond is for  use in the gym. I grow weary of the classic rock at Gold's and want some  Talking Heads, Lords of Acid or maybe Mozart. The carry case packaged with  the player, however, is tedious. The fabric mesh case completely obscures  access to all controls. In fact, while fumbling, I accidentally placed the  Rio into "loop this track" mode. How did I do this? There is no loop  button. Several minutes of inspection, between workout sets proved  fruitless. Later, after I got home and read the manual - fold out pamphlet  is more apt - I learned Diamond overloaded the use of the multi-button. Not  only does the multi-button turn, but you press it for selections. If you  have a Sony HandyCam, you know the drill. However, while in the gym, the  Rio's interface had me baffled. I blame Diamond for a bad interface.

Some stops require using a foot to push the doorstop into place, and others require using a foot to pull the stop up to close the door. We had tried magnets on the wall and door, but they only worked about half the time. I had never seen magnetic door stops before, so these caught my eye. I figured it would be the perfect solution. When I ordered, I received a discount from Elbee in exchange for my honest, impartial and thorough review of the doorstops.

I will definitely buy from this seller again.
Honestly this device has all the pros of a kindle with one major upside. The ability to load documents and free ebooks far far far exceeds the kindle. My great aunt wrote a novel before she passed away and had a microsoft word document copy. With the help of some free software, I was able to convert the file and load it onto my nook in a matter of minutes! My sister has a kindle and could not figure out a way to load it onto her device. I have an extensive library of free books and since I can purchase ebooks from anywhere, I have more choices than the kindle.

tax collecting ?
Also, the fact that these cables come in multiple colors GREAT.  You can have a different colors for each room (i.e., use blue cables for your office, white for the kitchen, etc.).  If you have a problem, it makes it easy, even for your young kid, to trace it back.  Internet not working in the kitchen but is just fine in other locations.  Check the white cable running from the router - you're using white in the kitchen.  Or, if you're needing a specific color to help hide a cable or match a color scheme, it's nice that you're not relegated to just one choice.

Even if you only seldom use this guide you will find the cost to be minimal for the information listed. By the way, all of the info on the card is also contained in your user manual, however why carry that manual with you everywhere you go? This is well worth the small price paid.

Attempting to add the sidewinder through the gameport control panel also fails in that state; however, if you first mate the adapter to the joystick DB-15, then plug it into the USB port, it will recognize it properly and, under Device Manager, it will be listed as a Human Interface Device.  In my case, I have a Sidewinder Precision Pro and it identified it immediately.
The earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use. However, after time the foam may rip or tear causing one to buy another one. At this price, that is a minor drawback to pay for the extra comfort these provide.

I have a somewhat heavy Hanspree 28" TV / Monitor that works very well with the VideoSecu brand. I LOVE being able to swing and swivel it however I want. The only downside to these are that the tilt angle is not great, but with newer TVs, the viewing angles are much better than they were in 2008-2010, so it matters a little less. I mounted mine upside down because of the position over the window, and under a shelf with my routers and it works awesome. Very happy with this swivel style mount. Exactly what I wanted, even if I did get a wrong, smaller version.
1301	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.

8370	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I have always enjoyed the old style ear covering headphones like these.  The new fangled ear buds and on ear design phones serve a purpose and are preferred by many, but not me...I still remember headphones off old being the total ear covering design like these, but much heavier in the those days.  These are exceptionally light and can be worn for hours with little fatigue...They are also very nicely padded and comfortable without any pinching anywhere..Like most headphones, they can be adjusted to your own comfort easily, and, once set they don't slip at all.  The phones have an excellent overall quality to them with an older style curled cord that at first is just fine being very up close to your device, but is pretty tightly wound and not much good beyond 3 or 4 feet.  Just a few days use here has already seen the cord stretch quite a bit, so don't be put off at its being very tight and resistant at first.  It will loosen up.  All together the make of these are excellent, the comfort and lightness exceptional..
2821	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Well, for 10 months it was great.....then the picture disappeared. So then the real fun began....I emailed the sellers, and they wanted proof that the monitor went bad? THey wanted a screen shot? Im not kidding. I said, its broken.....paleeeese. So they did send me a return label, etc. So I went out and spent 15 bucks, and had a custom box made, and packed it like there was no tomorrow. I shipped back(with their label thank goodness). They got it in about 5 days...and then the excuses began. For 1 month it was in order: 1) They monitor worked fine. 2) They had to wait for the guy to bring my exact video card set to retest. 3) They had to send to a different repair place. 4) Waited and waited. 5) They had to send back to manufacturer(this after they had it 3 more weeks) 6) They don't make my monitor anymore 7) They are waiting on manufacturer 8) I am apparently supposed to wait longer, but I called amazon as this has been going on for 6 weeks and 1 day. Now, they did offer me 100 dollars after 5 weeks, but I refused as I just wanted the new monitor.....but I got tired of waiting. Thank goodness Amazon got involved.....they will refund....sadly 4 days short of 1 year(thank goodness this came with a year warranty). I can only suggest you buy the extended warranty on this one.......get as long as you can get......its a great picture when it worked! But, if the warranty work is covered by the manufacturer....you might want to skip the monitor altogether. I think the warranty work is done by someone else though.....but check just to be safe.

7394	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great tapes, and reasonably economical.  There are still a lot of applications for cassette tapes, and Maxell's have been one of my top choices for quality and durability over the years.  For a time I found it more difficult to get high-bias tapes than normal bias.  These are normal bias, and now it appears that these are scarcer than the high-bias.  Not sure where this will lead, but if you need quality, normal bias cassette tapes, I'd grab some of these, while you still can.
8840	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Love this cover. Tried a few others but this is perfect for the price. Looks classy and works well. Has a nice feel to it as well.
2990	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Simply put, mine came in a box marked CD-RW / DVD-ROM. Not the DVD burner I thought I was buying.

2217	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Broke IMMEDIATELY upon arrival. I sent it back.
2565	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Not reliable at all.  Does not stay engaged in socket. Buy something else. Spend the extra five or six bucks
Im done with the Nook and am going with Amazons Kindle.
7205	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Delivered as advertised.  Works great!  The price was a little steep, but when you're buying a discontinued item, that's the reality.
3700	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	good product, good service!
8951	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This 50ft cable is flawless, snagless, no more kinks in the cable.

Unfortunatly there is no easy fix to getting an Analog/Digital Joystick to work in Windows 10 Architecture.
-Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature)
2988	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I have had about just less than a year but only used it once when I first received it. I tried using again on 8.1.14 and it won't open. It has been sitting on a shelf for a 8 months but that should have any impact on its ability to function. Waste of money in my opinion.  I have not contacted the vendor about replacing it. I just went to BestBuy and bought one.

> The included earbuds are adequate for listening to audiobooks.
2584	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I would buy this again.  The "crown" was a little bit "thicker" than what I had expected, but still a nice usb port at a great price.
8781	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I ordered the wrong thing I didn't see that this was for a radio not a moto phone :0/
6661	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good cable MG.
