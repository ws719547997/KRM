Among their standard glues this has a medium viscosity; it is around if not slightly thicker than water. While they say this is gap filling I've never had much luck spanning gaps. It does offer a little more time than their super-thin glue which can make all the difference in lining things up.

I then noticed that the sink had a very small hole in the back inside which did not go entirely through the sink. It was likely just a bubble in the granite mix that came to the surface and remained unseen until it got to me. The hole was about a quarter of an inch in size. I didn't want to take out the sink and replace it for two reasons: one it is a lot of work and two it seems like such a waste of materials in the environmental sense.

6104	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I'm an electrical engineer and very particular about secure wiring and strain relief.  These guys are perfect for routing LAN, 1/4 microphone/instrument and coaxial cables.  I recommend drilling a small 1/2" depth pilot hole to prevent cracking and excessive screwing force (people have been commenting about stripped screws).  Just wrap a piece of electrical tap around your drill bit to ensure precise depth.  I would also recommend a nut driver over a Philips head, as it just works better.  100 of these guys for 7 bucks is a great deal!  You can always use more anyway, *wink*

5362	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Its a nice system but putting the parts in a kit would be better because this isn't all youll need. To install a door on a trolley system you need the track, hanger brackets & roller assembly for the key components and then likely the sliding bumper, stay roller, end cap and a handle. I originally purchased enough parts to have a door system that closed in the center of the doorway and when I made the doorway smaller I had some extra parts. I never thought Id use them again but I decided it was time to expand my 2-car size garage that only had a single wide overhead door so I could actually get my Ford Expedition in for the winter. I found a used single 8 high x 7 wide solid steel door that lifted up and over the vehicle. However, though I could barely get the vehicle in the garage I couldn't walk behind it to get out of the garage. Something had to give so I decided to take the door off the rail system, remove all the overhead hardware and install the door outside the garage rather than inside and that gave me 9 more of floor space: 6 for the wall thickness, 2 for the door thickness and about another 1 for the tracks holding the door a little more inside than needed. Since my opening was 8 wide I used two 8 sections of track you can use less by setting the rollers in farther 2 at each end of the door and setting the track back on the closing side but my door weighs about 250-pounds so I wanted the rollers close to the ends for a smoother roll. With 2-sections of track you need 3 hangers at the minimum one at each end of the track and one in the center that joins them together make sure the center one has 2-setscrews on it or it won't work for joining 2-rails. The instructions call for a hanger about every two-feet but thats overkill and theres no way the rail will bend unless you're using it to roll an auto engine across it. I had to go with a larger stay roller because the 44140 allows for a 2-1/4 max door and mine is 2 so it was too tight for an easy the slide. The tracks plus the door are a lot of weight so this has to go up with lag bolts into studs or with carriage bolts and large washers into the sheathing. Once you start rolling the door open theres a lot of momentum heading toward the end of the rail so I just drilled mine out and used a lag bolt with the end cap. The rollers are enclosed from the weather so they stay lubricated and you can hang a door almost flush with the exterior wall and I used some garage door rubber side seal screwed into the door for a draft free closing. If you don't use the bumper and stay roller the door will swing out at the bottom and I added a boxed end on the closure end to keep the weather out on one end and the rail does a pretty good job on the top. The cost adds up fast with all the parts but not having a door inside the garage gave me the added space, I now have ceiling hooks over the vehicle, I don't need a garage door opened and theres no chance a spring is going to snap but this industrial look may not be aesthetic enough for some but when the hardware is painted it looks pretty sharp. Lastly, the hangers added enough additional height so that I could mount the rails right over my overhead door next to it. I did buy some parts at the home centers and their pricing was pretty good but were hard to find because they were in the back of the store with the doors & windows in one and with in the fence aisle at the other. Since this is like a giant erector set its a pass/fail so it gets 5-stras and since you cant do it with just one part Im using the same review for all the parts. Also check all the hardware variations shown on Amazon because National and Stanley are both interchangeable.

It saves us the task of using our house vacuum proper which is the size of a small car engine but barely picks up bird seed, so here's a tip, if you want a vacuum to actually suck then get rid of all the filters, including Hepa and the like.  On the Flair there are two filters, one each side of the main body, remove the plastic filter grills, unhook the foam filters, throw them away and replace the grills. Do this with all your vacuum's and they will then perform as anyone would expect. The Flair's don't last forever but for the money, ease of use and for having a power head, which is perfect for cleaning stair carpet, they are indispensable.

Having said that, these are about 1/2 the price of a Type II and are ideal for bulk storage of gas. If you are filling something that has the fill spot on top, then this works great.

Stethoscope, Black Tube, 28 inch, 2201. After some research I learned the technical reasons why this unit is considered as the "standard" by most medical personnel. Aside from the high quality of components, it faithfully transmits key sound waves to the ears from the patient. While I am not skilled at descerning the differences in verious organ sounds, taking blood pressure is so much easier than with the "cheap" units I previouly used.

It IS also the same item that can be purchased under the Ace brand name (ACE 44411 or G01A-534) at a local Ace Hardware Store for $30.  However, I do NOT recommend the White-Rodgers/Ace product.  Due to needing an immediate replacement over very cold winter months, I have used that thrice on my Grandma's heater.  One lasted all winter, the next winter needed replacing twice. The metal on the end of these expanded with heat and I have to take out the whole pilot assembly portion and cut the end of the thermopile off with my dremel to remove it from the pilot assembly. This makes what would of been a 10 minute job a (insert word for a nasty female dog); at least I removed rust at the same time and learned what to do the next time it would not pull out.  For the same price, buy this Honeywell one; I have not seen any thermopile metal warping in any of our heaters with the Honeywell.  Oh, these generic thermopiles do come with a push-in clip, PG9 adaptor and 7/16" nut -adaptor and nut are both brass.

 A dust mask or respirator is also key, as the dust masonry cutting puts off is pretty impressive.
It has an offensive smell when wet, it can be a little difficult to mix, it dries to a very visible dark color, and it takes a long time to set relative to most other adhesives in the home (24 hours+...the 15 hrs is only for very small quantities). So why choose it? It's stronger than most riveting, it has the highest strength bond you will find on any home-use product, the bond can withstand prolonged heat as well as major fluctuations in temp (this last part puts a lot of strain on many bonding agents), and it is very, very durable. Application-wise, you can use JB Weld on most any surface that an epoxy will not damage, and if you prep the area correctly, it will work better than you can imagine. This product is appropriate for some of those so-called "mission critical" applications in which failure of a bonding agent could result in injury or financial loss...it's performance is excellent, as is its longevity and consistency. So it's uses are endless, and it takes over as a general repair tool when a standard glue or fast-set epoxy is not appropriate for whatever reason.

7259	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I am using this as a printing surface for my 3D printer.  I saw the name brand poly printing surfaces and did a bunch of reading and ended up here for $5 instead of there for $15.  Overall I am very happy with it.  I cut it using a metal straight edge and initially cutting with an XActo knife blad.  Then I reversed the blade and scored over and over making sure to cut fairly deeply in the front and reverse sides before trying to bend and snap. I am holding it to my print bed using binder clips and it is working fine.  I read where people said they could print PLA with no heated bed but I could not.  I tried none, and then low bed temps and always got curling and failure to stick.  I went back to the 55C bed temp that I had been using for blue painters tape and it sticks fine.  I was worried that I would not be able to get the part off the bed when finished but so far it has been easier than painters tape by far.  I haven't tried ABS yet but PLA works great.  If  you have trouble getting your part to stick just up your bed temp a little and make sure the nozzle is pressing the bead into the surface.  if the bead is round the bed is too low.  If the bead is flat then probably too high (you don't want the nozzle to hit this surface).  If the bead is oval and flattish but not completely flat then it should stick just fine.  If you still have issues just clean the surface lightly with alcohol and then dry completely.

If they could improve on one thing, it would be to make the reclaim tank about 20% larger.  As-is, you'll fill up the reclaim before you're out of water every single time.  That gets you out of sync because sometimes you'll empty it and not add more water.  I have yet to find a machine that doesn't have this minor problem so I'm not inclined to complain too loudly.

835	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This a great value for the price, especially when compared to those with the flexible spout (Type II). If you need to fill side opening tanks (e.g.; cars and trucks), you may be better served by a Type II can (I love my Eagle Type II) because with this one you will typically have to put the funnel into the tank opening and then pour into the funnel. Type I cans, like this one, don't have a second opening so the thing is going to go glug-glug-glug and possibly splash a little unless you pour very carefully. Type II cans have a second opening (for filling) that is partly opened when you operate the valve, allowing for a smooth and fast flow through the spout.

Second thing you need to know. The box states the bike fits children between 25" and 38" tall. My daughter is two years + 3 months old and is tall for her age at 36". I had to put the seat at it shortest setting and she just reaches the pedals enough to pedal all the way around. The box also states, "Ages 3 and up". I haven't seen many 25" tall kids that were even two years old so be forewarned if your child is under 35" tall the "trike" will be way to big.

I would like a longer version of this hook too. But these should hold quite a bit of weight and really just great hooks themselves all the way around. Very handy in garages and storage sheds if they have open beams made with two by fours. Just make sure your beams aren't so old that they predate the newer measurements. Or be prepared to hack out a few notches. The metal is too firm to try to rebend to fit anything but what it is. Also two together could hold a bike up or even one a wheel on a bike off the floor for winter storage. The width of the metal is solid and good to help prevent cutting into a hose or many items you might want to hang from them. But slip a section of hose over the hook end and that would help also if you are worried about that.

2139	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I'm kind of surprised these got such high star ratings. For the utility, these are going to work for me just fine. The fit and finish is what has me struggling to even give these a 2 star rating. Some pits from rust, hammer marks, polish is very poor, teeth on self locking mechanism are uneven and jagged, hinge area is sloppily constructed, and it's not really straight either. The teeth at the end don't fit snugly together because of the uneven thickness of the metal so there about a 1mm gap in some areas of the teeth. These look as if a high school student made them in metalshop. Mine have a stamp on them saying Pakistan so I assume that's where they are made.

5405	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I for one can't figure out how 52% give this product a rating of 5 and 30% give it a 1.  Lots of possibilities come to mind, from user issues (as in following directions), and perhaps other things that we know happen in reviews.  For whatever it might be worth, here is my experience. I am framing a large bathroom mirror, and it required that a 1/2" x 1 3/4" strip be attached to the back of a 2 1/2" trim piece. I'm using the pre-painted wood that you can get at Home Depot. I had to run a 5/8" x 5/8" piece of wood all around the mirror to have a place to attach the trim piece and to work around the clips that hold the mirror to the wall.  The trim piece is too thin for attaching to the strip with nails or screws, so I opted for this product. I ran two small beads (about 1" apart) around the trim piece and held the two pieces together with strategically placed clamps.  Out of curiosity, and despite the instructions that specify how long the glue takes to set and dry, after about 45 minutes, I removed one of the clamps at one end and (without going crazy), tried to lift or move the strip from the trim piece.  Didn't budge!  I let the pieces set over night before removing the clamps.  With greater force, I attempted to separate two of the pieces. Impossible.  So, in terms of wood to wood, using a very modest amount of the glue,and applying well-placed clamps, Liquid Nails LN700 works like a charm.  And despite what some say, it does dry! Take the 1's with the proverbial grain of salt, read and follow the instructions, and assuming wood to wood, you will be delighted.

The main reason I'm writing this review though is because of Amazon.  I ordered a bottle and during transport the cap became loose/leaked and you can imagine the gooey mess...fortunately it was all contained in the box and this was the only item in there.  A quick chat with the Amazon folks and had a new bottle straight away.

Now with the bigger hose nothing gets clogged anymore. I'm surprised at the increased amount of suction I'm getting with the bigger hose. You have to be careful not to suck up your tools because they will easily fit down the hose. If you have a powerful shop vac that is still using the 1 1/4" hose, you are missing out on a lot of power.
2450	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I am restoring a 1977 Winnebago Minnie Winnie RV.  It didn't have a jack, so I ordered this one.  I have used it a couple of times as I have worked on the rig, and it is smooth and powerful.  You don't get a lot of lifting range with a hydraulic jack, but they sure work well otherwise.  Good product at a reasonable price.
Having said that, this is a great material to work with.  It cuts very easy and fairly clean.  The material does not melt when using a power saw.  Holes drill very clean.  If you will be screwing into this, make sure to pre-drill with the right sized drill bit.
Still, ya asked it to make hot water - and it does - just be aware that adding instant coffee, sugar, artificial sweetener, or creamer will probably cause a boil over.

I was a bit frustrated at wondering how the defective item could've been shipped in the first place not to mention I was concerned about what the condition of the second one would be. I must say the return policy is seamless. I want online, printed a return label and I received a new item the same day I shipped the old one back. The return couldn't have been any easier. Its because of the seamless return/exchange that I give it four stars.

For the price, this seems like a very decent device, unless low resistance accuracy is important to you. I personally think I'm going to drill a hole in the faceplate and add another terminal, with a 0.77 ohm (or 1 ohm adjustable) resistor to an existing terminal or maybe just buy a 0.75 ohm resistor like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CLAROSTAT-RW70UR750F-RESISTOR-75-OHM-1-WATT-1-TOL-Per-Piece/dp/B01D5D33HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CLAROSTAT RW70UR750F RESISTOR .75 OHM 1 WATT 1% TOL. (Per Piece)</a>&nbsp;(or six 4.7 ohm in parallel=0.78 ohm) and connect it in series when I care about low range accuracy, and know 1 ohm is the minimum resistance. Normal DVM's can't accurately measure much below 1 ohm anyway, so perhaps owning a meter than can measure in this range influences my expectation that 1 ohm at 1% should measure in the range 0.99/1.01, and on this device it measure 1.23 ohms.

The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go.

Why these vendors make a straight plug for an application where the outlet is typically behind the appliance makes absolutely no sense.  The widow air conditioning people have learned to use a flat, right angle plug and the microwave and coffee pot people should learn their lesson.  You may want to buy an outlet adapter so the cord doesn't stick out.  (I chose an AssorRite Vertical Wall Tap - 3 Outlet - UL Listed from Amazon for $5)

The casters have ballbearings and move in the direction you want. This is designed for one or two Rubbermaid Commercial  "Brute" Heavy Duty barrels, they twist lock at the base and stay in place until untwisted. One side folds up when using only one Barrel but still moves easy loaded or not.

9161	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	These connectors are far superior to the traditional domestic wire nuts. They allow easy addition or removal of Romex power lines from a junction box power system. I have made a habit of using the center of the three connectors as the 'feed' connection bringing power into the junction box and then the outer two connections serve as a means to distribute power out to various loads. With this consistent connection method, I can easily remove a 'load' wiring connection without constantly going back to the circuit breaker panel to shut off that circuit breaker branch. Another benefit is that each Romex wire is held and connected independently unlike wire nuts which can easily have one or more wires slip out during assembly. I will be using these in a speaker installation of a sound system for a church that is coming up soon. A great improvement of the old school method of wire nuts!

I finally tried ABS.  It sticks so well with 80C beds that it basically ruins the bed.  I had extra so I cut a new one.  Be careful and do tests starting at low bed temps if you do ABS cause I have not found a magic number that works yet.  If you make a mistake and get the temp too high the bed piece is probably ruined.  Still love it for PLA though.

JB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.

Watch out for some of the negative reviews because many complain about how it falls or tips.

I have found that these 40 gram units work very well. I check the indicators on them frequently, and find that in summer they will need "recharging" about every two months, in winter only about every four months.  This refers to items kept inside an air conditioned house. The recharge is really just drying the silica gel, done in an oven set at 300 degrees for 2-3 hours.  No odor, so your wife won't get mad..I stick mine on a cookie sheet and let them bake while I do other chores.

Or perhaps I stumbled upon use number 1002. My model is an older version that has not been made in so long that it's impossible to get parts. When the boiler became pitted and corroded on the edges, it became impossible for the gasket to seal it because there was no longer enough metal to cover it.

I got some "no-Name brands  too and I will try and keep track of how they compare to the Krazy brand.  I tape the little nozzle into a duct tape fold ( tape around the end of the nozzle to seal the end from air- you need to be able to pull on the ends of the tape and the nozzle will come free for the next job.) and the glue seems to  work well a month or 2 after it has been opened. You just yank open the tape fold and the container is read to go for the next job.  I find that I don't need too much quantity but just want it for those many little jobs around the house and garage.

Our house had windows and doors from the 80s with thin frames and shoddy locks (original and aftermarket type). I wanted something more significant that wasn't a wonky hack. I got some of these bars and cut them down to size to allow secure venting. I plasti-dipped them to stop the rust and put some 550 cord around them in loops to aid in lifting. I know it's overkill, but I find 2x4s tacky in this application and the metal bars fit snugly in the tracks, looking very sleek. Now I know that crooks would certainly have to break the windows or doors to gain entry. I'm sure if your project calls for sturdy, heavy dimensional steel bars, these should work for you too! These aren't stainless so prepare to deal with oxidation somehow.

I thought they were the most feasible application, but over the years I noticed I had become a bit more sensitive to formaldehyde, fiberglass and the overall accumulation of unknown particles. I would put a foam strip on the nose piece to keep my breath from fogging up my goggles, and even an extra wrap to hold it on more snuggly. I have tried every type of mask on the market.

6159	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.

The Neiko seems to get decent reviews, probably mainly because it is the cheapest one and soo many more people have bought it, but compared to all of the other calipers in the roundup it actually scored low across the entire data set. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.

I was able to produce accurate, clean holes in 3/4 fir plywood with each of the 4 drill bits, as long as I drilled it to the maximum diameter of the bit. So if you live with 1/2, 7/8 or 1-3/8 holes, you are not really constrained as to thickness of your wood. The bits all cut quickly and cleanly through the material.

2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is "repositionable" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or "reposition" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.

Use this with a very light touch and make several passes though, and you can get a finished surface out of it with a little practice (I "practiced" on a ceiling joint that used to separate two rooms before moving on the more visible wall joints). I still followed up with a 320 grit sanding sponge to soften things out, but that was more like a swipe here and there across the surface. Use the sanding screen with a vacuum of some sort and you have virtually no dust at all.

Both the infeed and outfeed bases are aluminum stock and there is enough flex in them to cause them to bow a bit between the four bolts that hold them down. No fault of this dial indicator. The jointer just has too-thin aluminum bases. However, I have to move the base of this dial indicator back and forth on the outfeed base to zero out the blades. Have to account for the base's unevenness. It gets four stars as there is no way to zero out the indicator itself. Instead, you use the fine adjustment screw on the arm to zero out.

Well, this appliance has let us down. It has been steadily going down hill since we started using it and my wife finally asked me to send it back; sadly, 1 day after the 30 day return period expired. It seemed to take longer to reheat and warm things and pop popcorn the first week we used it, and now it is definitely running out of power. It now takes at least 3 times longer to pop popcorn than when it was new and NEVER pops without leaving a large amount of unpopped kernels (it doesn't even have the power to burn the popcorn, no matter how long you let it run). The wife complains that it can't even soften a stick of butter in a decent time. Reheating food in either plates or bowls is frustrating. What a disgusting letdown. Good old foreign and cost saving manufacturing at work!!!

1282	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I have owned several Hoover carpet cleaners over the years. All were very similar to this model. One had the Clean Surge option, which just floods more water out for tougher stains, and one had attachments for upholstery.  As for power, suction and body build, they're all the same. This "commercial" unit is no different, sadly. The only difference with this model is the addition of a few stickers slapped on it that say "commercial," and an orange power cord instead of the black cord. Everything else is completely the same. So. I feel that this product is a bit misleading. Yes, it works very well and really gets the dirt out of the carpet and does not leave them soaking wet, BUT, so do the other non commercial models. So, if this model is higher price, do not fall for the gimmick.. buy the cheaper model. I do give this unit 4 stars because it does work very well and is actually good on hard floors, as well (so are the other models). The performance is great, it's just that it is no difference in power etc from the non commercial units.

I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products.

Many people say ArcticSilver 5 is best.  But what does "best" really mean?  Some people change their compound every year or two.

Unfortunately, this microwave comes with a few annoying features.  The hardware tolerances are a bit too coarse, and the door fit, and the body molding, tend to be mismatched in different places.  The door latch makes a huge sound when opening and closing, and if the microwave is not bolted to the counter (mine is not) opening and closing the door always moves the microwave. The fan and the motor are very noisy. By contrast the finished beep is very low and timid, to the point that sometimes I do not hear the beep. I know that it has finished when the noise stops, particularly since the finished beep does not repeat, as most other microwaves do.

Like any step drill, it is a tremendous cost saver when compared to purchasing individual bits of equivalent diameters. Yet, it has a few advantages over conventional bits as it acts as a nice deburring tool in certain circumstances. It can also be a great time saver when installing electrical connectors and switches in electronic enclosures or automobile dashboards. You don't have to constantly switch bits.

Because these cuffs are factory sealed and you cannot identify when they fail (all such things do in time) it's prudent to have a spare unit to test and compare when BP readings begin to get erratic. I check my BP daily every morning and keep a running track with the "Lose It!" app on my iPhone 5s. My old OMRON BP machine (HEM-780RELN2) was becoming very erratic and I have replaced it with  a OMRON BP791IT model that uses the same cuff.  Testing the old model with the new cuff isolates the failures to the BP machine, not the cuff, so I am able to assure that replacing it was a prudent action. Plus now I have two spare cuffs for futures use, as needed.

I have a Sperry (aka Gardner Bender) ET64220 that had no power to trace wires through drywall.  It was good for small telephone wiring kinda stuff.  Well why waste your time with the Sperry when the Fluke does it all.  Believe me it does everything.  I have no problem using the probe through 5/8" thick drywall to locate NM wires.  The tone (either continuous or pulsating) is LOUD.  Takes the guess work out.  I've also used it's continuity function and that worked great too.  The quality and reliability of this product has made me become a lifelong Fluke customer from now on.  Don't waste your money experimenting with other products stick with Fluke and you'll be happy.

Original review: So I drive a 15 year old F-150 I lovingly refer to as Shaniqua. Dont ask. Well one of her running boards has been failing at the point where it attaches to the frame. I thought what the heck, for $7, whats the worst that can happen? It freaking works!! I am stunned ! Put my whole 211 lbs, shut up, it is so 211, if I say it is, on the thing and it holds! Damn. Now admittedly, in normal use you aren't putting all your weight on because you're stepping up, but if it holds until spring, Im happy. (breaking down and buying a new truck).

This machine cleans very, very well. My son's apartment has old, cheap carpet. He also has a geriatric dog who occasionally has accidents. I took this machine there and cleaned the entire carpet. OMG, the dirt that came out of that carpet was scary but the result was astonishing. It looked fantastic - even in the high traffic areas in front of the door and near the kitchen. It looked as good as the carpet in the closets, which see almost no traffic or wear. There were a couple of old stains that I pre-treated with a spray stain remover and they came completely out.
The dirty water tank is what I'm most impressed with. The removable lid covers the entire top of the reservoir. That means when I remove the lid to empty and clean the tank, I can easily clean every area under the kitchen faucet. Believe me, the water is waaaay dirtier than one would ever expect and the tank can get very gunky. Being able to run water directly over every part of the tank makes this chore much, much faster.

4365	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I'll say that yeah, this tape does work but there are for sure much better tapes out there.  This tape is not the clearest tape and is definitely thinner than average.  It does come off the roll easily enough, but look out for static cling because this tape is so light it will double back on itself if you aren't careful.  Also note that when using a tape gun, this tape will have a lot of extra small little pieces coming off from the teeth on the gun.

So after receiving, trying and using this, I am VERY happy with this Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape 3850-6. It is User Friendly! It is STRONG, It is Tenacious -- I affixed a 10 inch length of the tape from a roll of tape hanging onto a fixed object the other day and the roll did not drop down to the floor from its own weight -- the tape stuck and even the exposed part was just as sticky as ever a few days later. I left a used roll of tape un-tabbed for a few days in a warm kitchen - the cut end of the tape was retrievable without tearing and without my losing any portion of the tape when I pulled it open. Bravo!

522	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This Irwin step-drill was reasonably priced and has lasted about the longest of any I've had in this size range. I keep a bit of this size in each of my drill storage cases and since this 1/8" to 1/2" size bit is also the one I tend to use most with my cordless drill, I keep one in the nail set holder of my tool pouch, so it's always ready to go. It is just the right size to make a hole in metal enclosures for the draw stud of my 1/2" Greenlee manual KO punch, which I will often use to make the hole for the draw stud of the larger KO punches, so it gets used quite a bit for that. With this size bit, over time I usually seem to end up snapping off the 1/8" tip then grinding it down to a new larger point so I can continue to use it. So far, this bit has managed to keep its tip, so not sure if it's just luck or if maybe there is something to the titanium nitride coating after all, but either way I'm happy with this step-drill and will buy again.

If i was going to offer ANY criticism at all it would be that the drawers and door open a little TOO easily, which was a little bit of a pain during assembly. I wish it took a bit more tension to open them, but on the plus side the drawers and cabinet all lock so that's a bonus. It also steers and pushes very easily and has locking casters on the back wheels. You could easily move a couple HUNDRED pounds at a time with very little effort.
Be absolutely sure to install the kit with the fill valve as perfectly vertical as possible.  If it is not vertical, the check valve will not work correctly and you will lose fuel, as much as 60 gallons if you don't notice the issue.
Silicon Glue:  Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  It is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier.  Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GE-Silicone-II-Household-Glue-2-8-oz/dp/B002J998DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 oz</a>

When wrapped with PTFE and tightened properly (not over-tight..) they never leak. The barbed shank is longer than some others and holds tightly to hose.

I actually used the Insta-Set in combination with this glue over a cut I had on my thumb, ( not sure it's "technically" recommended) and got really warm, then all of a sudden, the glue was hard. Stopped the cut from opening up and I could continue my day. AMAZING! I will never go without this glue or the Insta-Set.. It will always be in my tool kit. I can't wait until next time I need to use some super glue for something.

It was a copper pipe, filled with chlorinated water at 20 psi, so it wasn't a simple problem to fix. And it was on the bottom of a pipe inside a heat pump with limited bottom clearance, so I did the job standing on my head. But if you rough up the surface and make it super clean (with acetone if possible) and wrap it all the way around, it will patch the hole. Cure overnight for full strength and now I don't have to pay $5000 for another heat pump. I had the same problem on the input line 2 years ago and the first EP-400 patch I put on that side back then is STILL leak free.

Incidentally, for those who care, you can do almost the same thing with other products like this.  What damages left over paint the most is a partially filled can. To stop it, just replace the lid very tightly and then turn the can upside down. the paint will then stay at the top, and all of the skin and crap will be at the bottom of the can. Same with other wood finishes like polyurethane or varnish or ...???  Just fill the can with marbles (if its a small can..) or tightly close the container and store upside down. It won't keep forever, but it will allow you to store it for awhile ... maybe until your next use.!!!!

For those unfamiliar with that term, a squib is bullet that gets stuck in the barrel of a gun due to insufficient propellant (powder).

The 12" length is perfect to ensure that even super long handgun barrels (like some long revolvers) can benefit from its use.
The price of this durm is great and for another use it might be OK.  I will spend another $50 and buy the ONEIDA AIR SYSTEMS 17-gallon Steel Drum For Super Dust Deputy which is already drilled for the dust deputy.  I guess it's best to stick with a product that's engineered for that use.

Carter has been a big name in fuel systems for many years and they know what they are doing when it comes to building a fuel pump.  This pump comes pre-assembled with a filter on the suction side, a band for mounting it to a frame rail or body panel, 2 electrical connectors, and 2 hose clamps.  In other words pretty much everything you need to install it in your vehicle to eliminate vapor lock issues like the ones I was having.  I also ened up purchasing a few more hose clamps and 3 ft of 5/16 fuel hose so that I could install it in a little cleaner fashion than I could have without it.  You will still need to get a relay to power it if your car did not have an electric pump before, but those are cheap and easy to find.

I've seen complaints about the construction and it's true the soap and the recovery tanks are cheap thin plastic.  The good news is they are also cheap replacement parts, so I suggest ordering an extra set if you're worried they'll not hold up.  Most of the rest of the unit is pretty well made.  I'm curious about the motor however, it seems powerful, but it says 12 Amps of power, then on the website the breakdown specs list a 7.96 Amp (8) motor, somebody made a mistake maybe.  We might just be playing games again, motors have a surge rating and maybe that is 12 Amps, it's not unlike the promoters to embellish a little even if the explanation is lame.  If they all do it, then it becomes folly not to list it that way.  The unit glides well with the brushes running, I have no shag carpet so I can't speak to that, but the standard thick carpet and thin commercial types, and it works well on.  The tank sizes allowed me to do a long hallway, the landing at the front door, and the upstairs laundry room and a bit more to empty the tanks.  I have a mini Bissel, I used to use in the kitchen before I tiled it, and it took 3-4 fills just to do a 4 X 12 foot area.  This is perfect for bedrooms and smaller living areas, but when I want the whole house, Ill still go to the RD.

2062	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have two sets of these.  Simply put these are the best test leads on the market.  First thing that you'll notice is right out of the box, remove the twist tie, and they fall free and straight!  They have almost no memory what so ever!  The high quality silicone rubber jacket is flexible even in cold temperatures.  I've had mine in mid 30's temps.  Never does it feel like it's stiffening!  For me this is a huge plus as tangled leads, in cold temp leads to aggrivation.  Add in the dangers of working on switch gear and you have a recipe for disater!  Next thing you'll notice is the banana jacks.  Full length shrouds and smooth but firm fit in any 4mm jack on any meter give you confidence.  These aren't going anywhere.  Next is the probes themselves.  Long probes with a slight texture for extra grip.  Healthy finger gaurds to keep your hand from sliding forward and contacting the tip.  The tips themselves are the perfect length and SHARP!  If you need sharp tips for electronics, take a good hard look at these.  Finally the safety rating.  They are 10A rated on current and 1000V CAT III / 600V CAT IV.  Again, put simply, these are the best probes on the market for DMMs.

The other option is to use a soft start made by Dometic. It's approximately $370.00 dollars but it will lower your inrush or starting current much lower than this capacitor will.

4156	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love this tool. I'm no youngster and I frequently work alone doing cabinetry and home remodeling. The handle is well-padded and very comfortable.  The Gorilla Gripper allows one person to move 4' x 8' panels of plywood and drywall around the shop or work site without bending awkwardly.  This, in my opinion, significantly reduces the probability of a lower back strain and eases the load on arms and shoulders as well.  While the sheet goods don't get any lighter, the unique grip action and lifting angle of this tool makes it possible to get a firm, properly balanced grip on full-sized sheet goods.  By grasping the panel at the center of the long edge, you can easily carry a full size sheet by yourself.  Moving the gripper a few inches to either side of center causes the panel to hang from the gripper at an angle suitable for going up or down stairs. The rubber padding and nice wide grip distributes the gripping pressure allowing you to carry 4' x 8' drywall panels without damaging or marking the panel.  This is a well-made tool suitable for around the house/shop as well as commercial applications.  This is worth the price and has already gotten rave reviews from my arms, shoulders and back.  Recommended without reservation.

The big surprise was how good this caliper ended up being - it is a very good buy.  For those woodworkers on a budget, this may be all you need.  It is well built, sturdy, accurate, and comes with a nice storage case that works well.  It has all the locking mechanisms to hold a measurement, and the hold well.  Basically, it has all the features of the 100$ Starrett caliper I own, but for $70 cheaper.  I would like to say that the Starrett is more accurate and durable to justify why it costs so much more, but I am not 100% certain of that.  This caliper is well made, and I don't see it breaking any time soon.

5751	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	My door opener was growling and shuddering pretty often so I checked the carriage and it was seriously worn.  This is an older door opener (ISD990) and uses magnetic switches. My other door opener, also a Genie (H4000A), is newer and uses the lever type switch, it has no magnet.  Other than that they are interchangeable.  So I took the H4000A carriage (without a magnet) and glued a small magnet to it.  It worked perfectly on my ISD990 door opener with the magnetic switches.  Since they are so inexpensive I bought 2 of these replacement carriages, #36179R, and put one on each of my doors.  In a nutshell, this new carriage will work on both the magnetic switch openers or the lever switch openers.  You may have to readjust the location of the switches but that's a snap.  I could not determine any difference in the 36179R and the 36179R.S other than the '.S' is apparently a replacement for newer magnetic switch units, but, do your research first.

Gorilla Tape now overlaps the battery-netbook seam...and it's not going anyplace.
The Gorilla Glue Company makes many different glues, in different colors and container sizes.  The one I am reviewing is the 2 oz. size of the original brown colored Gorilla Glue.  This glue will dry out in the bottle, so I do not recommend buying larger bottle sizes, unless the glue will be used in the near future.  For most of us, we use a little glue, and put the bottle away until needed the next time.  This glue is interesting, in that you wet the surfaces, add a thin layer of glue, and clamp the surfaces together for 1-2 hours.  In the meantime, the glue will expand and turn into a hard foam.  After application, any exposed expanded glue may be peeled away or squashed back down a bit while it is drying, so that the repair is not so noticeable. This stuff will eventually dry as hard as a rock.  Overall, I would give this glue an Amazon rating of four and a half stars, rounded off to five stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.

Smooth cutting step drills - like these Irwin bits - cut plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase.

5188	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this along with the 1 gallon Eagle UI-10-S Red Galvanized Steel Type I Gas Safety Can. I filled them both with gasoline and placed them in my Florida Room (Den) for several days before storing them properly. The whole time I never detected even a hint of gasoline odor. I bought them when my lawnmower conked out on me and had to be serviced. With gasoline now containing varying amounts of ethanol, a form of alcohol that above levels of 10 % can cause major damage to engines because it attracts moisture (water), this purchase was an obvious choice. In some cases this new fuel type can even invalidate warranties for system repairs. I threw out my old plastic, vented gas containers for this reason. These galvanized steel containers have a perfect seal that drastically reduces exposure to moisture, meaning I don't have to make constant trips to the gas station to keep it fresh and I avoid engine repairs.

893	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.

Reading about aloe and other properties, I found this and this one has become my favorite paste. The gel is not loose, tastes a nice mint and leaves an extremely clean feel to my teeth and gums. I will continue to purchase this one and have passed on my used tubes to a friend a work who has other issues.

9915	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with the power supply. Two 0-30V outputs up to 5A each and one fixed 5V output. Very handy for working and testing micro controller based projects as you have 5V output dedicated to just uC only and two rails for, lets say, testing N-Channel mosfets in high switch modes/applications, which require, lets say 12V and, lets say, 10V above the rail to turn the mosfet on. Displays current as well. I have another single channel power supply of different brand, but I call it noise generator as it has huge amount of noise and ripple, when I attached it to my oscilloscope, but Dr. Meter is very smooth, which is a huge plus. I find this power supply very handy and would recommend to any electronics enthusiast or even professionals on budget.

4702	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I had a hard time finding this in stores and didn't have time to run to a craft store that I figured would have it, so I bought it as an add-on item on Amazon. I can't even remember what my original intent was in buying it, but I've found it quite handy for various small tasks around the house since I had some left over (e.g., gluing magnet bars to the bottom of my new shower curtain to weigh it down and help it snap/stick to the "lip" on the bottom of the shower floor, which just happens to be the right kind of metallic). The only downside I've found is that after repeated use, the tip of the bottle can get clogged with glue, but I've found that inserting a toothpick (or similar small disposable object) will work to clear it and make the bottle usable again.

Before you apply the compound clean all the surfaces and make sure they have no oil, finger prints, or dust on them.  Make sure you have removed the old thermal compound from the surfaces.  Some old compounds get rock hard and can be difficult to clean.  I have used Goo Gone and it is by far the best cleaning solution I have ever used.  Don't use too much and clean only the CPU and heat sink.  Then wipe all surfaces dry and wipe again with an alcohol swab and a Q tip if necessary to clean up the old compound.  Then give it a final wipe with  of a coffee filter as they are fiber free paper and you should have a clean surface.  These surfaces must be absolutely clean and even the oil from a fingerprint that you can't see can cause a problem.

First off, the instructions are not detailed enough. It seems like it should be simple, but they don't give any guidance on the recommended offset from the door to make the best seal. On the first attempt at lining it up and putting in the first nail, it seemed too tight so I pulled the nail and backed it off a little. That seemed better at first, but after a few nails, I had gaps in some areas, either at the garage door side or the trim side.
One review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.
Loctite Blue is the perfect product to make sure that there is a no slip connection between bolts and their receivers, and it is outstanding for use with firearms as the stuff withstands the beating and vibration without a second thought. A little goes a long way, so use sparingly.

1780	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	For me this is the best way to buy this type of glue. Better than the small tubes due to it being a bit thicker making it fill gaps and much easier to apply without making a mess or sticking your fingers together.
Gorilla glue was particularly effective on repairing my Ikea chest of drawers that had multiple broken joints. Where these joints had failed around the metal fasteners, chips of particle board broke free. Most were too small to recover and reattach.  The expansion of polyurethane filled the voids.  In fact, I which I used Gorilla glue when I first assembled it as the breaks probably would have never occurred in the first place.

When I moved into my new house, the first changes I made were to fix the water softener, and to install a Reverse Osmosis filter system for a tap at the kitchen sink and the refrigerator.  I bought this meter to see how well the filtration was working.  The tapwater is about 600ppm, and the water coming out of the RO unit is about 40ppm.  Having the meter allows me to check periodically for any deterioration of the RO unit.

I've been using it for a month, twice a day, and it makes my teeth glow (added bonus is the fluoride! so don't eat or drink for 30 minutes after using this).  I drink 4 cups of tea a day but I have orthodontic braces and therefore can't use whitening strips, so the whitening mouthwash is the way to go for me.  I don't think this stuff burns - only if I've recently burned my tongue on hot food, *then* this mouthwash kinda irritates the burned tongue.  And it's the most pleasant tasting whitening mouthwash I've used (Optic White was the worst!).  It foams up a LOT but that's the nature of the whitening mouthwash, they all do that.

One of the employees at Ace Hardware told me what he did to protect his outdoor faucets. He wrapped then  in a towel, covered the towel with a plastic bag and taped it down securely. I planned to follow his suggestion but had run out of duct tape and had only some thin tape to use, which I did. I wanted to get replacement tape and decided to try this Gorilla tape. When it arrived I was doubly pleased to see that it was weather resistant. I replaced the tape on my three outdoor faucets with the Gorilla tape and now have a firm and secure installation.

BUT THE BAD: The first set of leads I ordered came with a perfect red lead, but the black lead was warped, slightly banana shaped.  What the heck?  These are supposed to be top quality.  So I arranged to exchange them with Amazon, and Amazon had a new set here the very next morning.  Kudos to Amazon!  But when I opened them up, this time BOTH leads were warped.  In opposite directions, so it's clearly not an intentional thing.  And besides, I got ONE lead that was perfectly straight.  See photo.  Also, on one of the gray probes, the "grip ring" towards the front of the probe was sort of distorted/melted somewhat (not seen in photo.)

It is the perfect size for use with 1.75mm diameter filament and is way cheaper than the PTFE that most people use. The only difference between this and the PTFE is that this is less rigid which ultimately means it is more flexible and better for ninjaflex. However, most filaments (I primarily use PLA) are quite rigid and will hold up this tubing and prevent it from contorting.

The case exists, that's about all. It's a really basic blow-molded case. You'll have to take the base off to store it in the case, and everything rattles around because the molding is just a cavity, and not formed to fit.
It went nuts the day I got it.  After a few minutes, it worked flawlessly. Apparently I'd gotten moisture and a bit of debris on the scale, affecting the capacitive coupling.  It would probably drive any digital caliper nuts.

Manual stethoscopes work off physical properties, so materials and workmanship are key.  Unless equivalent parts can be tested to work as well and at lower cost, beware of copies or worse, counterfeit Littman parts or stethoscopes.

The quality of the hose is just OK.  Although it's fiber-reinforced (protecting against bursting), it is relatively thin and the ends are stamped steel, not solid brass.  You can easily deform the ends, causing leaks.  I found the hose lasts for about a year when left on a parked RV, then has to be replaced.

As the advertisements suggest, this tape will stick to brick and virtually any other surface. Be careful though, because it might just strip the paint upon removal. This was the painful lesson I learned when trying to temporarily hold some video cables to my wall and ceiling.

555	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	i first bought one of these back in the late 90s, on the advice of a friend who really knows how to shape wood. I was building a custom stock for a target air rifle using mainly rasps and scrapers, and my friend advised me that these bits easily carve through wood without excessive grabbing or tearing the surface. They cut very fast, too, using a light touch that doesn't load down the motor on your Dremel tool, and they last a long time. The price may seem high compared to, say, those little sanding drums that come with Dremel tools, but this bit will outlast dozens of the tiny drums and cut a lot better, too. Do your shaping with this bit, and save the little drums for finish wirk with fine grits.
6536	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this caliper to aid in my 3D printing projects. The display window is large enough to read the numbers easy, and it can switch from mms to ins. with one button. Very satisfied with this purchase.

6509	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I gave this only 2 stars because it was working well but now it is not. I am not sure if something is caught in it or what, but it constantly stays on and the counter runs through random numbers. When it is working correctly, the digital display is very accurate down to the tenths, but I do not trust it anymore because of the issues I am having. It still works fine using it as a regular caliper and not using the digital display.

I've used Sonicare since before they were bought out by Philips.  One thing I hated in over 15 years of owning them is the battery dying out, it lasts about 5 years, and I've gone through 3 versions already.  While a new brush will hold a charge for over a week, after 3 years, it will give about 3 days sometimes not, so if you travel with the brush you'll also have to lug the charger, otherwise you'll have a useless brush with no power sometime in your trip.  The brushes still use NiCD, so you get a memory effect and to revive it you have to recharge best when the brush is dead; to do so you have to endure the increasingly weak brush stroking and it dying sometime while you brush.  You can't just leave it on, all Sonicare's have a 2 minute timer, Quad Pacer or not.

2) This has a limited shelf life and you probably don't need as much as you think. PU glue foams up and you use a LOT less than other types of glue. 4 oz should be more than enough for most people, 8 oz is a BIG bottle - I can't even imagine buying the 16 oz bottle. PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two, a LOT is going to go to waste. Don't ask me how I know this.

For a company like 3M, which generally sells some of the best products, to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad. I will not be purchasing this tape again, or any 3M brand packaging tapes for a while, in the hopes that they correct this problem.

I decided to try this step bit and see how they worked. It was fantastic! I drilled a large enough pilot hole with a twist bit, and then started feeding the step bit in the hole. It cut smoothly and did not bind up at all. The hole it made was perfectly round and no burs left on the front side. It did leave burs on the backside of the metal, but I simply did a very light drill with this step bit on the back just enough to knock off the burs. Presto...a clean wonderful hole was drilled quickly.  I am now a true believer in step bits.
it flexes and it is way to easy to foul the tape.
5986	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works great. One note: This is closed-cell foam, so it has air in it, so it floats in the sealant. Therefore cram it down into the crack so it's held by friction. If you just lay it in, it'll float up and show above the level of the sealant.

So out of the box this was easy to assemble by myself.  There were only two screws that had to be put in (so you do need a screwdriver) and once that was done, getting this ready to run was easy.  I already have a carpet cleaner - but courtesy of the aforementioned dogs, the plug was chewed off of it.  This cleaner did just as good of a job as my old one, though it was a tad lighter.  I do think that it is made of a cheaper plastic than my old one so I don't know how well it will hold up in the long run - but I also don't see anything concerning about it.  On the whole I am very happy with the job this does.

The wood frame is bare, dry and smooth and thought that it would be good enough to attach a few pieces of the tape over the offending holes.

1717	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have a small woodshop so floor space is at a premium.  Used these casters to put wheels on a table and band saw.  They work well and the locks hold better than I expected.  Getting new tools so will need to buy more.  I like the locking mechanism, much easier to set and release than the rocker arm lock affixed to the axle of common casters.  And, it locks the swivel too.  I used two of the non-swivel casters on the back of my sliding miter saw and it stabilized the table very well while keeping it easy to move.  No point to using four of the swivel type, which makes the table less stable.

But, even after stretching it out in the sun for a few days, it snaps into a tight coil, especially when it's cold out.  It's usable but you do have to wrestle with it and getting it out to it's full length take some work.  I do not know if there are more pliable potable water hoses.

4280	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	One of the major problems with rolling toolboxes is that they are constructed of steel. Inevitably over time they get dinged, dented, and then start to rust, particularly if utilized in a damp environment. This product, on the other hand, is an extremely sturdy plastic; if it ends up sitting in a couple of inches of water when the garage or basement gets some water, it won't suffer as a result. There's no "give" to the plastic - I tried using the top surface as a ladder, standing on it (probably not recommended by the manufacturer) and there was no give at all. The drawers pull out smoothly and easily, even when weighted down. There are some intelligent design features here, such as the little indentation that will catch a rolling pencil before it rolls off the top, or the easily swiveling rubber-coated wheels. There is a minimum of construction necessary when the product arrives....attach the four wheels (a driver drill is a big help here), the handle, and the handy AC strip and you're ready to go. If you decide that the unit is going to be in a fixed position and will never be moved, you can leave off the handle and the wheels; the unit has an underside design that allows it to sit flat and firmly in position without the wheels.

It is plastic but seems sturdy enough to last if you don't abuse it or run the truck over it.  I like the idea another poster did adding sandpaper to create a non-slip grip on the panel as on an incline or stairs the sheets do tend to want to slip and that is a bit dangerous trying to capture an errant panel and not fall down the stairs yourself.
Well, when she took it to the Mercedes dealer she found out that replacing the little antenna would cost in the neighborhood of $500-600. Not only would the part have to be replaced, but the car interior would have to be removed in order to do so. Furthermore, the antenna wasn't used for anything in that my friend had neither a phone nor a GPS system as a part of her car accessories. The only benefit in replacing it would be cosmetic. The service manager suggested that the duct tape should work fine, except that we might use black duct tape since the antenna was black and it would be much less apparent. So, my friend went to Home Depot and asked for a real tough black duct tape. They gave her a 2"x12' roll of Gorilla Double-thick adhesive tape. I took the old tape off and applied the new Gorilla Tape.

I had a choice of buying another 25 ft. hose and joining the three together of just going for a single 75 foot hose. I opted for the latter and I'm glad I did. The original hoses were flimsy ACE Hardware brand (white with a blue stripes) and the end connectors, although kept in the garage, were beginning to corrode. The Camco hose has a much thicker reinforced wall and only cost $14 more than another ACE 25 footer. This is a nice hose and my only complaint is that it was covered in some sticky residue that I had to clean off before using.

Wife wanted the new box for sewing odds and ends, or it would have gone in the recycle bin.  If you're throwing the box around in back of a truck or trailer, the plastic might hold up better over time.  But the screws are a good product.

It filters bad air when we use bad stuff and we use a regular filter when we want to suck out dust and cwap, Yes cwap.  That way the fan itself will last longer.

I relate this because it also seemed counter-intuitive when working with heavy-duty mega-glue. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty -- even use your fingers as an application tool, if you want.

7965	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This was a shot in the dark purchase. I was looking for a lightweight rod, and this is a little heavier than I expected, being aluminum. It weighs about 5 pounds, I was expecting around two or three pounds.

2723	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	My desktop computer's CPU has been running pretty hot for a long time.  I finally took it apart and blew the dust out of the CPU cooler which helped improve the cooling efficiency, but then I took it apart again and put some of this goo on the heatsink and now it runs MUCH cooler and the fans run slower so the machine is nice and quiet.

8052	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I needed a "thick walled" piece of tubing to replace two leg rest bars on an exercise weight lifting machine.  It needed tubing to be 3/4" OD but thick walled, as the OEM pieces that "bent" were 3/4" OD but thin / standard wall thickness.  I looked at local big box hardware stores, but could not find any type of tubing or pipe that was 3/4" OD that was thick wall.  Standard threaded pipe would have worked as I could have cut out the non threaded portion length I needed, but the OD on standard stocked sized galvanized or black pipe (which are thick wall) were either too large or too small.  Steel conduit (for electrical wiring) was thin wall, as was metal tubing sold in another area of stores.  I found what I needed on various metal supplier websites, but with shipping the total cost was pretty high.  I ordered this : 3/4" OD, 0.53" ID, 0.109" Wall, 60" Length - and it appears to be exactly what I needed.  Good buy for $20 including free shipping.  It came within two days, and was very well packaged in a thick protective cardboard tube, with good plastic pieces inserted into ends so heavy metal tubing would not fall out - I have not yet cut this down to length, but am happy with product, price, and shipping.
7022	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	There isn't really much to say about a square of copper, is there? Very smooth, very flat, shipped in a nice poly bag inside a box. My wife uses these for some of her jewelry making projects and loves 'em.

5709	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This holds circuit boards in place well while I solder or desolder components in place. Given that it uses a vaccuum seal to hold in place, I'd be loathe to reccomend it for large projects, but it's absolutely awesome for electronics.

8983	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	First of all, kudos to Tool King (TK) for the way they shipped these nails to me; the nails were shipped in bubble mailers, which is normal, but what TK gets credit for here, is that they wrapped each pack of nails in packing tape so even if the package was ruptured somehow the nails wouldn't go everywhere.

3760	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this hose for our camper. We went camping this pass week and our neighbors our camping had the same problem. They said when they get home they are going to get rid of their too. Once you TRY to roll it up it has kinks in it and won't roll. So three of us will not be using this type of hose, the other people through theirs in the garbage. The hose is strong but the end was bent on ours in the first place. Thank God we had another hose to use.

2821	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It's been awhile since hooking up a computer. The last time I had to use thermal compound that wasn't pre-applied is close to 7 years. Back then I was told to put it on and spread it out with a pieces of plastic. Well this method is quite messy and really wrong! The best way to apply thermal compound is to apply a little dollop in the center and let the heat sink spread it out. Anyway, I used way more than is necessary.
I try to find multiple uses for anything I buy so I want to mention another beauty use for these that I have discovered when using them to hold creams on my feet. These are wonderful for applying and sealing in moisture overnight for the ankles (and, yes, feet!). I realized this when using only a moisturizer (and not the RX creams). When I removed the bandage and tape in the morning, the areas of my skin not affected by eczema felt wonderfully soft. I used to always just use socks over my moisturized feet, but this is going to be a nice trick for softening dry heels this winter.
6181	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased just about all sizes and types of American Terminal connectors and they are all of good quality and crimp well without destroying the  boot, as some lesser quality connectors do.  I have a habit of keeping an eye on the seam of the barrel, as the crimper's point needs to crimp the opposite side.... they are all aligned on the same side as they should be. The barrel takes a beautiful, tight crimp.
5935	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is amazingly strong and abrasion resistant.  It is indistinguishable from their Shoo Goo product, which I have been using for over 35 years.  You can bond just about any two things together and make a permanent fix.  Moisture resistant also.
Use them again and again.
6345	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It can handle fast movements without error. That is important to me because I use it so much that I am pretty quick with it.

6537	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	After having read some product reviews while waiting for the unit to arrive, I was a little nervous that I might have problems. Nothing could be further from the truth. The installed batter worked fine, I zeroed the unit once and used it to model an object for about four hours. Every time I picked it up, the measurements were consistent and it never required zeroing again. Well worth the money as far as I'm concerned.
2556	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff. Have been using it for years for random repairs around the house. Things have held up in some cases for years! Once opened, I like to take the black and red plastic caps that are under the spreader, and keep them in after squeezing all the air out to help keep any oxidation to a minimum. I've used it for plastics, metal to plastic, car parts, vacuum parts, holding up undermount sinks, countless repairs that have saved me tons of money.

Just install the magnetic strip along the back of the sink.  The problem here was getting all the "stuff" out from under the sink.  But that may not be a problem for you.  Then the hook "attaches" easily to the sink because the magnet is just on the other side.

For the second measurement I took a trustworthy (+/- a couple of degrees over the range) kitchen thermometer, which correctly read 32F in ice water.  I put them both in warm water.  The trustworthy thermometer read 118, and this one read about 110.

The double layer I had applied probably added 3/16" of thickness to the coating that was there.

Gorilla tape is for jobs that require a thicker duct tape; about twice as thick as the regular kind, and for those jobs that require the tape to have very little stretch. This tape is great for outdoor applications, where the tape will be exposed to the elements.

It runs quietly (even the beeper isn't too loud), has great power and power distribution, and the door opener has, so far, operated smoothly and with ease (although we are holding our breath on this item in view of all the negative feedback we see on the door opener).
No one likes call backs, from the Contractor to the client. They cost money and time. Most of my painters use professional caulks that you will not find at big box stores, and for a reason. Most of the DIY caulks will shrink over time. I had some crown molding on a project we did a couple of years ago, develop cracks between the ceiling and crown. It took a full year for that to develop, but it was in a home that had insulating, heating/cooling and humidity issues. Later I found out that the caulk used was not a pro brand. It really looked bad seeing all those cracks and pulling away caulking in an otherwise highly detailed and otherwise flawless job. The old caulk had to be removed and new caulk and paint applied. I paid for that trim finishing three times. The first time, the second to remove, and the third to fix. Needless to say we went back with big stretch.  *** It may be a little more expensive up front, but it may be much less expensive given time and circumstance.....***

Plus, the range of viscosities assures that I have the right type for whatever I'm doing. The only caveat I'd make is that these adhesives have a limited shelf life (2 years I think) and unless you're a heavy user, there's so much that you might end up throwing some out. I keep mine in the refrigerator to maximize its shelf life, but even if I don't get thru it all, I'll happily toss it and get another, because having it on hand is worth it to me. And it really isn't that expensive compared to the quantities you get in the piddly tubes.

Silicone Sealant is the best sealant available for most applications. It is far more resistant to drying out and cracking than latex based sealants, is more waterproof, and is more permanent.

Make sure you vacuum the carpets and rugs you wish to clean before hand. This cuts down on the hair and fiber that you will have to clean out of the brushes and the dirty water tank. To begin, depress the trigger in the handle while walking slowly forward. This releases hot cleaning solution onto the carpet. Now release the trigger and walk slowly backward. The machine will then suck up the dirty water from the carpet. You can clearly see the dirty water being vacuumed up on the top of the dirty water tank. I then walk back and forth over the same area again to make sure I suck up as much fluid as possible, which speeds drying time. Move over and repeat, slightly overlapping the area you just cleaned, until the entire carpet/rug is clean.

The old belt had rotted in at least three parts, which could attribute to the excessive noise.  I can't remember if it was that loud when I first got the belt sander, but the only way to really find out is to either buy a new belt sander, fresh from the box, or get a standard non-grooved V-belt and try it out.  I'll leave that test for someone who wants the challenge.  As far as I can say, this belt may be a little more quieter than the old belt, but again, that may have been do to the cracks in the old belt, or the stiffness from heat cycles over the years.  Nonetheless, the sound is not as SMOOTH as a standard V-belt.  The grooves definitely give it a different sound profile, like off-road tires on the freeway sort of thing.  The end result should not sound quality, although sound quality affects the overall work environment/atmosphere, but the real important factor is longevity.  It seems like a solidly built belt, and I hope it lasts as long as it looks.

423	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I don't install grommets everyday, so justifying spending hundreds of dollars on a production press just wasn't in the budget.  For those of us with smaller projects to do, this kit was perfect!  It has everything you need to get the job done.  The anvil portion, arguably the most important part of the kit, is very well made.  I'd give it 5 stars.  The wood block is just a piece of oak.  The cutter works okay, I'd give it 4 stars.  The grommets I'd say are not the best, so I'd probably give them 3 stars.  But again, the most important part is the anvil and this kit delivers a top notch anvil that will pound hundreds and hundreds of grommets.  I was using the cutter on some nylon webbing, so it didn't cut the best.  I suspect it works far better on leather or cotton.  Regardless, it did work, it just wasn't awesome.  The grommets are pretty light weight.  I've definitely used heavier grommets before.  That said, they were free and come with the kit and they work fine and seem to hold tight.  How they'll stand up over time I'm not sure, but I'll just have to see.  So if you want super nice top notch grommets, you'll probably have to buy those separately.  Overall I give this kit 5 stars because it delivers an excellent anvil and it's very affordable.

When using the product a little dab will do the trick.  If you use too much it will squeeze out from under the heat sink and make a big mess.  The proper amount is about 1  to 2 times the size of a grain of rice.  If you look on the internet there are several guides on how to use the product including photos.  Sometimes on a large CPU I spread the compound in a very thin and even layer with and old credit card like tool.  On one rough heat sink assembly I had to work a drop of the compound into the surface with a credit card and this filled in the micro abrasions in the surface and improved the temperature drop by 4 degrees C. The key is that you want a thin and even layer of the compound on the entire top surface of the CPU so that all the micro flaws in the surfaces of the CPU and the heat sink are filled with the silver in the product to provide maximum thermal conductance of heat away from the CPU and into the heat sink assembly.  Do not use to much compound, people tend to use too much or not enough and the science is to do it just right!

In fact, look closely at the side by side pictures below of the $100 Starrett caliper and the $30 Shop Fox caliper.  We live in an era where there are times where products being sold under different brand names at different price points are really made in the same overseas factory.  When you compare these two calipers side by side - it becomes clear that they are VERY similar in design / manufacture, all the way down to the screws.  Sure the knurled knobs have different textures, the face has a different color / appearance, and other finishing touches that distinguish them  products end up being.  And the kicker - look at the weight of the two calipers - near identical.  A one gram difference is negligible, and could be the difference of the type of knurled knobs used.

better choice.  For joining metal "J&B Weld" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick).  Some are packaged in a dual-syringe---but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.  Previously, a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored (usually white)---but now clear epoxies are available.

About 2 months ago I ordered a Hoover Steam Vac Spin Scrub.  It works well, too. But, it's priced better even at Amazon. AND it's actual label states 12amps.  I bought the Spin Scrub for the mother-in-law. That model has a hose and attachments for cleaning stairs, furniture, etc.. Now maybe more power is needed (12amps) when hoses and attachments are added. Maybe. This new C3820 Commercial states 12amps in the Hoover information, BUT it's actually only 7.9amps.  The two seem to work equally well. They seem to be the same weight, but I didn't check that out. This C3820 has an orange and maybe longer commercial grade cord. Everything else seems the same, again, but this one lacks the hoses and attachment tools.  I've had several Hoovers over the years and wish to point out something important.  The Spin Scrub came with a plastic tool to clean out the take up shoot, the C3820 did not. In time the shoot needs cleaning. Also, Hoover now has a small clear plastic window to the right side on the front. Once in a while you need to snap that window off and clean the screen filter right behind it..Hoover got smart and makes it much more accessible.

I know I will use it for many other purposes around my home, for example: moving wood, heavy bags of dog food, poultry grain, and other heavy bulky items.  A real find! Highly recommended for anyone who owns their own business and needs to move equipment back and forth to various venues as it cuts way down on multiple loading and unloading trips.

So I had to grind out what I could and then tap the threads back to normal with this. It worked flawlessly and easily. It never binded and I was never concerned on it breaking. The tap seems of high quality and very sharp. I was even able to put test threads in a block of wood to be sure I had the right fitting before using this tap and it gracefully threaded a 2x4 as well.

Won't do it due to the small size. If you're looking to move something that will either fit on the tops, or in the recessed section, it should be ok. If you want to use it to move something else, look for something else. I'll probably end up getting a furniture dolly from HF at some point.

"RTV" stands for "Room Temperature Vulcanizing".  People don't realize it, but all silicone adhesive/sealants that you purchase at hardware and auto parts stores are "RTV's", no matter if they say it on the label or not. (There are also specialized curing silicone's, such as the ones used in hobby and manufacturing mold making, but a two part mixable silicone is typically used rather than RTV.)


Naturally it is best to used up the entire cartridge/tube after opening, however, I was able to screw off the red cap and tightly cover over the tube opening with aluminum tape and cleaned out the red applicator tip and partially screwed the red cap back onto the tube.

I was guessing the size I needed the best I could because no one at my local hardware stores had what I needed.  I use this even though it was a bit wider but I had to cut it to make it a bit thinner which was a lot of work.  SO it was a good product I just ordered the wrong diameter.

6283	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I've had this Fluke NC tester for several years really like it. It's by far the best of the non-contact voltage testers that I've tried. I use it all the time for simple go-no-go voltage checks on receptacles outlets. You have to be careful with it just as with any of these type of NC testers, because they can give erroneous results under some conditions, but sometimes there is just no way to gain access to physically connect test leads from a multimeter to the wiring, such as when several spliced NM cables located in a damp crawl space are enclosed in a metal junction box that has the cover fused in place and is completely encrusted with rust and corrosion, so using a non-contact voltage tester is really the only way to verify that the circuit is disconnected. In a situation like that, you really do trust your life to the NC tester and I have had to do it in more than once in the past. You would always want to verify that the voltage is off with an actual meter whenever possible, but in bad situation like I described, I know that I can rely on this Fluke NC tester until I can otherwise access and test the circuit. I've owned a couple of different model Greenlee NC testers previously, but didn't like how the batteries in them always seemed loose and would rattle around inside, so that is what initially made me switch. I now have two of these Fluke 1AC-A1-II testers and always carry one of them in my tool pouch with me at all times.
so this is probably not optimal for use with the saws.

While I haven't had an application where this tape has failed, most of my applications have not been that extreme. In one instance, I did tightly wrap this tape around a slightly fractured [stationary pedestal] shaft of a high-powered 12v Caframo fan and there have been no problems since.  Other mundane applications include fixing and strengthening a cardboard retail box of a tool for which no hard plastic case was offered.  With several areas covered with this tape, the retail box has become a permanent storage box.

Over the past year I have ordered and used many different brass fittings. This is one of them. No Tru-Flate fitting has ever failed me. The threads are well within specification for NPT design. When wrapped with PTFE and tightened properly (not over-tight..) they should not leak. The barbed shank is longer than most others and holds tightly to hose. Once again, when clamped properly there should never be a leak. The hex shape on the exterior is perfect for use with a typical open-end wrench. Nicely machined and finished.

I've used the cheaper, $100-$150 steamers in the past and this definitely beats the socks off of them.  The scrubbing is better and the brush head is much wider (which means fewer passes).  If you're tempted by the cheaper ones and have more than a couple of rooms worth of carpet, I'd rethink and go with something like this.  Overall, I'm very happy and I love how clean my carpet is now!

1411	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	When I purchase anything tape related, the only brand I will buy is Scotch.  If there is one thing I can't stand, it's crummy quality tape.  Bring on the HD shipping tape from Scotch!  I routinely ship things from my small business that are heavy, so having a quality and strong shipping tape for the boxes are a must.  There is no doubt in my mind that my packages arrive safely and securely when I'm using this tape.  This tape also saves me time because I only need to use one strip of tape rather than 2 or 3 runs of tape with a lesser quality and thickness alternative.  This package of 6 rolls is neatly packed in a shrink wrap and it makes it very easy to get a new roll.  The tape is noticeably thicker than it's traditional counterpart but still cuts easy with scissors or a packing tape dispenser.
5195	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I bought six (I live on a farm with a lot of large machines.) of these from Woot.  The quality, fit, finish, etc. is great.  I agree with a lot of other reviewers that the valve handle/carrying handle/fill opening interaction is uncomfortable and cumbersome.  Note, however,that the ess-shaped valve handle is configured for a purpose: when fully retracted, it lifts the fill lid a bit allowing the can to vent thus increasing the fuel flow.  After some use, I expect most of these issues to disappear.  In the meantime, no more messing with leaky, dangerous plastic gas can junk!

The way I apply this onto a CPU is to clean it using a 2 part solution (both the CPU and the heat sink must be cleaned) Add a small dot to the center of the CPU and apply the heat sink over top. At this point you can be happy with the coverage or you could twist the heat sink slowly and spread the layer a bit better before locking it down to the motherboard.

The seat looks comfy (too small to judge for me) but my daughter likes it. She loves ringing the bell, lol. I like that it sits closer to the ground, so there's less chance of her taking a serious tumble over the top of the handle bars. I wish it had some kind of little storage bag, basket or attachment point on the back so she can carry some of her baby dolls.

I purchased a cheap in-line electrical cut off time which allows me to select in one hour increments how long I want this to run.  At the end of the time it cuts off the tumbler.  At the time I thought that I would leave it running at night and let it shut itself off.  However, I found that letting the brass sit in the water/soap/Lemi-Shine mixture for an extended period of time tends to dull the brass.  MOST but not all of this dullness can be removed by tumbling some more but there is a slight color shift so I stopped doing this.  However, the timer is still used to shut it off as a reminder to empty it.

Our house had windows and doors from the 80s with thin frames and shoddy locks (original and aftermarket type). I wanted something more significant that wasn't a wonky hack. I got some of these bars and cut them down to size to allow secure venting. I plasti-dipped them to stop the rust and put some 550 cord around them in loops to aid in lifting. I know it's overkill, but I find 2x4s tacky in this application and the metal bars fit snugly in the tracks, looking very sleek. Now I know that crooks would certainly have to break the windows or doors to gain entry. I'm sure if your project calls for sturdy, heavy dimensional steel bars, these should work for you too!

Update 11/04/17:  Last time I needed to replace one of these in any of our heaters was 2 years ago. All heaters turned on for this Autumn's cooler temps and are still working fine,  which I am glad,  seeing as the price has been hovering around forty bucks for the last six months (I have one under "saved for later" in my cart so see the price often lol). The past days of it being twenty five bucks appears to be gone :(
The machine came with several covers for cleaning and buffing, but we leave all those to the side and use the bare stiff brush heads on the tile. The spinning heads really get down into the grooves of the surface without any pressure needed from me. As long as the floor is wet enough (we use a cleaning liquid that doesn't foam up excessively), you can move pretty quickly across the floor and get great results. I can't comment on how well the cleaning pads or buffers might work, but for strictly cleaning a hard textured floor this thing is a lifesaver.

7715	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	The only potential issue is that if you wanted to use bolts as big as the bolt holes allow you could run up against the protrusion in the stamping--you're not going to get an unmodified washer under that bolt head (or nut), and you're not going to turn the nut or bold head on the caster side, so think carefully before you plan to lag-screw it into wood.
These are better than wire-nuts or any other connector out there.

This liquid electrical tape solved the problem perfectly. Each layer you brush on is about the same thickness as a single layer of electrical tape. I brushed on three layers about an hour apart. The finish is smooth and rubbery and as thick as the plastic insulation around 14ga solid wire. This made a difficult problem easy.

It's a simple cut the tube tip to a slant (larger or smaller) depending on the amount you will be need to squeeze out and VOILA really!  It was a good price and pretty easy to use.  Two weeks later, it's still there so I can't complain.
These are very strong and made with tempered steel which won't dull as you cut memory wire, and I've used them successfully on wire gauges up to size 8 copper wire without any apparent damage to the cutters. With memory wire or small gauge wires it makes a fairly clean cut. Sterling and softer metals might need some filing, but they do with any cutter. Thicker gauges will need filing.
1452	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I guess you do get what you pay for as the old saying goes. I use a lot of tape mailing packages out every day and sometimes I have to get the cheaper tape (Scotch is usually higher), but I always regret it later. The cheaper tape wrinkles up or you lose it on the roll and can't find where to start peeling again. It's so frustrating. Some rolls I have had to throw out completely because the tape splits down the middle or it has lost its stickiness. I have never had a problem with Scotch though, no matter how old it is and how long I have left it sitting around. These big rolls are great for my packages and make everything so much easier. No splitting, no wrinkling, very sticky. Love it!

The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).

I installed the switch in my project case and it functioned exactly as designed. The switch is a little on the "stiff" side in use...not at all like a wall switch. I like the stiffness of the action because it makes the effort to use the switch a definite one. You will never operate this switch accidently. The switch looks as good as it works. It is fashionably commercial looking, adding a bit of flair to a visible mechanical project.

The bit fits standard 1/4 hex drivers, but the shank section before the groove is a bit shorter than normal (see photo). This is no problem whatsoever in magnetic drivers.

The Gorilla Glue Company makes many different glues, in different colors and container sizes. The one I am reviewing is the 2 oz. size of the original brown colored Gorilla Glue. This glue will dry out in the bottle, so I do not recommend buying larger bottle sizes, unless the glue will be used in the near future. For most of us, we use a little glue, and put the bottle away until needed the next time. This glue is interesting, in that you wet the surfaces, add a thin layer of glue, and clamp the surfaces together for 1-2 hours. In the meantime, the glue will expand and turn into a hard foam. After application, any exposed expanded glue may be peeled away or squashed back down a bit while it is drying, so that the repair is not so noticeable. This stuff will eventually dry as hard as a rock. Overall, I would give this glue an Amazon rating of four and a half stars, rounded off to five stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.

7511	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I had a very cheap version of this tool (not of this brand) many, many years ago and it was totally worthless, fit only for the garbage can. So when I ordered this step drill in an attempt to cut a 1 1/8" hole in mild steel, my expectations were not high.  But I was absolutely wrong.  This little beauty drilled four holes through 3/16" thick steel and looks as if it was still brand new and untouched!!  I'm very impressed and would recommend it, especially for use in a drill press.

1912	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It is not transparent - it has a lot of white threads in it. The threads are arranged lengthwise and cross wise but otherwise not at an angle to the side of the tape. The backing material is clear, but it tape itself is not. Frankly, you won't be happy with this if you want completely clear tape.
I highly recommend this for 3D printing applications and will likely get more once I run out. The only downside is that it is slightly tacky and might not be good for long runs of filament. I use primarily 1ft sections and it works well for that.
4135	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It works well and is easier to use than running sandpaper along the edges of a piece of sheet metal to remove the burrs.

7414	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I love liquid electrical tape. This stuff works great. You wipe on with the self contained applicator brush and it dries quickly. The thinner the coat, the quicker it dries. After it dries, if you want a thicker coat, apply more and allow to dry. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired thickness. It is a little hard to maintain a consistent thickness throughout simply due to the nature of the compound and how quickly it dries (or starts to become tacky).
4806	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Great!  Works just like it should.  Good price and fast shipping.

No other two-sided tape I've seen (even the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3M-Command-strips/dp/B000BQYH2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3M Command strips</a>, which are great for posters) is this powerful. That mounted items can be so easily adjusted and removed on-the-fly is a huge plus. This is an extremely versatile, useful and inexpensive product.

3908	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Worked the same as the stuff you buy in the store.
5994	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Relatively good value.  Accurate voltage readings. Not high quality but it is workable.  I would buy it again. Nice paint job.

They do seem to hold up better/longer and the texture is nice. I think they're worth it.
Spend $10 more and get the iGaging EZCal which was the best digital caliper in the $30 and under group.

It ships in an enormous box and is about 90% assembled. I'm not sure how it was delivered - it just showed up on my driveway. There is NO way a human being can lift this alone, as it weighs probably 200+ pounds.

3181	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It does exactly what I needed it to do, and will surely do many other things besides.  I have a caddy hanging from my shower head in the tub, and it kept slipping down the pipe it is clamped to.  For awhile I wound tape around it, and the "bump" held the shower caddy in place.  But it was unsightly.  Made a "bump" with the silicone adhesive, and the caddy stays in place just fine, it isn't unsightly, and the caddy can be easily removed to clean it.
148	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	works great,exact replacement
7569	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I bought this bit for drilling tube socket holes in an aluminum chassis
1397	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Excellent packing tape but a overpriced.
9634	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Wow. I was not expecting how solidly this is made. I'm using this with an Oneida Dust Deputy for sawdust collection.  The vacuum did not even begin to collapse this container.  The top seals very well, yet removes very easy.  For my application, I don't even need the metal sealing ring.  I would buy this container again in a heartbeat and will look to Eagle containers if I need something larger.
332	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected. I don't have to move the vac as much now
5333	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I use this to seal all my accessories on my kayak. Works perfect. Take a little while to dry. Easy to use and remove from hands and skin.

7243	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This percussion hammer works well and was constructed with sturdy materials.  It can handle daily use.
These things are tough as nails and super-smooth.  Brake mechanism works very well and overall quality of fit, finish and so on is quite good.

4660	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	They are zinc washers.  Not much to say really.  Quality control in this brand seems to be very good.  No bent washers or washer with clipped edges in the box like with some other brands.  They suited my needs perfectly.
2057	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I do TV Repair and have purchased cheap probes up until now.  Nothing compares with this probe set.  Nothing.  Amazon pricing is on the money.

5742	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Fixed my garage door opener in 15 minutes. I'm so happy this was available. Make sure you keep it lubricated. I gets louder when it starts to run dry out. Needs to be lubed about once a year.
The heating is fairly fast with 16 Oz of water (*) and it's ready to operate in about 5 minutes.
2061	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	As for this model TL71, they still make them like they used to. The thick rubber like material that is supple to the touch and so easy to handle (work with) and bought at a very competitive price. Much obliged with this offering.
2358	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Nothing much to say here - easy to use, accurate, and convenient. Pleased and will buy again.
I have a 20 ton shop press at home and when pressing bearings on and off, this air jack makes short work of doing so.  Instead of repeatedly ratcheting the stroker, with compressed air, you just press a lever.  It does make quite a bit of noise when operating, but that is totally understandable.  The release is the same type as all other bottle jacks, twist of a valve to release the pressure.
2.  The FOUR different size tips is awesome, can accommodate many size rivets.
101	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	They work well

 3. It worked fine for us, so we recommend it to others.

429	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	Tried it on aluminum and a steel hole I drilled and does not cut. Seems the blades were ground flat. Had to return.
-Tall enough to accommodate another shelf.
3809	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Perfect
2338	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Work very well.  I used to use case lube that had to be wiped off.  This lube goes a long way and only requires a paper towel for application and maybe clean up.  I do not wipe it off so that the lube stays on.  Never had a miss feed so I love it.
5). Not a huge fan of the plastic snap-collars that hold each component along the four poles--they kept sliding out if not slid down level.
Other details and observations:

5908	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is the most amazing tool I have ever used and I'm 70, if you need to pull T posts this is the best tool you can buy just remember to get it a close to the post as possible it is a mule.
7687	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	If this is actually what you need, it's perfect. I like it much better than the rope style spline that I was replacing. If you don't know what size spline you need, then you probably don't need this. Check your size before ordering, people!
208	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I was going to buy this brush vac at HD but I thought $9 was outrageous for something so simple and cheap to make.  So, I bought two here and if the shipping is included you wind up paying about $3.50 per brush.  Since they don't last for ever having an extra is good. I can't see any difference in quality with the one that came with my Shop Vac.  I use them to suck up sanding dust before finishing furniture and wooden bowls-they work fine.
2509	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I bought each of my adult sons one of these Spinbrushes because they like the spinning brushes better than manual ones. I had previously purchased an electric toothbrush for myself but it made me dizzy - I have ear issues - and I gave it to my younger son. He didn't like it and went back to using these types of brushes.
9403	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I tried to like this center. I really did. It's big, it feels substantial, and it's exactly what I'm looking for. The first one felt like it had positive stops every quater of a turn. I figure in any production line there will be duds, so I had Amazon send me another one (thank goodness for Amazon's easy return system). The second one is better, but I can still feel the bearings grind when I turn it. Hooked up to the lathe, at slow speeds, it feels and sounds like a pepper mill grinding pepper- not the smooth, quiet live center I was expecting. Still hopefull, I called PSI directly, figuring they would find me a good one and send it to me, I don't doubt all the other reviewer have good ones, I'm just seeing some poor QC up the chain. Anyway, I could hear the technician's superviser talking to him in the background, and he basically said that's how it's supposed to run. Maybe it will get better with time, he tells me. He said if I wanted a quiet, smoother center I should look into their more expensive package (~$80). I was pretty surprised since they advertise it as a "smooth running" center.
5478	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Simple and fail proof system. No worries about calibration or batteries to mess with.

Summary:
6137	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	My furnace condensate pump would cycle on and off as water from the drain hose that carries water upward to a sink would drip back into the pump. I spliced this into the drain hose and the frequent cycling which would reduce the life of the condensate pump has ceased. I did need some fittings from Home Depot to make this back flow preventer adaptable to 3/8 inch tubing. This item offers heavy duty brass construction so it should last forever.
VERY handy for lubing the gear set on the sheet winches.
2598	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is a quality Loctite product.  I used it to seal my tub/shower faucet and tub spigot.  The clear color makes it almost invisible.  The tapered dispenser tip makes it easy to drop a consistent size bead of material on your workspace.  Enjoy!
7037	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is SO much better than vinyl tubing.  No kinks or permanent dents in the hose and far more flexible.  Love it!  Worth the extra cost.
Overall I am happy with the product and I would use it again.  On new construction I believe it would be easier without the soap film issues.
6202	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Can't get these any cheaper.. especially with Prime.
1711	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	These are really good strong casters. I added them to a Sears workbench and improved the versatility of my garage shop quite a bit.

1830	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	For Kreg pocket holes, nothing works better than Kreg's own screws.  Beefy head, and strong gripping threads.  Great for plywood.  Amazon had the best price I could find.
5273	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Have used this for years on all sorts of stuff, leather, shoes, even repair rips in nylon jackets. It can be washed and stays bonded and flexible. Just sealed an orange tape signal light repair on the unsecured edge

It has held up now for over 2 years saving me at least $100. I have used it for many other plastic mends and it has worked better then other types of epoxy.
Don't put it off...just GET ONE. Life's too short to work harder than you have to.

EDIT 9-8-2014:
1176	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	so far so good, working well.
I can't stress this enough:
Update: I have had this almost a year (I use it in the woodshop for accurate measurements) and am happy with it. I still think a Starrett is much better, but for the price and the use I am very happy and would buy it again, but it still feels like new so I probably won't need to for a long time.
6502	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works exactly as it should.  Auto turn on when you move it. Comes with a case and spare battery. Reads in metric, ASE, and fractions.  Piece of cake to use and read.
1313	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	At first I was disappointed at first as the adhesive didn't stick at all on one side of the shade material I was sticking it to even after I had cleaned everything with rubbing alcohol.
5334	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Just the best sealant for anything outside. I use it seal all my electrical connections for auto and trailer. Never a problem.
8527	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Very durable and is holding up well. I like the flexibility of this for any project that requires it as well., The price and delivery was very good so would highly recommend.
4068	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	"Gorilla Glue" has become one of the most used "tools" in our house. We have used it to repair wooden chairs, fix a wooden medicine chest, glue soles back on to sneekers, fill cracks in a wall, and at least half a dozen other fixes in the past month.

5134	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Ok
* It expands a *LOT*, use with caution or you might accidently glue your project to the table as it expands overnight! This happend to me :-)
2625	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is light and folds to small enough size that will fit in our vehicles compared to other models.  Can carry lots of items and rolls very smooth.  We have use it in snow where others would get stuck.  I'm sure if enough snow was around, it probably get stuck, but so far so good.  Best investment we have made when we go to trade shows.
It is a standard silicone-clear, which is like a translucent clear.
7806	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This was just incredible.  I use it to hang a windsock in the back yard.  Does great.
The process. I lifted up one side of the toilet to inspect wood damage and condition. The rot was in the past and little moisture was present so the leak may have been partly condensation gone wild. Good news. Gorilla Glue activates with moisture. Didn't know that, so the conditions here are perfect. What the glue was now to do is to bond with the bad wood becoming super strong, water resistant, and hard as stone. it will make a bridge so to speak with the bad wood and the good wood, and Gorilla will bond with porcelain like grout does but stronger bond.

3444	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works exactly as described.
2489	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Excellent.  It has survived several drops so far.  A bit complicated with all the memories (99 of them, come on) and various functions, but the basics do work great.  Will buy more.
8980	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	USED THESE TO MOUNT MY LED FOG LITZ TO REAR OF VEHICLE AS BACK UP LIGHTS. ALLOWS ME TO MOVE MY LIGHTS TO THE INTERIOR OF VEHICLE OR TO THE SIDE IF I NEED TO CHANGE A TIRE. VERY STRONG. I PUT PACKING TAPE OVER THE MAGNET TO PROTECT THE PAINT ON MY JEEP. THE ONLY HARD PART IS PUTTING A NUT AND BOLT THROUGH THE MAGNET. IT CAN BE DONE BUT IT WILL TRY YOUR PATIENCE.

1618	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Need instructions to fine tune the slide action.  Very heavy duty and did the job I intended it for.  Could not orient the vise to drill adequately.  But not sure if it was my drill press, the vise of me that could not get the right position.
General Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.
7793	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Outstanding rod, well made with fantastic ultra heavy duty cardboard tube shipping.

2376	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I have a German Shepherd who sheds enough hair to build her own dog every week.  I had gotten used to having hair everywhere, all the time.  Thought it was inescapable, until now!  I got this vacuum and I can whip in out in seconds and have the downstairs ship shape in no time.  It is powerful and lightweight, which I need.  It's small enough to stick easily in a closet or corner without being in the way.  The power cord wraps easily without any bending, which can cause me great pain.  Emptying the cup is easy, too.  I couldn't believe how much dirt it picked up!
FOllowed instructions, silicone lasted a few month before water was getting trapped underneath it and mold started popping up. Going a different route now that i have to redo it once again.

1015	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	great
6346	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	It works great.  I now own two of this model.  The first one is still going strong.  I measure to 1/1000 of an inch, and these give me an accurate readout.  The only reason I would buy a different one would be if I could find one with a detachable screen.  At times, it is hard for me to read the numbers when the calipers are applied.  That's no fault of the calipers.

Smooth cutting step drills - like this Irwin bit - cuts plastic sheet much better than regular bits, especially as hole sizes increase. I found it easy to produce clean edged, accurate holes with the Irwin step bits in my handheld drill. Trying to use standard bits often made a mess of things, unless the holes where small (say less than 1/4 diameter).
2351	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I tried this on some pistol cartridges and it did make a difference in how they cycle through the press although, with the right dies I'm not sure it's worth the extra step.  For rifle cartridges (which I don't reload) I think it's a lot more useful.  Hornady makes good stuff.  Some of it is a bit pricey but I've never been disappointed with any of their products.  Don't expect one of those big jumbo cans if you buy this, it is a small can.  I'm guess it's about 1.5" - 2" diameter and maybe 6" - 7" tall.

1451	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I mail out alot of packages and use alot of packaging tape. And sometimes I have fights with the tape -- it is either too thin, it sticks to itself when I unroll it, it has a mind of its own and wrinkles just as I am about to tape up the package, and if I should forget to create a little "tape tab" so I can easily unwind it from the roll the next time, I engage in the "battle of the tape" where I pick at it until I find a starting point, only to unravel pieces of the tape in an endless spiral -- what a waste of tape and money, eh?
6893	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I do a lot of repairing wiring around the house.  Using electrical tape is messy and tends to peel off, even if you cut it properly.  These really come in handy and shrink in a snap. This box has many different sizes and colors.  You can also cut them to size.  A single box can last you a long time.  Plus the price is right!

5987	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I was a little concerned it wouldn't work, but ordered it anyway as it was just a few bucks. Using to fill saw cuts in my patio before I fill them with self leveling concrete filler. The cuts are only 1/8" and this squishes down in there just fine. Get it started with the fingers and finish it with a flat head screwdriver. (I hope no one takes that last sentence out off context)
2606	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	For those of us who have no soldering experience and just can't seem to ever get those butt connectors crimped to hold, this is a fantastic alternative. Just place your two wires inside and squeeze down the metal clip which cut through the insulation making contact with both wires to complete the connection, then close cap.  Available in three sizes.

I also like that it folds up into a reasonably small and easy-to-store form.

2860	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	What I received was NOT what is pictured, not even close. The product picture clearly shows a thumb wheel adjuster. There's no thumb wheel on what I got. As if that wasn't bad enough I cannot believe what I received is a Brown&Sharpe. Talk about being cheaply made. I have an older Brown and Sharpe and I bought this because sometimes I need to have two calipers on hand and wanted a quality instrument. well I guess I'll have to look elsewhere. I am sending this POS back! For those out there who are content with second/third rate calipers and enjoy name calling GOOD for you I am glad you are happy with an inferior product and receiving something you didn't order. I saw a thumb wheel in the pictured product description so I want what is shown not a cheaper substitute the seller decides to send instead. I also own an older pair of B&S calipers that are first rate. These newer ones are a mere shadow when compared  with the older ones. In fact a pair of RCBS China made that I also own is a cut above.  So go ahead and be a cheerleader for junk. Buy a hundred pairs of these new B&S. You will need them. What I said is 100% true, ignore my advice at your own risk!

9631	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	It's big and the latching lid mech, keeps dust in--that's the good, the bad is that is awkwardly big, I bought it to use as the debris collector for a Clear Vue mini cyclone, and it just to big--my bad for not checking the physical dimensions more carefully, also the 'handles' such as they are, catch a ton of dust etc since they are simply molded in recesses. It is made of super tough materials and works well though, just be sure you really need this size.

According to Panasonic, there are no parts available, even if I wanted to have it repaired. Sorry Panasonic, you just lost my business.

At the time, I did not realize that it was a medium bristle until I went home and opened the package. However, since I was coming from soft or very soft bristles, I decided to brush my teeth more gently and let this toothbrush do all of the work. It does have a rather large toothbrush head, yet this is good because it cleans all areas of all of my teeth, even those hard to reach places in the back!

6348	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	My old Mitutoyo calipers were stolen a few years ago, and I wasn't going to drop another $150 for a new set.  These Neiko are decent enough, seem to be accurate when measuring known sizes, and were well worth the price.  They are a bit stiff out of the box, but were adjustable in tension, and they loosened up after a few days of use.
Because cell phones and microwaves are in a much higher frequency range, this product does not measure EMF (RF) at those frequencies. You would want a separate meter for that.
superb price
Before getting this caliper, I used to take measures with a plastic measuring tape, not I finally have precise measures :D
 - For something described as "unpolished", the finish looks really nice to me!  I was expecting that I'd need to work on the finish before using it in my project, but it looks great as-is!  So, I'm quite happy with the item ;)
5094	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Used these on the front hubs for my 01 Excursion 4x4 vacuum system. They fit perfectly and allow the use of the stock size vacuum tubing.
Silicon Glue:  Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  It is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier.  Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GE-Silicone-II-Household-Glue-2-8-oz/dp/B002J998DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 oz</a>

On review claimed that these bits cut in two directions. To test this I tried making holes in hardwood by running my drill in reverse. It worked poorly, cutting action much slower and the quality of the hole was not as good as running the bit in a normal (clockwise) direction.

Not a big deal, but not what I was expecting.  The vice itself is serviceable, with a fairly smooth action and not very much back lash.  The base is not tall enough for the lower cross slide handle to clear, so it must be mounted up on another sub-base to function, which was easily done, but inconvenient.  Still, it's a pretty good value considering the price.

I just removed the old belt and installed the new.  If anyone has the same application, the old belt is a standard non-grooved V-belt.  Like all things imported, the belt was probably low quality to begin with, but it lasted about 3 years of every-day use.  Yes, every-day use, maybe minus a weekend here and there.  I just got this belt so it's hard to tell if this belt will last over 3 years... maybe 5 (?), or not.  We'll have to see.

The Achilles Heal of this instrument is that the design is HIGHLY INACCURATE for LOWER EMF readings.  The accuracy is not 4% of the displayed value (+ 3 digits) but rather THE ACCURACY IS % OF THE VALUE OF THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT RANGE (4%x200mG = +/-8mg (+ 3 digits). Since the vast majority of the consumer use of EMF checking is in the single and low teens mG, this is unfortunate.

To get the furniture into the dollies I used a scissor jack, a 4' pry bar, and some wood blocks.

I like the right-most one, which has long steps -- it helps get nice straight holes, even through a fairly thick piece of fiberglass. The only minor thing is that I wish that there was more variety in sizes. The bigger one is, if I recall correctly, 3/4" at the largest. If the set had a narrow, medium, large one, it would be slightly more versatile, than the current set which has 2 narrow ones, and a medium one.

5720	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is amazing. Got it installed to eliminate outdoor smoke getting into the air conditioned rooms and lingering forever. It not only did a great job of that but it also reduced the amount of outdoor noise that came through which made the bedrooms more sleep friendly. Also is a dead guarantee that no ants or tiny bugs can crawl through depending on the type of windows you have etc. It also peels back off after years of installation without taking the paint off the surface it was stuck too which is a big plus. good stuff I highly recommend it except for one small thing. The surfaces you are sticking it too must be totally free of dust or it will be a pain to install and it also may require you to use some sort of finger pressure or roller to squash it down and close the window before it re-expands fully. I was unable to fully close my windows all the way to the point that they needed to be to lock them before i figured out that technique.

8239	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this rod to use as a squib rod, primarily. For those unfamiliar with that term, a squib is bullet that gets stuck in the barrel of a gun due to insufficient propellant (powder). At 0.3125" diameter, this rod will work perfectly in any 9mm, .38 Special, .357 magnum. It will also work fine in larger calibers like 40 S&W and .45 ACP. The 12" length is perfect to ensure that even super long handgun barrels (like some long revolvers) can benefit from its use.

That's good customer service.  These are good pins.  Will not work in older metric pin guns.

7725	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I wasn't crazy about the olive green color, but I didn't buy it for the color.  I've used plenty of duct tape over the years, and this stuff is outstanding.  It's really strong, but is easy enough to tear cleanly.  Some cheaper varieties of tape are hard to tear without getting strings or strips, but not this.  The adhesive sticks GREAT, but the odd bit is that when you have to remove a piece, it peels off cleanly.  It reminds me of a post-it note, but with bigger 'teeth' to hold on.  I carry it in my truck every day, and wouldn't be without it.

When you pull out your thermopile, if the metal is stamped with Q313A (ignore the next 4 numbers = production lot # or something that is not model # related) or was a generic one with a tag on the wire of White-Rodgers G01A-534, G01A-332, G01A-502, G01A-505 / Robertshaw 1950-001, 1950-532, 1950-536 / Jade PG-36 / General Controls 101934F32, then you are in luck with this product.

10/23/15: This tape is easy to tear, and I used it to cover a wood cover for the crawlspace to my home. Very easy to apply and just ahead of our first major rain storm.

1255	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I purchased a pair of these to allow me to install a grid of Unistrut type metal channels on the roof of my workshop by myself.  Turns out I only needed but one for that task.  I would lean the 3rd Hand against a ladder and then climb the ladder with the strut in one hand.  I would place the center of the strut where it needed to be and hold it in place with one hand and then grab the 3rd Hand with the other and place it under the strut and then squeeze the lever to clamp it against the strut to hold it in place against the ceiling.  I could then start installing fasteners to attach the strut to the ceiling.  I also purchased the 3rd Hand laser attachment clamp and have projects where that combination will also come in very handy.  The supports were easy to adjust and operate and were sufficiently sturdy to apply sufficient clamping force to hold steel struts in place against a ceiling. I never felt my head bone was in jeopardy as I proceeded with work on the ten foot long steel channels clamped against the ceiling.

This was perfect for that!
225	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	If you do any vacuuming this is the way to go. The bags aren't cheap but they hold a lot of dust preventing clogging of the cartridge filter. Prior to using these I'd have to clean the filter several times a day and get dust and grit all over myself. With the bags, do go several days of sanding and cleanup before the bag needs replacement and the cartridge filter is relatively clean. Don't get any dirt on you when you remove the bag.

1598	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Well, not everything I did was a mistake but there were more than Id like to admit. I do a lot of my own building and am making a lot of repairs to my current house and a log cabin I have. When I did a lot of roofing & siding work I assumed water would flow down and away so thats how I built everything. Along comes winter and the dreaded ice dams and now water flows uphill and under everything to then leak into the living spaces. I pulled some vinyl siding off to put on an addition and after only a few years enough water had gotten behind the siding and even the house wrap that it rotted away some large sections of OSB. I found the source of leaks to be where water ran down the sides of some window J-channels and where a sloped roof met an outside wall. I pulled off everything, made the repairs and then put all the trim back with healthy does of this sealant and the leaks are now gone and ice cant push up under it. I also use the clear around my wood stove pipes & roof flashing and it seals them tight so no water running down the pipe onto the stove when strong winds are pushing heavy rains. Im putting flashing over all the exposed wood fascia and this stuff ensures no water gets under it. if you vinyl siding you are likely getting water damage near the windows so don't assume that because you don't see it its not happening. Ive no gone through about a dozen tubes of this stuff over the past few years and never had a problem with it and have stuck a large nail in open tubes and since its flexible the nail comes out easily and the product is still usable. Its also a good adhesive so I can attach flashing with a minimum of exposed nail and/or screw heads. For exterior work its the best product Ive found at a reasonable price. Ive even had success with it on sealing gutter leaks in the connectors.
564	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Fits and works and also because it is not reversible it is quickly in need of replacement.  The solution is to always run it at max speed and use a delicate touch.  There is no substitute. If you need one of these this is the one to buy.

2023	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	These came straight from China i'm not sure they are authentic. but they seem pretty good. they work great with my for sure authentic Fluke probes and clips.
I used this same as I do the RD, I spray for spots, and do a full hot water pass the first time then a cleaning fluid pass, then a final cold water or warm water finish.  It seems like a lot of work but I have a white carpet in the larger areas and hallways so it's needed.  I used this on the halls and the entryway landing as they had the most soil.  I swept very through first with a good quality upright carpet sweeper.  Then did the process, now this says it's a "SteamVac", but that is some kind of make name.  It's usually food products that try to fool you with their name, there's no cheese in Cheese Whiz (except in Canada), and I'm surprised they would tag something like that to a product like this.  This is not a steamer, you want steam, make the water in the soap tank hotter.  It did a nice job on the halls, but I could see there was a little gray in the traffic area which I don't get with the RD, so it is not quite as good.  I went over it a few times and that helped, but that doesn't make it as good.

2861	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I received this in the mail today and it is a "very" nice unit. Is is smooth but a bit seemd little stiff (not jerky) out of the box. It does not have a "thumb" wheel like the Starret which I also have in this size. I tried the Starret without using the thumb wheel and it was identical to the this unit in effort required. So a thumb wheel will reduce effort to move.  I tried both the Starret and this unit on a known object and got exactlly the same readings as one would expect. The Silver numerals on the black back ground are as easy to read as the black on white numerals on the Starret even in dim light. This unit has a solid metal dial case (Starret has plastic) which I really like and seems to be a touch smaller in over all dimensions than the Starret. The unit comes in an attractive dark grey plastic case with a positive slide latch mechanism. The Starret comes in a red plastic box wih a simple "pop" type latch. Additionally this unit has space in the standard plastic case that is supplied for a T-Bar depth base. You must upgrade to the optional case if you want that for the Starret. All in all it is really hard to choose between the two as both are qulity instruments.  Note if you get the T-Bar depth base you need to order part no. 5.60013. It is finished in silver and sized in mm and is approximatley 3 inches long and will fit in the supplied box. Do not order part 5.60086. It is finsihed in black. It will fit the caliper but is too big at 3.35" long to fit in the cuttout in the supplied case!
