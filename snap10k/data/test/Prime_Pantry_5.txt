I personally don't consume acidic products that are packaged in plastic -- (plastic is unstable chemically, especially this softer version of plastic) unlike glass or ceramic,  when exposed to acid or heat, lemon juice is highly acidic, and the components of plastics can leach into the liquid in the container.

I guess it is the protein....anyway, the tuna is good, though I couldn't really discern rosemary, garlic or sea salt as dominating flavors, so if you are looking for a big flavor explosion, you won't get that.  What you will get is a nicely flavored tuna salad, much like you would make at home, not just a can of dry, flavored tuna.  My one drawback on this one was a small one.  Not enough crackers.  I had to really heap the tuna on the crackers-I believe there were 6 to use most of it and still ended up eating some out of the container, so a few more crackers would be good.  The crackers are Ritz like and go well with the tuna.  Other than not enough of them, they went well with the kit.

9426	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love Fiber One Bran Cereal and have eaten it for many years.  Recently, I purchased another brand of high fiber cereal which resembles this General Mills cereal, but it is not the same.  I'll admit that the box I purchased this past weekend was from a brick and mortar store and the cost was half of the current price (big store sale) and it's mot an item I think of purchasing from Amazon as a single box item.  Regardless, because of the way this cereal is packaged inside the box leads me to believe that it would be a good product for shipping survival.  Years ago, a box of this cereal contained a single bag and I needed to put it in a Tupperware container to remain fresh.  It is now marketed in two packages rather than one in a single box, so I can put the single sleeve inside a glass jar after opening it and consuming the first serving.  That is smart packaging.

Quite some while ago I felt the Lentil (and other of Amy's soups) were something you'd only eat because you're vegetarian like me, but regular brands like Progresso are also vegan and much better; and since Amy's cost more they should be top of the line for flavor and not one of these soups is a stand-out. I had stopped buying it because of the price. But lately I ordered a case of the Lentil and was startled it's way better than Progresso or just about any lentil, and I don't know if my attitude has changed, or what I suspect, Amy's has been improving the product.

It could be the bag they're packaged in that makes the difference, but they are MUCH crispier than the ones you get in the can.  I'm not sure if it's an accurate description, but the ones in the can almost taste underdone or maybe the can itself retains more moisture.  That's not the case with the bag and my family tore through them like fiends after potato chips.  I have to admit, I'm addicted too, but I've hidden away one bag for Thanksgiving Day.

9763	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Not the strongest, most vivid Jasmine Rice I've ever tasted, but a very solid contender.  Clean, fresh, unquestionably the right strain of rice, but some of the imports have this beat flavor-wise.  Naturally, rice costs a lot in small quantities like this; I think I'll step up and buy a larger bag of an A-list brand next time.  Definitely recommended though if you want Jasmine Rice as a rare treat, and not as a semi-staple.

They are bite-size, soft but crunchy, cheesy and delicious, and not that high in fat. Addictive! Better than even the other Popped flavors we've tried. Better than some potato chips for that matter.

They are fairly soft caramels, especially when they are warm - they do melt well.  Sometimes I make my son caramel apples out of them, though I prefer to just eat them and will sometimes use that intention as an excuse to buy a bag or two.

I noticed more than 1/2 of the cans are dented. I thought about providing feedback on the packaging but I don't think it is a packaging issue. The box and none of the other contents showed any signs of damage. It seems unlikely that the cans were damaged in the warehouse. I am wondering if the cans were damaged in the canning factory and sold as seconds. None of the seals were broken and the contents tasted fine. I'm curious if anyone else had this problem. If I were to purchase this product in the grocery store, I would avoid buying any damaged cans. If they are seconds there should be some warning in the ad.

I usually drink self-brewed, loose-leaf teas, but I gave this a shot when I encountered it by chanced in a grocery store. Unsweetened is a big plus, and I am a fan oolong teas.

It allows you to lay a perfect bed of lettuce, with the succulent and perfectly-seasoned beef, dripping its cumin'd juices into the bed of lettuce below, with a dusting of your favorite finely hand-grated cheese, and a number cherry tomatoes decorating the top - a literal cherry on top of delicious tacoy goodness smothered with hot sauce and sour cream.

I've been making my oats this way for over ten years and it keeps me full. I do add some raisins and ground flax to the oats, before I cook them, and the oatmeal comes out perfectly. The raisins come out plump and the oats keep me full and energized until lunch.

If I have a recipe that requires Dijon Mustard (such as a Dijon Chicken recipe), I typically purchase a glass jar of Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard and spoon the mustard out for measuring.  However, I do not like using the jar for sandwiches and similar food, as I've found the jar of mustard can become cross contaminated with mayo and other fixings when a single knife is used to make a sandwich.  (But granted, that is the sandwich fixer's problem and not the mustard's problem!)

3547	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Very good flavor and easy to make.  If you have not tried "prime pantry" yet, you are missing out.  Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?
Bottom line is that this spray & wash does work on most stains we have tried it on. If you are looking for a laundry stain remover for stains like those mentioned above, and if you follow the directions as noted on the bottle and have the time to use it properly, then I recommend Resolve Pre-Treat Laundry Stain Remover based on our experience with it.

3878	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I'm still getting into he habit of using Coconut Milk in recipes, but I am on the Whole 30 plan and have found that it is used in many of the recipes that comply with my diet. It works great as a thickening agent in sauces and gravies, instead of flour and milk.
On the box is a recipe using the mix but adding canned corn kernels, bacon crumbles, grated cheddar and chopped green onion. Chile was the plan for dinner so I changed the recipe by adding 1/2 cup cooked frozen corn kernels (dont like canned,) 1/2 cup grated cheddar and a tablespoon of dried red bell pepper to the mix. The mix itself requires 2/3 cup milk, an egg and 1/3 cup oil/melted butter.
345	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This been has ben around a long time. It is very flavorful makes quick and easy sandwiches. Or can be used in meat loaves. Still taste great after all these years. I like it with chicken or turkey.

765	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	If you want quality oats, you HAVE to get Quaker Old Fashioned. They are the only ones I used in my oatmeal raisin cookies and other baked goods because they hold up really solidly and give it a proper oatiness to them, even if you are mixing them heavily into batters.

A true family favorite, we eat this rice at the majority of our dinners, plus our 2 Faithful Canine Companions also eat this rice in the home cooked meals I fix for them.  I recommend using a rice cooker to prepare this according to the rice cooker's direction.  Rinse first, then cook with a bit of olive oil and dried herbs; no salt.  The rice will turn out perfectly every time, separate flakey grains with a delicious nutty taste.  As a bonus, your kitchen will smell wonderfully from the basmati rice's mild popcorn-like fragrance.  Leftover rice warms up beautifully in the microwave with no change in texture or taste.
3901	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I bought this brand because a food blogger said it worked well for a substitute to cream for whipped topping. It worked well with a mild coconut flavor to the topping. I didn't give 5 stars because that would be a perfect score. I don't know if it is perfect for my purpose compared to brands I haven't tried, and there did seem to be room for improvement. But it is a good product.

1434	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I was honestly expecting these to be soft, since peaches can be soft often-times. However, I was surprised when I found the chunks to be firm, almost apricot-like. I actually prefer firm peaches, so this was a welcomed experience. The syrup was not too surgary. It did appear to be nothing more than water with fruit juice, which is preferable to sugar-water.

I am quite happy that this does not contain any artificial dyes; the color isn't very exciting, as a result, but you're also getting less junk, which is nice, especially since you're using this on items that will later touch your food.

8735	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These blue Scotch-Brite sponges with the scrubber on one side and the softer sponge on the other are truly great! They are very good thick material. The scrubber is particularly useful on pots, dishes with food stuck on them and so much else--bathtubs, tile, bathroom counters kitchen counters.. Oh you get the point. These have so many tasks you can use them on. The other side with the sponge which is soft works just as well as any other sponge. It's a thick sponge so it doesn't rip easily.
7908	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love the stuff. These are the best tasting chips that is healthy. Pretty addictive, though. Unlike a typical salty potato chip, you can eat this all day long without getting tired of it.

1986	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I've tried this brand and the Great Value brand of these, and while they are both good, these are better. They're easy to make, and taste great. My boyfriend isn't a fan of them, but he's kind of a picky eater. I love having these as a side with dinner, or if I can't think of something to make, as a meal for me. Definitely worth buying again and again!
5752	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Awesome as always with quaker oat

3357	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I really appreciate this salt.  Just a pinch goes a long way.  The large crystals are intensely salty.  You really can taste a difference in the quality of the salt.  I love it on meats, a meager pinch sprinkled over a large salad before tossing, a pinch over scrambled eggs along with a twist of fresh ground pepper. In recipes, on food, it just tastes better.
*Cheap price
480	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Just disgusting. This is not what I remember eating as a kid. My Mom must have jazzed it up or bought something else, I'll have to ask her.

6632	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are my all-time favorite fruit.  As a kid, we had far more canned fruit than fresh; peaches, pears, fruit cocktail.  But these mandarin oranges were reserved for special occasions.  Mom used them to make "ambrosia" for Thanksgiving & Christmas dinner.  That is the only time I remember ever having these  I guess since they were a rare treat, it made them extra special to me.  I eat them in salads and I also enjoy them plain as a snack or with a squirt of whipped cream as a dessert.  In fact, I think I will go eat some right now!
9271	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Good staple to have on hand when you want a fast easy dinner. You can add beans to make it go further or use it as is for chili dogs or with hamburgers. Mild flavor that you can add your own seasonings to for a spicier flavor.

Walgreens consistently has this on sale for about half the price, so there's no reason to order it from here unless you cannot find this locally and are desperate for bad clam chowder in a can. It's basically just a bland, can of diced potatoes in a white starchy goo, so I don't recommend it at all. There's very little nutrition in here (1g fiber, calcium 2%, iron 4%) and it's mostly just empty calories. It's edible, but I won't ever buy this again.

But that aside, the taste is great, the small amount of fat is poly and mono which are both good fats with just a touch of saturated which isn't. In all, a very healthy and versatile product. I will be buying the the big container though because the large container is a better deal and I won't have to buy it as often.
I am sticking to the baby shampoo routine as it doesnt hurt and it doesnt burn my eyes at all and it keeps your eyelids clean and glands working properly.  I hadnt used baby shampoo since my son was a baby many, many, many years ago.  It is a good product and it worked for me.  I picked mine up at the local store as I had to start my eye washing treatment right away.
151	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Most disgusting tuna I've ever seen. Can't be drained because the whole product is pure sludge. Should be taken off the market and shame on chicken of the sea, a brand I used to trust. There were no chunks at all so I had to pour the sludge into a fry pan and heat till the liquid evaporated out. Then I added mayo to make it tolerable. ( I hate throwing food away, so I try to make do when I can)

Once I get stains on my clothes, I cannot wait until I get home to put inside the laundry.  I use this stain remover to treat it first while I'm still wearing the cloth (it removes 90-100% of stains most of the time if you use it right away) then I when I get home I spray it again and throw it inside the laundry machine. Without this, I probably would have had to throw away 40-50 shirts.

Mid-week, my husband decided that it was a good time to nick himself while shaving -- but why did he have to grab a nice, thick, white master bath towel to stem the flow? Seriously... still, this Resolve spray was liberally applied and allowed to soak a few minutes, then I rubbed the liquid in a bit, and then wash the towel with a load of towels. To my surprise, the stains were completely gone. Well done

1361	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These fruit bowls might be my favorite that I've had so far. I am in my mid-twenties and bought these as a quick snack to include in the lunch I make for work. Usually, I actually can't stand any of the snack "jello" bowls but I thought I would give these a try and I love them. The peaches and the Strawberry Gel taste great together and when I say great I don't just mean like kind of good. I mean great! I am not a huge fan of food coloration. . . but honestly if they were clear I probably would be kind of "weirded out" so in this case I think it works. I would definitely recommend that other people try them at least once (because of how much I like them). I will definitely keep on buying them.
9616	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This is really good cereal, and I have been eating it for some time.  I would recommend this to others

I've even heard rumors it can be eaten straight out of the tub ;)
3372	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I swear by this salt, I really do! Morton's coarse kosher salt is the only kind of salt I use now. It has great flavor, much better than iodized salt. And because it has such a strong flavor, you can use less in recipes. I highly recommend this salt to anyone that cooks!

Parties, picnics, providing leftovers to guests, etc. No worries about your expensive Tupperware going missing! For home use, these are inexpensive enough that you won't moan if one gets stained or cracked and you need to toss it in the trash.

6512	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I really enjoyed these raisins in oatmeal, in yogurt, for backing, as a snack. They have tons of flavor and at the beginning they are fresh, with a nice texture. The only thing I regret is buying a big tub for me alone; as it took me some time to consume them, at the end they became rather dry. The tub does not seal perfectly, I would recommend storing them in a better container.
1243	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I have to say I really do like Welch's grape juice it's exactly what you expect. The flavors always been great I've never been disappointed. I will admit that it is a bit sweet which some people may like that may not be great if you're on a sugar restricted diet.

8243	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are delicious! Packed full of flavor and they had a nice crunch to them. I usually buy the Tostitos Lime flavored tortilla chips but I think I'll just get these from now on. They have a better flavor and I feel like they are better for me.  I think they would go great as nachos or even pico de gallo. I also like how there weren't a ton of crumbs or broken chips at the bottom of the bag.
I cook it up in a rice cooker.  It is perfect every time!  Not sticky, not heavy.  Light and tasty.  I know lots of people say all rice is the same...I disagree.  Jasmine is my favorite.

The muffins/cornbread freezes well although they should be consumed within three months which is when the taste will begin to deteriorate. Lately, although the regular cornbread mix is usually in stock at my local market, the honey cornbread variety is not always on the shelf so it is good to find it here. The best buy date on the box was fourteen months in the future.

This won new supermkt product of the year when Dole introduced it. Del Monte tried to copy it and made theirs about .25 cheaper but packed in syrup instead of natural juiice. My grandchildren devour these so I hide some for myself. Delicious and tastes as if it's fresh off the tree. Amazon was cheaper than the store price-I usually pay 2.60 for a carton of 4. I also love the mandarin oranges in an orange gel and the peaches in strawberry gel.

7450	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful product!  Sometimes I'm skeptical of "green" products because so often they just don't work, but not the case here!  It has a very pleasant somewhat mild fragrance and does a great job of softening the fabric.  Plus, I am often allergic to laundry products but this one does not affect me in the least.
My 1/2 gallon at wally world was 2.98, that's 6.00 a gallon compared to 4.18 a gallon of milk. For 2 bucks more you save 800 calories you don't need PLUS its lactose free!!

9683	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great alternative to a gummy-style candy these ginger chews are less sweet than candied ginger or just plain candy and possess all of the helpful digestive properties of ginger. Definitely spicy, this is a rather grown-up sweet and because of the complexity of the taste, there is little temptation to over-indulge so a bag lasts quite a while. Chewy and satisfying..I can only find these locally in a couple of stores so very happy to find them here. .
For any recipe that calls for fruit cocktail or eating just as it is.
3257	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This is a very large box of salt!  It will last for years at my rate of use!  A one pound box would have been more than sufficient for my use. I do like Morton Kosher salt for general use while cooking.  Too fine for a salt grinder and too coarse for table use, but wonderful for recipes.
So many things are better with lime, and this doesn't get icky after a few days in the fridge, make a mess, or require labor and tools to incorporate it into your cooking.

1708	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good
7520	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic product.
3867	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Works as well as regular wheat flour, with the exception it has no gluten, which I compensate by adding xanthin gum to the recipes I use it in.  I have developed several gluten free recipes for cakes and cookies that my grandson can eat.  He is gluten sensitive, but does not have celiac disease.
1506	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	thank you
Hard to complain when it's shipped for free to my door though!  Smile.  Hope this is helpful!
Of course the kids loved them too! Will be buying more soon.
5453	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	A great way to rev up the flavor your dishes without adding calories or fat.  For me, a little goes a long way but makes a huge impact.  One of my favorite features of this brand is that it is designed so that it can easily be stored upside down for quick use.  The product is fairly thick (more so than regular yellow mustard) and can require more "shakes" than I care to give it when it gets past the half-way point.  Storing the bottle turned upside down only takes a few quick shakes for blending and then it is ready to squirt.  I have even gotten my husband to use this instead of mayo on most of his sandwiches as a healthier alternative!
The only other mustard I'd recommend is Inglehoffer (aka Beaver on the West coast) - much harder to find be it rightly is rated high by many tasting panels

303	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Love these Italian flavored bread crumbs..they add so much to casseroles, meatloaf, or as a coating for fish or chops.  Glad to see Amazon offering these..a good value over buying them individually in the grocery store.
3358	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	There is a crazy number of uses for kosher course salt.  Not only cooking, but cleaning.  I am converting to natural cleaning supplies and Pinterest lists this salt for so many uses.  I'm glad I got the three pound box because I am constantly getting some for everything from cleaning my iron, an ingredient in my homemade dishwasher detergent. Not only that, there are recipes that call for it.

Ali Julia review
Thos food side is great
Tried an order from Amazon Pantry to see how it would work out.  I was impressed.  I filled a pantry box to near 100%.  Made sure that the items were a nice mixture of items that would not necessary be packaged together and could be a problem.  All arrived in great condition with no damage.  Chips, cookies, bottled drinks, cooking oil. Snacks, etc. were the type of things that I mixed together.
3305	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We have tried other brands and keep coming back to Morton.  The crystals are just the right size and the tastes is unmatched.

This is a known and trusted brand and I was delighted to find it available on Amazon. Nothing can compare to fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemons seem to have gone the way of limes. Good quality has become difficult to find in the grocery stores.  The bottle is easy to store on one of the fridge door shelves for easy access, has a removable top with easy no spills dispenser. It's cost effective and multipurpose useful. Onion/garlic odor on your hands is a quick fix with a few drops . . . if there is an unpleasant odor from the garbage disposal, add lemon juice and allow to remain overnight.

My Grandmother made ambrosia with this brand and I will stick with it. The oranges don't taste like the can and I feel like I get more for my money than with the smaller plastic containers - though I would buy the plastic containers for taking out lunches and travel.  Use in your favorite orange cake recipe or bread recipe and skip the orange extract.  Excellant.

5167	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	It's lime juice.  It tastes like the juice of limes.  Many, many limes.  One squeeze (of the bottle) into your clear lemon-flavored carbonated soda will result in a fantastic limeade without all the work of trying to get juice out of a freshly cut lime.  Add some red berries or cherries and you will have a refreshing cool beverage for the upcoming warm weather days.  The decision to add some spirits for a hard limeade is up to you-- and maybe Mike.
6140	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	The tuna has a mild taste and the smell is not overwhelming like some brands (that smell like cat food).
7459	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This stuff smells AMAZING. It smells like lavender essential oil. That being said, if you don't actually like lavender essential oil, this is NOT the product for you. It seems to do a good job keeping clothes fluffy, and I like that it's very concentrated. You only use about a tablespoon for a normal size load. I do NOT like the cap. The cap has the normal screw portion, plus a piece that goes down deep inside the neck of the bottle. I'm guessing this is to prevent extra product from leaking through the threads and spilling. I've seen other brands with similar caps, but this one uses twice the plastic and makes measuring the product odd. The full load measuring line is half of the capacity of the weird lid (i.e.: at the threads, where the weird neck portion SHOULD stop). I couldn't figure out why we were using it so quickly (we don't have THAT much laundry). Eventually I figured out that my S.O. had been filling the full lid and literally using twice the amount recommended. It's too expensive to waste!

We prefer the Old Fashioned over the Minute version. You are probably very experienced with cooking oats, but in case you are not: The Old Fashioned needs to be brought to a boil on the stove and cooked for several minutes until desired tenderness, but the extra work is worth it because it has better chewiness than the quick oats. I tend to make mine less watery so I can transport it to work and eat it there. That way it stays nice and firm, and the oats will reabsorb some of the water over time and improve texture. It is better to undercook than overcook because undercooking can be fixed later in a microwave. If overcooked, there's not much you can do with the mush. I like my oatmeal cold. It shrinks the oats and gives them a better mouthfeel, but everyone has his/her own preference.
4194	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	We can obviously purchase this elsewhere, but we have been enjoying the ease of Prime, especially as the weather gets cooler.  The price is comparable if you weigh in the cost of gas and distance, particularly if you live a ways out from town.

Fru-fru soaps can't get it done for this guy so I have to keep it old school like grandpa did.  If you are a mans man, or a woman that is quite manly, you will find that the activities you participate in make you sweat, dirty, and smelly. The Irish can kill that funk and even make the whole bathroom smell good....which is an amazing feat in my case.  You might even be able to hang a stick just as an air freshener.

Note: the pictured canister is not included. This is simply a very large bulk box of oatmeal. Inside are two plain 4 lb plastic bags. I recommend saving your empty canisters to put the oats in, for daily use. The rest, you can put back in the box and store until you need to refill the canister.

They have a good amount of chocolate and sweetness (almost to the point of being too sweet for a "healthy" cookie) but may indeed seem a bit "dry" so make sure you have your milk or other liquid drink nearby. I think the biggest downside is that they are relatively expensive, with only 8 cookies per box.

Regardless, the yeast is just as good as the last pouch I purchased, so I am not complaining.  By keeping the yeast in a vacuum sealed bag in the freezer, I keep a 4 ounce brown glass jar that had contained yeast filled with this in the refrigerator and allow what I need to reach room temperature prior to baking.  If I know I'll be using for several baking sessions, I'll leave the small jar on the counter top.  Keep the yeast dry and cool to maintain the lively yeast.  If I am ever concerned about yeast that doesn't appear to be active, I proof it.  If it is still active, I then take into account the amount of yeast, water and sugar, using the proofed mixture in my recipe.

I bought this container because I don't like the packets with all the extra sugar and fake flavors and I am pleased with the taste and how easy it is to prepare. But the container is super small. I didn't realize how few servings an 18 ounce container would be. I would have to buy this every week or more just for myself and my husband who occasionally has some. But I guess that was my bad. I didn't really look at the servings per container. We always had these big containers of oatmeal when I was a kid and they lasted a long time. I am almost done with this container and it's only been a short while. Walmart has the 42 ounce canisters for just $1.00 more I will buy my oatmeal there from now on.

8068	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Review is based upon hubbie's comments.  He prefers this particular Old Spice fragrance over some of the other Old Spice offerings in that it is not as overwhelming scent wise.  Hey Old Spice, if it wasn't broke, why did you mess with the scent?  Old Spice used to offer a body wash that smelled like their eons old original Old Spice after shave but if it is still produced it apparently is not available in our area.  Still, he likes the Old Spice better than some of those gosh awful smells of others such as e.g., Axe or those that emit a musk odor.  Ugh.  It is reasonably priced and comes in a fairly good sized bottle.  However, my absolute favorite scent for my hubbie is the very pricey Azzaro original.  But that's another story.

To avoid the waste, reclose the near-empty carton with the cap.  Tear off the cap and the screw-on mounting; this will leave you a hole in the top.  Using your thumb, expand the hole to the nearest corner.  This will give you a extra 2 tablespoons of liquid that you cannot get otherwise.

I lived on Okinawa as a teenager, and bottled oolong tea I purchased on the local economy was what started my appreciation of various kinds of tea. I'm willing to wager that Ito En's Oolong was the one that began it all. It has a mellow ta flavor with subtle hints of fruit and honey. Very soothing and refreshing. It will not replace fresh brewed tea as my daily drink, but in a pinch and for convenience, I will certainly be getting more of this.

The 2 combined don't equal one average cylinder. So my overall grippe is that it is WAY over priced. I fell for the suckers bet, don't make the same mistake.

Since this is the old fashioned type of oat, it's a lot thicker and holds up well in my weekly food preps.  I also add some golden flax seed, primarily on the suggestion of my nutritionist.  I don't love the taste of flax, though.  But you do what you have to do to get the results you want, right?

They taste like a metal can with a weird aftertaste that I can't describe - period.  The 6 pack plastic does not work, cans are loose.  Two were pierced and made a mess.  I could have worked with that if the soda was any good, but don't waste your money here.  I am back to Zevia and natural sweeteners.

My children enjoy these as a snack. We also use them frequently when we make my dad's favorite cookies. We make a carrot slaw type salad that needs raisins. We also make a recipe that has broccoli in it and the raisins add that extra sweet touch that makes the salad perfect.
9968	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	very good
The taste is not completely homemade. Maybe it's mental, but I think all boxed stuff has a "BOXED" taste. But it is warm and freshly baked and you get that nice sweet aroma in the house. I don't recommend eating the cookies directly out of the oven because the GF dough needs to cool and set a bit longer than regular wheat dough. Instructions on the box indicate that a 2 minute cooling period is required. I think it's wise to follow those orders. I let mine sit a little longer.

Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands.

I also use this oatmeal when I make my great-grandmother's oatmeal cookie recipe that has been in my family for numerous years. Yum. Another thing we do with this oatmeal is to make boiled chocolate oatmeal cookies. Those are great favorites, too. This is one product that is very good and healthy for you.

4635	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	I've bought this Organic Apple Cider Vinegar before, and I've also seen it in stores.  Never have I seen it (or any other organic ACV) priced anywhere near what it costs here.  The fault is my own for not paying closer attention to the size of the bottles, but I do think there is a bit of deception--or at the very least, price gouging--in this being sold for the same price that two 32 oz. bottles (twice as much!) would normally sell for.  The vinegar itself is very good, and I don't mean for my review to reflect otherwise; however, most people buying this product already know how great it is.  Those who already use the product might easily assume (as I did) that the bottles are the 32 oz., because the price is in line with that, and those who have not bought this product before should be warned that this product can be gotten for half the price.  Two 16 oz. bottles for $16.49 is the same price as I'd normally pay for two 32 oz. bottles!  Please take note of this if you are considering purchasing this item.
I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.

4773	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I wasn't sure what to expect, but found a very good tasting chicken broth, that is definitely low sodium (needed to add salt, but that was the idea, for me to be able to control it).  The size (8 oz) is perfect for when I make matzo ball soup and just need some broth to add to the matzo balls to reheat them.  I'd order this again :)

9985	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I saw this in a specialty market and was so impressed by the wide ribbons of white coconut that I disregarded the gazillion dollars they charged and bought a bag.  At the Bob's Red Mill website, I investigated recommended recipes and found an enticing cookie recipe, then assembled the ingredients and prepared a batch of wholesome, chewy, flavorfully delicious cookies which we've been enjoying for a few days.  I'd used home dried cherries and grapes (raisins) instead of the cranberries listed in the recipe, but otherwise followed it as written online and on the Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Cereal bag.  The coconut was so impressive that I immediately checked to see the Amazon price in preparation for buying more and after only a week, they now have it in stock at a much better price than the nearly five I paid for my first bag.  The 12 ounce bag probably contains 3 hefty cups of coconut as I split it with my daughter and nibbled some before measuring it for review.  She made fresh blueberry coconut ice cream with coconut milk and said this coconut was especially nice because the texture was more interesting than smaller shreds which she'd used in the past.  Nothing is added to the Bob's Red Mill Flaked Coconut Unsweetened and that's just what I want!  Toasted, it's even better when added to fruit and yogurt.  I have it in my Amazon cart ready to order!

But YES they microwave decently (not for all foods and not for too long, but defrosting works well), and YES they hold up under repeated abuse straight from the freezer.  They are a softer plastic so not as brittle.  I don't like how the top ridge is so thick.. but I'd start buying them again if they got rid of that circle in the middle top and reverted to the old flat-top style which made you GLAD to use GLADware.

7202	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	This was a poor purchase for me. I was looking into natural, chemical free products and stumbled upon Meyer's. I really did enjoy the scent, but that was about it. The spout once pushed down doesn't not come back up on its own. In addition, the mechanism for pushing the soap out of the spout often only squirts a little or a splattery mess. The soap itself requires two or three pumps to actually create bubbles on your hands and get a thorough washing. Because of this, it is running out fairly quickly, and I will not be purchasing again --- or any other meyer's products for that matter.

This has nothing to do with the product but the carrier ONTRAC. Not pleased with their delivery or lack of delivery. The only problem was with ONTRAC delivery. Lazy? Point-of-fact my package with three items was delivered to the wrong address because the carrier was too lazy to walk it to my apartment. Only had trouble with ONTRAC The carrier did  not even attempt to deliver to my address or leave a note on my door and dropped it off at the leasing office. I would have never known about the delivery except I have Amazon mobile phone tracking and they text me. 2 DAY deliverery turned into a week! I had to wait for some one to go to the office within their business hours. I depend on others to carry packages I can not carry such large packages. That is why I expect them to deliver to my door as usual. ONTRAC learn from the more professional big guys like UPS or FedEx.

6093	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I was prepared to be dissatisfied with these since I rarely like instant mashed potatoes.  I decided to give 'em a try for the sake of convenience.  I took a couple to work, and they sat in my desk a couple weeks.  One day I was desperate for some quick comfort food.  These are fast, easy (only water required), and pretty delicious, all things considered.  I was very (and pleasantly) surprised.  Soft, fluffy, buttery mashed potatoes.  Who could complain?  Very handy when you need a "quick fix".  I'll be buying more.
8874	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Great easy gluten free cookies. You can add peanut butter to them or pumpkin and it totally changes the taste. Betty Crocker has recipes online.

892	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	I normally love these chips but I ordered them for the first time from Amazon instead of getting them at my local store. The problem is that the chips I received from Amazon seemed to have a lot more grease on them - to the point where it was very noticeable in the bag and on my fingers, just like regular greasy potato chips. I've never experienced this before with this brand and flavor, normally I don't even notice if there's any oil or not. I'm not sure if Amazon had a poorer quality or older batch or what, but I'll think twice before ordering these from Amazon again.

9286	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Like just about every family in the world, from time-to-time we get stains on our laundry that need pretreatment to get out. We have tried many products, some more effective than others, and recently purchased the Resolve spray & wash style Pre-Treat Laundry Stain Remover. The spray container is easy to use, does not leak or dribble down the container, and it helps get most stains out in the wash. I like it, would recommend it, and will purchase it again when needed.
9441	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I always do a spot test. I did learn the hard way over the years. I have done some crazy things to mine and others laundry on the way to learning! There are some fabrics that this isn't great for. I did have really good results on some, mostly cotton, pillow cases that had makeup residue on them. After some guests had left I immediately went and stripped the bed to wash everything. Then to my own dismay I noticed some smudges on fairly new sheet set pillowcases. It was mostly just some eyeliner or mascara and foundation it looked like. I sprayed the pillow cases and let them sit overnight for the treatment to soak in. For me it is just something handy to keep in the laundry room in case of mishaps. For what I used it for it worked great.

I have had raisins elsewhere and in trail mix or energy bars that were like little stones, so compared to those, these are five stars.  i do wonder what chemical is keeping them moist so there's that...
1080	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I do love these but they are a guilty pleasure, Negligible nutritional value, but the taste... sometimes you just have to have one
2512	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	While I normally prefer the full sodium soups, I really do like this Progresso minestrone soup as well (though I sneak in a bit more salt or I mix it with another can of a full sodium soup).  Like most canned soups, I primarily use this as a "base" soup and then add a little leftover rice or pasta and any fresh or frozen vegetables (like spinach) I have laying around.  This soup is pretty expensive in NYC supermarkets when not on sale ($3/can), so at less than $1.25 a can here and delivery right to my door, this is a bargain!
Now, onto something that bothers me even more - the literally scum this soap lives in the sink and shower.  It's the worst soap I have ever had to clean up after.  After two days of not cleaning the sink, there is a visible and DURABLE layer of soap scum throughout.  Same with the tub.  He also uses it in the kitchen, and it doesn't seem to have the same effect on the stainless steel, at least.  But this soap is extremely difficult to clean up - I often have to scrub my bathroom with SOS pads just to remove the soap scum - and it's not because I go for weeks without cleaning, it's because this soap is terrible.

9682	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	I really wanted to love these chews but I just don't.  There are a few good things They are each only 20 calories but since they are large, for me, just half of one is plenty. The ingredients are just cane sugar, ginger, and tapioca starch, so that's a nice change. They are too spicy for me to enjoy though, and I have thrown each one away before finishing it because I just couldn't handle the heat on my tongue. This is a small bag, just 3 ounces, so there are only about fourteen pieces per bag. I can't recommend them

3026	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	This soup makes me wonder if Progresso is not contracting with another company to make its soup ( This idea is not far-- fetched.  Years ago botulism was found in a particular brand of soup. When the public was warned about this they were told that the same soup was being sold under a list of companies' names including premium brands). This is the worst Progresso soup I have ever eaten. It is NOT loaded with potatos and it is rather watery to boot. I am going to spend my money on the Campbell's Chunky Soups from now on.  They are less expensive  and  the quality is consistently good.

2322	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Clam chowder has been one of my grandmother's favorite soups for years. So I purchased this as a surprise. Progresso was a complete fail with her. Upon opening the can she noticed there were very little clams. Upon her eating one she discovered this was a good thing as the were so tough and chewy they couldn't be eaten. She was very disappointed. Will never by this brand again!

3502	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	the best!!
there are not many of those either. Very sparse
5723	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Come on.  Sometimes you just have to accept that large companies that have been around for a long time, put out a good product.  Like Quaker Oats.  I bought these after a Jamaican chef taught me a trick to create smooth silky porridge:  keep stirring.  Just like pasta, it takes a little while for water (or milk) to absorb into the oats, and stirring helps break down those flakes as they cook.  Jamaicans also blend raw oats into some of their smoothies, which I thought was an interesting way to make a shake nice and hearty.  So again, to review:  don't stir and you get oatmeal; stir and you get smooth porridge.  "Please, Amazon, can I have some more?"

5922	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	For those of us who need a low sodium diet, this is a great choice!  Great as a hot vegetable or as a salad. The only problem I encoutered was the packaging. Several cans were crushed and that was one big mess. Used the Amazon 'call back' system and the case was replaced. The next shipment contained a few dented cans but none that were crushed. Not certain about this problem but each order has contained dented cans. As long as the seal is intact, dents do not affect the quality of the contents.
Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: "At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are "trans fat free" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging."  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.

748	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	This brand is a favorite of my oldest daughter, she can eat them every day if allowed. She likes the hint of jalepeno in each bite , and the satisfying crunch that goes with these crispy chips. The product is very well made and has good portion sizes. This brand is our favorite Kettle style chip.

Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: "Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag"

Now these little containers offer the right amount for adding last minute flavors to gravy or to reduce with pan drippings into flavorful sauces. I devoted half a shelf just to this product alone. We use it all the time.
5389	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I enjoy a variety of beverages with my meals, and just for refreshment. I've tried any number of bottled teas and I like some of them. Personally, I've always thought that most were either too sweet (whether with honey, sugar or artificially flavored). I was mentioning this to my wife the other day and she came up with a packet of Ito En (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea and suggested I try it. She said it came from Costco, but it's probably available elsewhere or here on Amazon. Well, I took a bottle (16.9 ounces) pored over ice and a later bottle chilled ice cold in the fridge. Excellent. Much better than other brands. Very smooth and light tasting with a ever-so slightly bitter aftertaste. Quite refreshing! Goes well with food. I particularly like the absence of any sweetness of any kind. Plus it has the antioxident qualities of green tea and a surprisingly high vitamin C content. It's a very quality beverage.
I had no issues with this product,

5956	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These are real good
7702	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	I read the package.  "rich and creamy",  it is not.  It's texture is chalky.  When it dissolves, it becomes a sugary texture.  No buttery flavor if you are use to real butter and cream.  Not what I was looking for and not what I remember as a good caramel.  Kraft use to be better.  They changed the formula to save money just as other big companies have.  It isn't good enough to be a substitute.  I'm going to have to make my own if I want the flavor and texture.

You can eat with a grilled cheese or add some meat. Chicken or stew beef would work great or just eat as is.

2063	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	This Pasta Roni variety,Shells & White Cheddar, is so amazingly good. It tastes wonderful, nothing like many other boxed macaroni and cheese mixes. The white cheddar makes all the difference here. It almost tastes homemade. It is creamy and quite hard to resist. Which is a problem because it is high in calories and fat and pretty low in any sort of real nutrition. It has a lot of junk ingredients too but man, oh, man, now and then it is worth the extra calories to dig in and enjoy this cheap and easy side dish. I always look for things that are healthy and low in fat and this really is neither but life isn't black or white. Now and then, I want some good macaroni and cheese and I don't want to spend time making it from scratch. I don't eat this often but I totally enjoy it when I do. Then I diet for two days after! I do use 2% milk instead of whole milk and it tastes just as good so I save on calories and fat a bit doing that. Skim milk waters down the taste. This is one of the tastiest boxed pasta mixes I have tried.

Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?

I am old enough that frosting mixes were introduced while a child, and readymade frosting was not available until I was well into my adolesence.  Thus, I learned how to whip up a cake frosting with little trouble or effort.  However, now days, even that little bit of effort is more than I have in me.  For those occassions, I rely on a can of this.  It is also good to use to make what we called quickie sandwich cookies back in my college days:  a graham cracker split in half filled with a generous dollop of this frosting.  (Very good for sustaining the scholar while studying for finals.)

As an alternative to dry active yeast, you might prefer instant yeast.  Unlike active dry yeast, it doesn't require rehydration, plus it is has a much higher percentage of live cells.  Some people swear by it.  If you'd like to get instant yeast, here's a popular one on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fleischmann-s-Instant-Yeast-2-16-oz-bags/dp/B001BZEGN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fleischmann's Instant Yeast - 2/16 oz. bags</a>.

1776	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Excellent cookie, good chocolate flavor, reasonably healthy. If they would only use a dark chocolate for the pieces within it would be as good as a cookie can get and still taste like a cookie

8110	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	4.0	Not necessarily the healthiest option based on the preservatives present, but this one is not without merit. I was running very late last night and had to stop by the grocery for a couple of items. My husband is a fussy vegetarian and while I had prepped the vegetables for a five minute stir fry I didn't have the time for whole grain regular rice to cook or a mushroom risotto. I found this. No lie, this was 90 seconds fast and completely cooked and pipping hot. The stir fry wasn't done when this came out of the microwave.
608	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	Good value. Taste good.
6291	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	The taste amazing, and I love how crunchy they are. If you like Blue Diamond almonds and are looking for a small difference in taste, choose these
