4862	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This headset wasn't the best quality - it was great for me, the talker, but the mic didn't work so well. The person on the other end often had a hard time hearing me when I was talking in a quiet environment (forget it when in the car!). I'd recommend something else.

9477	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	UPDATE #2 - weBoost support sent me a new unit to test, and also sent me the optional cup holder mount. I tested the unit again, with MUCH better results this time. You can see from the attached screenshots from my iPhone 6 that the weBoost increased signal strength significantly. The iPhone was sitting in the weBoost in the cup holder on my center console. I took a screenshot before plugging the unit in, and after about 10 seconds of the unit being on with a green status indicator. My phone went from 17% to 45% signal strength according to the FieldTester app.
The 5130 is available in purple, orange, red and blue (I own the purple). It's very thin and small, but fits easily in the palm of your hand and doesn't give the impression it's going to fall apart if you look at it cross-eyed.

the bad, is slow on many thing, menus, contacts, etc, even with 128 mb of ram that sucks, now if you update it maybe that is fixed, i haven't update it yet

4. No volume adjustment on the headset; you need to adjust volume directly on the phone. Headset only has a single multifunction button (I had guessed there'd be at least 2 looking at images)

6)  Perfectly comfortable, even if wearing glasses.
However, it does take some skill in putting them on just right (some major precision). It took me at least a good 5-10mins to put the external screen protector on and not so much for the internal screen. Unfortunately, a couple of dust particles did get in the external screen protector and when I tried to take it off, I left finger marks on the screen which lead to a horrible experience trying to clean the screen. In the end I had to dispose of the external screen protector because of the mess I made while trying to clean it. But the internal screen protector remains and I'm happy with it. You can barely tell that it's even on there!
5504	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Does the trick, but probably have better luck if you super glue the base to the back or something because it falls off a lot.

3653	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have read some positive and some negative on these. I bought four to test on different phones and to test two on one phone.
 My first step was to call "BLUEANT" customer support (North America) . After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was "How much did you pay for this product?"..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was " Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!"....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.
On my Windows XP laptop, I can connect the 590's as  'stereo headphones' or as a 'hands free headset with microphone'.  After connecting as a headset, I hear odd beeps about every 5 seconds.  The beep pattern is not described in Plantronics' skimpy User's Manual.
2.  Your camera is manufactured with a glass protector that protects your actual LCD screen.  The film or hard plastic cover usuallly seen on cameras are actually protecting the factory LCD protector from being scratched. These GGS glass protectors look just like the factory one, except it says GGS and your camera name at the bottom instead of just your camera name.  The factory glass on my top screen was cracked, so I ordered a genuine Nikon part and replaced it.  When I installed the GGS protector over this, I couldn't tell them apart, so if your top screen glass is cracked, I'm pretty sure you could install this one instead of the Nikon part.  Unless you knew these were screen protectors, you woudn't even know they were installed.  They integrate that seemlessly with the factory look of the camera.

The verizon phone also went to 5 bars.
2487	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I had to write in and contradict the review saying you can only use this on your right ear.  the instructions show you how to switch it, and you can even switch the volume control from the bottom to the top, so it is on the top regardless of which ear you use it on. NOTE: if you want a Y splitter for car or home charging for this, you have to use model P000, not the one that comes up on a search, because you need a splitter with 2 mini-USBs (one for your phone, one for the headset). Only had it one day, so can't comment on the other issues.
After figuring out how to attach the ear tip, I wanted to take it off to try on one of the other two (3 total) ear tips that came with it (different sizes and form fit).  But I couldn't even get the original one off!  I had to ship it back with it on and it made the packaging kind of bulge.

1648	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have small ears and sometimes have to use this gadget for 8 hour conference calls.  For this reason comfort and battery life are paramount.  It stays pretty comfortable and the battery will go about 4-6 hours.  I think that's about the most you can expect from a bluetooth headset.
The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
The bad:
5968	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product, gret seller, great shipping,
Have to add that through Amazon is definitely worth it. The extended battery, and all the additional adapters were great to see in the box, and with no need to purchase in addition to
7834	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one (at least they're cheap). I gave them two stars instead of one since, oddly, 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose (a size adapter for my iPhone), though none of them work when plugged into my PC. Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less...

355	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Only had it a couple days seems great loved the fast delivery
The second is the remote.  It takes at least a full second, nearly two, between when I push a button and when the phone does something.  A little annoying, but again, could be my phone's issue, not the product.  Easily overcome by the cool factor of being able to control your music (pause/play, skip) without touching your phone or the stereo.  It won't fast forward or rewind tracks on my phone, just skip them.  I have to press the play button twice to get the phone to play after I start the car.  The mounting strap doesn't really cinch down tight, so the remote was constantly tilting in and out on my steering wheel.  And, when I was doing a lot of steering, my hand would sometimes accidentally hit part of the remote and skip back or forward - not fun when you were in the middle of a 30 minute podcast!  So, I decided to mount it on my turn signal stalk.  Now there are no accidental hits, and it stays put... just looks a little odd, but not any more odd than the big windshield washer paddles on the top of some US car stalks.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all... I can't figure out exactly why but it has something to do with starting the music playing using my phone instead of with the remote, and it has something to do with switching the car off but leaving the key in the ACC position.  It is quite rare that it doesn't work, about twice a week, perhaps.  I've tried pressing the center of the remote, but nothing.  But, if I power on/off the LiquidAux, it works fine again.

2.  The adjusting of the earpiece is backwards.  It turns outward in a circle to switch ears, when it should turn inward.  I have a hard time keeping the gel in my ear, because the earpiece tries to work around as I move throughout the day.
8859	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great size for the size of battery you get. Charges devices fast. Very convenient to toss in a bag in case you are somewhere that you can plug in to charge. Would definitely recommend.
it has a laser and LED light built into the charger, handy for trying to charge your phone at night!
The inside is lined with a firm foam which adds to the protection.
6849	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Awesome Product! A+++
I simply love this phone, and my old P800 is nothing compared to this phone.

3617	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The case fits well and I appreciate the ridge around the edge so that when laying screen-down, the screen is not actually touching the surface. I have not dropped the phone yet while in the case, but I am confident it would be fine if I did. The power button on the left is doesn't have any 'play' to it so when you press it, you aren't sure it's pressed really unless the screen comes on. Takes a few tries, or pressing with a fingernail. Same for the volume keys. Also, it must just be how I fold the phone, but my pinky finger usually goes at the bottom to support the phone and always seems to rest on the openings in the case for the usb or microphone, and this can produce an irritating feeling after a bit. Not really the case's fault though. The case is easy to put on and take off, and I took it off after a few weeks and had forgotten how slim the phone was.
4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.

9036	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased the NewTrent IMP52D Mobile Power Pack. It is easy to operate and even has an LED laser pointer and a small white LED for flashlight use. The laser pointer is easily visible 50 feet away, but the flashlight LED could be brighter. This power pack can be charged with any of your devices plug-in chargers or from a USB port on your PC. It even comes with a carrying case for the unit and its two cables.
4792	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Most of the negative reviews of this charger are because people were expecting a fully automatic "smart charger" which is unrealistic at this price. But, the good news is, if you have overnight to charge you batteries, most don't need a smart charger. This is a "trickle" charger and, while it takes longer to charge your batteries, there's little risk of leaving the batteries charging for up to several days at a such low rate (for those who don't believe this, check the battery manufacture datasheets). It also won't cause your batteries to heat up, shortening their life, like a fast charger will.
3753	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this a couple of months ago and it already quit working. It felt heavy duty when I first got it and thought it would be great to power my iPhone. It burnt out and i took it apart. When i got it apart i found lead weights hot glued into it to make it feel heavy. Too funny that Chinese ingenuity. The part is junk.
bottom line, looks good and fits perfect and great price.
4590	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought this one as a replacement for my wife's BlueAnt Z9i.  Works just fine.  No frills!
6/13/08 Enough already! I replaced it with a Nokia E51. On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive, they require deliberate use, and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway. The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?
10. Voice command with this headset and the W755 works exactly as it should. (hint: change your contact names to phoenetically match ...i.e., spell them in a way that they are likely to be pronounced... this helps voice recognition a lot, and I've been doing things this way for voice command for years.)

1760	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've been comparing 8 different headsets. The Jabra BT500 and the Plantronics Voyager 510 are both at the top. (I also liked the Samsung WEP200 but it's a different style so I won't compare it here) I work in a noisy construction environment and drive a noisy construction van so background noise is a huge issue. Plus I need the headset to stay put even when I'm lying on the ground, sideways, etc. This over and behind the ear style works well for me. I tested all 8 headsets by pairing two at a time and putting one in each ear, then switching between them while on the same call. This let me and the caller compare the sound quality equally from both sides of the call. In a nutshell, the Jabra BT500 wins on function and the Plantronics 510 wins on sound quality. Given that background noise is such a big issue for me, I have to go with the 510. The BT500 has better designed buttons that both feel and work better. But, the sound problems are: 1) The BT500 always sounds slightly more muffled, even in a quiet environment 2) The BT500 has the mic so close to your face that it often touches and makes noise, especially when trying to use a button and 3) in a noisy environment the Plantronics 510 wins hands down. With the kind of background noise I get, I couldn't use the Jabra BT500. I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound. For those that would use this in a quiet environment I can say that the sound quality is only slightly worse than the 510 and may not outweigh the better function of the BT500.
I tested it indoors where I am using the older version, in the exact same spot, with the antenna in the same precise location.  I also turned off the other one when testing to avoid interference.  To no avail.

*I have cell phone amplifiers, wifi routers, cellphone microcell stations, and regular AM/FM powered antennas. The "Radio/Microwave" setting doesn't really spike out next to these devices unless I'm within 5ft of them - rather odd.

After trying four units, I've concluded that the product does not work as advertised.  In contrast, I've also tried the Wilson cellular repeaters and they seem to work great.

4.  Keypad: Well organized, decent color schemes, ergonomically designed and everything in its place. Some people whine about the T-Mobile logo but its no bother for me.
Speakerphone is loud with good quality, and camera just average.
I just ordered a Plantronics Legend. Many have recommended it as a classic best choice. Unfortunately it is only one ear. Better than crappy performance in 2 ears.
I have a mixture of sizes and capacities, and threw a bunch of them in it the first night.  Some were conditioned and others just charged.  I pulled about half of them off of it three or four hours later when the lights turned green, and the others were on it for over 13 hours (still red when I went to work in the morning, turned green sometime during the day while I was gone).
Then, after mapping signal strength throughout my attic, I finally found a spot where I could get 5 bars on my cell phone.  I located my antenna there and ran it through the ceiling to the desired location for my base station.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I now had 4 or 5 bars near the location of the base unit.  That, at least, gives me one spot in my home where I can reliably make phone calls.
2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases).  Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon.  It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail.  Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...

I have found I can get 3 full charge cycles for the iPhone 4 before the IMP500 runs out which is quite impressive.  As I indicated above, I only just recently purchased the iPad 2 so I have not yet tested to see how many cycles I can get from the IMP500 but plan on testing it out this weekend.

Pros:
6294	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery pack will charge your iphone several times.  It is compact and easy to carry in your briefcase.  It doesn't plug directly into the iphone so you will need to also carry a charging cord.  The unit is very solid and I would recommend it.
This is NOT a Microsoft cable and neither charging or sync work.
The only real complaint I have is that the lights are a bit too bright for my taste.  Putting something over the puck solves that problem.  Other folks might like the "night light" effect.
621	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was pleasantly surpised with the quality of this map.  The price was 1 cent so I was a little skeptical but once I opened it and rolled it out I was quite happy.

2468	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone.  The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.  However, I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been.  I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time.  I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset.
981	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have loved the switch from T-Mobile.  Every day is new experience.  I will highly recommend Verizon Wireless with a Droid phone any day.
Controls are low-profile and easy to find
The unit really is not a "stick it on the wall or window" type of unit in my opinion
3679	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This item looks to be what must be originally sold through Verizon. Works fine charging in a reasonable amount of time and doesn't cost much.

3360	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I needed the component hookup for the Wii, and this was one of the better looking inexpensive cable sets out there.  The cables themselves seem a little lightweight, but the signal is passed through properly from the Wii to the TV set.  Granted it costs a lot less than a genuine Nintendo cable, but given its use where it will remain connected all the time, it does the job well for the price.

2976	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	PROS:
More, with another person in the office (or a spouse at home,) who also owns a Dragon? You get full duplex (both can talk over the other) communication between the paired Dragon devices. I'm told that the Dragon does up to eight devices (for storage in memory...) although I've only tried five at the same time--I'd it is just as easy as the five devices I have at this point. The dual noise cancelling Mic allows me to drive with the windows down or talk in a loud environs with no issues. GREAT PRODUCT! Highly recommended. I can't wait to try their conference phone product (the phoenix.) You'll like this very much. It's even fun to use with the PS3 Voice Morphing that came on the newest firmware for Sony's Blu-Ray Baby.
Plus, all the manual that came enclosed with the phone where written in russian or some language from an ex-URSS country.
However, it is a somewhat flimsy cord, and if you crimp it near the ends (for instance, sitting down with my iPod in my pocket) it may cause internal breaks in the connection.

I plugged it into my computer to test it and it both fit and charged my cell phone perfectly.  I plan on using this at home, and it's inexpensive enough to buy one for work, in the car and other places when I need to charge the phone elsewhere.
Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well, so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me: the Bluetooth transmitter.
Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM.  I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone.  I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average.  The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking.  Another issue is the cramped key pad.
5. A micro-usb to 3.5mm audio jack adapter

I saw this case and thought what have I got to lose?  Even with shipping it came in under $10.00.  I can say that I was just amazed at how nice the case was when I got it!!  It does look professional, and I like the magnetic closure much more than the velcro closures.
These units ARE picky about battery voltages. If the AA batteries are partially discharged, it might not see them.  In terms of battery usage, using regular rechargables, you can expect to get one full charge on your phone from the batteries because of the high voltage requirement of the charger to start up.  There'll still be juice left in the AA's, but good luck getting the little chip inside these chargers to wake up.
7. The black device looks very nice.
Itap predictive text.
The fit is not that great for my 7-5/8 hat size. I cannot get the mike in front of my mouth and the over the head strap will not extend as far as I would like it to.

The only down fall is the fit of the device on the ear. I had to tilt it into a certain angle to let it stay firm on my ear at the same time hearing the sound clearly, but one should be able to do that in couple days.
9316	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Nice one.

The included rubber ear loops aren't easy to use. With enough fiddling, we got them to hold the unit securely, though. Jabra ear gels work as replacements, but the unit won't fit in the charger with the gel attached.

* Storage pouch, charger, different sizes of bud tips included.
Volume is fine--It can be louder than you'll want if you start by turning up the volume on your phone/ipod/etc-- there should be plenty of decibel range. (or turn down the volume on your phone if you can't get the volume low enough).

4070	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I have to say that I gave these headsets a fighting chance -- I am on my FOURTH set.  There weren't many alternatives for us folks who want wireless headsets while we work out or run.  But they always, always break.  And the bluetooth Ipod adapter, which is clunky, never works as well as the Sony dongle.  I would add that these headphones are not really comfortable, tend to ride the buds out of the ears as one runs, and can't be worn at the same time as sunglasses.  My latest set melted down just before a half marathon -- suddenly, they no longer take a charge.
Overall, I am pleased with my improved signal reception.  Two thumbs up for this product.
9627	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great value.
3967	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Was received 3 days after shipped.  Great surprise!  After pairing up with my phone I was stunned at how well it sounded.  The party I was talking to said it was very clear on their end and they sounded like they were in the car with me.  Price was exceptional and wished I'd gotten one of these months ago.

The Tab 2 is ONLY SLIGHTLY thicker so the VERY top and bottom bow out very, very little.  And the mic hole next to the headphone plug is covered up.  But the other areas are clear.  Power is very stiff and vol rockers are also very stiff but that is how it is made.

 22kHz polyphonic speaker with MP3 ringer support
I got this phone the nanosecond it was available as a replacement for my V710, which was having issues with it's charger.  With new-every-two, I got a great deal on it.  I was initially disappointed in some features that were different than the V710: you have to open the flip to use the side keys to change volume or engage the speakerphone, the dedicated camera key is gone and the voice mail key is now a voice memo key, which I find less useful.  I must also be the only person in the solar-system to actually PREFER Motorola's interface rather than Verizon's.  But I am getting over that.  It's also harder to get the memory card out of this one as opposed to the V710, which is odd considering that since the easiest way to get MP3's to the card is to do so from a card reader, you are going to be pulling the card out a lot.  (V-Cast music software does not work with a Mac, and actually doesn't work with my last-year vintage Dell PC at work)  The bit covering the charging port is tethered by a bit of plastic that puts the cover in exactly wrong place for the charger and the optional (and useless) headset.  It should have been either left off or slid back out of the way.  Oh, and I wish the time was larger on the outer display, and visible without lighting, like the GSM RAZR's
For the other features (speakerphone, wireless headset) it's a unique and functional, albeit somewhat expensive, device. I have not tried Skype integration and I remain very disappointed about the failure to interoperate with the iPhone.
2. No user replaceable battery, with a maximum number of charges specified at 400. Basically, it appears Motorola expects you to throw this device away when the Li-Ion battery will no longer charge. I would prefer the ability to send the unit in for battery replacement and not further contribute to the burgeoning electronic waste issue. If you're a big talker and max out at 6.5 hours per day, you will get 400 days of life from the H710. One thing that is clear, don't recharge until necessary, as you are counting down from 400 on the life of the headset.
5418	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	the skin is very well made and very precise.  I would prefer more skin around the front of the blackberry.
Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.
9169	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Back when I purchased this it was doing an admirable job of charging my MP3 player and GPS. Times quickly change. Now everything is integrated into my phone and my phone is ONLY charged via USB.  In terms of longevity, this thing has paid for itself. When I'm on a plane, the extra power is generally used to keep charge at 100% while I enjoy an hour of casual gaming. Plane lands. Phone is still charged. Bonus: the A/C adapter is compact and useful by itself when paired with a USB cable.
We now have 3-5 bars all over our house, deck, porch, and even garage!  Calls are clear and there is no breaking up or dropping of calls.
i didn't like it
I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and my phone just fits in the holder. This weBoost system does seem to boost my signal. There are areas that I typically drive through that have low signal. That is not an issue now. However, I really hate the fact that your phone must sit in a stationary holder attached to your dashboard. I have to use my speaker phone or a wireless head set which I don't like to do. I really wanted something that boosts my signal more outside of the car. I particularly have issues in certain areas at work. While I could probably install this weBoost at a stationary spot in work, I need my boost to be more mobile and work as I walk around the warehouse.

I received the earbuds, 3 set of ear tips, 1 charger with 2 ports,  USB cable, and a bag.
The charging system is my favorite part of this headset you can charge from anything.
My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car, even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials, and over my bluetooth to boot.
i got it to sync back to the PC software database. i will have to look for an alternative.

I bought two more for my father and brother. Great product!
6680	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	it is listed as good for 2500 sq feet it was only good for 18 inches. i called wilson tec services and they recomended additional equipment that would have  cost and additional $500+
Can't recommend this enough!!! Get it! You'll be shocked at what's going on around you!

2054	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This impossibly small (1.5-inch, 1/3 ounce) Bluetooth headset is the perfect compliment to slick phones such as the Razr V3. Jabra did a nice job not rushing it to market merely because of its irresistible size. You WILL forget you're wearing it; it's that comfortable. Great with sunglasses, too. It's loud enough for most environments (car windows down...NO). It sounds surprisingly good for both incoming and outgoing calls, although there's a faint hiss at all times that I don't get with the new Logitech Mobile Traveller headset. While sibilants were a bit exaggerated on the Jabra, it sounded clearer to people I called than some other headsets, with less of an "underwater" sound. You can charge it with the included stand, or directly from the charger (awesome), or directly via included USB cable from your computer. This Bluetooth 1.2 headset works with virtually any Bluetooth phone in both Handsfree and Headset profiles.
I recommend buying 4 or 5 of them since they're pretty cheap and increasing order size doesn't change shipping costs.
7865	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Purchased from Eforcity, US seller that I've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price.  Not this case.  Item is the proper fit, and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack (ie thin).
With the booster installed:Ping 108, download 232, upload 325 kbps This is using the app speedtest.net and this is me 20 feet away from the desktop Wilson antenna! Great product, can't wait to install on my roof and see the results! Some other comments, I have no heat on the connections at the booster amplifier that other people have reported. Also some people have said that the booster will not increase signal. For me that was not true, because I did receive 41% standing at my front windows and a very noticeable improvement signal of 65% at the front of the desktop antenna. Wilson also has a panel antenna that you can replace the desktop antenna for improved and wider signal in house reception and other types of antennas to replace the cradle antenna. So far I don't think I will need any of these, but its nice to know this is a product that you can use additional addons to support different situations. Glad I made this purchase!
2. The length for the earbud is not long enough to stay inside the ear, and another reason for this is because the back of Noise Shield area is so thick that somehow not allow your earbud insert deeper to your ear.

7081	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great extension to my cell phone life.  Although it doesn't seem to have the same potential to last as long as the original battery, it is certainly better than the charge every day battery it replaced.
91	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This charger works well. It charges pretty fast and hasn't gotten weaker as most of the other chargers do. No problems at all.
plantronics discovery 610-super light-super comfortable. defective earpiece design, even the "improved earpieces" are no good.  Glue it together if you really like it.
Overall it was super simple to disassemble and the screen was a snap to install. There was an issue with the ribbon cable management and the HDD but just did a work around. Turned it on and it was like brand new!!!
In short, this phone is not recommended. Purchasing a bigger phone with bigger buttons that are actually useable and a battery life that can last carry one through a business day are much better options.
Basically, make sure you know the phone/mp3 player/whatever the device is standard.  Don't blame the car if you buy the wrong seat covers. Don't blame the headset if you purchase it for the wrong device!

Pros: Will securely hold a variety of phones, quality craftmanship & materials for the price.

---------------------------------



5354	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This product is great and performs well. The sound quality is fine, for phone use or at the gym.  However, as others have noted, the cord on one side is WAY TOO SHORT. So if you are using both sides, its a bit awakward and hard to use. But I have been albe to use it while jogging outside, but just have to be aware of the cords.
Movie (3GP) player.  You can rip dvds and convert them into the 3GP format and watch movies on your phone

1300	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have purchased both the Smoke HS850 and the Black HS850. The smoke version had an echo giving the effect of being down a hallway, with pops on high pitched sounds. I expected the black version to be similar. The price difference and ability to prevent hitting the button by closing the headset made it worth the sound issues. When this product arrived I was amazed to see that it was nothing like it's smoke-colored version. The clarity was great on both ends, with no pops or echos. This is not the US version, as shown by the included european adapters, but it definately should be. The bass does become a bit jumbled at full volume, but not enough to make the conversation unclear.
2270	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It charges my Yaesu VX-8DR just fine. The Radio itself is designed funny. When I plug it in sometimes the radio turns off, and sometimes it stays on. Sometimes it lets me transmit and sometimes it just turns off. I'm not blaming this car adapter since my official Yaesu wall adapter does the same thing. The radio is one of the coolest handheld radios out there, but not being able to transmit while plugged in or charge it while using it is just strange. Every electronic device out there lets you use it and charge it at the same time. Oh well. At least this will charge it, just don't plan on using it until it is done charging. I've heard of other people having this same issue so I don't know if it is a defect in my radio or not since other reviewers say they can transmit while plugged in. I'm confused.



Finally!  One that works.
smartphones, or perhaps an iPad overnight, but that's not what it was
3919	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for a good shower head and this one got good reviews.  I really do like it.  It is slightly adjustable, so that's nice as I'm short and my boyfriend is tall (over 6').  It works for both of us.  We removed the flow control piece and it works very well.  I'm happy with it.
5798	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I love this fone and been looking around for a new one but its impossible to find one so i came accross this seller with his high rating. Unfortunately the fone has used parts, if not all of of it is used. The key pad looks used, the front screen isn't fixed properly not to mention that itsn't the original screen it could have been taken from a demo fone or just a fake screen. This product is fishy and the speaker isn't clear.
The good news, is that when I simply put the antenna in the back of my car and let it get signals through my back window, I did get better reception. So maybe that is the best way to use it. It may not give you maximum reception, but it gives me marginally better and that is worth the purchase.

4244	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a very well constructed leather carrying case for the iPhone.  You can attach this to your belt and have the headset plugged in at the same time.  The case is tight, well designed and protects the iPhone while in the case.  The case is very tight at first, because it is leather, but will stretch slightly.  You cannot fit anything other than an iPhone (meaning no extra protective sleeve) in the case.
A few other reasons I love my Jabra SP5050 -- over the past few years we've owned four different cars with factory systems built into the car.  The most expensive car we own has a built-in system, yet -- despite the brand's reputation for German Engineering -- the hands-free BT system is nearly unusable after the car hits 30 mph. Too much noise, and you end up switching to the handset itself to make yourself heard. My wife HATES it if I even call her using the BT/hands-free system in this car.
7878	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a no frill basic adapter that allows you to use a normal set of headphones on the 1G iPhone.  Don't expect too much, as it's a basic black cable, nothing fancy ... but it gets the job done.  The best part is that it's ONLY $3 and some change (includes shipping) versus some of those $10+ cords / adapter out there.
5594	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap... go for it. The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason. You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap. However, you still can easily unsnap the case off and I'm just glad the phone hasn't fallen out yet. The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip. This is annoying when trying to answer a call or trying to get to a text message. The only pro about this product is that it's cheap.


6599	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great !  Exactly what I needed in an all metal barn.

1639	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It took me just a little time to get used to this headset but I do love it. I have to admit that for the price, it works really well. Sometimes, it loses connection even though the power is on and bluetooth is blinking blue light, but if you reset it, it reconnects. Sometimes, I have not heard calls come in so reliability for me has been around 95%. I am giving it 4 stars because for the price and comfort, it works quite well. Watch out for battery drainage on the cell so if not using, make sure to power off the bluetooth Power On to Off. It is a concern not to lose it - it's small and without wires. I left it in the Juice store but it was right there when I went back (lucky me)!
7304	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Cons:
Hmmm, the signal strengths were almost identical, and the apparent call quality was unchanged.
Aside from charging your phone pretty quickly (if you're not in a dead spot) this charger will be able to charge your phone multiple times. It won't be able to charge it more than two times or so up to 100%, for that you'd need to check something with more than 5,200 mAh such as the New Trent: iCarrier IMP120D - (12000mAh) but it will provide at least six to seven more hours of usage, which is what you need to keep your phone alive until you get home to your sanctuary of electric outlets and unlimited energy.
I've never heard and echo, nor received complaints of others hearing one.
6432	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I had a different phone with a different mic. That phone died and wanted to start using my newer phone to plug my car stereo in and using the lapel mic to talk hands free while driving. In the past nobody has had any problems with this kind of setup...

5887	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
Caveat: The first one I got had a faulty microphone, no one could hear me. After laboriously working through Kensington's tech support, I did get a new one shipped to me at no cost that worked fine.






1) The glue used for the felt lining doesn't dry up completely; so whenever I slide the phone in and out, some gooey residue sticks on my screen.
To be fair, today's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself, or a wired headset, because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz (i.e. 8,000 audio samples per second), while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz (16,000 audio samples per second). That is why today's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.

Looks like a very well constructed product for the price.
  1. Not all songs on your computer can be played on the phone they have to be in mp3 format, often you can convert music files and your cd's with free software such as Freerip which will enable you to convert them to mp3 format. After this is done you can change the extensions to .3gp and play them or set them as ringtones.

6772	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Replaced on my G-Shock
Now the bad.  This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay.  It is pure torture to wear.  The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears.  I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling.


9495	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Improved cell service significantly!
The only thing I don't love is that it makes it difficult to use the pulse oximeter on the back of the phone if you have slightly long nails, because of the angle. It'd also be cool if this came in a different colours, or came with a few different cases (since it makes it impossible to use other third-party cases). Otherwise, it's really great and I'm looking to buy one for my Note 4, now.

7480	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this phone as a backup to my E51, but this phone is just waiting to see some action. I used it a few days and tested it out. I love the dedicated music circuit, it sounds wonderful. The controls are easy to use on the whole phone. In two days I was wizzing around through the menu. the blue is so nice, and the only complaint is the internet is tough to configure. Maybe I'm not as tech savy as I thought, but phones never make it easy, none. I do think overall this phone is great. It has a clear voice setting that really brings out the mid to high levels in voices while on the phone. I couldn't tell you what menu it's on. It's truly the best phone for people who dislike flip slide or giant I Phones that feel like your carrying a computer. this phone is like the zoolander phone small, and light easy to use, and without complications. This model works on att and t-mobile. 850 and 1900. The 3.5 mm headphone jack is so cool to connect easily to your computer speakers, stereo, at a friends house on the go jams. It sounds as good as my I pod nano 4th gen. At 200 dollars it's a little pricey. It should be around 140 dollars in my opinion.
The item itself is made of hard leather with a very thin felt liner which wouldn't protect your GPS from damage if it fell onto hard concrete.  This is more of a carrying case to be packed into something else.

HS805 Uses a battery, but had the best sound
4739	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the best headset I've used so far. Years ago I experiented with inexpensive motorola headsets and got no where. Eventually I purchased a Platronics Voyager 510, and it was great. I heard people's conversation well and it was extremely comfortable. I was perfectly fine with it, but my girlfriend wasn't so happy. She said she often have trouble hearing me speak. I hang on to my 510 for almost 2 years before taking a risk at something new, the Jawbone. I was pleasantly surprised. I purchased it at Amazon for about $80 dollar, about what i would expect for a top of the line product. From my end, there was pro and cons. It was more stylish and more comfortable. Unfortunately, the volume button is next to the end button and it was hard to deal with at first. Another problem was that my now 2 year old phone would randomly disconnect from the Jawbone. I was still optomistic and it was time for a new phone anyway. I then purchased the Razr 2, and my connection problem went away. The best part of all this is that my girlfriend tells me that she can hear me, even when i'm outdoor and event next to a concert hall. I think the noise cancelling technology really works and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay between $50-$100 range. Althought I really don't know if you can get a better headset if you pay more...


I mostly use it for the music because I got tired of people complaining about the sound quality of the phone. I use a HTC Touch Pro 2 phone btw.
7698	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	works great

71	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.
All in all I think it is a good charger. People just need to be careful that the first charge doesn't heat up their product too much. Setting the item on something that will conduct heat away (marble counter, sandstone coaster, glass table, etc.) will help with that issue somewhat. As will taking it out of its case.

I wish I hadn't had to purchase this headset twice, but it should say something that I tried other types and came back to the Motorola H series (second time around was the HS850, not really different from this one at all that I can tell).
670	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This one is the best out of all the other sticky pads, if you want the large one. Holds very good


Buy one now, you know you need it.  Save yourself from that feeling of haplessness that comes with forgetting to plug your battery operated electronics in.

The device uses four blue LED lights to show charging status/remaining capacity. It is very intuitive, and pleasing to see.
When I  got up I began using  the battery i used my iPhone 3, an iPhone 4, an iPad with retina display, a fifth generation iPod, a HP Mini notebook and the new Kendle 16 gig HD e reader.  How impressive it worked on every device I had.

8193	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I got 2 of these for 2 chocolates I have that I lost the power cords for. I got them in the mail and plugged them right in and they started charging right away with no problems. The only downside I could see is they feel a little flimsy but they get the job done and as long as I don't go throwing these around or treating them like garbage they will last a while.

1080	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Love everything except... my reception is poor. People that I am talking to say they hear an echo when they talk. I am waiting for my third replacement.

I like the Treo 680, but I had to read all of the instructions, call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone.  For example, I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.)

Summary

This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material. Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in, still doesn't work a lot of times. So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.
6561	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	TOUGH environment for a cell phone. Had no service at all, as expected, inside an all-aluminum Coastal Cruiser (boat) sheltered under a roof. PLUS, low signal area with 1 bar only at best and sometimes NO SERVICE, even in the parking lot. Have 4 bars now! Gains both set at 50db. Crystal clear both ways and no drops. UNIT does what it claims! Set up took about an hour to run the coax and mount the outside antennae onto an upper railing. Used power strip surge protector at 1000 Joules, as recommended so as to sleep better during storms.
BUT, as many have probably mentioned, you need a good signal at the antenna location.  Our unit was donated by an employee who tried it at home unsuccessfully.  His signal was spotty on the roof, so there's no surprise it didn't work.  But for an office environment where there's a good signal outside and the building makes it spotty inside, this is an excellent solution.
The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a "tri-band" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.
6681	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is an old style DT signal booster. It does not have an adjustable gain control. I expected this booster to have adjustable gain control as I contacted Wilson before I purchased this item to know what to buy.

Good luck..

  I get worried when these newer type chargers run so hot and this one is no exception, but it kept me running for four days, charging quickly so I could keep up my schedule.  It charges quickly, but hot and seems to charge my Apple iphone faster than the Apple iphones wall wart chargers.
I'm not sure though about how correct the reading are.

I've been using the headset for 6 months now, so I think it's a good time to give it a fair (personal) review.

1. Battery does not last that long.  It gives you about 3 hours of music playback.  I do not talk that much on the phone so no comment on talk time.
I'm a realist... I understand that the pursuit of music reproduction quality can generally always be made better by the liberal application of money.  But it becomes a truly diminishing return in my opinion.  I wanted better sound quality at a price my checking account would appreciate and that I would actually hear.  The Magni 2 and Modi 2 hit the mark.
8913	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the iTorch IMP52D about a week ago and have played with it for a few days. The product is easy to use and doesn't take a rocket scientist to operate it. The simple instructions that came in the box show exactly how to use it for those who are new to the tech world. I was able to sustain my battery on my tablet while traveling with my son last weekend. No need for extra charging ports in my car which was already occupied by my phone charger.

Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.
CALLS: I haven't had any problems with receiving calls or making calls. Haven't had a call dropped yet, and I end up driving through the mountains at times.

Plantronics switched from their proprietary connector to a standard micro USB (the same as on the Kindle 2). The bundled neckband cleverly features a micro USB plug so you can easily attach the headset when not in use.

As a test, I walked nearly 30 feet away from my phone and my music wasn't interrupted.  About 33-35 feet is the range limit.
5992	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and for some reason he wanted this instead of just a charging case, and he absolutely LOVES it. He's been raving about it all week.


8027	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased tis phone from a local store and after a month it started to die  within about 8 hours. I called customer service and they promptly sent out a new battery only tohave the same problem return. I called them that same day and they sent me a new phone which I received in 2 days . The new one works fine and I would recommend Net10 to anyone that wants a great phone coupled to great customer service. They definately stand behind their product.
The bad: As good as the noise cancelation is it does not resolve direct wind noise or a screaming kid in the car, some things can just not be overcome. No headset has solved this problem yet. The ear pieces are cheap and break from time to time when trying to bend or store them, but there are 6 of them. This does not transport very well because of the size and I worry about it in my pocket unprotected. I ripped the back button off while removing the charger once, but Aliph replaced it for free quickly while under warranty in the first year. Some phones (cheap low end phones) have echo problems with the noise cancelation.
My fingernail scratches it. In other words, common objects (keys, credit cards, pens, pencils, even tissue paper ect...) in the real world will WTFPWN your screen. Making the rare decent application at risk of looking like that CD that has been kicking around in your trunk for 8 years... Seriously. Also the product smudges so easily that the smudges have smudges, I literally had whole armies of smudges constantly battling on my screen.
Guess, I will have to file a dispute with AMX.
9760	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great in old commemorative pocket watch I had put away years ago.  Batteries came packaged well, on time, and at a great price.
Buy one, you won't be sorry.
5989	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	From sitting on the couch because the USB cord isn't long enough to saving your life in an accident with a dead phone in No Man's Land, this product is one of the many very useful New Trent products for many reasons listed below:
2) The on/off switch on the headset is very small & stiff.  I have to remember to turn the headset on Before putting it on due I can't manage the on/off while the headset is on my ear. I can live with that given my great satisfaction with every other feature. Noting also that it took me a bit to figure out the on/off button is a 'slide forward to toggle' (i.e. is not a little push button).
4. People on the other end report a slight echo.  As soon as I deactivate the headset, the echo goes away.
If you enjoy sending messages and carrying a piece of your office on the road this is DEFINITELY worth checking out.
6786	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchase this battery back in 2013 and use two worked well, try to change for the third time, all three remaining new batteries are dead, evidently shelf life on these are not the best.  If you are like me changing occasionally, getting large pack don't pay off.
6821	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	thank you. Ill buy again

7371	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this cell phone as a replacement for the one I had which was generally used as a backup or extra phone should any of my kids would be going on a field trip. The cell phone look and features was quite different from the earlier one I had from AT&T. Up to this time, I can not set the clock on the phone. It doesn't have a day light saving feature. Right now, it is showing an hour ahead of the real time, and I cannot set the time.
9364	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I don't want to add much to already reviewed feautures. I bought this phone in Nov 2007 and till now did not have single problem.
1.  The gels come off TOO easily!

The Laser is not a very high quality laser (in fact I had to adjust the metal that was surrounding the laser port so that it wouldn't dissipate as quickly)
TONs of software: It runs Symbian OS, so there are lots of programs/games to install.  I have installed 'Active Desk' [a replacement desktop/theme organizer] and AgileMessenger [supports MSN, Yahoo, AOL, ICQ and other IMs] along with 'Extended Profiles' [lets you custimize when differnet profiles come on, or how long they last + more].  Check the Yahoo groups for 3650- there are several of them with lots of good backgrounds, games, ringtones, etc.  There are replacement web browsers [Opera, NetFront], screen savers, IR Remote software, and even a Gameboy emulator [haven't tried this one yet].  Hell, there are even movies you can download and watch on the unit [once you get a larger MMC card].
Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer. It's a 5-star.
Service from Elago Design was prompt and the item came as described.
Overall, I like the headset and hope Motorola continues to make these available. I can't imagine having to use one that plugs into my ear canal given the amount of traveling I do. At that point, I will go back to the wired type.
Negatives

5491	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Didnt work
I hope they make one for the Tab 2 7", but until then, for me, this is the ONLY way to roll.

-It would charge higher capacity devices slower, but then again maybe its because other devices have a high capacity storage.
4619	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent! ordering 2 more.

As typical with Amazon buys, this showed up at my doorstep nearly INSTANTANEOUSLY !!  At least, I ordered like midnight on Thursday, and it was here before noon Monday !!!!
96	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	what a great product!!! !Samsung Galaxy S2 Phone OEM Official Travel USB Charger (Detachable, comes with OEM USB to Micro USB Cable)!

Overall, I like the headset and hope Motorola continues to make these available. I can't imagine having to use one that plugs into my ear canal given the amount of traveling I do. At that point, I will go back to the wired type.
Better yet, just don't get this phone.  The super-sensitive buttons not only make it a game of Russian Roulette to keep the phone in your pocket, but it also makes it a little aggravating to navigate the menus, as lightly touching the wrong button will activate that button, sending you down the wrong menu path.  So even if you use a holster and are careful to not accidentally activate the phone, you'll then have to deal with a finnicky interface.
Battery on/off: 3 second hold of the power button(letting go of power button at 3 second will turn off battery)
4) your TV probably has stereo input jacks, which will help avoid a problem discussed below.
5042	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This item is great if you have a phone case which prevents full access of a reagular head set jack. it prevents you from having to get another case or modify your existing one.

*too costly at $80 for what you get

So the case was inexpensive and secure but added bonus, it looks very classy.  Black, sturdy looking leather outside, soft, tan kid glove type leather inside.  It goes well with a suit.  I've now had two of them.
2.) Dual 12V VPA and dual USB

Apps are easily loaded - I've got sbp pocket plus running on there and it improves the interface nicely and also supports finger scrolling (ha iphone users take that!)
These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)



I've also found that the battery will charge my dead phone (iPhone 5) somewhere between 2 and 3 times depending mostly on if I let it charge or if I start using it while its charging.
The laser pointer and flashlight are both bonus features that I don't see myself using that often, but the same situations that require an emergency charger also call for a flashlight, so that's a benefit.  Read the manual as others have stated, the procedure for turning on the separate features isn't exactly instinctive.

=====================================
Anyway, back to the BT500.
Overall this phone does have a lot to offer (especially if you get it for free or for less than $30) but it simply does not hold its own when compared to the other music phone options that are available.
Bottom line, if you have to pinch every penny, the z-boost works.  But, I recommend this one for $30 more because of great US based production and support.
3192	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I didn't see any improvement on my signal at all.  I tried using at the campground where I have my toy hauler and put it on the window.  Did nothing for me.  Maybe because I have a 4 g phone (Mororola Razr maxx) by verizon and maybe the fequency channel is different but, for whatever reason it did nothing at all.
5865	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've had the Motorola F3 for about a month now, and I cannot imagine a more perfect phone for me. It does all the things a phone should do, and it does them very well: (1.) Strong Signal (2.) Long battery life (under my "normal" use, ie about five short calls per day, a single charge lasted me seven days--AMAZING!) (3.) Small and light, I hardly notice it's in my hip pocket (4.) Sturdy and durable, solid as a rock (5.) Easy to use and read: the e-ink display is as easy to read as ink on paper, even in direct sunlight.
...at least with mine.
but there's one big minus: very short battery, only lasts about 3 hours under hifi mode, but I am not surprised considering small size, though I want to have 5 hours or more battery

BUY FROM SOME OTHER MANUFACTURER!!!!!!
9426	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Thing actually works! I am happy with this purchase.
A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies. Go 'head on, Motorola.

7965	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	good holder for your Ipod, phone or gps they hold. I had one on my Ipod for 2yrs. this one for the wife bike. the good you will not be disappointed.
1221	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	very good it works well with all phones and it has a very clear tone to it.
3215	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I installed the antenna as per instructions and it did NOTHING. Zilch.... Nada
7838	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for use with my Mophie Juice Pack Plus External Battery Case for iPhone 5 after the included cable died. Sound quality isn't changed from if I just plug my headphones directly into my phone. Mini remote on Bose headphone (probably others too) and microphone (talking on the phone) also work with this extender. I feel like eventually it will give out but I have 4 as back ups!
3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.
least 3 full charges right in the back of your pocket! the silver trim is
2016	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better.
4774	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	IF YOU WEAR THIS DEVICE, YOU WILL HEAVE YOUR EARS BLISTER OR TURN RED. IT HURT SO BAD AFTER A FEW MINUTES WEARING IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT LOOK LIKE THE 60 STYLE EAR MUFF
2442	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Here is your basic no thrills case for your bluetooth Headset.  IMHO you need something to put your bluetooth into, and here it is.  It stretches out, front and back are hard, and elastic holds the sides together with a velcro close on the top that stretches over.  On the back is a metal clamp to clip onto your belt or such.

3557	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Worked with a Durafon, but very tight. I was able to do a little filing on the duraphone to get it working well. Much less expensive than the OEM part and works just as well. Also works on any other phone that you can stick or screw the tab to.
This device basically will provide excellent cell signal to an area about the size of your office desk.  The inside antenna is really designed to sit on the corner of your desk.  It works really well for that.  It WILL NOT improve coverage inside your entire home, floor, etc.  Get their other, more expensive model for that purpose.  I wound up returning it and getting the zBoost SOHO which is working fine.
If you ever got to check out Jawbone's demo video on their website, you'll see the actor showing you how well it works when you're at super-noisy places. What he doesn't show you, is when the volume in the surrounding area is, say in an office where there're people talking around you. What does it mean? It means the noise cancellation only works in very noisy environment.
4981	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Apple, as usual, continued to display its stupid game-play attitude by creating a recessed headphone jack on the 1st Gen iPhone (which I own). I had other pair of headphones which are 200 times better than the stock headphones apple provides. I went ahead and bought this and now I listen to all my music/watch videos/podcasts, etc on my nicer in-ear headphones. It's been over 15 months now, and the adapter isn't showing any sign of wear/tear. Good thing about this adapter is - It's smaller in size, maybe 4 inches in length (end to end), Plug your headphones into these and you're ready to go! Recommend this to everyone.
Last word: Very good phone. Overall package - can do better.
1555	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great sound quality in the car. People hear me OK even with the music in the car (not blasting), and when the windows are slightly open.
So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.  I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.
8246	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is one tough case.  A little heavy, but it really protects the phone.  I dropped mine off a combine onto the concrete and scuffed the case but didn't hurt the phone.  I have also had a cup of beer dumped on me and all it did to the phone was make the trackball a little sticky for a couple of days.  Great case for people with dirty hobbies or jobs.
2268	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product for the safty of you radio.. It takes the risk out of over charging your radio.  Cars are 12V as we all know but, the charging system is usally 13.8V.  That makes your radio getting 1.8V too much, save your investment by investing a little in this...


3372	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Worked great, nice durable outer casing on the cable, mesh type stuff.  Would buy again.  Colors make it easy to put the plugs where they need to go.

To keep Jawbone stay in my ear, I got a spounge-like cover and just wrap it around the earpiece, and it works 70% of the time as long as I don't shake my head much.
Loud enough to hear when you're driving, even with the windows down on the expressway.
8014	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Item as described.
If you have phones bigger than the iPhone 5, this won't work for you.
4.  Sound:  Good most of the time.  Better than the others I've owned.  Loud.  If you drive the highway this one works well.  Background noise is reduced but not eliminated; and unlike another background reducing Headset I own (from Plantronics also) there is no delay on call pick-up... nice!
6758	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Work as per described.

6055	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the Powerpak iTorch (IMP52D) from New Trent a few days ago. I used it solely for my cell phone charging during this time. (A Nokia Lumia 920 / 2000 mAh Battery)
5819	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I've replaced this a few times from different sources and I don't find these rings go on properly. I've had others try as well and they couldn't get it to fit right either.

Not particularly helpful,
I run distances of 10 miles or more and stream my music via bluetooth to my sunglasses.  This case does not hinder the signal.

* It's big
  Speedtest: 190ms ping, .8 - 1.5 Mbps data transfer
7512	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This phone may be an old model, but its the best phone in durability, reception and sound quality I've ever owned.

There are a few drawbacks, such as a screen that absorbs your face-juice. I'll be honest here: It's summer and when it's hot outside, you perspire. That gets on the screen and doesn't look so nice. I learned to keep an LCD wipe handy to keep it clean.
6101	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	LED light to indicate whether the batter was charged never lit up. First light lit up, second one always blinked regardless of how long I had it charged.

8207	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	i use to carry mini cigars.  very nice finish that can be engraved for that personal touch.
1175	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The one other reviewer was right on when they said this unit is much smaller than the photos make it look. I was a little worried this was a bit large for my desk area. It ISN'T large at all, see the pix I posted.
Cons - (Very Minor Ones):

5757	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This case is listed as "rubber feel" and that's about all the rubber you get :) These tend to be my favorite cases because that little bit of soft rubber-feel gives some extra bounce if/when you drop your phone. Any hard plastic cases I have had in the past have broken when dropped. These cases are a bit more durable/flexible. It -is- a thin plastic like most cases but adds a smooth finish which I think also keeps the phone from feeling slimy like other hard plastic cases can.
There's also the usual selection of programs, like a calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc. The system also comes with a few game demos, none of which are particularly memorable.
Over the Nokia Xpress Music is a great phone with many great features and accesories. Dispite the sort of slow camera I still give it a 5/5. I guarantee you'll get your money's worth.

As for me, I have kept my iPhone 4 in a soft cloth sunglasses pouch with a draw string and then carry that combination in this case. It has worked like a charm.
I purchased my YX500-PCS for use with my T-Mobile Blackberry Pearl 8100 in Saratoga, CA. I live in a one story, 2400 sf, ranch style home with a metal roofing system called "Calpac" that uses formed and coated sheet metal panels to simulate a tile roof. The house structure is wood framing with wood siding on the front side and stucco on the other three. I mention this because this means that my house is at least partially shielded by metal on top and on the three stucco sides (remember that stucco is hung on steel mesh). If you have a similar home, you should seriously consider placing the remote antenna of the YX500 outside of your house and not in the attic as others have done. You don't want to have metal between the antenna and the cell tower.
In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.
6479	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Our office building is in some kind of cell reception shadow. We have learned to stand in a particular corner near the window as its the only place from which you can make a cell call. The weBoost Changed all that. Now the primary weBoost antenna rests in that sacred spot and the repeater units push the reception all the way into our office. We can make calls from our desks, which is, really as it should be.


3552	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works perfect for my LED headlight battery pack. Ive used it for a month now with not a problem. I just followed the directions and it works.
6812	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These are my watch batteries for my citizen watches and sekio watches. I put them in a while ago and going strong.
8293	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	purchased this for my husband, he loves it, could not believe the quality and the price is un heard of.
840	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Lightweight and has longer range than the cheaper brands.  Really comfortable to wear and sleep with.  The earbuds are flat on the outside and therefore not bulky in the ear.  They earbuds really stick to the magnets very well at the tips of the unit.  I bought other cheaper brands and they don't have the range and would drop me.  I can go farther away with the Motorola Buds.
8739	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This so far has been a really good heart monitor strap.  I have had problems with other straps as the moisture getting in it when you ride makes them unreliable.  This one is sealed so you do not have that problem.  We will see how long it lasts.  Will update later.
I'm surprised the price has not dropped at all for this item (although I can understand why as it is a quality product). I bought it 2+ years ago at a Sam's Club for $25.

Happy with the purchase.

Shipped fast and priced right. Thanks
  -Not too grown, looks like it belongs to a child, and perfectly suited for one!
It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone, so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars, taking into account it could have been my unit.
2435	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	For those of us who are active and don't carry purses or wear sport / suit jackets, this is an excellent way to keep from loosing the bluetooth.  This is the only one that I know of on the market.  I must lean over a lot or be very active because I was loosing them.  Put it in here, with the ear piece on the top and fasten the Velcro strap over the ear piece and it is securely stored.  Much cheaper that replacing bluetooth units!
- Loud everything
Update 5/14/2012

And the back looks good according to my taste. The S design looks classy.
I think most people who complain are the ones who fall into the category who don't own a A2DP device. My suggestion to them try some Sony Ericsson or Nokia Multimedia phone and you will know this products ability.

4459	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got burned bad with a generic a while back. Make it a point to get good cables. The price on this cable is fantastic considering the fact that it is Nokia OEM. I've never had one of these to fail.  Well built and a good balance between being too thin and too thick.
  It boosts whatever minimal signal there is where you place the outside antenna
For the price, this is an above average product. Comfort is my real only issue.

2942	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I wanted to use rechargeables (good performance and inexpensive) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.
Well-built with a quality feel

Overall, I'm quite pleased with this device and will recommend it to
BEST CHARGER EVER!
2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.
Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way.
4963	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	So I lost the adapter that came with the Lifeproof case and was really being cheap when I ordered this one. I learned the lesson the hard way :(.  The seller is not at fault here, I actually received my item way ahead of schedule.  The sounds comes through really strange, like its an echo from inside a tin can.  Tried with multiple earbuds/headphones and the problem persisted.  Just go with the real lifeproof adapter if you can find one in stock.
Cons

4) stays closed (one of my rubber skin cases allowed it to pop out of the front - it only took twice for me to trash it and get this one).
8531	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It was so great to find this. These products are no longer being sold in stores and I love this charging system for my car.
-Charges my iPhone and Galaxy Player faster than the computer and car charger.

I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.  It fits into the ear, not over the top, so I am hoping for a better fit.
However, it is a somewhat flimsy cord, and if you crimp it near the ends (for instance, sitting down with my iPod in my pocket) it may cause internal breaks in the connection.
The premise of this product is simple.... a car is a metal box with a small area of windows.  Radio frequency transmission will not penetrate metal...so cell signal both incoming and outgoing are greatly reduced vs. using the phone outside the car.  The booster is designed to take the cell antenna signal from the back of the phone, and carry this signal through an installed cable (included) to a magnetic base antenna mounted atop your roof.  Antenna is easy to remove and put back in the car, such as during a car wash.  The unit is powered via cig. lighter, which assist in carrying both incoming and outgoing signal.

This would be five stars if they were able to multiple buttons to control the device, flashlight and laser pointer.  Also, they could increase the capacity to 7000+mAh.  All in all, solid product.
1531	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The headset works very well.  The noise reduction is not that great, the Jawbone is better at it.  However, the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the Jawbone.  It is light and seems large at first but is very easy to fold up and is quite sturdy.  Especially for the price, this is a great choice!
6530	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my pottery studio since the walls are thick and people do not get very good cell phone service inside. It has increased the number of bars I am getting!
-You can talk and ride up to 25mph then it gets too windy for the other person to hear your voice.
3068	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this case for a brother DS-600 mobile scanner as it was advertised to fit that scanner.  However, upon receipt I could not fit the scanner into the case as it is about 1/2 inch too short.  It is a good quality case, well made and sturdy but they advertise that it will scanners that it clearly can not.
Nicely padded inside for protection.



A second less bulky indoor unit is to be placed indoors within range of the 25' cable.  This is the indoor antenna which I am guessing is what actually does the broadcasting and receiving of cell phone signals.  The antenna has to be placed facing the same direction as the booster.  You can expect more acceptable cell-phone coverage within the room it's installed in.

Other than that, it is a perfect headset.  Since those are minor problems and are typical of other headsets, I rated this model 5 stars.
useful but don't see when you would use them.
2925	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this product hoping that it would provide some privacy when riding the train to work everyday. Although it does, it is minimal at best. It is exactly as advertised, "Mirror Like Screen Protector"... you can see yourself when the iPhone is off as if you were looking in a mirror.
4396	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received this card when I purchased an unlocked phone. Considering I travel a ton, this was a nice freebie.
How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.
5523	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	ive had the mount for a couple weeks and so far it works great. I read some of the other reviews saying it shakes which i don't know how you could avoid that since the whole car is moving. it hasent fallen down or anything. So far it does what it says. it is cheap but thats to be expected for the price. my only complaint was putting it together was annoying. other then that it really is FINE I sell these at my job that are the same quality for 30$ or more so really its not THAT bad.
I recommend it.
Call Sound Quality: Callers sound better through the Jabra than the phone earpiece or speakerphone. Regarding the outgoing sound, I was a little doubtful that the mic would work well hanging on my chest, but the people I've been talking to all said I sound very clear, and better than on the speaker. I haven't had to talk to my chest, as other reviewers have.


Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less.

4666	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have had this for about 2 weeks and the metal clip was coming off.  I then switched to the belt loop and the stiching came apart within days.  Too bad it fits the phone nicely, but the rest is crap.  I have a Reiko cell phone case for my work IPhone (simalar to this) and that works great, if I can find one for the Note 3 I am getting it.  Stay away from this.
Positives:
The belt clip will not hold the iPhone.  You should be aware that the phone could fall out without your knowledge if you are in a noisy area or in my case a grassy area with a light wind.  I had no idea the phone fell until I turned around and walked back the way I came.
  I think if the company could fix this one flaw, this product would really be worth purchasing.  If you decide to try it, use caution when removing from your outlet or lighter port.
-Highly customizable through the 3rd party applications
497	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Yes when you get this paper insert, go to your fireplace, make sure your damper is open and then light a match to this baby and you will see the true value of this insert. I give it 5 stars for the pretty colors that are created when it goes up in smoke.
HOW IT WORKS:  We now have 5 bars everywhere in our Living Room (about 25' x 20').  That's the only place we needed a boost and the whole room is covered.  I can't really address range because elsewhere in the house our coverage was already good.



6715	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Way over priced for what it does.  1 Room for $288? In January, 2010 that is way to expensive especially since other devices that cover a whole house, sell for about the same price.
After three weeks of use, it stopped charging from the AC adapter. It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)
With the a120s I get about 40 feet away line of site (cubicles) or less than 20 feet through standard home walls. With the CyberBlue dongle however, I can use it all the way into the restroom which is over 60' away & through 2 walls & a bathroom stall.


-  Thinner design if possible for this capacity would bring positive feedback.
5. Very good audio reports from those I am talking to. No one has yet detected that I was even using a headset.
938	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Too hard to quickly turn on or off rapidly because it's not a switch like the LGs but a press and hold button. Otherwise no complaint, but considering how mach I user them, enough to knock off a star
**With our installation, I already knew where our closest cell phone towers are located & which carriers are on which tower.
I highly recommend this speakerphone unless you have a car with a loud cabin.
Pairing was a snap with my Sanyo 7050 Mil-Spec phone.
The packaging was professional, as I expected.  The unit had a charge, so what does any person do?  I plugged my iPhone into it and started charging it.  I know that was a knee jerk reaction of being excited to get my new toy!  I have a second iPhone that I drained the battery to 1%...time to REALLy test out my new toy.  So, from a fully drained iPhone I plugged in my fully charged iTorch Charger with LED Light and Laser Pointer!  To say I was amazed would be an understatement.....I came back in 38 minutes and it was sitting at full charge!!  Now, that is what I call awesome!  So, later that night I actually opened the instruction manual - - -yes, I am one of those guys!  I figured out how to actually use the laser pointer and flashlight.  I was thinking to myself, "when am I actually going to use the laser pointer or flashlight?"  You never would have guessed, but I woke up later that night and had the iTorch Charger with LED Light and Laser Pointer sitting on my night stand and instead of turning on the light and take the chance of waking my wife, I grabbed the iTorch Charger with LED Light and Laser Pointer and used the flashlight and it worked great!
4)  Bad sound options.  There was very little flexibility in sounds.  You could have a certain ring and options for receiving phone calls but a much smaller subset for receiving text messages (which I received a lot).  But most phones allow a certain flexibility that this lacked when it came to sound options.


The ear loop has about the consistency (and strength) of a paper clip.  The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable.  After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use.  Needless to say I didn't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements.  Any future earloops, they tell me, will have to be purchased for $2.50 each!

9083	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The iTorch is a fairly compact battery pack. the package contains a velvet like bag for storing the iTorch, a microUSB cable, and a USB cable. along with a small instruction booklet.

3837	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good buy.
First the good: LOUD.  I could get the volume loud enough to be uncomfortable.  The volume is easily adjusted.  Also the micraphone is clear and people said they could hear me very clearly.
Interface is maddening to get used to, if only because it's similar enough to the i1000+ (which I had for three years) that it can get confusing, as it's not the same. Color display is sharp. All volume levels can be set from whisper quiet to LOUD LOUD!
6408	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This little cover is perfect and safe. It has a STRONG belt clip, so no worries about it coming loose in practically ANY activity I can think of. For EXTRA security, you can use the loops on the back also to bind it to your belt.
* The N95-4 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB NAM", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of "n95 8gb" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.
4852	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought the H710 in August 2008.  It worked flawlessly for about ten months, then suddenly, the microphone stopped working.  At first, it was intermittent, sometimes people would say they couldn't hear me, other times, no problem.  Then one day, dead on all calls.  Sent it back to Motorola for a warranty exchange in July 2009.  It's January now.  Guess what, the replacement is doing the same thing.  I love the feel and operation of this headset; it works especially well with my hearing aids, but if the other folks cannot hear me, it is a piece of garbage.  FWIW, I also hate the proprietary charger.  I'd be interested to know if anyone has any LONG TERM success with this headset.



This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found.

7328	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Best phone from old times ever! Slick, chic and classy. Too bad the battery doesn't last long, about 4-6 hours tops and with all the smartphones today you can't be part of that world whit this phone. I bought for a trip to Brazil in 2010, when smartphones were not that common and networks were 2G only. Work on any GSM network. Good nostalgia feeling with this one, when people didn't have to be online all the time and phone calls were actually made.
4. Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.
Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned:
-Adapters, charges with a micro usb cable, it ships with that and cables but there not dedicated, there's an adapter included for that.  But accessories are easily found at Walmart or online.

7713	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I was looking for a black case that was as thin as possible. The crystal cases detracted from the unique stylings of the iPhone, making it look cheap. The thin rubber skins did not add any protection and covered up all of the nice shiny back of the phone.
If a device is connected to the IMP52D to be charged AND the battery pack is turned on, blue light 1 will illuminate, whether or not the IMP52D is itself being charged - if the IMP52D is not itself being charged, the blue lights 2, 3 & 4 may illuminate depending on the battery pack charge level -

I wear it often, it holds itself under tension on my ear.  When I take it off it still feels like it's there for a while.  I often forget I have it on too, and end up in family photos wearing it.

8245	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great Item This Item protects my Blackberry just as promised. Ive got the yellow one and you cannot misplace your phone. I also love its size I have trouble holding on to the blackberry as I feel it is thin and dos not provide much to hold onto. This case is contoured to really help get a grip on the phone. I am very pleased with this product.
Overall, this is a very attractive (black with silver trim, and the black is NOT a finger print magnet), lightweight device with excellent sound (when paired to a Pearl... can't say about other cell phones, PC's, etc.)
I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I gave this item a 4 out of 5 rating because of the flimsy feeling with the product. If the product breaks or holds up for an extended period I will update this review.
2385	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	works great, everyone i talk to thinks i am on the phone and not a blue tooth. fantastic price, and quick delivery. one and only complaint: you must hold in the multipurpose button over 6 seconds to turn it on and about 3 seconds to turn it off.  very light and holds nicely in ear. I definitly recommend the wep 200.
1986	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have purchased 2 of these mounts and each one has lasted for about a year before the arms broke and I had to throw the mount away.

The IMP500 comes with an retractable USB charging cable, with mini-USB and micro-USB adapters. This cable can be used both for charging the unit, or in reverse for powering any device utilizing a micro or mini-USB port (virtually all non-Apple wireless phones). I can plug in my Bluetooth headset when the unit isn't needed to power my iPhone.
8285	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This charger worked fine; I took the time to look at reviews first because I wasn't totally convinced this would be a working item... following those reviews I will just be sure to be gentle with this one, it's very lightweight and you don't want to leave it plugged in when you're not using it, and probably want to be careful about how you store it.
  For those of you who have any call quality issues... you may have a bad unit. I have had two other units replaced in the past (unrelated models). They had been damaged upon receipt from the retailer. Motorola is very good about warranty replacements. Case in point my H710 was a replacement for an H700 that I couldn't get replaced satisfactorily via the originating third party retailer here on Amazon. Simply go to the Motorola support page, register your product and then give them a call.
There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser.  The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs.

723	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Worked great in my 1991 GMC Sonoma.
Great sound (although you have to remember to keep the speaker over your ear). Truly great speakerphone- I've had friends have no idea that I was on a cell, much less a speakerphone. I think that between the speakerphone and the bluetooth headset, Moto actually almost meant for you NOT to use the handset in the conventional way
4841	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I am on my third one and love the call quality.  I really love the swing out mic that turns the earpiece on and off.  You can save a lot of battery life by having it off until you get a call.  Swing out the mic and answer the call by the third ring. But, and this is a huge BUT, the swing out mic is also the weak point.  The wires in the arm eventually weaken or break.  At first it will sound like you are far off and then it might not work at all.  As such, I cannot recommend this earpiece to others.
4048	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I only had zero bars to one bar for a cell connection prior to using this. Now I always have one to two bars so i don't have to worry about any data or phone calls getting dropped. Well worth it since I will be dropping my landline.

9785	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Perfect
It will charge my iPhone from 20% to 85% in about two hours and will go higher given more time. I had hoped it would give a little bit more boost to my iPad than it does but the New Trent website description clearly states that it has 35% of iPad battery capacity so I have no issue here.


4284	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Device paired - perfect 1st time, music feature - no problem, clarity hearing voice and music - excellent, voice command - works 1st time when answering call. Noise canceling is excellent. People were able to hear me with considerable amount of background noise (even a dog howling). Clarity was much better than the Jabra Freeway that I tried. Note: If you are using a Samsung 3 and cannot get the voice commands to work press "phone" icon on the Samsung 3 then the "Bluetooth" icon, then back out of the menu, if you don't follow this procedure the phone will not activate voice command mode when you press the microphone button on the Motorola Bluetooth. I think this is more of a phone issue than the device.
8517	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Hard to find replacement tip for my iGo power adapter.  They do wear out eventually, and have to be replaced.
7458	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good
Finally, the earbuds are very small. Entire earbud structures and design are very small. Even the rubber earbuds that comes with 3 different sizes are smaller and flatter designed than other 99% of earbuds.  I think when I use the biggest earbuds, it works well enough and I get adequate seals when I listen to music.  But I just feel that they might slip off when I am running or doing some activities.
I was able to not only charge my phone twice (once for each day camping) but I got to play with another nifty feature that comes with this little charger which is the laser pointer.  It has quite the range on it and relatively no affect on the battery as I played with it for some time.  It really didn't serve me any purpose other than just something to play with but would make great for business persons in need of something to not only charge their mobile device as well as have something for a presentation in their business meetings.  The battery will shut off automatically if you don't plug something into it and once charged and you unplug you device it will also shut down automatically as well.  Also shutting off manually is quite easy compared to some other external batteries and will shut down in a few seconds whereas some take 10 - 15 at least to shut down.
1805	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Easy set up for my Mac Mini coupled with CD Spin Doctor (part of Toast software).

I have a wilson solo range booster and am thrilled by it. I'm so thrilled with the Wilson, I'm going to upgrade to the db pro.
7647	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Product works great with my iTouch. I love te design and that it has the microphone bulit in. So much more comfortable than the Apple ibuds you get with the unit. Product performs great and was avery reasonable price. Delivery was fast. No issues here.
I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.

3459	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	When I first got this mount I was pretty happy with it. Unfortunately it did not last. About 6 months after I got it there were problems, and within 9 months it was in the garbage. The problem is that the months these nice little arms on the sides that slid in and out on gears so that it can accommodate devices of various sizes. While this is good in theory, the gears are plastic, and wore out. At first it started getting stuck open or closed. After a while it stripped the gears and the arms became frozen in place. No amount of work was able to make it work again, and into the garbage it went. I would not buy this again.

Finally, if you are considering purchasing this phone please be aware that you are most likely going to want some additional things to go along with it. Screen protectors, software (SPB Pocket, etc), MiniSD, case, etc. While these upgrades don't cost a whole lot they can really help in the use and enjoyment of your phone.
3886	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love this shower head. Easy to clear clogged tips. Easy to change angles and it stays where you put it.
The way that the LG's fit is very comfortable compared to these.  The Motorola Buds feel like you have a dog collar around your neck.  If you wear a shirt and tie to work, forget about it.  They look like they are just sitting on top of your clothes like a clothes hanger would if you could imagine wearing a clothes hanger around your neck to listen to music.  They are rigid and not very flexible.  Putting on the Motorola Buds feels like you are opening metal thongs to put around your neck.  The thickness of the device on the back of your neck is not a good design and feels wrong.  Maybe I'm biased because the LG's were so comfortable?
(and no, I don't work for Motorola!! haha)
features of the light and laser. It is very handy for multi-device
1) Size - Unit is super tiny! It gets lost in my shirt pocket, my jacket pocket, left on the counter. Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile. Its never a fun scramble, especially when someone important is at the other end. "Hang on a second! I need to find the headset!!!"
9925	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased a European model Nokia N810 Internet Tablet which came with a perfectly usable but hulking charger plus a plug adapter.

Another thing that might turn ppl off with this phone is the way the letters show up on the screen when you text.
You can use ANY 3.5mm headphone in this device.  The sound quality is by no means perfect, but I thought it was pretty darn good.

So off we went without worry as I had a new charger and while you may think that 5,200 mAh may not be enough for a weekend getaway it was definitely sufficient.
The integration with Office and Windows is fantastic, especially since the OS on this phone is by Microsoft.  Palm has still not updated their sync program for Windows Vista so having Microsoft's support on this is extremely helpful.

There is no manual with it, but it's a very intuitive interface and you should be up and running in no time.  They don't tell you, but you should know, if you add a ring tone to your phone, you have to shut down and restart your phone or else you won't be able to answer or make calls.  Since I synched my calendar at the same time I did the ring tone transfer, I don't know if you have to "reboot" after doing any transfer to the phone.  I would play it safe and do so.
I think the best use of this item will be for those that have somewhat alternative means of installing the antenna, or are ok using it for special trips that might have poor cell coverage.

I still couldn't bring myself to get her a cell phone, but what do I do?  I remembered seeing a little girl years ago with something that looked like a phone, but not quite - she said it was a "fly."  Well, that's the part I remembered.  Thank goodness for Google; enter the Firefly!!!  I was elated for "Santa" to get this for my princess, and so was she until we realized no one knew what it was or how to get it activated. Emailed the company, it responded with "take it to T-mobile or Verizon."  Both companies looked at me like I had five heads citing there was nothing special, it's a phone and the lowest plans were $35/mth. Even my Sprint offered some crazy high plan.  Negative!

We also used the meter, like other reviewers, around various electronics in our home.  We were surprised to see that, if you put this in front of a microwave within a few feet, you'll go off the scale on even the 0-100 meter.  I read about other reviewers doing that and being startled.  There's nothing like seeing it yourself.  I'm not really a big worrier about EMF, but after seeing that with my own eyes, I don't stand by the microwave when it's in use.

Many features that require a data plan clog up the interface even when you don't have a data plan. For example, if you press the AT&T logo (select button), it pauses, says the connection failed. You then have to press OK, then Back, then confirm that you want to exit from the browser, 3 different button presses just to cancel the unavailable feature. This button is prominent on the phone and I had to learn NOT to press it from the main screen. I wish that the phone knew or learned it had no data plan, and kept data-dependent features from getting in the way.
Great for travel or just keeping in my bag when I need it.

5027	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a low cost product which works well in the Mophie case for my iPhone.  It is about $25 cheaper than ruining a headphone cord pulling it in and out of the Mophie.  I would strongly recommend this to everyone as the way to go until someone comes out with a slim 3 cm cordless jack extension which fits in a Mophie.

DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE OR ANY JABRA DEVICE!
I have owned or tried several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones, including some Blackberries, Motorola Razr and L6, and here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:
Dislikes
By the way, I use it with an iPhone.

So, bottom line: This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible, I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go, the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town, or driving. I am giving it four stars because it isn't PERFECT (and I only give five-star ratings for perfection). That said, I will continue to use it as my daily headset until the coming of the Perfect Trifecta of audio transmission, audio reception, and comfort -- which almost certainly will be achieved by Plantronics.
the charger itself charges with a standard micro USB cord, no need for extra cords that are specific to that charger
4490	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I got this for 31 dollars once.  I don't know why it went down so much.  The one I got might have not been compatible with my phone( which was an LG Env2)  But this works well otherwise that is, until im using it!  It frequently disconnects during calls while on the phone for 15 minutes( sometimes it happens almost right away.  No matter how close I am to the phone ( which doesnt make sense because its fullly charged and supposed to last at least 5 hrs) I mean the no matter how good anything else is( sound,mic, etc, product build,features) it all depends on how stable its connectivity is to the phone!  I know alot of others gave good reviews on this but after reading about what many others have to say about the way this disconnects alot, I don't doubt it.  Ive had other bluetooth headsets and none of them ever had this problem.  The volume doesnt get that high for music, and the sound can be a little tinny at times.  I will be looking elsewhere for bluetooth headsets. Gotta have one that stays connected. Thats a must.
All that said, while it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing Bluetooth headset, it is not the ugliest either.  It is interesting to note the design differences in the newer Jawbone model that Aliph just released, however.  They've presented a much more attractive version with a sleeker, less obtrusive style, seemingly proving that the manufacturer recognizes the customer's desire, frivolous though we may be, for a headset that is pleasing to the eye.
But good product

The Voyager 510 meets my needs.  I have used it for about a month and have recommended it to about 7 people who are in the process of purchasing it.  I may purchase a second unit as a spare or to use with my wifes phone (identical to mine, but used about 10 minutes per month).
Okay so when you get a blackberry the first thing you think of is business user phone ONLY... Well they aren't just for business users. They are for anyone and everyone.  By far this is the second best smartphone I have used (number one being Pocket pc).  Anyways for this phone there is a whole bunch of features jam packed into a small package.  I had upgraded mine for the new Operating Software for upgraded features. You can also do it just ask me about it and I can help you out. So here is the info...
7172	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	As described, received when indicated on order
the cord ends up a bit long but the button is easy to use. No one has complained about sound quality.
5067	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I finally dumped the low battery time, irrational malfunctioning Razr phone in November and upgraded to the Blackberry Curve 8310 in red. It's like upgrading from a Yugo to a Mercedes SLK. I have had none of the negative issues some of the other reviews mention - access through the 3G system for the internet, phone calls, email etc is speedy and consistantly works when asked to. I had AT&T service before with the Razr phone in the same location and had problems with reception all day long. That problem vanished with the Curve. I am finding that my email appears on my phone within just a minute or two after it appears on my computer.
The sheer convenience for music playback is great though, it remembers my device (whether it be the EVO, an iPod touch, or my old phone) just fine so I never have to re-pair it, and it can remember multiple devices as well. It can even pair to multiple devices at once, when I had the SE phone I'd pair it up for phone functions and I'd simultaneously pair the iPod for music playback.
Now when I search for 'dead Jabra bt500' on google - I see many similar complaints about it not working out of the box.
The camera takes ok pictures but I am not expecting professional quality from my phone.  Just a snapshot to remember the moment.  If you really want good pictures take your camera for pete's sake.

2060	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Wonderful headset!  This is my first BT headset and I needed it to work easily, hold a charge all day because I drive a lot and need to have access to customers without causing accidents!  I considered a number of other units that were highly rated on Amazon but decided to try the Jabra first.  After a week of use, I cannot find anything to fault.  The key features plusses for me so far:
2310	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This phone does every thing I could want from a phone. It EVEN makes calls ;-)  The camera takes a very nice picture and video, and the large display shows it very clearly. You can make your own ring tones from MP3s, though limited in size, its enough for a good long ring. (it would go to voice mail before the song would repeat.) The MP3 player is cheesy, but it plays them just fine (no higher than 192 bit rate) Once I added a 1 gig MicroSD, I was able to convert my music videos and even some full length DivX'd movies to the phone. (Use SUPER, It is a must for awesome FREE video and audio conversion (Not a plug, just the truth)) The blue tooth works great, and combined with the free Samsung edit software, you have full control over phone content from your PC. The design is very sleek, and fits into a pocket with ease. I could go on and on.. I liked it so much I got a second one for the wife.
9184	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	After one month of testing, I can say it's a good product but not perfect. Once it didn't want to charge my phone (Samsung Focus), I'm not sure if it was because the battery was so low that it was almost impossible for this charger to sustain my phone's needs at that moment. It last 3 to 5 charges until it dies. In general I'm happy with this product.
6700	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this when I switched from AT&T to T-mobile. TM's signal is much weaker and doesn't penetrate my apartment like ATT's does in downtown San Francisco.  The signal is OK pretty much everywhere else so I got this booster for home.  Does it work? Probably, if you are willing to drill a hole in your wall, run the cable to the roof, have a spare outlet and are willing to put up with the extra electricity charge and equipment necessary.  My landlord will not let me drill or install the cable.  I tried putting it in a couple of windows and it didn't improve the signal at all; apparently not high enough.

9128	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Joseph from New Trent helped me.  The on switch needed to be held down to activate the charge.  It works great and am taking it overseas  It pays to read the directions. I am not very good at that.  phyllis

Even though this is my first Bluetooth headset, overall the Pros outweigh the Cons and I'd definitely recommend this headset!

4691	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does what it needs to do.
7317	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	As others have said, good for the price, but remember this is a 2G phone.  It WILL be supported for quite some time however by AT&T despite rumors to the contrary.  I discussed the matter with AT&T and they said they have so many 2G users they don't dare cut 2G support any time soon.  When that day comes I am sure they will announce it, and there will of course be gnashing of teeth and rending of garments, but at least we'll know about it.
- Material seems to not be so prone to wearing/tearing/stretching.
- Overall the product has a slick finish, it would be nice to have a rubber-type casing on the back for a better grip or some type of texture on the back.
2. Some reviewers have mentioned, difficulty in positioning on ear due to flexibility. But it is not a big issue, since once positioned, it stays there.
The Pros: Great audio quality! Good battery life.
* Memory card is located under the battery. I find it very annoying that I have to power down the phone to remove and replace the card. Hey, at least it's MicroSD.
8219	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I spent a lot of time researching iPhone cases before finally deciding to go with this one, and I can honestly say I couldn't be happier with my decision!  A 'naked' iPhone is actually a bit to thin and slippery to comfortably use on a daily basis, and the rubberized silicone cases are impossible to pull in and out of a pocket.  This case solves both of those problems, and looks great doing it.  Other iPhone owners always ask where I got it, and some have even gone on to purchase it themselves to be equally satisfied.  My friends who don't have an iPhone are shocked when I pop it out of the case - they thought it was part of the phone!  It has a great feel that really is hard to describe - it's a "soft" texture on a very hard surface.  Strange, but it couldn't be a more comfortable surface for something that you touch many times throughout the day.  You'll be very happy with this case!
6035 come standard with voice dial feature

1886	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I decided to purchase this headset despite the bad reviews and I was happy that I did.  First, the sound quality that pours out of the headset is great, my Lg Vu came with some earbuds but the quality was very poor.  When I purchased these though, it was like wow.
Contacts > Menu > New Contact -- you'll have to retype in all your contacts.  (I have not found an automated program for this.)

I ended up going from 106 (on a clear day and if I was lucky) to 120 (almost non existent signal; borderline dead zone) before the WeBoost to 88 on a good day to 98 on a bad day. Either way it's a good enough signal to talk without dropped calls and without repeating myself constantly. But again, that's only in two small rooms. Between the number of variables along with different levels of expectation by the customer, I can see how someone would be thrilled or hate it or anywhere in between. The good news however, is that you can try it and return it if it doesn't work for you. I can't stress enough however, how much of the slightest change of angle or height can change the signal strength. So if you have the patience, I suggest doing a lot of playing around with it before you decide it doesn't work. To illustrate my point, my booster is toward the front of a small table and it's perfect. If I move it to the back of that table, back only 6 or so inches, the signal decreases drastically. So it's THAT sensitive. Once I found the "sweet spot" I was very pleased, all things considered (woods, metal roof, rural, etc).
Compare this to a buddy who picked up a SIM card to be in France for a month.  The card itself was cheap (maybe $20 -- although that's $10 more than this one).  However, the fine print and extra fees ended up making the whole ordeal cost about $1500 for just a couple of hours of use.  This car in France? Only $150 to call back to the US - and no fussing around. If you'd just roamed with AT&T: $155 plus fees. And back at the Masai Mara for two hours? AT&T: $478 Mobal: $234.  No guarantees that a local prepaid SIM wouldn't charge huge rates for international calling, either.






1380	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The item is just as described, and priced reasonably.  needed this SIM card to start my service with this carrier.  It fits my needs perfectly.
1. Palm OS meaning alot of stuff you need 3rd party software to run.  And those 3rd party software is very expensive.
  The only requirement that the product passed my expectations.
First off, the design of it looks a bit off-putting.  It uses military-grade noise reduction technology and the look of the headset makes me believe that this particular headset may have been originally intended for such use.  It's not exactly the most attractive headset out there - definitely not the most feminine.
Cons, compared to the BB:
8561	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It's from I-Go.  Need I say more?  Bought it for my BB Curve 8530.  Great charger tip
-While flexible it is a tad flimsy, the way the orientation worked out when plugged into the wall and then a power strip plugged into it sometimes it came out. Some work was required to keep it in.
Add a $25 feature package for data or use wifi.
Lots of connectivity option
817	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great
Also unlike Samsung, LG and even Mpow, SF500 has very ridge body that you can not really bend as you like. For me, it fits me well enough since I have a normal size neck, but I can see that if someone with fatter or bigger neck, it might not fit comfortably due to its stiffness in the body of headphone.  Also, it has 3 EQ settings.  Personally I like the second one the most which brings out clear mid and high.  It is a good feature to have.

-It doesnt come with a wall outlet, or a cable for the apple products such as iphone which is annoying but it does work with the cable apple gives so that not to bad.

I was able to charge my Droid Razr to 100% and still had 2 lights left on the charger.  So I could probably get close to another full charge of the Razr before needing to recharge this unit.  I don't do alot of traveling but always want to be prepared, I really could have used this last year when the power went out for a couple days, and the only way I could charge things was via my car charger.  This would have been so great to have on hand then.  I have numerous products from this company, so everyone in my family will have one in case of emergencies.
If my sunglasses are too large, I leave an ear piece hanging outside the holder - no problem at all.  I came to this item today to order another - but out of stock.  Hopefully they will get more in stock.  If not, I'll check Carol Wright's catalog or Kimberly Clark where I first purchased them.  For the price, you can't beat this item.

  5.  Laser pointer and LED light are a nice touch
This is the first phone that was an mp3 player, a camera and a camcorder all in one (for me) so I'm enjoying taking pictures and listening to music very much.
Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money).
9342	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Actually I really like this, price not withstanding. My 2 year old just broke my 2nd Plantronics 510 Voyager so I figured I'd get a cheap one the 3rd time around. I'm really surprised how much I like this. Sound is great! Distance signal not. I can go about 30 feet before hearing bad static. It's either crystal clear or loud static. Volume up and down is a little irritating as when you change the volume setting, it makes a little beep which blots out for those brief seconds what the person on the other side said. Comfortwise amazing. The 510 Voyager is bulky around the ear but light in the ear. You really felt the weight which got painful or irritating after a long talk time of 1 hour or more. With this one, the weight around your ear is nothing. The "bulk" of the weight is what goes in your ear and it's quite light at that. It's a little different to get used to, like there's water in my ear that I need to shake out but I'm sure it's just something to adjust to after time. I'm not on my cell phone all day for business meetings or anything but I spend long times on the phone as a mommy who is trying to do a million errands or phone calls while taking care of a toddler and infant. Ever tried crawling on the floor picking up Cheerios or running after a toddler to get him dressed while trying to schedule doctor visits at same time? For all the running around I do while talking/waiting on the phone, this thing stays PUT with no problems.

4966	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was concerned by the number of bad reviews, but given the low price, I was willing to risk it anyway.  Turned out to be a great decision. I use the iphone 4 quattro case and have been unable use most 3.5 mm phone plugs.  This adapter has a very slim body compared to others and fits securely in my iphone without removing the case.  I use a cassette adapter to pump the sound to my truck stereo and the sound is awesome!  I liked it so much and the price is so low that I just placed an order for three more so I have one in all my vehicles and travel kit.

Recommendations:
Sound - Outbound:  The best for last!  NO COMPARISON!  I rarely had people complain with the Jabra, especially if I was in a quiet room.  Then they might not know I was on a headset.  But kudos to Jawbone on the active noise cancellation!  As a test early on I turned up the TV volume to where I almost couldn't hear the party on the other end and they COULDN'T HEAR the TV!  We held a comfortable conversation where whatever noise was going on in the background at my home was virtually inaudible on the other end!  For those reviews who state that this feature doesn't work, I can only assume that a) the unit was defective, b) the noise cancellation circuit was turned off or, and this can probable be critical, c) the fit is not good and the 'vibration sensor' is not in solid contact with the cheek. In my case, with a comfortable and solid fit, the noise cancellation is almost eerie.  And worth the price of a Jawbone.

9096	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is so handy.  I get about 175% charge on my Nexus S 4G (which admittedly has a battery on the smaller side compared to most phones today).  I use it when I travel and it works awesome.  I bought it before they changed the look/features of it and it looks even better now - the battery itself uses USB to charge (why didn't they do that in the first place?).  After dozens of uses, it still charges just as much as it did on the first day (I've had it for 5 months).
7914	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The description said that it will fit even with a case, and its not true. The picture don't matches with the product delivered. It will not work for my purpose. It is a regular extension of a headphone. I was looking for an extension that had a jack as the apple headphone jack.
5505	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've been looking for a car mount for my iPhone 3G. After searching around the web for a while, I found that there's no "best choice" product for iPhone car mount. Even brand such as Kingston have people liking it and hating it. Knowing that they don't cost cheap, I looked for a cheap alternative. This one does the job well. Construction is not rock solid, but after you mount it on the windshield and you have your iPhone mounted, it holds pretty solid. It has cushioning so it won't scratch your gadget. The suction cup holds very well. I use it with Tom Tom app, Google maps, and to make hands-free calls. It makes a whole lot difference! Plus, it's universal so you can you use it with different gadgets. Buy it!

9282	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I just return this case to the Verizon store. I liked the look of the case, but it make the phone too heavy. Now if you are a person, who wears the phone on their hip, you might not mind it. I put my phone in my pocket, so it helped to almost de-pant me serveral times. Try the rubber cases, this phone is already too big and heavy for a heavy case.

Without the boom mic...not as impressive.  I did the same test, music up relatively loud and placed a call.  It picked up my voice fine for the voice commands, however I could hear some feed back--heard my music and a slight echo of my voice.  Also both my callers that had heard me on it with the mic b4, could hardly hear me over the music....said they could hear that I was speaking, but couldn't make out my voice with out straining.
The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.



  So, if you're with me so far... is it any coincidence that the iPhones have no ability to change batteries by the user? In my opinion, it is a bold move to force the consumer into a buy cycle on apple/at&t's terms (oh, a "battery replacement" costs a (hypothetical) $100? Well that brand new iphone 8 is only $150, I might as well upgrade! And its about time to renew my contract anyways...)  Something to think about.
9449	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This doesn't work miracles but it works well.  I use it all the time for car camping and it's great.  iPhone 6 fits.  It typically boost me about 2 bars, including from none to 2 (if there's any signal at all).  (Using tech app, it'll do something like -107 db to -85).  It gets quite hot, don't put it in the sun, but the heat has never melted or harmed anything.


157	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.
4500	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Product works as claimed. Fantastic Price! Stereo is cool. Boom Mic helps with other party hearing me. Use it often. Had to put the smallest ear insert on headset to get a comfortable fit. Looks a little large on the side of a persons head in comparison to the super small ones commonly available now. Nonetheless, if you're looking for any kind of multipurpose bluetooth headset that is stereo and very adaptable than this is the one. I JOG WITH THIS ON and listen to my music with NO wires catching my hands or flopping around. I may get a second smaller bluetooth headset in about six months for the times when I don't want stereo. It's adaptable to use without the second earphone as well. Great product at the right price.

I then plugged in the charger to other wall receptacles and the charger no longer worked. There was no charging light on the headset!! Talk about being mad!!  But the little amount of charging to the headset before the charger crapped out, was enough for me to test out the headset.  It worked just fine. And it worked for a few days. I guess the 30 minutes or so of charging was adequate for a couple of days of use.

no matter how good the review I read, the price was a drawback, and some random crash issue
Positives:
I've purposely stress-tested it in some pretty noisy situations.  First of all, my own vehicle.  I have an older car, and it seems to pick up all of the outside noise there is, even with my windows up.  If it is raining, my callers could hear the rain on the windshield when using other headsets.  When a semi drove alongside my car, the noise of the big truck distracted my callers from our conversation.

1064	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got this to measure EMF around my new house, and use it to move electronic devices around to keep them further away from where I usually am.
6098	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	iTroch IMP52D, It looks like a perfect travel battery when you need a charge on the go and I like the fact that it is pretty universal in what it can charge.
I have not used the software that came with the phone since it is not for MACs.  Nokia has a plug-in you can download on their website to use the phone with a MAC's iSync software and it works seamlessly.  The phone also works well with the HandsFreeLink Bluetooth in my Acura.  You can download MSN Messenger and Hotmail for the phone, as well as check your POP-3 based e-mail.  The web browser works well and most pages display fine, if a little slowly (even over Wi-Fi).  The map program is accurate as well, although you have to subscribe to a service for voice guided turn-by-turn directions.  If you don't pay for that you just get the directions displayed on the screen all at once.

4979	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	If you're like me and have a 1st Generation iPhone then this adaptor is nice to have if you want to use normal headphones, earbuds, or if you want to run your music through a sound system.  I keep one of these in my office and another in my computer bag just in case.
Overall this is a 5 star product and it really does walk right in the middle of needs. Plenty of power in a small package makes it a great choice in any setting from the office goer to an on the road warrior!
Figured it out...
*easy to use
The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.
Overall, I give this product a 5/5 rating.  It works GREAT, holds lots of energy for charging, charges very fast and is very well constructed.
The whole system takes about 5 minutes to setup. 1 minute to attach the mounts and 1 minute to plug in the charger. It is a little weird at first, you have to leave the unit in the car with car "on", not running, so it gets the initial 2 hours. Then about 2 minutes to sync it to your phone.

I'm surprised at how well this product has held up to the wear and tear I've put it through.
The Dash is an awesome device and is highly recommended.
Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.

6161	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like the size/shape and ease of use of this external battery. I've purchased 5 previous external battery packs, and this one is my favorite.  It even has a built in flashlight and laser pointer.  Really easy to charge and use and the small profile is perfect for travel.

3128	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	These are easy to use and provide short-term effective protection for device screens.  The plastic is soft and scratches easily, but is easily replaced with a fresh piece...I find that it lasts about a month (in my pocket, exposed to my keys and other crud) before the scratches become totally obnoxious.  The used plastic peels off easily, without leaving any residue behind.
3708	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I got this for my Line 6 Relay G50 due to all the reviews I've read. This pouch does it's job. Holds the receiver tightly. Although I did notice that it's kind of a pain to get the receiver out to turn it on and off. Other than that, totally worth the extra money for the G50 or G30 I would guess. Would recommend to a friend.
8726	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The replacement trackball does exactly what it's supposed to do... can't beat the price. I can't imagine how much I would have been charged if I'd taken my blackberry into a store to be fixed.

1883	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I just purchased this on 11/17/06.  Radio Shack has the HT820 (stereo headphones) and the DC800 (Home Stereo Adaptor) on sale.  You pay for the Headphones and they throw in the Home Stereo adaptor for free.  $99.00 value.  The headset is remarkable.  Excellent audio with easy to use controls.  I have it linked to the new LG CU500 cell phone with easy to use MP3 files loaded.  I am sure all you Razer fans with MP3 will love it as well.

- Extras - comes with a laser pointer and LED light built in, not necessarily a must, but a nice to have.  Well thought out.

While the packing was adequate I think there should be some changes there.  When this was delivered to me it was opened and ripped in two places.  The flashlight wasn't so great.  The range of that light was very small, and it's light was not much help in the dark.

647	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this case as a package with the Palm TX from amazon. I wish I had read others reviews because as the others pointed out it does not fit the Palm TX. The top sticks out. I went to staples and bought the right case and was told the ones that fit the Palm TX have to say compatible with Tungsten T5. So Im not sure why amazon has a deal with the Palm TX when it isn't the right case. Another thing is it doesn't have a snap only a pull through strap which doesn't stay put too good.

 Excellent charging speeds as compared to competing power banks. Added 20% in 20 minutes to an iPhone 6.
7265	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this phone just as a back-up to my current smartphone but I liked it so much that I used it as my primary phone for a few days. Size is nice and compact, fits well into any pocket. The battery life is phenomenal and that is expected because its a 1000+ mAh for a very basic phone. The features are decent and the bluetooth pairs very well with my external bluetooth devices such as the Motorola speakerphone in my car. Menu and options are basic and quite easy to use. Screen resolution is so-so but then what do you expect from a phone at this price. Overall, even though I went back to my smartphone a few days later (only because of my dependency on its features) I highly recommend this phone to those who need only voice + text. This is an excellent device and I will be more than happy to use it again if I ever need a back-up phone or if I go out on one of those rough outdoor adventures.
5243	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Keeps all my husbands electronics in one spot and cords are hidden.

3483	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	If you read my other hip case description, this was the product I ended up using.
But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.

Pros:
That's 3 out of 3 that quit.
The BEST feature on the NUVI 200 is while your driving hit near you, then pick foods and you can see what restaurant are coming up, see whether you want to get off that exit or not. Before we got the GPS on long drives we would look for billboards to tell us of exits with food and sometimes we get off and the food would be nothing we want or we'd go to a fast food place right off the exit because we didn't want to get lost. With the Nuvi I could type in steakhouse and it would find me one close to an exit and we didn't have to worry about getting lost and we ate very well on our long drive!! I'm Glad we bought it worth every pennie!!
8452	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Ordered for my Z61e, doesn't fit. Doesn't fit my Z61t, either. I wasn't expecting the world for $30, but something that is at least compatible would be nice.

I dropped my new iphone twice before I got the otterbox defender case. Both times I held my breath to see if it survived. I was lucky. There were dents in the case, but the unit was intact. I felt that my luck would soon run out so I bought this case. A friend who works in the Apple store said it was great. Definitely watch the video on the otterbox site to see how to use/ install it. It is bulkier (although I can still carry it in my back jeans pocket) which was a deal killer for my husband who carries his iphone in his shirt pocket. I keep mine in my purse, on the car seat, on the dash when I plug it in for itunes through my radio, etc...so size wasn't an issue for me. I actually feel like I have better control of it now that it has a neoprene no-slip edge. The screen is covered by a protective membrane that is absolutely as sensitive as my husband's naked iphone. The color is cool and people often ask where they can get one. The apple logo is visible on the back. The only feature you can't use is the little vibrate button on the side of your phone, but I don't mind going through settings to do the same thing. The case is also water resistant which has been great for beach, boat, and rainy trips.



Due to the relatively open design it does not do so well in windy conditions. I use this mostly when riding on my bike and I definitely have to slow down to understand incoming calls and to be heard by the other party. A minor inconvenience for me because I don't usually make long calls while riding.
Doesn't like hubs or USB extension cables. It would charge with either of these but would not sync (with my Mac).
I have batteries that are up to eight years old, charged maybe 30 or 40 times so far, and they're charging fine as well.
plastic does fog a bit, but doesnt bother me as I don't mess with mp-3 once I start working out
The Bad (highlights only):
THE RAZR has an auto-answer feature so I don't struggle with the buttons on the headset.  PAIRING was very easy.

BTW, I have now tried this on my Blackberry Playbook tablet and it WILL charge it!
So here are the main advantages:
Nice screen, sound quality is fine.
1257	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I used this headset with the Moto RAZR and it worked flawlessly.  I was quite happy with the audio quality (folks I talked to never complained about background noise, even while driving) and battery life was more than adequate.  Additionally I thought the button functions like mute, swapping calls, etc. were pretty easy to use.

On a side note, I can see some users expecting the charging cord to be a little longer than it is. Most likely those users will be the ones who do not have an easy access to a usb port, PC for example, and will try to plug it into a wall outlet, which majority of the time will require a longer cord. Also an optional wall adapter would be nice for those listed previously.

1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit.
Pros:
 I was very disappointed in this investment of >$300 and was not able to return it because the packaging had been discarded.
6. Battery life is good (I charge it every 2-3 days)
The quality of the entire package is top notch and feels like it will last longer than the warranty.
Aesthetics: A, like most Moto products, it's an attractive piece (though a bit odd). Some color options would be welcome.

6518	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't work for me. I killed the 4g signal on my phone to use 3g only, and it would add one bar for me when I was standing right next to it, and it was cranked to the max signal. I sent it back.
The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.

1506	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have owned other BT headsets, but this one is my favorite. It stays on your ear, and the sound is great. The fit took some adjusting, and I have decided to remove all but the cone-shaped earpiece. The foam pads made the earpiece too large, and a bit painful. Without it, the headset is great. It is a bit heavy at first, but after a few minutes, you will forget that you have it on.
The manual that comes with it should be better writen.

1552	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have tested many bluetooth headsets. This one sets the bar pretty high.  The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two. It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones.  If you have a Palm OS phone, pick a different headset as this MAY work, but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.
With aftermarket headsets, the diameter or shape of the headset connector may prevent you from fully inserting the connector.

5319	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I spent a lot of time researching iPhone cases before finally deciding to go with this one, and I can honestly say I couldn't be happier with my decision!  A 'naked' iPhone is actually a bit to thin and slippery to comfortably use on a daily basis, and the rubberized silicone cases are impossible to pull in and out of a pocket.  This case solves both of those problems, and looks great doing it.  Other iPhone owners always ask where I got it, and some have even gone on to purchase it themselves to be equally satisfied.  My friends who don't have an iPhone are shocked when I pop it out of the case - they thought it was part of the phone!  It has a great feel that really is hard to describe - it's a "soft" texture on a very hard surface.  Strange, but it couldn't be a more comfortable surface for something that you touch many times throughout the day.  You'll be very happy with this case!

After talking with some music tech masters, I discovered my current amp wasn't putting out enough voltage for these planar headphones and was immediately recommended schiit. I decided to try the magni to see if it would really improve the problems I was having, and I'm happy to say it did. So much so that I immediately upgraded to the asgard 2 after just one listening session. The magni was fantastic for the price, but I knew I wanted to try schiit's even better version of it asap. It really improved my planar headphones. I'm sure many will be very happy with their affordable base model, and I'm very impressed with everything about this. Would highly rrecommend if you need more power for your phones.

I thought of purchasing AT&T prepaid sim card which can be used with AT&T Go Phones. In AT&T store it is 10$. Here is on Amazon, i purchased it under 4$. It worked good and every month I just load it with 10$, no contract, no hefty bills. I liked this very much as I can have a permanent AT&T number for just 10$ a month. I have been using this since last 7 months
427	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Palm pre charging data cable works as advertised. No problems so far and that is a very good thing .
The plastic cover was easy to install bubble free with a credit card and a little patience - only took two tries. The instructions were clearly written. The rest of the case and rubber outer cover installed in seconds and everything fit exactly. The keys and trackball are perfectly useable through the plastic cover just as they were without it. The only caveat is the clarity of the camera with the plastic installed - you do need to cut out the plastic bubble over your camera eye if you still intend to take clear photos with the Otterbox in place.

After our new batteries arrived and I got them fully charged all misery above was gone.  Both our batteries only get charged once a week now.  I can leave my bluetooth on all day and make several long calls via bluetooth with plenty of power to spare.

The first unit failed just short of two months.  The indicator light would quickly flash alternating green and red for a couple of seconds, then shut down.  Unplugging the unit and plugging it back in got the same response.

I usually use them to listen to my internet radio station over the cellular network, but when a call comes in the ring is very distinct and switching to the call and back again to the radio station afterwards is a simple press of the phone button on the Jabra.

7087	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is the second time I have tried buying additional batteries for my Motorola Razr V3 and this attempt panned out the same as the first.

Makes the phone considerably larger and heavier but didn't bother me at all. Definitely not waterproof anymore but I lost the charging cover anyway. There's decent room next to the battery to store some cash. The cover is two stage: One clicks onto the phone and then the rubber case fits snug over it. The rubber case has started to get a little loose around the sides of the phone but isn't too bad. Some larger 3.5mm headphone jacks won't seat properly but the charging port does not have this problem

9159	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When I purchased my iPhones, the first thing that I found was that the battery life ended around 10:30 AM.  This was NOT good.  So I began my search for a batttery backup assist.  I looked on the web at all of the then advertised external battery cases and external batteries and found the IMP500 at then IMAX, which was since bought out by New Trent.  I chose it because it had a 5,000ma capacity and was about the same size as my phone, which made it more convenient to carry arround.  It came with attachments that allowed me to also connect my BlackBerry phones as well.  I really like the retractable cord).  The only problem that I had with it was that it would periodically get turned on in my pocket, but they very quickly modified the unit with an automatic shutdown to prevent that from happening.  I have been very satisfied with my battery pack since its purchase when they first came out with them.  My co-workers, friends, and family members have used it on several ocasions when there batteries died, and I still had backup for mine when needed because it allowed me to charge up 4 1/2 to 5 phones before I needed to recharge it.  I have since purchased others, but I still like this one the best.  I don't have the version that automatically shuts off because I purshased mine before that time, but it doesn't create a problem for me, but if you purchase one today, it will have that functionallity.  I take mine with me on horseback rides out in the country over the weekends and have plenty of extra power when needed.  I have considered purchasing another one because others keep borrowing mine to charge up their phones.  Great product!

8675	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the BlackBerry Curve Leather Holster in late August 2011.  I was initially pleased, as it looks nice and the automatic off feature worked.  However, within 60 days the leather strap cracked where it folds across the top of the leather and across the Blackberry.  The seller offered to exchange it for another, but (1) that would leave me without a holster during the process, and (2) the cost of shipping it back would amount to a substantial percentage of the price.  I have chosen instead to cover the crack with black electrical tape, while waiting for the genuine BlackBerry original replacement I ordered.  I just noticed that the strap has now cracked in a second place, where the strap curves across the front edge of the BlackBerry and back down.  I should also mention that the chrome Sprint logo fell off the strap very early on, which did not bother me.  FYI, I wear the holster on my belt, on my right side.  The only significant stress it gets might be when I fasten the auto seatbelt across it.

7872	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this item because I misplaced my old adapter for the 1st generation iPhone. I expected, as usual, that as soon as I bought a replacement the old one would show up! In this case it didn't. This adapter is used to connect headphones or audio output to the original 1st gen. iPhone. That model had a recessed jack to plug in the headphones and would not accept a standard plug, like the newer iPhones do. Since I am now using the 3rd gen. iPhone, my 1st two are jailbroken to use as iPod Touches, for music, internet and app use. This jack comes in handy when connecting headphones, as the 1st gen. iPhone has a sub-par speaker, and is of little use in listening to music. I would recommend it for anyone still using the original iPhone.
Functionality wise, the Keypad layout is difficult to see. The numbers and the letters are all the same size on very small keys so I found myself just staring blankly for several minutes trying to figure out where my character was. Not saying you don't get used to it but be ready to hit the wrong character several times because of the close proximity of the buttons. I never had that kind of a problem on my blackberry.
Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design.  I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset!
Regardless, it seems like they should last more than 30 days even with the hygrometer reading always on. Say, 90 days with daily use.

587	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great otterbox dry box, I got the clear version as recommended by other reviews and like it. After reading the size dementions between this (3000) and the 2000 I went with this one, I wanted to keep my ipod 4g with otterbox defender safe inside and eventually an iphone with either a defender or armor case. So i compared the sizes and ended up with this 1. First, at least the clear version of this box is way bigger then u would expect, it dwarfs my little ipod in there, but leaves plenty of room for wallet/anything else. It is much to big for a pocket or anything like that, but would easily fit in a backpack and comfortibly fits in your hand when u carry it.  In conclusion, if u want the extra space, get this 1, if not and you want just your phone/other small items, get the 2000. Note: (will fit an iphone 3-4-5  with pretty much any case on it and still have plenty of room for wallet/anything else)
7253	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Cheap phone that did what was intended; for use while traveling abroad using pay as you go SIM cards.  However, the battery no longer holds a charge at all. So, I got one use out of the phone.

When traveling, the LED light is handy for emergencies.  This is also a handy power supply for camping since it is small and light and can provide additional power for small electronic devices such as GPS and phones that might be needed in the wilderness with a small penalty in size and weight.
This unit makes a world of difference when talking on the phone "hands-free".  It feels more natural and is definitely preferable to using the non-private speakerphone utility.

2507	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	While many don't know of OPPO, they've actually been producing phones overseas for some time now. Here in the States, they're more known for their high end DVD and Blu-Ray players. With that said, they seemed to have taken their visual excellence to create a very functional and competitive phone. For me I was looking for an unlocked GSM phone; which boiled down to the Apple iPhone, HTC One, Samsung Note 2, and this OPPO Find 5. While all 3 Android phones shared similar specs, the OPPO is actually a few short. However, what really sold me was the higher capacity battery, frequent updates (every 2 weeks) which address issues that are brought to the developers attention by owners(via OPPO forums), and the steel casing that houses the electronics for a more weighted feel. There was one thing that did almost kept me from purchasing the Find 5, no LTE support. However after speed testing, on the ATT network, I am still able to get 3.5Mb/s down and 1Mb/s up. Makes you wonder what's going on with other phones or what's really in the Find 5. You won't be disappointed with this phone, it is definitely worth every penny. For accessories check out the bidding store (- bay).
Lastly, another I wasn't expecting it and I don't know why, but the IMP52D has an LED light - a 3 Second Hold Click will turn the LED light on or off - if the battery pack was not on, the 3 Second Hold Click will also turn the battery pack on when it turns on the LED light - Turning the LED light off also turns off the battery pack -

711	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo.  It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.



Since I am not a business professional, I cannot speak for the functionality from that perspective but as young professional who loves to text message, constantly check email (I got Gmail POP to work in 2 minutes flat), use the phone, and obsessive-compulsively check daily plans, weekly timetables, etc. as well as write several notes-to-self, to-do lists, and shopping lists, this Treo is awesome. It also doesn't hurt that it looks terrifically sophisticated, albeit bulky, which I actually like (it doesn't feel so dainty like the Motorola Q and Samsung Blackjack). And I personally like the antenna on top, unlike the more recent Treo models.

6096	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I received this unit as a promotion special when I bought an iCarrier. Some observations I have made while putting this unit through its paces.
2) SMS and Email problems: If you will use SMS or email frequently, this phone can make you pull your hair out. There is a bug (feature?) in SMS and PocketOutlook where scrolling down means the cursor goes to the bottom of the page view. Thus if you have a 14 line email or document you are editing, the only way to get to line 5 is to whip out that stylus or scrolling a few hundred characters to the right until you get there. Unfortunately the same goes for SMS which is NOT THREADED. This means that you can't see the ongoing conversation you may have with different people. It is by date, end of story. There aren't any suitable alternatives right now unfortunately. Nothing for SMS and the best email program I have seen is Web IS Flexmail which itself requires several keypresses just to delete an email -- unless once again you want to whip out that stylus. One handed operation is better than other WM devices but NOT EVEN CLOSE to the ease of using the Palm OS.
3101	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	THEY WERE OK !
It works great if you are between antennas in direct sight. When I go to another room I have 3-4 bars and only one wall between cell phone and antennas.

While it does deserve five stars it has a few flaws:
1296	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a terrific device.  I use it with my Motorola RAZR V3 and it works great.  I don't know what I did without a wireless headset.  Two things that could be better - first it doesn't recognize ring tones from my phone (but I think that is the phone's problem not necessarily the headset), and second, it occassionally will drop the signal from my phone causing me to scramble to figure out how to go from the headset to my phone.  This doesn't happen very often so it really isn't that big of a deal.
2. 1/8 battery bar means your phone is about to completely turn off with no warning whatsoever - but don't get me wrong, the extended-battery life is pretty phenomenal at 3+ days of regular usage with voice and data.  My SLVR/RAZR would beep to let me know it was low, the Q simply goes dead real quick (after 3+ days as I was testing it out) - there may have been a warning, but I never got to see it.
For example:
Some of the folks on here seem upset that you can't copy the card.  Can you imagine the clones for sale on eBay.  Part of life.  This is much better than the $10 per month service you get from Sprint.  The card is paid for in less than a year. Works out in the county with no cell phone service, a big deal to me... I love it.

2460	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Received this item and tried plugging it into my K1m.  The K1m didn't even detect it was plugged in, and it never worked.  When I plug in the USB to 2.5mm adapter that came with the phone, the music player stops playing music on the speaker built into the phone, but with this headset plugged in, it just keeps playing from the built in speaker.
The second flaw this product has, although this might be a little more like a double edged sword, is the fact that after 30 seconds of not using the device to charge your electronic, it shuts off. This is great as it helps conserve battery( which we all so desperately need) but in the case of an emergency in which you've managed to turn on the flash light, you will only have it on for thirty seconds. The same applies to the laser pointer.
it still mysteriously charged, so it was used for a moto charger, or planned to if i found a phone with the same battery and then all now i get was a lit up keypad. i took it apart, which voided the warranty, if any since wet. now all i got was nothing and figured i should replace it and recycle it which i did.

1202	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to replace a big bulky tool that I have had for years.  The first thing I did was open and try it out.  This works better than what I had.  I totally can not wait to use this again.  I  will be purchasing more of these for family members.
2420	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was reluctant when the Cingular salesman suggested that I try this Samsung headset.  I had been a Jabra BT250V user and I liked the comfortable over-ear design.  I did however realize that from a size perspective and a style perspective that I should consider replacing my broken Jabra with a more stylish model that was significantly smaller and had the newest versions of Bluetooth.  I just HAD to get something that meshed better with my new Blackberry Pearl.
7789	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Want "wear all day" comfort, good sound, out and inbound, and easy operation?  This is it.  I've tried them all including a new "super headset" that is supposed to eliminate all background noise.  I felt like I had a foot in my ear and the performance, in and outbound, was terrible.  The H710 works great.  My only complaint is a non-replaceable Nimh battery good for only 400 charges.
7803	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works as expected.
  The reason I rated this item so low is because it does not hold up.  My husband and I have gone through three of these chargers in less than a year.  It seems that we can only plug the charger into the car's outlet about four times before the end of the charger breaks off.  Twice this has left the metal tip and fuse inside of the accessories outlet in my car, and once even blew the fuse to my outlet.

WIll never buy and recommend this product.
-Not very stylish, it looks a little bit clumsy to me
7420	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	One of those great ideas that works for certain situations.

5538	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The original battery on my T60 started at about 100-minutes play time and it slowly degraded to less than one hour. I am happy to note that this replacement can give me up to 3 hours of laptop use - not DVD-watching.
2367	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it. since it so small, I tuck it away and now I can't find it ;(. anyways, I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung. both are very good, but if I had to choose, I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager, where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it. on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs (IMO).


9308	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This little cover is perfect and safe. It has a STRONG belt clip, so no worries about it coming loose in practically ANY activity I can think of. For EXTRA security, you can use the loops on the back also to bind it to your belt.
8758	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I'm glad i didn't pay much attention to the reviews saying they got a locked phone. i ordered this from unlockedcellphonekings here on amazon monday night after my samsung died and the t-mobile guy at the mall was telling me to buy a new phone because i don't bet an upgrade till may. I wasn't expecting to get this till monday but it got here 2 days later.
Now for the MP3 player: It's AWSOME!!! It comes with MP3 player controls on the side if the screen too, which I thought was cool. So the phone can be on standby and you can continue to listen to music, just use the controls for it. The speakers are LOUD! So this phone can bump music!

Great little phone. it makes phone calls and sends and receives text messages, and that's about it. it does have an alarm, and you can change the ringtone among 9 presets I believe. That's it. No camera, no organizer, no apps, no web, no touchscreen.
Pros:
This product is excellent, is not fragile (quite the contrary), and the second one I bought as a backup will probably remain unused forever.
Looking to the future, there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM, it will be thinner, lighter, and the antenna will be internal - basically, it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside.  These are much sought after features by Treo users.  Maybe I'll upgrade then.
2) the oft mentioned delay - it's a minor thing I've gotten used to. It is most noticable with voice dial and answering.
A great buy!
9356	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I was really disappointed this didn't work better. This was a Christmas gift for my husband. We used it twice on long road trips. We did have a signal the whole trip, BUT our phone kept falling out of the cradle. The phone got really hot and 1 of the cords that you screw into the cradle kept coming undone. We had to keep connecting it.
5. Volume buttons on earpiece.

6538	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna  and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED,  acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the  reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting  and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was  defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost  antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it.
Update:  2.11.15
391	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is very pretty and ubber functional on my phone!  I couldn't see spending a fortune to cover my phone with an ugly otter box, this one does the job and is gorgeous!
and 2 of three failed immediately so he refunded those units: after 2 months
  - works great - just had to download free Samsung PC Studio 3 software from Samsung site

2) Handsfree is limited.  The speakerphone is great.  Unfortunately, without bluetooth, you can't use wireless headsets, and even wireline headsets are hard to find because of the custom combination headphone/power jack.
2020	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.
8813	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very ultra portable. I love it so much. I would recommend it to anyone who is always on the go. Great buy!

a decent buy


793	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a good unit and works perfectly with other marine grade male plugs. Delivery was prompt. It is weatherproof and the plugs stay locked in place
All in all, I am very happy with this bluetooth headset because of the sound quality, the fit, and the price. While the mic does still have a few issues, it's still a great improvement in sound quality to the point where I can finally have a normal back & forth conversation in the car, and that is vital. The fit's comfortable, and the unit is very light and small which I dig. The usability issue can be a little frustrating at times, but if you remain mindful, it's a minor inconvenience at worst (heck, sometimes I actually WANT to redial, so there it's helpful). There is no perfect bluetooth, but for the price, I haven't found anything better in size, fit, or sound than the Samsung WEP410.
The belt clip seems to be sturdy and strong so, hopefully, I will have better luck than some of the other reviewers.
The camera's 1.3 mega pixels, but that ain't the kicker.  It's what you can do with the pictures you take.  You can edit an image with the following options: None (leaves you with a regular lookin' photo), Black & White (self explanatory), Negative (looks like a negative), Sepia (classic lookin', brown tint), Blur (self explanatory), Sharp (s.e.), Sketch (looks like an artist sketched it with pencil), Posterize (I can't even explain this one.  Just gives it a slightly different look) & Solarize (this really looks artsy!).  There are even a variety of picture "frames" that you can use to decorate your photos.
The physical size of the phone is also a major plus.  It's still a comfortable size to fit in your hand, but it's thin enough to easily fit into the front pocket of a pair of jeans.  The fit and finish are top shelf, the iridescent silver outside (seems to change to a smoke and a purple in different lights) contrasts well with the sleek black of the interior of the clamshell.  The outside display is bright and clear, and the interior screen is also bright and easy to read.  The keypad I find to be very good, but some people don't go for the feel of the cut metal keys.  Personal taste, I guess...
Lastly, your phone slides in to the cradle and the sides of the cradle are flexible so my iPhone 5 snugs right in.  There are no actual wires attached to the phone.  It just goes in the cradle and the cradle has two cords attached to it.

But everywhere I bring it people ask me about it and what it can do.
Needless to say, this sucker's getting returned. Sorry Amazon.
685	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased more than a dozen sticky pads over the years and i like this one the best because it has a larger surface area of almost 7" x 9" compared to the typical 4" x 6" size. And this pad's stickiness is just right, where as other sticky pads you will have to use force peel your cellphone off the stick mat and the cellphone paint and then you need to re-apply the phone's screen protector touch up the cellphone's lost paint. I recommend this product and have bought a 2nd one!

Nothing major, and nothing to warrant the loss of a star, but the one thing I feel could have been better is a more clear indication of the charge level on the device. The LEDs don't fully match up with the writing and I mistakenly thought it was fully charged when it was only 3/4ths of the way.



Since I bought my NewTrent device, my Uncle, my niece, my mom AND and girlfriends daughter all bought the IMP500! I have turned them ALL on to it.

We both were quite excited to see this product available and couldn't wait to get it.  It lives up to the JABRA standards-  works very well, and looks great.  It is very simple to get set up and to use.  We couldn't be more pleased with our purchase!!!
* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. "push mail"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).


2) The unit is very sensitive to location. I had to fiddle with the indoor antenna's location in relation to the amplifier to get the strongest, most consistent signal
8455	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this radio is awesome- and after 8 weeks i still haven't had the need to recharge the batteries- comes with all you need






6071	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I work for an on-call computer service. I never know where I'll be going and what kind of power source will be available should I have to be there very long. I use both a smart phone and a pad in my work. I like the larger view that the pad gives me but mapping a trip and researching a problem can drain a battery quick, forcing me to rely on my smaller device to fill the gap when the bigger device runs low on battery. The IMP52D takes care of this problem in spades by removing the either/or option. From a single charge I was able to refresh the battery on my pad from 37% to full once, the battery on my smart phone from 26% to full once, and refreshed the battery on my stereo blue tooth head set 17 times (so far) and the IMP52D still has power left on the four LED charge indicator.

LOOKS: This stealth phone definitely flies under the radar. No bling. No wow factor. I like to think of it as a high end, understated Benz whilst the iPhone is a mass-marketed, gold-laden, flashy Cadillac. Of course, the iPhones aren't even remotely in this phone's league. The upcoming N97 from Nokia has more features, but it is larger, is a 'slider,' uses a touch screen and doesn't have a Xenon flash. Oh, and it's $300-400 more expensive.
2079	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Before I bought this I had to go outside to talk on my cell phone. I contacted my carrier and found which side of my house a tower was located on. I installed the outside antenna per the directions on that side of the house. I went from 1 bar inside my house to 4 bars. This really works. It boost the signal just as it says. When I bought this I kept all the packing material expecting to return, I didn't. It's still working great.
9596	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The 801247 was the perfect solution for us.  It was installed in a 100' x 40', metal roofed building with the antenna mounted above the roof. Before it was installed cell phone reception in the building was very poor (and phone battery life was drastically reduced) unless you were near an outside wall.  Now reception is great anywhere within the building.  We had considered the next model up from this one (the 841262) - but because we had a very strong signal outside the building decided to go with this one and we are happy with our choice.
8708	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It saved me some cash by continue to use BlackBerry.
Now for the important part:  how it works.  The Jawbone was simple to pair with my cell phone (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HP-iPaq-6945-Unlocked-Cell-Phone-with-Wi-fi-GPS-MP3-Video-Player-SD-U-S-Version-with-Warranty-Silver/dp/B000ILDSLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)</a>), as most Bluetooth headsets are.  More importantly, I've paired it once and it has maintained that pairing without issue ever since, unlike the previous headset I owned which lost its pairing at least once a week, usually while mid-conversation.  This is annoying, certainly, but for a user that won't use their cell phone while driving without a hands-free device, this is very unsettling.  If I wanted/needed to continue a call while on the road, I disconnected the call, pulled over to re-pair the two devices, and then started my call and my trip again.  This is a major issue for me, so I am extremely appreciative of Jawbone's reliability.

The phone stays paired until you move out of range or turn off the Jabra SP5050. The range is pretty far. I had my phone sitting on my desk near the window facing the street. My car was parked on the street in front of my house--they stayed paired overnight and drained the batteries on both devices. I now make sure to turn off the Jabra SP5050 when I leave the car. It does turn itself off when the phone goes out of range for 15 minutes in case you forget.

I sent pushcartdeals an email and recieved nothing in return yet. Everything else was just fine except not recieving what I paid for in full. The case itself is great, at least the pieces I have protect the phone very well.
So Now I have two batteries that won't hold a charge. I charge them both on my day off and switch.  Thank goodness I have a charger at work and a charger in the car. I should have trusted the reviews!
7747	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent for hearing on both ends, noise cancellation works great. People barely know I am on a mobile phone. Holds a charge really well, and only really need to recharge every other day, unless making alot of calls.
- Spanish manual and default language
Overall one of the better chargers that I have seen - a few tweaks to the product would be nice, but they do not detract from the overall product.  A definite must have for those looking for a pocketsize charger that has style, useability, and portability!
2572	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this thinking I was going to get an upgrade to the 500.  Unfortunately, though it was smaller, the ear piece was larger so I couldn't get the jabba gel over it.  Without the gel, the ear piece just sat on the ear which made it unstable when moving.
5.  The useable distance is quite short.  If I get much more than about 10 feet from my phone, the sound quality gets "crackly" and the link may be dropped.  Under normal situations, like having the phone in my pocket, or on the car seat next to me, or on my desk while I take a short walkie, you get the picture.....the reception/distance is just fine.
Pocketability is a big concern for me.  The 510 isn't really pocketable.  I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it.  The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable.  The BT8040 is a micro-sized "brick" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable.
Well written hardware code
I used it on my computer desk. Then I took it to the car and placed it on the sun visor. There is a magnetic clip provided which you can place on any side of the visor for you convenience.

223	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love this! The HTC M9 is a beautiful phone, but I have a lot of issues with the battery lasting just for part of they day. When I am at the office I have it plugged in, so it is not an issue, but when I am off, like on the weekend and running around and not able to plug in, the battery is at 50% by noon. This battery extender is a life saver. In the past, I have used a power bank, which means I have to carry a cord to connect the power bank to my phone, so that is added inconvenience. Also, it is awkward to use my phone when it is plugged into the power bank. This here is a great alternative since I am able to (very easily) slide my phone into the case, making it feel like I am just carrying my phone, instead of three items. It is very light weight and adds a little length, but I don't find it an issue. I have used products similar like this in the past and this one is very slim compared to others, which where bulkier and heavier. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.

First, I have used the previous version of this booster with my Galaxy SIII.  It worked like a charm.  Now, I needed a larger unit to accommodate my larger NOTE4 phone.  This unit fit the phone, without the case, and ultra snug with the my ottercase.

FEATURES - The phone is a 3G phone which means if you want (relatively)high speed internet or the ability to watch streaming videos/tv on your phone then this should work better than the non 3g models out there.  Personally I don't get why anyone would pay such ridiculously high monthly fees for the Cingular Data services just for the "privilige" of watching tv on a 2 inch screen!  Apart from that the phone has most of the standard cell phone features available out there including, quad band GSM, bluetooth (including bluetooth stereo headphone compatibility), and a nice 2 megapixel camera.  The camera takes wonderful pictures (as long you hold your hand still) but the video is pretty lousy (hey its a cell phone not a camcorder!). Despite all of these nice features there is one major omission in the feature set and that is the lack of voice dialing.  This is truely a sin in this phone because what is the point of having handsfree bluetooth if you still have to pick up the phone and search the phonebook to dial a number while driving?  Another big minus with this phone is that it does not include any cables to connect it to your computer. Normally I would not care if a cable was included with a cell phone but lets not forget that you have to have a way to get songs onto the phone.  Not a problem if you have a blutooth adapter on your computer or you buy a micro sd card with an sd adapter to just put the songs directly on the card, but Samsung is really going cheap by making this phone have a proprietary connector and then making you pay extra to buy it.
1544	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is, by far, the BEST bluetooth headset I have ever owned. I've tried all the Motorola ones, and they pale in comparison to the Plantronics. You can see by all the positive reviews that this thing is amazing.  I can walk all over my house while my phone is in one spot, and talk without any interference.  The only problem is that I always forget where I put my phone!  The range on this headset is truly amazing.






The directions in the Manual are easy to understand.  I like that it came with a carry pouch.  It fits into my purse or even in a pocket. It stayed charged for over twenty hours while running several devices. It was still charged when I went to bed.  The pointer worked great it has  good range.
2872	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I got a bad one.  One of the split channels works, the other split channel is dead.  Since this adapter worked for others, I will return my dead one, reorder, and hope for the best.
The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
The reception is no better than other cell phones on the T-Mobile network.  Since it is a quad-band phone, I expected more.
Another thing that i want to point out,the unit doesn't come with the power adapter. so use the one that comes with your phone.
4736	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Best customer service and delivery time ever received.  The Jawbone arrived faster than anticipated.  Little learning curve to know how to properly place the headset and adjust for comfort.  Once learning curve transpired, no problems with the Jawbone.  Would recommend to everyone.

5107	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Looks and is ok but I found my phone did not fit provided connectors although phone brand was not actual one provided, was going to need to buy two additional connections at high cost.  Returned in favor of separate plugs.
however, 4.x firmware has a2dp added, but it works only with included players, and it has crashing problem with realplayer
2386	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The headset works pretty well with my treo 755p. In fact, it's the best headset I've found for the treo (tried plantronics and motorola previously without success). However, the ear hooks were missing from the package and Samsung customer service wouldn't even speak to me without me providing my phone's ESN numbers. WTH? I also attempted to make a request on Samsung's service website, which also would not function correctly. I called Amazon CS and they sent a replacement after 4 minutes on the phone. AWESOME!
One might be disappointed by the standby time let alone the talk time... it is very short, definitely contradicts the spec.
Lowest shipped price I have found.
I can hear clearly and be heard clearly.  It rests well on the ear and doesn't cause discomfort.  It has fallen off once as I was getting out of a car as it just slipped so I just have to be aware of that.

It's small enough to fit in my pocket and it really makes my life easier! It has a built in red laser and a led white flashlight built in. I play with those but haven't "used" them yet. The charger keeps my phone or tablet charged all day long for a few days! I never have to worry about finding a place to charge my phone, it's always charged. My car cigarette lighter plugs are in use for a flashlight and my gps and my kids stuff and I always need a place to plug my phone into... not anymore! I never have to worry about a low battery with this charger! When I have my Tablet and Phone or if my husband is with me I use the bigger New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Dual USB Ports External Battery Pack. It has 2 charging ports so we are both charged at all times! We go to breakfast every weekend - our "get away" from the kids... "OUR" time! I never have to worry about running out of battery ever again! 10 stars at the very least! For both of these products!
*The email is really easy to set up you just type in your address and password and it is ready to receive emails. I don't like how the emails show up in two places, in your mailbox and in your test message folder because it gets very crowded with texts, and emails from two accounts. Does anybody know if this is a feature you can turn off or not?
* The (mostly) positive reviews
5303	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This screen protector does an excellent job of protecting your phone from scratches, but it requires a lot of patience (and a very clean room) to apply. If you get any lint, dust or oil between the screen and this protector, it will be very noticeable when you use the phone later. Of course, since the screen protector is coated with adhesive, it's practically a magnet for dust. But since this is easily washable, it can be applied cleanly with the included squeegee and an appropriate amount of care. Once you have the screen protector on, it won't come off unless you want it to, but when removed, there is no residue left on the screen. All in all, a good product as long as you don't mind taking the time to apply it carefully and in a dust-free environment.
There was not much good about the phones other than the:
I needed a way to put a large headphone plug into a tiny jack hole. this is not what i expected it to be. really there are nicer tools for you to get nearly as inexpensive this is not the tool you want!

7282	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Excelente
My biggest complaint is the battery life.  But they at least had the wisdom to make the battery removable so you can carry around a spare.  If you don't have a spare, expect to charge it daily if you use it often enough.  For slight usage (in which case, what is the point) you can probably get away with charging every other night.
3630	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love the item. Functions as described/designed and I am satisified.  I would purchase this item again and I would recommend it to anyone.
electricity is touch and go in some countries iTorch would be a very handy

1622	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is my 3rd bluetooth. Works very well, my others had lots of static and noise, this has minimal noise. also fits very well to my ear.
8216	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I originally bought this case since at the time I had a first generation iphone and case selections were limited. It definitely fit great and felt awesome in my hand. Obviously this case does not protect the screen but does shield the rest of the case from scratches. I had a Zagg invisible shield screen protector on along with this case and my iphone was still in mint condition when time came to pass it along to someone else.
Lastly, you must be within 6 feet of the antenna for it to work properly. That in itself requires careful thought as to the placement of everything. You want it to be in an area you are comfortable taking all of your calls from.
7720	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very well made and feels great in your hand.  Protects the phone just as it should.  I got a great deal and just wish I bought two of them.

9196	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought my IMP500 several months ago and my whole family loves the product! The IMP500 can power many different products such as Nintendo DS Lite, Gameboy, or a Ipod Touch to name a few. This is a very long life solid power pack. It usually lasts for days of intermittent use without needing to be recharged. I share the power pack with my son who uses it for his Nintendo DS Lite and his IPod Touch and my wife who uses it for her phone. This is a very versatile product with a lot of power in it. The indicator lights tell you how much juice is left and flash when you recharge the power pack. The on/off switch insures you don't accidentally discharge the power pack. I have no complaints about this product and would highly recommend it.
3668	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Work ok

The battery life is very good, the sound is great, the part that wraps around the ear is comfortable. This bluetooth is PERFECT in every way. It's the absolute best one I've ever used. Don't hesitate to buy this. Get 2. Get one for yourself and one as a gift. Whoever you gift this to will love it. Once you use this bluetooth, you will not want to use any of the others on the market. I'm so spoiled now, I can't imagine ever go back to using any of the others out there. This one is a keeper!
8204	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	the screen protector came in good conditions fit my cellphone perfectly. Just remeber to clean very well your cellphone so no dust is tehre . you don't want to repead teh same steps i did. I had to wash it like four times and use an airduster to clean my cellphone so no dust will be show

7179	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Arrived quick and brought new life to an old phone! Definitely would buy one or more to keep the old phone going.
you just stick the button to your case and then slip the clip on it or take it off if you like, the button stays.  it also acts as a little stand for my smartphone.  the clip turns in any directon, so it works well for me.  i bought 6 packs, for any new phone i might get and one for my ipod touch.
2944	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I actually use this as a battery backup for when the power goes out in the winter time/emergencies. I like knowing my devices can be kept charged and i can keep i touch with the outside world if i become isolated for a period of time. I just keep a stock of batteries and itll charge my phone over and over.
7599	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I wanted something for my iPod Touch that would protect it but not require a bulky case. I already have a TPU case on it to protect it while in use, and this sleeve case works great to protect the whole thing when it's in my computer bag, backpack etc. It's soft and can even be used to wipe the screen clean when needed. Very simple but useful product.
The laser pointer is extremely bright and fun to use when playing with the pets! The flashlight could be a little brighter, but it does the job. Overall, this is an excellent solution to any battery life issues you may have. As of this review, I have not come across anything I dislike about the product. It works exactly as advertised.

5328	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Fairly easy to assemble, and not too bad to take down and put back up as necessary. Could be better assembly instructions.  Had to use some trial and error on where to place the nuts and bolts to allow proper extension of the panels.

449	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I use it with a Garmin StreetPilot 7200, which is a fairly large, even somewhat clunky GPS with a large 7-inch screen.  The screen does vibrate just a bit when going down the road, but nothing major.  I have it sitting on the dash of an Armada, inside a slightly crevassed area just to the right of my steering wheel/main console.  It sits perfectly, so I can see it with my bi-focal sunglasses and still clearly see the road. I have had no problems with it sliding off or tipping.  It has a locking mechanism at the bottom, which I cannot slide over to lock the mount connection because the Garmin GPS is already wedged so tightly into the beanbag mount; no big deal though...doubt I would use it anyway, I don't see the need since it fits so securely without it. It is a well-made beanbag mount that I think will last a while and I got it for a great price here on Amazon.


I am happy with my purchase, especially at the great price I got it for.

4181	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The sound quality on this thing is just as good, if not better than advertised. I use a Blackberry 8830 and it is known for high amounts of background noise. When using this headset, virtually all background noise is eliminated. Best noise reduction headset on the market.
3358	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Theoretically, this is supposed to make the image sharper, right?  It actually looks worse than using the stock RCA connector to me...

3792	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have now used this in two different cars, and it is perfect - you can have the USB ports (and 12V ports, if needed) where you need them. The USB ports are also high-power enough to charge not just the usual GPS and Smartphone, but even my iPad, which needs 2A to charge.
socket and quality premium flexible material in coil cord its tops, I give
It is very well constructed with a professional looking fit and finish.  It offers great protection against bumps and fall.
The Plantronics was also great with respect to sound quality; I would say though that it did not quite beat the Jawbone while driving in a car.. (I did not try either one while walking outside in wind though). I did not quite like the large size though (my pockets are full enough already with my cell phone, keys, wallet...), and as someone mentioned, it would seem that it could easily wear out after prolonged pocket-use... Finally, I did not like the proprietary charging connector. (Give me standard mini-USB please; or else micro-USB will work too).
- Second earbud is fragile and cumbersome. It would be nice to have a better way to carry it, maybe something that would attach to the neckband.
3205	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It does not work for me. I know it might for some.
9. It fits ok with my glasses, although far from perfect. However I may have to try out others in order to see whether this one is better than the rest.
This headset's sound quality is the best one I have found after trying ones from motorola, logitech and plantonics.  I am told the background noise is hardly noticeable.  The earpiece fits into the ear which makes the sound a lot clearer than the 'lay over the ear' style used by motorola headsets. If the earpiece doesn't stay in the ear, use  a 'twist-tie' and shape it into an earliece loop. Its light and custom shapable. A black twist-tie will even match the headset. This trouble is well worth the superior size and sound quality of this pproduct!

9724	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	very good.
1304	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	After a week the headset would hang up while I was talking, also it would dial out for no reason, I use to own a HS850 before it got stolen from me, this one here I threw out the window a couple days ago. I think it was refurbed
Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.
8981	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had IMP52D for the last few days and I have to say- it's one of the best chargers I have used. The biggest thing I noticed right off the bat was how small it was. Much smaller then I was expecting. The size makes it easy to carry around in pocket, briefcase or just about anything. The size also makes it really nice to be able to have it charging a device and leave them connected in pocket without a bunch of bulk.
5078	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The Navigon 4.3" case is quite large for the Garmin Nuvi 200W.  It really is too big for this GPS.
2728	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	the selection is awesome. so many to choose from, not easy to do. my husband is happy with the case.


I already recommended to my friends who visited and liked it.
The only issue I have is the battery pack might not store as much juice as advertised.  I get about 1 full charge on my iPhone5 - it is advertised to provide 2-3 full charges.  I don't see that happening ever!  But this is still light, compact and easy to carry around all day in your pocket just in case you need some added power to your phone or other device.
3058	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Case is great.  To bad Neat Software (as of today) has switched to a cloud based service and has stopped supporting the non cloud based software.

Whoever had the booster had 1 bar more.
5194	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought the Jabra over other stereo choices specifically because you can use your own headphones. I have hard to fit ears, and I've found over the years that little earbuds are extremely fragile. I usually develop a bad connection in one wire or another after about a year, so I thought it would be wise for me to get something that I could always replace the part that will likely break first-- the headphones. My primary use is with my phone for talking and listening to music.
7901	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The cable rubber part is way too thick! I wanted to use it for my extended battery...and it doesn't fit!
3785	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Having only a single, low power port in my Fiat 500, I wanted something that could run my two to four devices and be hard wired into the car's electrical system.

7737	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I LOVE this design. I can just flip the boom and I don't have to worry about my headset calling anyone.  The previous bluetooths I owned called people from my purse, which I hated.  With the H710 not only does is not call people accidentally but it also saves the battery.  I could go a few days without charging it which, is great in my opinion.  As soon as I open the boom the phone recognizes it and I could use it again.  There were a few times I had to manually sync the bluetooth but that is a minor set back.
7995	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	You can pay a ridiculous amount of money for the Samsung version, or you can choose this cable instead and pay practically nothing. So awesome.  I bought one over a year ago, but I took it camping (don't ask) and lost it. I can't believe how inexpensive they are! I'm so glad I can replace the cable without having to go hungry for it.
Note: make sure you remember to pack the cable, or else this thing is useless!  Also, I may pick up another version of this that packs a bit more mustard for extended vacays away from the plug.  New Trent has a few bigger dogs out there that offer twice as much charging punch for a few more bucks.

I think that pretty much covers everything about the charger; in conclusion I really don't have any major complaints about the device, for the week that I have been using it heavily I have never really had any problems with it. It's worked and I haven't had any malfunctions or something terrible like that.  If New Trent could improve something in my opinion it would be having the LEDs turning off while the charger is actually charging a device, and having an easier way to turn on and off the LED flash light.  But if you are looking for a USB battery charger I would defiantly consider this one just because of the form factor along with the features it brings at the price range.

Oh and the laser pointer is a lot of fun for my cats too. :)

1288	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I had this headset for about 5 months, I mean I had 3 of them. All of them had one same problem - super low volume. And it cannot be increased. First one I got I thought it was broken, but when got the replacement, same problem with volume... Two months down the road of very low usage, the main button went bad. Anytime I wanted to start using it, it would redial the same exact number, no matter which number I dialed last. I sent for replacement, got my third one and had same problem with volume. Decided to sell it on eBay. Got myself a brand new model of Jabra - BT500 and love it. Volume is perfect, sits comfortably on my ear, does not fall even if I shake my head, people hear me without any problems and distance is good as well. Charges fast and battery last long.
Also, supposedly there is an adapter you can use to use this on your landline, if you are the type who still has one of those things.

6. The mount is very reasonably priced.
Quality of sound is great. I only notice stutter (some people call it static but it's a stutter not a hiss) if I get a wall or two or about 25 feet of clear space away from my Samsung. If my phone is charging in my car, I will just set the phone up on my dash and run into a store to get a refill and not lose the signal while I'm inside. Sometimes if certain things touch against the BT antenna part of my phone, I will hear a little stutter. I just move my arm or whatever it was away from the spot and all is well again. The funny thing is, I can't purposely cause this when I try to cover my phone with my hand or arm; it is only in certain circumstances as if it has to do with the wireless signal bouncing around just right to cause stutter.
7869	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Simple device; Inexpensive; Works well.  Note the contacts are regular steel.  If you want higher fidelity with gold headphone jacks, look for one similar to this, but with gold plated contacts.  This little pigtail is quite flexible, and does not lose connection when bent.

You can use the Motorola Roadster Pro straight out of the box since it is delivered at medium battery level. When you turn it on for the first time, you are directed to go to the bluetooth setting on your phone. It works with any bluetooth enabled cell phone. A pin number is provided, if needed. A female voice walks you through the connection process and although the voice is a little mechanical, it's easy to understand and speaks English only. I paired it with an iPhone 6 (all you have to do is turn bluetooth on and the iPhone and Motorola Roadster Pro make the connections for you) and HTC M8 without issue. There is an audible battery status given and a light on the side provides constant battery usage with red meaning low, purple/medium and blue/high.

I hope this is helpful because the rest of the unit functions as expected! I still recommend it to let you walk about with your phone and have headsets on..:)
i so want to keep it. i even looked at upgrading my phone to a 700, but alas, that doesn't have version 2.0 of bluetoothe either.
My only issue is it was a little bit bulkier than I expected, it doesn't fit in my pocket with my phone too well. The external charger my girlfriend has is a lot slimmer, and fits very well. But that's my fault for not looking at the specifications.


I was a little disappointed to see that it lacks the necessary lightning grounding for a true roof mounting. Having a metal exterior on my home, I'm wary of mounting this on the roof without proper protection.
Add to that what others have said about the unit getting hot (really hot) and forget it. What a waste of money. So glad Amazon takes such good care of their customers so that I don't have to sweat about this. I'm shocked that there are reviews on this product with people saying it actually makes some kind of difference. Personally, I think it's the placebo effect... they want it to work, so they think it works. In addition to speaking with their technical support, I have a deep knowledge of electronics and I am a licensed amateur radio operator. Trust me when I say, don't waste your money on this hype... it's nothing but a gimmick.

I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well.

2996	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone, but no driver for it.  The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone. Go through live Internet update to version 4.35, still no driver for it.  Tried Motorola web site, there is no driver download for this phone. Contacted Motorol support, they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone.  Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later, on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours, still could not get the driver.

1577	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	After reading reviews, buying headsets and being dissapointed, I finally found a good one.  The Voyager 510 is light, and sits securely in your ear.  I have checked with many people and nobody has been able to tell I was on a wireless headset so far.  Volume is good and it looks ok as well.

One thing that consistently prevented me from buying Cingular's Audiovox SMT5600 was the outdated version of the OS, the data plan required for the rebates, the 2 year contract, and the fact that Cingular really does not make it easy for existing customers to get a deal that's comparable to what new subscribers get. T-Mobile has showed me a way out. A 1 year contract, no problem with transfering 2 numbers from Cingular, and a device running Windows Smartphone 2005 was all it took to say good bye.

* The N95-2 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6" to 2.8" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.

Update: It doesn't charge the phone to 100%. I only get between 75 to 90% if I don't use it all all during charging.

The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset functions flawlessly. However, I found that the design of the headset makes it an inconvenience to put on. Apart from the flawed ergonomics, this headset is just about perfect - 4.5 Stars!
5168	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Excellent speaker phone. Pairing with a Razr was a snap, and I've had no issues with the level of volume that some others have complained about. And best of all, you don't have to walk around looking like a dork with one of those goofy earpieces hanging off the side of your head.
6189	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the IMP52D iTorch external battery, on Sept 21st - fast shipping.  The packaging is great, very easy to open and get to the product.  The included cables are good, but I have been using a retractable micro usb.  It just keeps things neat I think.  I like the laser pointer and used it a few times to point something out.  I think the flashlight is extremely bright, and has come in handy a few times.  I have been charging my phone for the past week with it, instead of the wall plug, and have got 5 charges out of it before it seemed like it was going to die, HTC evo 4g.  I like the blue light indicator of remaining charge, very clean looking.  I wish it could charge a Xoom, but I guess that requires a higher voltage.  The build is solid and looks like quality material.  Kind of reminds me of a block phone like a Nokia.  It is small enough to carry without really noticing you have it in your pocket.  Very good for someone who travels and needs some extra charge on a long flight or even a weekend camping.  I am bringing it with me this weekend on a long flight and am confident it will get me through six hours of video on my phone.  Overall it gets a 5 out of 5 from me.  Hope this review helps. - Ryan
Also there is no more of my breathing noise into the mic of the Samsung SCHu-740 handset. I consider it amazing that I can keep my phone calls private at work by standing close to a constant noise source like a blower fan or A/C unit.

7727	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This is the most painful headset I've ever used. The sound quality is no big deal either. The fact that it is not easy to put on and take off quickly makes it so you have to keep it on if you don't want to miss a call. But keeping it on for a couple of hours caused me pain no matter which size ear pad I used. The charger is only for home, so no quick charge in the car in any emergency. The Jawbone is much better for comfort and I've had no problems with it at all as far as sound quality. The jawbone charger is its weak link, however, as with time it becomes loose and difficult to connect to the device.
4) Comes with the needed "shorted" cables and bag to carry
9459	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I had the previous version made by Wilson for 4G Verizon. That one works well indoors. Not the best boosting, but enough to hold a 3G or 4G a a bar or so.  So I had high expectations for this one which was twice the cost of the previous version when I bought that one.  But this one did little, to no, to even slightly worse signal "boosting".  Sadly.  If it had increased signal strength by a few bars I would have given it 5 stars. But it basically showed no improvement from the previous booster.
Anyway, it came with a little quick user guide that was in english and i charged it up that night and it was ready to use. So far my call quality is better than my old phone....wierd. i was expecting crappy call quality but what you know! it was easy to program (there are lots of program codes online for this fon including if you want your id blocked and what not). i inserted the sim wrong and it kept saying no sim with the blinking x so i called t-mobile and after the customer service took the mobile id number, She said the phone should be ready to use. Of course i realized the gold plated end of the sim goes in last, the clear part goes in the slot first. Battery life seems good for now. i dropped it in the gym and somewhere else and it still works great. the little user guide was helpful in terms of knowing how to send text messages, know how to find the last numbers dialed and what not.

7762	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This headset wasn't the best quality - it was great for me, the talker, but the mic didn't work so well.

The screen is suprisingly resillent.  I'm pretty rough on my portable equipment, and even with shoving this phone in pockets with change and keys and whatnot, there are no scratches on the screen.  I've also dropped it a couple times and it's survived.




Here are the phone's cons: I said "in your pocket" because if you mount this thing on your belt, the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket.  Also, in an age of identity theft and information security, you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there.  Believe me, the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords, account information, customer information, etc.  Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant, or if it's stolen.

1. The sound quality is superb. Most of the time people don't even know that I'm in the car. However, the sound quality is limited to the sound quality of your phone. If you are having major problems with the sound quality, then test the speakerphone on multiple phones. Most likely the problem is with your phone and not the speakerphone. Another IMPORTANT note: the microphone on the antenna must be within about a 45 degree angle of your head to get the best results. For example, if the speaker phone is on top of your head, then obviously you won't get as good of sound compared to the speakerphone being in front of you. The directions that come with the phone show a diagram of where the speakerphone should be relative to your head for best results.

Pros:

Overall there's no real reason not to recommend this phone. It's sleek and stylish, has a great price point, comes with plenty of goodies and plays music very, very well. It's worth every penny I paid for it, and that's not something I can often say!

Longer review:

When I received the product, I was expecting a simple battery.  It instead includes an LED flashlight and a laser pointer, in addition to battery power, a plus.

1)  I replaced the terrible ear attachment loop with a jabra ear gel I have left from an old headset.  It works much much better than the Samsung provided ear loop.  I have already broken both ear loops provided with the headset because you have to take them on and off to charge it.  Dumb design.
7045	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	WAY TO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
A couple of concerns, one it mentioned not for areas that exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  I'd hate to on a daily basis have to take down the unit and carry it inside, unscrew the antenna to disconnect etc.  The temperature limit is going to be exceeded often even in the Northern United States, maybe not right now in February, but soon enough.  Cars can easily obtain 30+ degrees hotter than that limit sometimes even with the window cracked.  My GPS often gets hot when I parked at a restaurant for lunch on my Chicago commute.  I've had power amplifiers burn up on my dash and even some in dash because of heat.  Now, this company is said to make boost units for outdoor and indoor ATM's and such, so why make something to be used for cars, that with even normal use is likely to overheat and break?  Next, the side stays on this pull off and are adjustable to different phone widths, My BLU phone was already at the outer limit, I suspect there might be wider phones that would work.  That aside, my LG flip phone was much too small to fit even the lowest width adjustment.  There is a growing trend of people wanting some of the older smaller more portable and more battery efficient phones, this would not work for them.  It might however extend the battery transmit life if you talk a lot for the bigger phones.

The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
9780	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The batteries are great - 1 star off as one of the battery blister packs was open and the battery was dead. For the price, I can't complain as the whole pack cost about what I would've paid for just 1 battery retail.

For $600, I think there should be a Microsoft Office reader but there is none, Acrobat reader? Noo, None of my old game works because the buttons are missing and no games come with it either.

2450	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great.  Help protect the Bluetooth while not in use.  Practical case.
If you have similar needs/usage expectations, this headset will work well with the Treo 650.

There is only one other better Plantronics Bluetooth headset that is possessedly more advanced (655).  But I am extremely happy with this one, as it retails for about $50.  You can even buy aditional equipment and this headset can be used in your office or home with a regular land line as well.  Not only for cellular.  Awesome!
ill be updating to a NMO trucker antenna to get them maximum benefit out of this little booster.

7765	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love everything about the H710 Bluetooth Headset. It is small and compact, easy to turn on and off, fits my ear wonderfully for I have small ears, great sound and easy to use.  It does let me get more than 300 feet from my phone but not to much more so that is wonderful.  I have had several Bluetooths that have cost a lot more and have not worked as good as this one. I think if you try this one you will like it.

Keyboard is great.
I got this phone about a month ago and I can tell you that its one of the best phone's I've ever owned. Much sleeker and compact yet just as capable as the curve. Wifi is a BIG advantage because I only pay 10 bucks per month for the unlimited email plan and thats it. No need to pay data fees. Wifi inernet browsing is free and I also IM via wifi. If you go for hotspot@home then all your wifi based calls are free as well, no matter what wifi network you're on!


Played some Logic from Play Music and bass is decent. A little too much treble for me but I'll live with it. The headset sounds good when both ear pieces are in your ears.

4044	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	First of all, the YX3000 performs as described.  I have been using it in an office building where my cell phone reception is blocked by a steel structual support column.  By placing the base unit in a window and routing the antenna wire around the structual column and placing the antenna near my desk, my reception improved by 3 to 4 bars.
5294	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This si the second charger like this I purchased. So far they each have lasted a year and worked on all LG phones I've tried (a Vu, Shine, and a purple flip phone). Each phone charges just fine. The only thing I would say is it takes longer to reach a full charge than using the LG brand charger that came with my phone. It's great as a back up charger. I keep one at work in my desk and gave the other to my mother since she is always losing and then finding her charger.
9855	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I received the unit quickly.  Was able to opne it, and mount it on my windshield within 3 minutes.  The phone shakes quite a bit in my truck with the included extended arm, but does not in my car without being extended arm.  The positioning of the phone is viewable nicely.  Would recommned it!


4239	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the only case I have for my phone but I did look at and try out several others in the store before buying.  The dealer at the AT&T store cautioned me that it was a tight fit and that he didn't like it for that reason.  I have since found that it is really a perfect fit, and not tight at all, if you insert the phone in the correct orientation - which is to say with the screen facing the back.  Secure but not tight with no risk of falling out.  I read the complaints about the cutaways.  I actually count the cutaways at the corners as an advantage because they allow you to access the controls and have headphones plugged in while in the case, which other cases without the cutaways do not.  I suppose if you have the misfortune of dropping the phone in the case and a corner hits then it might damage the corners but I wanted that added functionality, so just don't drop your phone.  I think this is the most attractive of all the cases and I am proud to wear it on my belt at work or with dress clothes.  The velcro latching mechanism is superb and I don't see this ever wearing out like some cheaper velcro does.  also I paid $30 dollars for this at the AT&T store so the amazon.com price is a bargain.  Highly recommended.

9241	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When my dad decided he wanted a smartphone, we were really concerned about protecting it because he works in a hot factory where he welds and runs machinery all day and has mangled and melted parts of a few cheap flip phones.  He also sent one through the lawnmower blades when it fell out of his pocket.  So after ordering his first smartphone, mom and i decided to get this for him as well as a heavy duty case and a screen protector.  He has the samsung exhilirate phone with a bulky ballistic case and a regular screen protector...so far his phone has been well protected for 8 months in this along with the case and screen protector.  Alas, the clip on the back of this belt holster finally ripped away from the fabric and he has it super glued on for now (which is working).  He wants a new one though, so I'm getting him a second one.  He's really really rough on everything when he's working so this should hold up for a while under rough conditions and for much longer under normal circumstances.  It's also roomy and fits his bulky case.
3084	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I'll echo the two previous reviews.  I love the clarity and brightness of the screen, and the many thoughtful features.  It takes a while to get used to the tiny keys which are harder to use than the Blackberry or Treo products, but eventually quite usable.  The scroll wheel is a big help and the back key really helps, once you figure out where it's likely to take you.  The menus are NOT as user intuitive as they could be, however, and I hope they'll revise them in a future iteration/upgrade.  They could have given more interesting choices in the included ringtones.  One fabulously annoying thing: the LOUD whooshing sound they included for the "turn on" and an equally noxious sound for the "turn off" of the device.  And all the other sounds can be changed or muted or added to, but not these.  You just can't get rid of them and that makes it astoundingly embarrassing when trying to turn your phone off at a meeting or in a conference.  This was simply stupid designing by some committee somewhere.
6314	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This item came in tried it immediately & it didn't work. I could hear them they couldn't hear me thought it might be muted but called motorola  they said needed to be replaced .It may have been great if I could have got it to work
2. When it drops connection with the phone it does not automatically reconnect when it comes back in range, annoying.
The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card.  To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway.  It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.
1880	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This cover is just what I was looking for. It fits great. I can leave it on all the time while taking pictures, charging, etc. I had a different cover at first that I had to remove for pictures. I haven't found a con yet. And it looks good too.
Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design.  I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset!

If you want to synchronize with Outlook, you are limited to around 200 contacts and the field names are shorter.  You will probably have to edit names to fit the available field lengths.  I don't change my contacts too often, so synchronization with Outlook is not important to me.
If you're looking for cute, look elsewhere; if you want an affordable and reliable headset, this deserves a close look.
Pros:
this will not be my first time :)
There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser.  The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs.
1983	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Hands free holder for my iPod. Clips on AC vent on dash.
In short - if you're shopping for small, sleek, light mobile phone with all the basic functions plus some added musical ones, this is your perfect choice. It's hard to get anything better for the money.
Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor --- two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable (had to buy one at Wal-Mart).
- No modern bells or whistles

5386	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	NOT RECOMMENDED!!
4941	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These Worked great for my Mophie juice air pack.  Now I have extra spares in case I break another adapter.
4406	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Got the card for free with a phone purchase. To activate the SIM card, you have to provide your credit card number. I asked not to be charged beyond the initial $9.99, so they did not bother to activate...

Good quality and works well.  Get it!

4) Be able to pretend that its not there (ie not obviously present at a quick glance.)
9382	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	In 4 months I will open & use it for the 1st time
2. A long goose neck brings the GPS closer to the driver. This makes it much easier to reach and switch modes or change destination without taking the unit off the mount. And for those of us with bad eye sight it is easier to read the street names and other information on the screen.

Pros: Your iPhone screen is protected, and you have a always available mirror



First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.

-Short battery life (gotta keep it small and cheap somehow)
charges fast so you are ready for the day
4439	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We've been using 2 of these batteries for ten days now with no problems at all. They were new in appearance and we did charge them with the phones off for 12 hours prior to the first use. Follow up review - It's been 2 full months now since we bought these batteries and they are still working perfectly.

It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.
Fast to charge, less than 2hrs if fully dead
5954	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I really wanted this to work but it never charged my phone for more than 2 minutes. Don't buy it.
1344	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design.  When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.

1. Annoying screen lock issue noticed by everyone

3964	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This bluetooth speakerphone is the first model I have purchased and in the first week of using it I can say I will find few reasons to use a headset in my car ever again.  I have been using headsets while driving for several years.  Now that CA requires a handsfree device it has been a chore to always ensure that I have a headset with me or in my car, charged and ready.  This purchase was an attempt to meet the handsfree need and find a device that would be more difficult to lose or break than my headsets have been.



5098	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	For the price (I paid maybe $5.00 total, including shipping), it's excellent. I had no trouble with the cable at all.
Unless you *have* to have it, however, I recommend against buying this unit until early adopters report that its performance has improved to being minimally acceptable.  At the moment, it isn't!
Still perfect though!
6762	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	OK
- Included micro-usb cable to charge
What kills this phone is the interface, especially the "buttons" on the front.
I am going to look for a Tape Deck adapter with a IPhone connector.

The ear volume is to quiet.
I am very pleased.
1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.


I like the magnetic latch mechanism, it's convenient that I don't need to be forcing a snap and it's pretty quite.
A 3 Second Hold Click turns on the battery pack (if it's not already on) and also turns on the LED light - again at first, I was confused by the white light going on & off -
9205	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This external battery pack works great. It is 5000 ma hours so it has power to spare. It will recharge my iTouch from 3-5 times. I would like to see a couple of design improvements though. It would be nice if the adapter that connected with the iTouch accepted the power cable at a right angle instead of straight out from the bottom. It's fine in its current design, but my idea would make it so much better. Also, because the adapter that is used to plug into the iTouch is used for multiple purposes it would be nice if they put velcro on it so you could attach it to the device when not in use. The connector could get lost so I put a small piece of velcro on it and on the coil wire holder. Now when the connector is not being used it is stuck to the wire assembly so it can't get lost.
It's probably fine if you wear a belt (I don't) and can slip the holster through that, but the design of holster makes wearing this phone on your person awkward.
7556	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It ripped easily.
Once applied it will keep your screen from scratching or collecting dust or grim directly to surface. You can even use a screen cleaner made for flatscreens to clean the side facing you.
I actually liked the arm band itself.  It's comfortable and holds my 3GS in tightly without feeling like it could fling out of it like so many other arm bands I'd tried.  But the stitching is clearly weak and this thing won't last.
The thing I use this for the most, other than tracking contacts and my calendar, is checking Email.  I check five eMail addresses on a regular basis and this is quite flawless.  I can customize each account a certain way and I've never had problems picking up eMail... even with one of them being behind a firewall I have to VPN into first.  No problem!!
5420	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Very satisfied overall with this product.  It looks great and comes in a variety of colors!  Slides on with ease and doesn't dimenish the integrity of the phones design.  The only down fall of this product is that the cover makes it difficult to use in my holster due to a tight fit.  I can't speak for all holsters though and I don't use my holster extensively so I switch back and fourth to accommodate whatever the occasion.  Highly recommended!

recommend this product!
  I even found a much needed use for the IMP500, I sent a picture. I'll be telling my rc group about it!

Cell phone coverage at home is now a necessity for me, because I'm running my business out of my house. In fact, my office is in the basement, where the reception is the worst. So it was either find better reception or rent an office.
I did replacement on mine Swatch IRONY and still have power on and on, and on.
Pros:

  This would probably not work for a day of touring in Hawaii or a long cross country trip, but for around town and out clearing that vacant lot, it does the trick, hot or not.

I love it.
i have a treo 650 and that device only supports v1.1 of Bluetooth, and the manual states (nothing on the packaging!) that the headset requires version 2.0. (sniff)
9166	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	What can you say about the IMP500? Why did it take me SOOOOOOO long to not get one earlier? Where was my head at!!
1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.
163	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.




The instructions next suggest calling customer support.  I'll update this review if that proves to be helpful.
The the way its made didn't work well for me. There is so much velcro on the front its a bit crazy, no case needs that much. I wound up removing the velcro from the front because it made too much noise, and just wasn't doing anything. I left the small parts on the other side of the stitches which is plenty.
3645	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I read the past reviews before buying this and after using it now for >4 months it IS a great case. My phone looks sheik and cool as well as being protected. Easy to use the controls and touch pad with it on the phone. Good find...you won't be dissapointed if you buy it.
This is the Razr Killer!!
I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago.  I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?).
It comes with both wall charger and car charger, so I'll never have to carry this one in to the house to charge it.

Before even reading the instructions, I set up the unit to charge in
I am happy with my purchase, especially at the great price I got it for.
I was attending a conference in Austin,TX a few weeks ago, I have a HTC EVO and I went through 2 batteries while I was there and still my EVO was burning up the battery. So, before my phone died, I started to research online about a battery  supply solution for my horrible HTC EVO draining device, when I came across the New Trent IMP500. I read the many 5 star reviews on this device and decided I MUST HAVE IT. Let me tell you.....I have now thought to myself how the HECK did I live without it!!!
- do not have to recharge the device for days despite heavy use
BAM! The bars on my phone went from the normal 1 (or two if I'm lucky)  to the maximum! I now get a steady, strong signal. I walked around my office and the strength only started dropping off when I was about 15 feet from the transmitter -- impressive. Calls are clear and seem louder than before and I don't get the audio "cut-outs" that I used to.
couldn't find them anywhere but amazon.
6404	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this case based on other reviews that will now confirm that this case is a PERFECT FIT and CHEAP holder for my iphone 4. Don't be afraid to buy this case for the iphone 4 with the Mophie Air Juice Pack. It won't dissappoint. It may be a little big with the juice pack, so if you don't have that look at other options. But for $2.50!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????
416	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Had it for a while, a monthish, but it seems that the charge is getting shorter and shorter.  I've tried killing the battery and fully recharging, but it doesn't seem to help.  Overall a much longer charge than the original, so 4 stars.
7479	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The Nokia 5310, aka "The Music Xpress", is one nifty little phone! Sure, it's no iPhone, but if you want something that got just about as many bells and whistles for a little less money, you want this phone.

Hope this help!!



6054	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased two of these.  One for myself and one for a friend.  New Trent makes outstanding products and I highly recommend not only this charger, but any of the others that fit into your budget.

The iTorch is an incredibly useful tool for any road warrior. It lets you fully charge your phone and then some. I love the design and size of the device. It charges with the ubiquitous micro-USB cable, and it can charge anything via a USB Cable. I always keep it in my bag just in case. The only small issue I have is the amount of time it takes to fully charge. It take a few hours to get from zero to 100%. This is expected, but is still a significant amount of time. 4/5.
Form - The size of the phone is great, especially when compared to the LG VX7000 or the Treo.
9187	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I travel by air frequently and game with my phone so there's never enough battery to last through a trip...until now! I went internet surfing for an extra phone battery and found this on Amazon. This little unit (it's smaller than the phone) packs a ton of extra energy. It comes with all the hook-ups you could possibly want to charge it and then hook it up to your phone. The amount of charge in the unit is huge! so that you don't have to recharge it every time you use it. When I use it to charge/run my phone while I'm gaming, I hook it up and then just hold it in the same hand just tucked underneath my phone. It works very well.

For the other features (speakerphone, wireless headset) it's a unique and functional, albeit somewhat expensive, device. I have not tried Skype integration and I remain very disappointed about the failure to interoperate with the iPhone.
It requires different charging cables for different devices and comes with two. A little inconvenient but not the fault of New Trent, it is just the state of differing technologies in different devices.



813	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	These are great headphones.  I use them for podcasts primarily.  The quality is decent.  They are not great with music but I don't use them for that.  These have a great design allowing me to lean back and relax without bumping them out of place.


2778	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this battery several years ago for my RAZR V3, as the battery was about shot in it, and I shoulda just saved my money. This was not worth the time, effort or money. It wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour. Probably not a relevant review today, but still not worth your money

This dock allows me to plug in my iPhone when its in its protective case...something all the others will not allow.
By the way I can't figure the person that complained about fit, I am 6'5" and a large guy, the ear loop fits me great!
1528	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This was my first bluetooth headset and I have used for more than 8 months now. It is perfectly fit for me and I am satisfied with the quality of voice both ways.

1923	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The texture of this is very rubbery but feels nice to the touch. The texture helps you grip the device. Doesn't provide much protection but for around the house use, was more than adequate. Would buy again for a slim case the provides some protection.
7109	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This product is awful. It was ok when I installed it, but then it didn't even last long. Right after applying the screen protector, it immediately showed signs that the adhesive wasn't strong enough. The edges were lifted and it allowed dust to get inside the protector. It could've been great, but the adhesive was just useless. I guess that's why it was only 98 cents.

7873	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It worked only for two months then stopped working, well, it works on one side only, the other earphone get no sound.
off my wooden panel in my Chevy Impala... this is just WRONG!!!!!!!
9792	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works great

POTENTIAL WIRING PROBLEM.  In addition to the component picture plugs (3), there are also two (stereo) audio plugs.  You can plug these into your TV, and run a cable from your TV audio output to your amplifier like I did, or use the TV speakers.  The audio connectors are meant to be plugged into the TV near the component video inputs; they won't reach much past that.  If you want to connect directly to your amplifier, you will need a stereo extension cable (female on one end, male on the other) or a stereo female-female adapter and an extra cable.

2293	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I RETIRED MY BLACKBERRY TO TRY THIS 'COOLER' PHONE. WHAT A MISTAKE!!

HERE ARE THE PROS TO OWNING THIS PHONE: IT LOOKS COOL AND SMART.ONLOOKERS WILL MARVEL AT THE PULL OUT KEYBOARD FEATURE. HERE ARE THE NEGATIVES IN ORDER OF ITS MOST ANNOYING OFFENCES:  1)THIS PHONE IS NOT USER FRIENDLY! THE PRODUCT MANUAL DOES NOT EASE THE FRUSTRATION EITHER. PERHAPS EASIER FOR TECH GEEKS...
1410	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Very Bad
it'll probably work - did for me.
-Could I have a defective unit? Doubt it..... This was a refurbished unit off Amazon. Either way, if Clarion failed to repair a refurb , than this feddback and review is still fair.
The sound quality is not great.  I had 3 LG phones before this and they all sounded louder and clearer than this phone.
In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.
I think the Jabra is a fine option for people that just want to be able to answer calls though, and not miss one because your driving.

Update:  2.11.15
3482	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We some case for the money. Integrated kickstand works well. No complaints here at all. Very happy with this case
If add it thru calling their service representative, the representative will try to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY by ask you all unrelated information. Besides credit card and your cell phone ID, they ask:


7749	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what seller described product to be. Definately worth every cent.  I use it throughout the day, I drive for a living and need my hands free and this product is wonderful. I would Definately buy it again and have already recommended to family, friends and coworkers!
8360	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Started using them for my tiny USB3 drives. Very handy to have these tails! :)

6420	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased these screen protectors for all my cameras. Over the years, several have been sacrificed while preserving the screens of my cameras. While I am not hard on my cameras, primarily shooting sports, they do get banged around a bit, as well as being shoved into and pulled out of the bag. I keep a supply of these protectors on hand, just in case. It only takes a few minutes to install them, they are crystal clear and protect like a steel shield. When one does crack or break, they are easy to remove cleanly, with no gummy residue on the screens. I cannot say enough about how well these screen protectors work.
 My first step was to call "BLUEANT" customer support (North America) . After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was "How much did you pay for this product?"..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was " Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!"....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.

All in all, I haven't seen a phone out there without a touch screen which is better.  The ATT tilt is way bigger and heavier, and has no mechanical buttons for dialing.
All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while.
3775	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This product works as expected. It seems to be a quality product unlike my last socket. The only issue, which seems to be standard with all of these, is that the adhesive will eventually fail and you will then need to actually use screws to attach this to its mounting location.
  Speedtest: 205ms ping, .8 - 1.13 Mbps data transfer

4611	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love these.  Going to give them to my mother in law for Christmas.
And for the big test, I roam on a verizon partner in a rural county using a verizon iphone 6 Plus.  This does provide usually an additional bar but what it has eliminated is dropped calls.  There's spots in my county that would drop phone calls reliably, in fact, i'd have to tell my wife I'm going to drop you soon as I'd approach such a spot.  No more with this installed.  And that alone is worthwhile.
2910	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good headset.  It's not as easy to get on your ear as those with the swivel out ear piece, but it works just fine.

3.fantastic sound quality on both ends.

5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized

But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I'm not a lawyer, but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.
8182	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I saved over $15 and I't works better then one that came with my phone and the signal booster really works, this product is well worth the buy as well as the wait for shipping best of all it comes straight to your mail box!
3928	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I saw one of these in Canada at a Exhibition.  There they sold the unit without the water restricter in it.  Must be different laws for different countries.  Only think I had to do once this arrived was remove the water restricter for more water flow, very easy to do.
435	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I went to best buy and they wanted $15 for a new cable.  This purchase is totally worth it for anyone needing a replacement cable.

My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!


COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:
616	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Well, just as pictured, I received the entire world.  Needed it to do a project which worked out well.  The paper it's on is a good thickness.  Every country is included as far as I can tell...what else is there to say?  It's a map!!
6655	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	works okay but had to buy larger outside and better inside antennas to improve coverage around the house. would work well as a desktop unit for a small office

3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)
225	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	i love my case
  Although I did download Nokia PC suite, I never did figure out how to use that to just simply put ringtones in my phone. I ended up having to get a short-term data service, then that took care of the ringtones. I haven't tried it yet but I am sure transferring photos from the cell phone would work well with this. Anyway, the price was great.
It comes with a usb micro cord and a second adapter cord for charging a Samsung Galaxy tablet.


4925	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got this to use with my credit card wsiper as it doesn't fit in my large case and i needed an extension. am sure that it will work just fine.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and my phone just fits in the holder. This weBoost system does seem to boost my signal. There are areas that I typically drive through that have low signal. That is not an issue now. However, I really hate the fact that your phone must sit in a stationary holder attached to your dashboard. I have to use my speaker phone or a wireless head set which I don't like to do. I really wanted something that boosts my signal more outside of the car. I particularly have issues in certain areas at work. While I could probably install this weBoost at a stationary spot in work, I need my boost to be more mobile and work as I walk around the warehouse.
The cellphone holder uses a velcro-secured flap, and seems to have been designed for a large or medium flip phone.  My normal-sized Droid phone fits just fine, but it might not be compatible with some of the larger (wider or longer) smartphones like a Samsung or larger iPhone (though I haven't tried it).
All in all, the best sound quality of any phone I've yet had; a great form factor which is easy to hold and deal with, and easy to use synching with Outlook --- if you have just your own computer to deal with.  When dealing with Microsoft Exchange Server -- you're out of luck unless you have a great IT tech (as we do) who after an hour of fiddling, found a document by googling that gave a work-around so we could synch with our Outlook, Calendar, etc.  However, it will only synch with your 'personal' calendar and since we've got a company wide calendar and a personal, it would be helpful if one could synch with two calendars as some phone/pda's can currently do.
9738	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Lasts 3-6 weeks so you better buy a lot of it.
9640	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Work exactly as they should. No duds. I buy them in bulk this way from Amazon because you can not beat the price. I'm not about to spend $5 for 2 batteries down at the local big box store.

3895	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This us without a doubt the best shower head I have ever owned.  I have tried many different kinds and none of them compare to this one.  I am ordering another to replace the shower head in my guest bathroom.
This thing's strength is no doubt that it has so many connectivity features. The options are Wifi, Bluetooth and IR. I have not used IR, just started experimenting with Bluetooth, and already mastered Wifi. I did not get a data plan for this phone, and it looks like I will not need one. The reason is that I can connect to both my company's exchange server and my personal POP3 email accounts whenever there is Wifi available. ActiveSync configured the Outlook client to connect to the Exchange Server's Web Services interface - which means that I did not have to solve the VPN client problem to connect to Exchange directly (the SDA supports only MS VPN - PPTP or IPSec - natively, but my company uses Cisco and Citrix). This really impressed my CIO. He did not know that he is already supporting Smartphone 2005 clients.

8873	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It works great & it charges my iPhone 5 fairly quickly.  It's small enough to fit in a pocket but still has enough power to charge a dead phone.
7279	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The item came in the proper sequence of properly packaged. It works as advertised to utilized by the manufacturers specification. I am currently using the product and I thank you for providing a great product I am willing to purchase from you in the future

My real issue with the item is simply the difficulty of installation. Many people will need assistance from someone to place it properly on the roof and install it neatly. In addition, the cords are not pretty either. You can do the best you can, but in the end a cord is a cord and the stick out if not installed properly.

I just received it so a 4 star rating for now till I have had it for a week or so but for 1.50 there is no way you can go wrong. From past expericence with Boxwave I can tell you I will be updating to a 5 star rating. The  grip is perfect,the fitting is perfect, the holes for all the external plugs and features are alighned perfect and 1.50 cost, well you don't need to figure that one out. Already purchased a back up one.

Surprisingly decent stereo sound (what do you expect for $4, Bose?), and great call quality.

510	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this phone a few days ago, and it is awesome!
Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&T could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&T to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.

Pros:

8481	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	A kayaker's view on this.  Easy to use radio.  Weather function is nice.  This radio is for on the water use only.  Just like all other VHF marine radios.  Do not use this device to communicate while on land.  Also read manual to better understand the regulations.  Comes packaged in a blister pack.  Sharp object needed to open.  Battery life is great.  Waterproof tested it myself in vat of water.  Use this radio for kayaking or as a back up to your marine radio on a bigger boat.  As with all electronics, keep away from your navigational compass.
7216	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	not working
7731	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this is a great multi bluetooth headset use it with my htc xv6800 and zumo 550 its all great

1918	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The Motorola H300 is the ultimate handsfree headset for those that want a headset that they will be able to use forever.  Why do I say this?  Because, this does not have a non-removable rechargeable battery like most handsfree headsets.  Instead, it can be operated with a single AAA battery.  I just got it, so I cannot verify the performance of the battery, but knowing that I won't have to throw this away in a couple of years is worth it.  The features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, and you can turn off the blinking blue light (if you're so inclined).  Even though it takes a AAA battery, it's about the same size as a comparable rechargeable headset.  It may be 2 mm thicker, but the same length as most.  It works great and is a no nonsense kind of headset.  If you want a basic headset that does about the same as those expensive ones, and you want the security of just changing a battery, this is the headset for you.  If I have any problems with the duration of the battery or with its operation, I will update this review accordingly (check the date of review to gauge how long since purchase... if no update, then no problem).
6963	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	VERY GOOD.
As far as product improvements there is nothing really major but would love to see the following.

1938	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	When switching to Verizon from another wireless carrier, I initially bought 6 of the VX5200 for my on-call staff.  Within 24 hours, all of them had come to me and complained about their phones.
9360	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros: Size, color, US 3G, excellent reception, crystal clear calls, Nokia maps, Google maps (downloadable), bright large screen, large easy to use keypad, 5mp camera is excellent.
6332	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	fair product for price point
The single button control for all functions of the battery is the pitfall of the product: the one button controls turning the battery on and off, turning the flashlight on and off, and turning the laser pointer on and off (depending on how long you press the button). The status LED lights are difficult to understand (they move when charging, but you don't know which combination of LEDs indicate it is fully charged, charging, or discharging).


The device has a standard 1A output. It can charge as fast, or faster than the standard charger that comes with your phone. Although it does not come with a charger, this should not be a problem. You can use the charger that comes with your mobile devices to charge it.
Definitely worth it! I wish they had more designs though and not just solid colors :)
The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore. I give it 2-stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software/interface.
8351	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love these for small electronics
4324	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is good product very good noise cancelling and sound quality is very good. However to upgrade the firmware on this product it is very difficult and not for the novice computer user.  I can wear this headset for the entire day usually 8 plus hours and I hardly even know it's there. I would highly recommend this product for anybody looking for a bluetooth headset.

2732	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros  fits tighly,  provides great protection from dropping the phone.  also covers the power button firmly, which is great because without a case my phone would turn itself on while in my pocket at times.  this seems like a well made case, i would not be surporised if the manufacturer sold this same case under another name at a much higher price

Cons:
5492	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Made well for a noc-off, but wouldn't fit my daughters arm. It wounldn't adjust that small. I had to take it to a taylor. Works great now, but cost me $8.00 for the repair.

1. MP3 players works great with 192kbps bit rate. Also you need miniSD card to get going for songs. Get the card reader to save MP3 on miniSD for faster rate.
6461	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This phone was introduced in US in March 2008. I am using it with AT&T.
5734	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Product matches description perfectly. Works with a Samsung T349 no problems. Works for charging and file transfers to and from a PC.
Other concerns and notes:

5. I work from home sometimes and use the speakerphone for conference calls. It works great. I can be typing on my computer and talking to somebody as if they were right there. The noise and echo cancellation makes this a better alternative to using a regular home phone speakerphone or cell phone speakerphone.

It's controls are very easy to use and it looks great, I live in a signal challenged area, but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned. The photo quality isn't anything to write home about, though the zoom feature is pretty effective.  Generally speaking I like my cell phones to have data card capacity, particularly for photo storage, but T-Mobile has a nifty Album feature which lets you store your pics online. I was also impressed by this little phone's sound.
 - no airplane mode
253	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great item for a really low cost now thats a great buy .
6893	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Delivered as promised. Great deal. Now, if I could only find my darn watch to put one in! Life would be awesome...
The removal of the noise-cancellation circuitry means a louder background sound when you're driving in the car than with the BT250.  However, wind noise is not significantly impacted, as the mic is not susceptible to a great deal of wind noise.
8851	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	If you're looking for a charger that can charge up your smart phone at least twice if not three times before needing to be recharged, this is for you. It's small and easy to travel with, charges up quickly after use, and charges your devices in no time. It won't recharge an iPad fully but it'll give you at least 50% extra run time. I love the size for dropping it in a bag when I'm on the go.
4719	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Really a rugged case.  I am sure you could not run over it with a truck and have the BB come out in one piece, but for more casual protection this case should do the trick.  I was a bit concerned before I received it about how the keyboard would feel but this is not at all a problem and might even be better then the feel of the uncovered keyboard.  Ringer volume is a bit lower but again not enough to be problem.  Goes together easy and actually is easy to take apart if you need to pull your battery or replace the SD card.  Does make the unit larger but the rubber outer shell makes it feel more secure.
4895	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I debated over this or the jawbone and pretty happy I bought this one. Its small but the volume is great and it seems to block out ambient noise fairly well. Good purchase, not too much to complain about here


- Pretty good instructions.
Also cool is the way the buds attach magnetically to the ends of the necklace arms when you take them off.  Neat!
6451	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	With $338, I have owned a 5 mega pixel camera phone which is so great. Everything works perfectly. The phone is very easy to use. It's system is pretty much the same like my old Nokia 3230. The key pad is small but I am not a text-lover so to me, it's not a big issue. If you are looking for an all in one phone, N82 from Amazon is really a bargain. Good luck
I went on a quest to find protection.  I first bought a silicone case from Verizon.  The thin silicone sleeve is sort of a joke.  I don't know what it's supposed to really protect it from.  The only thing it was good for was scratches.  If I wanted to keep my phone pretty, this was the ticket.
5466	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought more of these for keychain's I plan to make later on. Long shipping but worth it for the cheaper price!
PACK of ten for $nothing in my opinion!!!

So the case was inexpensive and secure but added bonus, it looks very classy.  Black, sturdy looking leather outside, soft, tan kid glove type leather inside.  It goes well with a suit.  I've now had two of them.
9894	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Really slick design for how to apply without getting your fingerprints on it, neat-o. My first one, eh, left just a couple of bubbles due more to user error than anything I think, for when I applied the second one, I had the 'trick' down and boy, it looked like the glass itself.  Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again, especially at this price.
6418	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Arrived quickly, it fits and was very reasonably priced. I have only had it for about 6 weeks so I cannot speak to its durability.
5056	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The product description is inaccurate.  I selected it because the original iPhone has a recessed headphone jack, unlike later models.  This causes a problem for third-party headphone plugs, which are too wide for the narrow recessed area which leads to the jack.
Pro's: Great size/ form factor. Weight is a tad heavy, but makes the unit "feel" like quality. The flashlight is good, considering its a secondary feature. The laser pointer is a nice touch. I could take this into a business meeting and no one would know its a backup battery. I tested its charging speed on my IPhone 4S and it took 1hr 30min to charge from 35% to 100%, worthy of note, it only took 1hr to get from 35% to 90%. Have not been able to test how many charges the unit will provide before it needs charging, or if the speed of charge changes with less power in the pack. The usb connectors are quality with no slip whatsoever.
2138	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This was an impulse buy.  I kind of needed a really small watertight case that was smaller than what Pelican could offer.  But when it came it was actually too small for anything I could need it for.  I could fit my Galaxy Note 2 in it by my life isn't so exciting that I need to put my phone in a watertight case.  But found an awesome use for it when I bought an external WD hard drive.  It fit snugly into the top portion of the case. The cable fit in the bottom portion.  So whenever I need it I just open it up and plug plug the usb into my computer.  It's perfect and because it's snug the hard drive doesn't move at all.
5590	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The charger's mini-usb connector is a bit different in size than usual, so it goes in to the port, but barely stays there and it's enough to nudge the phone and the cord falls out. Needless to say, I would not buy this one again.
The pearl is especially fast, it's got an intel 312mhz processor, much faster than the tmobile dash and some of the other phones on the market. The keyboard takes getting used to, but it works quite well. It's not for typing long emails, but I think no matter what you need a computer for long documents or emails.
6275	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this product from New Trent and found it to be okay. Not great, but okay for the price so I did not complain. Weeks later, a representative from the company sent me an e-mail saying they would like to thank me for my business by sending me my choice of a free battery pack phone charger. Of course, I accepted. The representative then e-mailed me again requesting that I post a positive review on Amazon in exchange for the free charger. I replied that I would not wholeheartedly support a product if I didn't feel that way and that bribing someone for a favorable review made me question the ethics and products of the company. Furthermore, there was absolutely no mention of any review in the original e-mail proposing the free "thank-you" charger. New Trent's representative quickly backtracked and offered to send me the free charger if I did not mention this exchange to anyone. After all the e-mails back and forth, I ultimately received a charger that does not even work, aside from my original purchase which was mediocre. Since the charger was a "free gift," I didn't expect much out of it. However, New Trent's request for a positive review on Amazon has now caused me to question how many of these reviews are actually real. Based on this and my experience with their mediocre products, I would think twice about dealing with this company in the future.
Was better than Jabra, but turning it on and off was a pain.  You have to push and hold the button, every time you need to turn it on or off.  This sounds petty, but gets annoying quickly and I'll end up leaving it on, thus draining the battery quickly.  Also bigger in size compared to the Motorola ones (see below)
4592	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	During the few days I tried this before returning it, I experienced very mixed results. I have compared it along side the Jawbone, nX6000, and my trusty old Plantronics Voyager 510.
7018	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery works very well. I have not had any problem since I received it.


Overall I am quite happy with the product.

- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird, proprietary plug.
Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned:

The only problem I currently have with The Trent is  that I somehow "misplaced it ~1-2 weeks ago" and though I've searched & searched for it, so far it has all been to no avail. Guess I'll be begging for one on Father's Day.



9215	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I think this is the easiest ear piece and most comfortable to use. Clear reception. I've tried so many that have to fit in your ear and they just don't feel right. This one sits on top of your ear and you can hear everything. People can hear me clearly too.

1250	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is the second HS850 Motorola I have purchased, and they both work great. (The first one developed a crack in the ear loop after three years, but it's still working and I use it as a backup.) These used to sell for $99.00, so at this price it's quite a bargain now. (I bought the "bulk package"... it's exactly the same as the first one I bought three years ago!) I like the fact that it's easy to turn on and off by folding the boom. I keep it in the car for hands-free driving. The battery lasts and lasts... and it's easy to charge. You can get a car-charger, too! I like the fact that Amazon guarantees a genuine Motorola product if you buy direct from them, and it was even more of a bargain with no tax and free shipping!
Excellent customer support, fast replies, and their contact info, including phone, email, and website address, is clearly written in their manual.

Matched with some good quality RCA Audio cables and man I can not believe the sound!! I swear my albums sound better than there cd counterparts. Anyways the Preamp works perfectly, seems very well built and at a very good price. I am very happy with my purchase and can highly recommend it. I actually needed to contact them due to a sound issue with my left channel.  He had me shut off all the DSP additives on my Harman Kardon receiver and BAM!!! perfection!!! The Doors Alive She Cried never sounded so good!!!!!  Make sure to set your receiver to 2 Channel stereo all DSP off.

2819	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really liked the look of this case.  The back is a kind of frosted see-through plastic that allows the BlackBerry logo to show through as seen in the product picture.  It fits the Z10 very well.  All of the ports are easily accessible with the case on the phone.  All cutouts and openings line up with the ports on the phone properly.  It was easy to get on and not too hard to get off when I needed to get to the phone and remove the back cover.  Overall this is a very good case.  It's simple and attractive.  I recommend it.

4615	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Belt clip broke too fast

(second review)
I liked this item so much, I purchased 3 of them. Of the 3, 2 have gone bad with 1 having distorted sound and the other a dead microphone).
8534	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love all of the iGO products!  They are more sturdy than others out there and they do hold up.  In fact, I haven't had one fail yet.  I love the ability to interchange tips.  Wonderful idea!  I would definitely recommend.

I should also note, my friends used this charger on their iPods and it worked on an iPod Classic (video), and iPod touch 1st generation and iPod touch 2nd generation with no problems.
7409	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I needed a few small cases to store various items - radios, batteries, and such. I found both these and the OtterBox cases. While Pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases, and while I'm definitely going to go with the Pelican cases for my medium or large case needs, I am not a fan of these micro cases.
Overall, this device was just all around disappointment for me. If it had design flaws, but worked exceptionally well, I could maybe overlook them. If it was designed well, but just didn't work really well in my area, maybe it's for someone else. I hate giving extremely negative reviews, but I really can't even come up with a solid reason this should deserve two stars.
I really like the firmness of the materials and how solid it feels.
4386	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This case is so great I bought another one.  The main reason I bought this case is the two ways to attach to a belt.  I never trusted just the clip-on style and wanted belt loops.  This fit the bill on that.  What I also can do is slip the end of my headset thru the hole between the flap and the main body and then pull until the earpieces are against the body, and then wrap the cord around the bottom where they join together and snap it closed.  I also have a folded up micro fiber cleaning cloth, cash, and a fold up stand slipped into the card slot.  That main body of the case holds my iPhone (which has an added snap-on case) securely, neither too tight nor too loose.  I highly recommend this product, and in fact ordered a second.  Such quality was very unexpected with such a low price.





The stereo store is perplexed too - so it's time to give up on Parrot and seek out another brand.  Oh yeah, we also replaced the microphone in thinking it was defective - nada, no better.
I bought this battery in expectance that maybe it would be better. I was totally wrong. Thankfully I bought a new phone.
3568	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	You can pick up a used Nuvi 200 for less than it costs for a map update. Mine has a tired battery but anything you want or need can  be had from from any GPS store. I've tried mine around town and use it primarily for the speedometer and trip functions. (motorcycle speedos tend to read a few mph higher than true)  The software updates for free, automatically (well almost) w/Garmin Express. It's a great tool with old maps & I'm keeping the $50 or $100 update price in my pocket.
I hesitated to write about this until now, because every time I talked up the greatness of a product, it literally died the next day or week.  So, now, since I have had this for almost four months, I can safely say THIS THING ROCKS!
4971	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I received the item pictured but it doesn't work at all! No sound comes through it at all, even if you use the Apple headphones with it!  Don't bother wasting your money on it.
Very compact and lightweight. Very small footprint. Looks very cool, and complements the looks of the iWatch.
3404	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Once I figured out that Nitendo does not put out a true 16:9 picture it worked great.  You have to set your TV to stretch the picture to 16:9 and the picture looks perfect.


1518	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I gave one of these away 2 years ago, when it failed to stay paired with my BB Pearl.  Decided to give it another try with my MotoQGlobal (ATT), and am thoroughly satisfied.  Reception is great, and there is an audible signal for every function, including receipt of e-mail or text messages.  Great purchase at just over $40!!

Factoring in the price and the performance of this headset, I highly recommend you buy this Bluetooth headset if you're in the market.
I still couldn't bring myself to get her a cell phone, but what do I do?  I remembered seeing a little girl years ago with something that looked like a phone, but not quite - she said it was a "fly."  Well, that's the part I remembered.  Thank goodness for Google; enter the Firefly!!!  I was elated for "Santa" to get this for my princess, and so was she until we realized no one knew what it was or how to get it activated. Emailed the company, it responded with "take it to T-mobile or Verizon."  Both companies looked at me like I had five heads citing there was nothing special, it's a phone and the lowest plans were $35/mth. Even my Sprint offered some crazy high plan.  Negative!  I just wanted something for emergencies*.
From what i know, phone numbers have to be saved to the sim since this phone doesn't have any memory. only one number can be saved per name. it started on vibrate but after toying with it, i managed to change the ringtone.

7146	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely perfect for my needs, charges and Hotsyncs, what more could you ask for? The lack of an actual Hotsync button is a non issue for me, if you want a physical button, sorry it doesn't have it, but really you don't need it.

5) Range - doesn't matter what side of my body this unit is on, it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800. I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro. It gives you just enough freedom to roam. You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.
I have had both the Roadster 2 as well as the Jabra Freeway.  The Roadster 2 is mediocre at best and I would not recommend that unit at all.  It's a single speaker and caller on other end has a very  hard time hearing you if there is any background noise at all.  Might be great in a new Rolls Royce but the average car at highways speed makes it a poor device.
3) Easy to assemble when instructions are followed
5685	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great on my Blackberry, keeps the phone at a viewable angle while charging.  No complaints very happy.
There were also no belt loops as depicted in the photo, just the belt clip and some weird plastic snap thing that wouldn't really prevent the phone from slipping off the belt clip.
2972	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	All the reviews I've read were right!  Very small, volume is loud and I love the color :).  It was here quickly and in perfect condition. It doesn't fit my ear so I've ordered the Jabra ear gels.  Prayerfully that will do the trick.  I have very small ears.  I don't want to wear an ear hook because I wear reading glasses.  Will update when I receive the Jabra ear gels.
7722	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	the wood on the back is nice and smooth like a basketball court or a bowling lane.  fits the iphone 5 fine but does not offer any screen protection the sides are lower so make sure you use a good screen protector.
In short, it doesn't get much better when it comes to bluetooth headsets and certainly not at the price Amazon is selling it for.
One last comment about headsets in general, they don't have the greatest life span.
b) I use this while walking (not running, just walking). The music skips for every step I take
Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are "OK" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.
Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it.  They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear.
8939	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Another solid product from NewTrent - I currently have the IMP1000 for comparison, even though the battery is not as large, I do enjoy the size and portability of the iTorch.  Right off the bat I am impressed, even the packaging looks solid.  Modern style with a fold out flap to show the true size of the product.  Even though I think most of their products are sold online, they don't skimp on the packaging; this is definitely ready to display in any retail store.

- LED and Laser Pointer is a nice touch
9546	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We spend 2 weeks in the UP of Michigan at a small home on a Lake outside of Michigan.  Typically we have no cell phone signal or at very sporadic signal.  Typically to get a signal we have to drive 20 minutes into town.  With the signal booster I always had at least one or two bars of signal.  I was able to make and receive phone calls which i had never been able to do before.
7267	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Nt compatible with my service
conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper)
9170	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I use this for my HTC Incredible 2, my iPods, my bluetooth headset, my Nooks, my Blackberry and anything else that needs a boost now and then.  I stream music while I'm at the gym and this will charge the phone at the same time the streaming happens.

I paid extra for expedited shipping - ordered on Tuesday and got it on Thursday.
7249	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great!
3. Multipoint Technology.  This technology rocks.  I have both my work (Blackberry) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.

[...]
3254	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Cheep, thin phone will fall out.  Not satified. Cool idea but needs improvement for more secure holding. You have to be really careful not to turn it upsidedown
1471	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.
Battery on/off: 3 second hold of the power button(letting go of power button at 3 second will turn off battery)
I downloaded the Outlook software that sync's my phone to my Outlook contacts. Worked great after I actually read the DIRECTIONS! LOL

1042	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great device


The edges are slightly raised as well (I think that's for when you place your phone upside down the screen doesn't touch the surface). Overall, a great case and excellent price.
The bluetooth provides rock-solid connectivity. I've never had problems with broken or sporadic connection problems.
526	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	You think that a little piece of shiny plastic will increase your cell phone signal? Well, how about you glue a mineral rock onto the back of your phone? Or maybe wrap it in foil? Seriously, you think that if a 1c solution to the cell signal problem was available, wouldn't your cell carrier give it to you for free? As much as you want it to work, I have bad news for you: it won't. If you have signal issues you need to spend real money, $$$, for a reputable booster like Wilson or zBoost or Uniden (all available at Amazon). So don't get it, because if you do, you will feel really stupid that you fell for it.
At home in Alaska, the 3 1/2 hour trip from my home to Anchorage normally has a number of holes in service where my phone is not operational. While using this booster, there is only one short space where I have no signal at all, and that is at the bottom of a canyon and is to be expected. Having this booster makes me much safer when traveling alone, and much more productive when riding as a passenger.

Plugged into USB charger with a cable to charge the IMP52D:

I use it for a Sandisk Cruzer fit, and that thing is so incredibly tiny, there's absolutely no way to get it out of the recessed opening in the tv without a leash.
PS. before making this purchase i contacted ross cellular to confirm that its new and they lied about it!
- charges an iPhone 4S more than twice before needing to be recharged
-CANNOT use mp3s as phone tones (message alert, etc.)  Must use mmf tones, instead.
5739	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I don't know about you, but I sure do hate seeing dust and smug marks on my touch screen as well as my internal screen on my LG Voyager. So naturally, I looked and bought these screen protectors. And I must say these fit perfectly on the LG Voyager!
8121	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The back panel, blocker and bottom part are separated when I got it. We tried to put it on, but it still cannot stand well.
Positives

UPDATE 1/8/2014: After 2 years, the product still works GREAT! It has not yet failed on me and still is one of the few items I take with me wherever I go.
8274	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the safest case I have seen and tested. You can drop your phone without fear. Excellent protection, I just wish it was little thiner and cheaper....but I love it, a very good decision to buy, very happy user....I work outside and its perfect for rough environment.
Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.
7666	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I think it's a great phone, but spanish speaking users will suffer big time.. there's no spanish language in the phone menu...
Others complained that the unit wouldn't charge up fully.  I find that it will charge fine if you fully cycle it.  I don't recharge it when it's only partly discharged.  It has 4 status lights and I wait until only one light is showing to recharge it.  The unit will turn itself off after 30 seconds of no load, or you can turn it off manually after checking the status.  I have not tried to both charge it and use it at the same time, which some dongle-type external batteries encourage you to do, but it would be an awkward mess to have both cords attached.  This is definitely for your pocket, not for holding or attaching to your phone.
It did not work with my 2.5 headphones being used in Nokia phones. Seller sent me a replacement, but even that doesnt work.
6335	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is durable and made of good material with Velcro seal.  Its a good buy for the price. I took the metal clip out and use it for my mothers cell phone. There is enough room for the phone , contact list and maybe your car keys.

3272	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Felt cheaply made. bought a different one to replace it. 2 stars because the kickstand was functional. There are better cases for the money or a little bit more
The headset has the feature to operate with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously and the smart technology feature connects you to the proper device with a touch of a button.  The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage.  The head set will operate up to 33 feet from your Bluetooth device so if your phone is in your briefcase or in the back seat of the car you can still take calls.
2) Plays MP3's and AAC's, making it a decent iPod substitute for short trips
6960	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I was really excited to get this, but extremely disappointed upon receiving it. The part that holds the iPhone is great, but the suction cup and "arm" are terrible to deal with. The way it's designed, the arm doesn't tilt enough to make the iPhone straight up and down. There's a very small amount that you can adjust the angle of the arm, then you have to tighten four total rings to stick it in place. Then it's still not straight, even with the extra extension arm which looks weird and ugly, and now you have a long bulky ugly arm coming from your windshield. Why couldn't they just take a note from GPS mounts?
5918	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Quick shipping great product!

9451	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	works great
Updated - 8/4/2009: Another 9 months goes by and another clip has broken off at the swivel point.  It's pretty disappointing because other than this one weakness I'd have to say it's the best case I've ever had.  Well it's time to buy another one.
6996	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	While they were easy to apply, as they had a tag attached to the front to allow for proper placement and even removal to adjust replacement.  Said tag left a sticky residue behind, which I had to carefully remove w/ goo-gone.  For the price, I can't complain too much.  I gave it two stars because I was able to reposition it twice, otherwise, it would have gotten one star.
306	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Received lightening fast, and finally, finally, finally I can make it through a whole day without charging.  The back feels great in my hand - I previously had a rather bulky cover, so the PowerBear back is not that much more.  To me, definitely worth the trade-off of losing waterproofing/resistance for a reduction in battery anxiety.  Loving it, and highly recommended.
Highly recommend this!!!!  I'm not sure how I ever lived without it.
2039	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I originally bought this for my wife. She complained about having a wire connected to her phone when she drove. Well apparently she just didn't like anything on her ear, so now I am using it. The sound quality is great, and the volume is loud enough. If it is windy outside, some people have said that it is difficult to hear me, but that is to be expected.
269	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great Product and fit perfectly for my phone!  WoW.......does it ever increase the overall mah for you phone and I no longer have the need to find a charging option about mid day!  Great Product and no issues that I've been aware of as of yet!
This shows that the company is actively engaging their products and they can still maintain terrific customer service!!! wow! I am very impressed with the iTorch and with New Trent!
A few nits.  The charger hookup unit is just plain wierd, and is counterintuitive to hook up.  Why do engineers feel compelled to make thousands of different charging standards for similar devices?  Also, while talking, you have to be careful if you adjust the unit on your ear--it is easy to accidentally hang up on someone.
Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).
3768	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I wired this in a ground up restoration to move these charging ports to a behind the seat area in a pick up. Plenty of cord for the installation and easy to hook up, you can mount this directly or use 3M to attach it to the surface.
5460	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Started using them for my tiny USB3 drives. Very handy to have these tails! :)

4376	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great price for these items and they look good; just like the picture.  They are leather and should hold up well with every day use.  Thanks.

I was in Costco in December 2007 and I saw a Jabra SP505 on sale for $64.00. I had never seen this model before so I whipped out my iPhone, did some quick research and bought the unit. I got back to my car, plugged in the provided charger and quickly started making calls to multiple friends and family. Everyone I spoke with said the sound quality was excellent on their end. From my end, the SP5050 is far and away, hands down the BEST bluetooth speakerphone I've ever used. It's LOUD and it sounds great.
In use it worked pretty well, though a couple of minor issues.
9209	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have tried other bluetooth devices and always had ear pain resulting in little use. This device, the Motorola H710 Bluetooth Mono headset,is comfortable,no ear bud to cause canal pain, and very good audio. For those reasons, I use the product most of the time. I highly recommend this for all that have problems with the ear insertion.
My first impressions were mostly positive, the design is attractive and very dimunitive.  On the ear it felt pretty comfortable and non-intrusive.  To me the buttons, although small were easy to operate and had a good click to them.  The glow light that tells you charge and status was a big plus.
2.  Yes it works. I thought it was a gimmick. But alas, it works, and works darn well. Does exactly what I need it to do. I have 1-2 bars of service where I am now, and I have absolute zero without the product.


9710	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great value
We changed and put the booster on my phone and I had 3 bars, he had 2.
9618	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Simply put, the SignalBoost DT does what it says.
4) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around. I've tried expensive, I've tried cheap, I've tried middle of the road. So far, the WEP200 beats em all, even when not factoring in the cost.

First, I have used the previous version of this booster with my Galaxy SIII.  It worked like a charm.  Now, I needed a larger unit to accommodate my larger NOTE4 phone.  This unit fit the phone, without the case, and ultra snug with the my ottercase.
Worse reception than previously owned phones
Very tempted to get another when I upgrade to the iPhone 5.
The the way its made didn't work well for me. There is so much velcro on the front its a bit crazy, no case needs that much. I wound up removing the velcro from the front because it made too much noise, and just wasn't doing anything. I left the small parts on the other side of the stitches which is plenty.
3294	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a replacement for my original charger. Well made.
Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get.
5555	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this radio is awesome- and after 8 weeks i still haven't had the need to recharge the batteries- comes with all you need
A week later two new headsets arrived. One would not connect to any phone. Second had the same cracking noise. We tried to call Aliph, the manufacturer (no toll free number available for support) for 4 days, left numerous messages - no one ever returned not one call. Sent them numerous email messages - nothing back.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to listen to their music without having to be attached to your music.
Now for the important part:  how it works.  The Jawbone was simple to pair with my cell phone (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HP-iPaq-6945-Unlocked-Cell-Phone-with-Wi-fi-GPS-MP3-Video-Player-SD-U-S-Version-with-Warranty-Silver/dp/B000ILDSLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)</a>), as most Bluetooth headsets are.  More importantly, I've paired it once and it has maintained that pairing without issue ever since, unlike the previous headset I owned which lost its pairing at least once a week, usually while mid-conversation.  This is annoying, certainly, but for a user that won't use their cell phone while driving without a hands-free device, this is very unsettling.  If I wanted/needed to continue a call while on the road, I disconnected the call, pulled over to re-pair the two devices, and then started my call and my trip again.  This is a major issue for me, so I am extremely appreciative of Jawbone's reliability.
6200	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the iTorch a few days ago and I have already had to use it.  I love the fact that it is so small and fits in my purse easily.  I like that it uses a USB connection; it makes it easy to charge and so much more versatile.  It charged up fully in about 3 hours after I received it.  It also comes equipped with a laser light and an LED light that are nice add ons.  It comes with a nice little pouch to keep it in so that it doesn't get all scratched up.  I plan on keeping this with me at all times.
===================
1969	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really like this item. It has a good looking. And also it has a pretty good size. I really like this item.
907	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I really wanted to like these.... my only drawback in ordering them at first was that they don't vibrate for incoming calls like the LG tones, but I decided I could live with that to have a lighter, more comfortable stereo bluetooth.
3219	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This item is very nice and inexpensive. Just as nice as the picture. I will order more of these in the future.

All in all, buying the iTorch will be the best move you can make if you are looking for a portable external power source for multiple devices!
2537	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	You can never go wrong with small rubberized cases for phones... Perfect fit every time, every phone! Of you feel like going to the store and pay $35 for the SAME THING, eat you wallet out. If you want to pay a fraction of the price, go no further!! Recommended!!!!!
1218	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This was a very smart purchase. I ordered this bluetooth for use with my treo 755p and it took seconds to pair it and begin using it. I love all of the features that are enabled in this piece of equipment and the sound quality is great for both parties on the call. I gave it 4 stars only because the part behind the ear is kind of thick making my ears stick out a bit (I wear a very short hairstyle so it's very noticable)and it pushes the metal hook that I wear in my ears out. Other than these minor issues, I would definitely recommend.
Id suggest ordering from MEDIA-MART, here's their store front: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main?ie=UTF8&seller=A28LEC9BBHMQ7G
8805	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very good device. It charges my galaxy S4 quite fast even with a low battery, very handy when you're traveling. With pretty cool features like a lazer pointer and a light it can come in handy.

8863	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	As a college kid I am constantly on the go and my iPhone's battery takes a beating. For christmas I received this portable battery and it has already saved me on numerous occasions. It is great how small it is as I can put it in my pocket or can quickly charge my phone up in one of my backpack pockets. It is really quick and am amazed at how I can charge my phone up twice on it. It does take a long to charge the battery pack but what I recommend is to charge it overnight along side your phone. I charge it on a dual usb hub with my iPhone so when I leave in the morning I can grab both without forgetting one or the other. It is a great product that I highly recommend and many people have been impressed with its abilities. Looking forward to more from this company!





light weight
- You just can't beat this price.
1631	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works well and sits on my ear well. All ears are different but this headset rests mostly on the back of my ear and I don't feel the weight of it pulling down on my lobe which is why I bought it.

7. Stable in the ear.  It doesn't feel as if it will fall out.
6559	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I had the previous version made by Wilson for 4G Verizon. That one works well indoors. Not the best boosting, but enough to hold a 3G or 4G a a bar or so.  So I had high expectations for this one which was twice the cost of the previous version when I bought that one.  But this one did little, to no, to even slightly worse signal "boosting".  Sadly.  If it had increased signal strength by a few bars I would have given it 5 stars. But it basically showed no improvement from the previous booster.
Installation of the case is real simple.  The first layer is a clear plastic overlay that covers the front, top, and back of the phone.  Then the hard inner shell snaps together, and finally the rubber top layer goes over all of that.  The only two gripes I had with this case... the clear plastic overlay needed a thorough cleaning every month or two, and the air bubbles were hard to remove from the screen (even with the application card).  Also the clear plastic piece covered the camera lens, so all my pictures would have a haze to them.  I ended up cutting out the part over the camera, and that fixed it right up.  Overall, this is a very rugged case, and really protected my phone to the max.  I highly recommend this to anyone that's looking for supreme phone protection!

9223	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a gift.

(There are 4 earloops they provide, 2 sizes "standard" & "long" for left & right side)
I was just looking around when I stumbled across this fine little bit of plastic and metal.
3) Near the end of its charge audio quality suffers greatly - very static-y and cuts in and out.
7580	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love it. Easy to hook on the belt and take out the phone when someone calls. So far it's comfortable
2. Obviously from the above, you might have guessed by now - you cannot keep any thick accessory parts inside this case once the scanner is in. Ofcourse there is a slight gap  in which you can place small flat things like memory card, pen or probably some small memory card pouch as well.  A small fabric cushioning lid separates scanner from rest of the stuff.

Getting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.

Pros
Overall, the Eachine X7 10000mAh Power Bank worked really well. It is small for its capacity and has a single USB port for charging phones or tablets.  The overall look is nice with its aluminum casing. I tested it with my iPhone 6 and iPad Mini and both charged just fine. It added 10% charge in the first 10 minutes of charging and another 10% in the second 10 minutes to my iPhone 6, which is a really good result for iPhone 6 charging speeds. It also has 4 LEDs that show the remaining capacity and charging status.  If you are in the market for a larger capacity power bank for charging your phone or tablet, this one is worth a look.
7485	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I didn't really expect too much from this case, and my expectations were fully met. If it fit a little tighter on the phone, I think it would work a tad better. There is no way you can access the charging port or SD card with this case on. It's just not well made.

 * blue light 1 lights and stays on -
5755	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Phone case seems durable, looks great, What it shows is what you get. No screen cover so don't expect one!! (I didn't but I can see who might). I got it because 4 other family members have the same phone so I know its mine...also I want this one to last (Unlike my other enV touch).
1198	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this thinking it would be perfect for what I wanted.
3327	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great product, fast shipping, thanks!
4889	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Want "wear all day" comfort, good sound, out and inbound, and easy operation?  This is it.  I've tried them all including a new "super headset" that is supposed to eliminate all background noise.  I felt like I had a foot in my ear and the performance, in and outbound, was terrible.  The H710 works great.  My only complaint is a non-replaceable Nimh battery good for only 400 charges.

8. Internet, although not 3G or Wifi, will suffice!

9014	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This external battery for your mobile devices is great for having backup power when a wall outlet is not available.  Works great and quickly charged my iPhone 5 over three times.  I like the design of New Trent products and the flashlight feature is very handy.
369	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great! I am a real estate agent and when showing houses with my blue tooth ekey, my phone would always die!  This battery keeps my phone charged and is great quality!  I can get 2-3 full charges from 10% minimum using this battery case.  I love it.


333	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This Is my 8th battery 3 for me 3 for my wife 2 for my father 1.5 to 2.5 days battery life depends on usage. We all have external chargers our phone's stay mobile we are never tied to a charging cord battery goes dead change it out recharge the dead one.
1779	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to.  See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference.  Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories:  pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.
To make calls: almost as neat. You don't have to open it to access previously called numbers - just hit the green button, up pop the numbers, scroll to the right one and hit the dial button. Nice. Almost the same deal with the phone book. Unfortunately, to dial a number NOT in your phone book, you DO have to get at the numbers, and show the dial pad. Oh well.

2599	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After going through a few headsets that were loose fitting and would feel like they are falling off, the 640E is a perfect fit!  It comes with 3 sized earbuds that will alone hold up the light as air device.  But it also comes with an optional ear hook that makes for a perfect fit.  Functionally it works perfect.  Voice quality is excellent.  Talk time is not as long as the Moto 850 which I had, 5 vs ~9hrs.  And it has the capability to connect to a 2nd bluetooth device and will give a different sounding ring for each.  So now im looking for a desk bluetooth phone to have a home station and a mobile phone connection.
Overall, I am very impressed with the iTorch IMP52D and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a USB Battery Pack.
9410	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Do not like this product, it does not show very well if it is functioning to carry signal and gives the feeling of being made of inexpensive plastic.  It is easy to install and set-up, I just wish there was a way to tell for sure it was receiving and brodcasting its signal better.

5775	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the BlackBerry Curve Leather Holster in late August 2011.  I was initially pleased, as it looks nice and the automatic off feature worked.  However, within 60 days the leather strap cracked where it folds across the top of the leather and across the Blackberry.  The seller offered to exchange it for another, but (1) that would leave me without a holster during the process, and (2) the cost of shipping it back would amount to a substantial percentage of the price.  I have chosen instead to cover the crack with black electrical tape, while waiting for the genuine BlackBerry original replacement I ordered.  I just noticed that the strap has now cracked in a second place, where the strap curves across the front edge of the BlackBerry and back down.  I should also mention that the chrome Sprint logo fell off the strap very early on, which did not bother me.  FYI, I wear the holster on my belt, on my right side.  The only significant stress it gets might be when I fasten the auto seatbelt across it.

Although Amazon LLC sells the item, it's over one-third more than other sellers. Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.

With practice I've learned to hook the case (it has loops for a belt but also a hook) it to my sweat pants for gym workouts and to run the cord of my earbuds through an opening, so that I can vigorously pump the recumbent bike or walk the treadmill and listen to the the music stored on my iPhone.
I have worn this headset for several hours at a time with no discomfort.  It is very light and well-designed for my ear.  It does not completely cover my ear, so I can hear what is going on around me as well.  In fact, having had numerous hard-wired car kits (professional install), this is a better solution that current bluetooth car kits (and my phones will not connect to hard-wired kits owiung to their mini-usb connections).

One day, while I was trying to answer a call, I was pulling my BB out of the fumbly leather holster it came with, and I dropped the phone onto concrete.  That was it.  It was lights out.  The 3 or 4 day down time until I received my new unit was almost unbearable.  The insurance deductible didn't help.  Then even though my service provider transfered all my phonebook, it didn't transfer all my calendar, notes, tasks, and most important of all, my passwords.  I was more than a little disappointed.

I can actually watch the "bars" on my smart phone go from zero to 4 bars and back down again over a few minute span. Repeated calls to Verizon were of no help, same issue with multiple phones, etc...

5106	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Months ago I saw a "charging station" in the SkyMall catalog and thought I should build one of those.  It was a nice wooden box in which to hide your chargers and cords.  While designing my charging station I thought about using one transformer and splicing the adaptors in.  Then the old "build or buy" adage hit me and I did an internet search for multi station charger and found Callpod.  I now have it and have nearly finished my charging station.  The Callpod is perfect for this application.  I reduced much of the clutter in my charging station and can charge many devices.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it isn't easy to get all the correct adaptors, so expect to spend another $20-$40 getting all the adaptors you need.  It would be nice if they indexed more camera adaptors, since many of them are the same as the phone adaptors.  Its just that without an index you can never be sure.

For months I walked around with the charger cable in my bag, trying to find an electrical outlet whenever and wherever I could. Sometimes that's hard to do in NYC. Now I have a better solution - I carry this around, plus the cable, and it doesn't matter if I can't find an electrical outlet. Just taking the subway to work can result in my phone fully drained by the time I arrive.....but now I can keep it fully charged while I commute.

5777	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Yes, I know about the problems of the broken clips, and those are real if you sit in a certain way, but otherwise this is the best case for the properly sized BlackBerries.  It holds the device safely and securely while allowing easy and fast access.  The "sleep mode" works perfectly, too.  I have four of them in four different colors, which is a nice choice to have, too.  This case is highly recommended; just pay attention to how much pressure is put on the clip.
What I love:
After trying two previous portable batteries, one made by Duracell that I had purchased at a local wal mart, and another "Made in China" product, I came to the realization that I needed a serious solution.  The Duracell provided 10% additional power (consider it advertised for cell phones, I was unhappy) and the made in product China only provided 30% additional power...then the power connector broke after a few uses.  So I ordered New Trent's iTorch, after seeing great reviews, and so far have been very happy with my purchase.
7529	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Poor quality.,  lasted 2 months
The key seems to be that you need to have at least a week signal to begin with, so if you have no signal, I really can't speak to it. However we had one bar at best for most of the house and the problem was completely resolved.  The wife and i both work from home frequently and the daughter is a 13 year old who constantly talks to friends.  we haven't had a single call drop since this was added, and I think we've had a chance to really test it adequately since we use our cell phones for work meetings (and daughter talks frequently to other friends). Dropped calls are such a completely pain in the butt so the elimination of drops alone justifies the price. the fact we don't have to constantly say "Are you still there, can you hear me" over and over is just icing on the cake. It's a good unit, I'm very glad I bought it, bought one for the parents b/c I'm quite sure it'll fix their problem and would gladly buy another one.

Battery life.  It claims to have 8 hours, but I'm not sure I'm getting that.  The battery seems to die much sooner than 8 hours, although this is not based on a real test.  I'm comparing it to my previous Jabra which could go for days without a charge.  This one is charged at least every 2-3 days.  I also turn it off every night and during the day to avoid the involuntary calls (altough it still happens)

8376	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	For my money, this is a very nice product. Please note that this is NOT for iPhones, it will not work well, they have another product for the iPhone. I paid $30 for this unique product, and I think it's awesome for the price. Paired up with my ancient LG CU500 on the first try, the volume was good, and the sound quality was just as good as when I used the headphone jack. Also worked well with my newer Samsung Solstice. If the sound is bad for you, then try it with a pair of bluetooth headphones, and see how it sounds then; the problem may be the streaming quality of your phone, or your phone doesn't support A2DP (properly).
9520	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I live in a low lying "dead zone" which made it virtually impossible to reliably communicate with anyone via cell phone - am I'm talking on the major networks like Verizon and AT&T. Since I have installed this system, I now get FOUR BARS in the room where I've placed the antenna and 2-3 bars throughout the rest of the house. Yes it's a bit of work to install - you need to mount the receiving antenna on the outside of your house and then string the cable either through your attic or basement - but it works incredibly well once you've got it in place. I work from home a lot and needed absolutely reliable cell phone coverage and this device delivers it!!!
9238	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	nice

One caveat, I am 6'3" so my face is right in the system and the visor.
My two biggest problems with this thing are the eventual metallic-jingling sound it makes as it shortens over time.  To keep it silent, one would have to readjust it about once a month.  My second problem with it is how difficult it is to install.  I HATE taking it out, because I dread the time I'm going to waste putting it back in.  It's awkward to adjust and tighten the legs and close to (but not quite) impossible to accomplish alone.
7505	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got this for $50 plus tax at Target on sale. It does the job as advertised. Hooked up to my cellphone via bluetooth and has been stable for two weeks. This allows me to set aside my phone but still can receive calls anywhere in my house, very convenient. One glitch I found is that the touch tone sent using my home phones does not seen to be delivered correctly over to the recipient end, thus company voice mail boxes and other automatic phone services won't work. However, I believe that's the limitation of the CDMA system used by the cellphone rather than the bluetooth gateway. This provides the most important feature I need (to be able to linkup to home phones) at a faction of the price of the other similar devices. Highly recommended.

3) A long cable that runs from the unit to a small antenna with a magnetic base.  The cable is long enough to allow for the antenna to be placed on the roof of the car and attach to the cradle unit on the dash.  The cable is meant to be run into the car through a back window/door and is long enough to be run under the seats so it's pretty much out of the way although not entirely.  It screws into the unit easily, no tools needed.  The antenna is about 5" high and the magnet is strong (but you probably wouldn't want to run it through a car wash).

* Works well when one is in very noisy environment
9211	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I've owned many of these headsets over the last 10 years, and I love the over the ear style.  But the last 2 that I've owned both had the mic go out.

6151	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got this item for a trip to Peru.  I used this to charge my phone while on the plane, and in airport and while in Peru and not near power.  It work great.  you won't get more then a few charges out of it though.  If you need that many extra charges away from a power supply it might be better to look at a backup that uses AA batteries and cary a lot of them with you.
it is fit all the battery however, it is only for charge little bit.

4)  It is convenient that it is GPS capable, however, I feel ripped off paying $10 a month for GPS when other GPS units (Garmin, TomTom, Magellan, etc.) are free.

1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.


- Add a "wall plug" but have it as a foldable option. (There is an iPhone charger on Kickstarter which has this feature. It is a case with a built-in / fold-out wall plug. I think a Trent which could charge from a wall outlet, without a wired USB plug, would earn a 5/5 unanimously)

4) The packaging is impressive though a bit tedious to open!
I'd recommend it to anyone that wants stereo bluetooth and the flexibility to use your own headphones-- it's easy to set up and use, and I think the sound quality is great, but at least for me and my phone, it definitely has its limitations.
Good features
You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.

1432	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This was an okay headset, during my days of wanting a BT headset. It's a bit bulky compared the other higher end ones, but does the job.

The speaker phone is very good. Much like a 2-way radio. Clarity is better than with the CSK. I use my phone in the car a lot and handle it like a "CB mike" or slip it into my shirt pocket and talk into the air.
And, one more thing. I am no longer bothered by what I called back in 2008 'weird format'. It's something you get used to. After all, Thinkpads were never meant to be fashion statements.
After working this issue with Samsung, I will now give this item a 4-STAR rating. (Minus 1-STAR for Amazon shipping out the generic black unit)
No video capture (which I don't really miss).

In my regular use, I powered three Android phones, one iPhone, and charged the battery. Routinely, I would have it in use for 12-14 hours at a time like this. I never suffered any brown-outs or blackouts, though I did have to find the right combo of what to plug in where (some of the USB outlets I used were culprits in this as well).

It even works with my wife's Verizon V3m, some tinkering was required to get the multimedia features to work on the Verizon phone (instructions were supplied my the vendor), but at the end everything works great!! As an added benefit if I get a new phone I don't have to worry because this kit works with almost all Motorola phones.
The BT headset I am using is the Cardo Scala 500, and they match up well.
The good clarity, unlike the Motorola sometimes offsets the extra steps taken.
The headset can be worn on either ear and it takes a little adjusting to get it to fit nice and snug.  Once it's in place, it's very comfortable, so much so, you forget it's there.
But to be completely honest with you, after trying a number of `prettier' headsets that either break easily, lose their pairing with the phone frequently, or just plain don't work as well I am all for sacrificing form for function.
You will love it !


9113	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My new IMP52D is great.  I opened the package 5 days ago and read the directions that told me that the battery is also a flash light.  Two minutes later the lights went out do to an electrical storm. I was so glad to have such a helpful item.  The next day my phone battery started to decline significantly.  Once the iPhone 4S battery goes down to 20 % battery the battery drops very fast. The new small battery charger saved the day and not only stopped the decline but put the charge back up to 100% in a very short period of time.  I am a nurse practitioner and need my phone for many medical functions.  I highly recommend this small battery charger.



Well, I discovered vast difference in supplies. The product is still high quality and the same, however...In the 20 application a measuring tube for the activator is included.

If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it, this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head, and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.
It's not worth returning and will just throw it away and go back to the old way of doing it.
This price is great as well. If you go to Best Buy be prepared to pay $10-25 for a pack of screens, that you must personally cut down to size (they only sell screens for Playstation 2 devices used by kids). These are way cheaper, even with shipping.
As of Thanksgiving, every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out (including Amazon).  This tells me two things: many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice, not out of necessity.  As a result, the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s, and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.

Upon receiving the speaker, I was really surprised at how large it is. 2-4 times larger than most. It covers a large portion of your visor. But it's still sleek and stylish looking with rounded corners and attractive gray tones.
The device comes with a USB cord so you can plug it into your favorite USB wall socket, your cars USB or your computer.  The cord winds up to become compact when not in use.

I purchased this item based from information on Amazon so I will be going back to all the items I purchased and leaving a review.

BAM! The bars on my phone went from the normal 1 (or two if I'm lucky)  to the maximum! I now get a steady, strong signal. I walked around my office and the strength only started dropping off when I was about 15 feet from the transmitter -- impressive. Calls are clear and seem louder than before and I don't get the audio "cut-outs" that I used to.

327	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've only had it a couple of weeks, but it's been so nice to not have to worry about my battery dying mid-day anymore. I can go two, two-and-a-half days now on a charge. I use my phone mostly for texting and web-browsing, some email, some Google Maps and Sky Maps, as a flashlight, a few non-intensive games; not a lot of phone calls. But with my old battery, same usage, I felt like I was doing pretty good if I still had 20% battery by the end of the work-day at 5ish.

I'm pretty sure these old-stock (04/2009) batteries are close to their functional expiration date.  The battery's shelf-life is all about the constantly decaying lithium-ion chemistry inside the cells.  Over 2 years sitting on the shelf is a long time for any battery.

THATS RIGHT!!... if you have a USB connection, you are going to get your device charged. Even better is that it doesnt weigh anything. If its in my work bag, backpack on a hike, or in my kid's diaper bag... I don't have to worry about if my stuff has been charged. WAIT theres more! Charging the iTorch 5200 only takes 30-40 min. I haven't timed it but considering it taked my iphone and ipad at least an hour to to charge, time well spent! What are you waiting for... buy it. Heck, I'm sold on buying another writing this =p

I don't use the cell as much, so now I'm using the Motorola :,-(
As for the Kindle - it has a great battery life, but it is great to have a backup should you forget to charge it. I read about this trick on a Kindle blog - and I bought the USB Sync Charge Cable (for Palm Zire 31 72 Tungsten E) and I now use this adapter cable to connect to the battery pack and it successfully charges my kindle!

Mine's going back. It isn't much better than my old H700 in actual use and have to carry yet another charger when I travel or manage another one at home is a real PITA! It is a bit louder than the H700, it will pair with more than one phone which is nice. All this is overshadowed by needing to carry yet another charger with me.
Cons:
5220	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I don't like this. I wish it had another strap to wrap around bcuz my bed rises up, and all of my items fall off on the floor.
But, as i said, simply awesome!
We ended up keeping the Wilson Electronics Desktop Booster due to the higher data rate and better name brand but the zBoost YX545 would have been acceptable for our use as well. Neither unit provided whole house coverage which would have required spending a lot more money to achieve.

1587	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is my first Bluetooth headset, but my 4th Plantronics headseat. This purchase was my first cordless and its been a pretty decent unit. Voice quality has been reported as clear and clean unless its very windy. Wind noise sometimes requires me to plug in my old corded headset in the car unless I'm running the A/C. I like the range, and often leave my Blackberry on my dresser and walk around the house with just the earpiece. Battery life is pretty good, around 6-8 hours talk time. I wish it had a car charger, and I wish they wouldn't flash the power light when it is running; which is totally stupid. When driving at night in the car it is a safety hazard because the blue light is bright enough to reflect off the auto glass and mess with your night vision; I suggest some black tape over the power light for night driving. Mine just bit the dust after 1.5 years, as it won't take a charge even though the charger is putting out 5.3 volts (rated at 5.0 volts). Tech support suggest I replace it, but I was hoping it would last a bit longer than just past the warranty period. I may buy another simply because the other features make it worth the money. To get a better unit I would have to spend $100 or more.

2423	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have used the Samsung WEP200 bluetooth headset for about 3 months. I've found it small in size and very convenient to use. I was able to adjust the rubber earpiece to a certain position that is very comfortable for me to wear. I feel it is secured in my ear and am not worry about having it fall out due to lack of a over-the-ear hook like some other headsets. Since I wear glasses, I prefer not to have the over-the-ear hook models.
Even as a standalone mobile phone headset, the 855 is a spectacular value. It's small, sounds great and the sliding boom mike picks up your voice very well. Sliding the boom open when a call comes in automatically picks up the call, and sliding it close ends the call.

If you want to use your headset in stereo mode (your device must support stereo bluetooth, of course, like most stereo telephones, iPhone 3.0, etc...) simply attach the earloop accessory and use the second earbud. Note that the stereo device does not have to be the same device as your phone: you could pair the 855 with your phone as a headset, and with your iPod Touch (with 3.0 OS) as BT headphones. If you're listening to music and a call comes in, you will hear the ring. Extend the boom to pick up the call, the music will pause and resume when you close the boom to hang up. How awesome is that?

4097	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I'm very happy with this skin.  It is a smooth black rubber, with an embossed "Blackberry" logo on the back.  It is very sleek and adds very little bulk, yet seems to provide a nice level of protection (I dropped my Curve with this on and it's still working just fine).  One question I had as I was shopping was whether or not this includes a face protector for the Curve.  It does not -- the face is not protected, so you may want to order separate face protectors to avoid scratching.  The skin provides good access to all buttons, including the popular "standby" button on top, and the two slots on top that I haven't figured out why they exist yet (cooling?).
9719	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good.

One important hint is that to make the headset fit my ear canal, I tore all the rubber off the original factory earbud, leaving just the plastic locking ring around the speaker hole. Then I had press fitted a Jabra Gel over this plastic locking ring to make a custom fit that is both secure and comfortable.
1654	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I had a phone that had terrible BT reception so I purchased 3 other earpieces; the most expensive of these costing $129.  I went to a forum to see what others have done about this problem when I found out about the Voyager 510.  I must admit, this is the best BT on the market BY FAR.  It is truly comfortable, not just "claimed" to be.  I am on the phone quite a bit, and I have never run the battery down, the volume can be turned up louder than any of the other, and plugging the unit is easier than most of the others. This is a great unit.
165	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	OEM is the way to go, fits the way it should and no shorts on it. Definately would recommend. Price is right
3535	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am loving my otterbox.  I drop my phone a lot and have 2 small boys that like to take mommy's phone and so far not even a scratch.  Totally worth every penny for the protection and peace of mind.

SUMMARY
1947	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I've had my pair for four months now they look great and the sound isn't bad overall. But that's where it ends. My pair died and would not recharge and the hinges developed cracks since it has plastic hinges with steel pins holding them together. My friends pair also has cracks in his hinges and i am talking about 2 to 3 cracks. I sent them in and they told me that I should not keep them on the stand when not in use, Isn't that what the stand is for????
The unit comes with a couple of power tips which I did not like much. Between the end of the cable, the power tip, and the connection to the battery, there is a fairly long, rigid chain of stuff ... It's very weak and very easy to snap one of the components (like the end off the power tip) if even slight pressure is applied. Anyway only
5225	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Looks good, perfect as white elephant gift, anyone can use one of these!
thanks,
4. Extremely long battery life.
Lastly, what I love about it even more than all those features is the fact that it's comfortable.  I often forget it's on.
First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.
8199	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	item arrived as promised
The sound quality isn't as good as my Plantronics Voyager either, but it's still good enough for phone calls.  People on the other end don't seem to have problems understanding me and I can hear them well enough.
It's pretty small and will fit in a pocket if you absolutely have to.  The only bad thing I can say about it is the adapter to charge the battery is pretty much proprietary and it is bound to short out on the ends.  You can buy a new one for a few bucks, but the time it shorts is bound to be when you really need it.

The Wilson Signal booster took 10 easy minutes to hook up AND B O O M!----2 bars where we had 0 to 1 for the last 2 years. The joy of getting calls, and sending and receiving texts without having to run into a good stop -OR- run outside is awesome...2 hundred bucks and some change...I would pay 2 grand had I known HOW Great this Booster works,...before I wasted So much time fooling around with all the other junk out there...
8222	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	works great
8897	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Charges up my Android phone as quickly as a wall charger, which is helpful when I'm not near a wall or in a car. It has four blue LEDs that indicate how much it has charged up. The flashlight thing seems a bit pointless, but I do like the power switch, to turn the outflow on or off.
I did get it to work well once I found the direction of the nearest tower and aligned it just right. The issue then was that the supplied cable was so short the booster and repeater were interfering with each other. So I went to radio shack and got a 50' cable and put the receiver in the attic and the repeater in the basement. I got good reception as long as I was within 10' of the repeater. Useless for my brothers needs.
803	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am using this connector as charger for my portable stereo.  I Was able to charge phones while camping so it works great.
3481	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	the button access for VOL and PWR is impossible with this case. I returned it and got a spigen which is great.
9534	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Ok, I wanted it to work because I needed it.  I have an older home with thick plaster walls that effectively block my cell phone signal completely.  I use my cell as my only phone so I need it to work at all times.  I can get three bars if I step out on my front porch but as soon as I go inside and close the door- no bars.  So, I thought this would be perfect because it would grab the outside signal and bring it inside where I needed it.  Well I went through the trouble of hooking it all up- getting the two green lights and following all the conditions detailed in the instructions.  It did NOTHING- had no effect whatsoever-  I began to feel like I got scammed.  I am returning it.  The outdoor antenna box feels like an empty piece of plastic- I wanted to look inside but probably would not be able to return it if I did.  I've read the reviews about there needing to be a signal to amplify- that's why I checked the signal outside.  Maybe it does work for some people just not for me.
Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small.

Pros:

9176	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is an stellar addition to the sometimes "lack luster" portable battery chargers that have infiltrated the mobile phone accessory market.  In the case of the IMP500, the compact size, ease of use, rapid ability to charge a dead phone on a plane or in the middle of a desert, combined with an ample capacity, makes this a dependable asset to your "must have" accessories.

The only con is, I sometimes have difficulty intially putting it on becasue I wear glasses.  I occassionally have to use two hands to put it on my ear correctly.

2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.
8221	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great and is a cheap alternative from having to try and find and buy specific nike+ shoes
Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.
The unit comes with a directional antenna. It would not work for me because there is a large hill between my home and the nearest cell tower 1.7 miles away. The signal bounces into my location and is very weak. This type of situation calls for an omnidirectional antenna.
BETTER RECEPTION: The next best option is mounting the receiver outside your location on a wall. This would work well if you were to mount it near where your cable box is on your home, since you probably already have a location near there drilled through your walls/foundation for your TV cables to go through. It also may have a kind of shelter built onto your home to shield your cable box from the elements, so if you were to place your receiver box there as well, it may provide it some shelter as well.
8846	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great little charger to throw in your computer bag. Chargers a bunch of products including iPhone.

BIG MISTAKE!!!  BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONS
I love it works great.
Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar "Please say a command" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting "Please say a command".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.
This happened with the first one I was using but the second one is holding up well since I have been avoiding that scenario.

This phone runs circles around almost anything you'll come in contact with. The best part (to me) is that it's feature-packed but stealth, tasteful, compact, sturdy and doesn't shout "trend follower".
Fits nicely with iphone 4. I have been using this for almost 4 months and both the belt loop broke but the belt clip still in good shape and i just sew the belt loop back for added support. Thinking of buying again and reinforce the belt loop with a pants belt loop just to see if it will last longer or i'll go back to the flea market hoping to find the one i use that lasted for a year.

4651	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Initially appeared to be a sturdy pouch-- there seems to be a 'design fault' in that option for vertical OR horizontal leaves it 'saggy' and likely to catch on things, ripping stitching...would be MUCH better/more secure  if  just vertical
8436	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Virgin Mobile is the best prepaid service provider. TracFone is just HORRIBLE (minutes go as high as $.50 a minute and text messages are $.30 each and I think you have to pay to receive text messages with TracFone. With Virgin Mobile, its $.25 a minutes for the first ten minutes of the day and $.10 a minute after that. Text messages are $.10 to send and free to receive. A lot of content is available at virginmobileusa.com for putting on your phone (ringtones, celebrity voicemail greetings, MTV and Comedy Central Content, and a lot more). You only have to play $20 every three month which is A LOT cheaper than most cell phone service providers. And best of all, NO CONTRACTS!!! Virgin Mobile is the way to go for prepaid phone service.

  Also don't expect this to cover your house. If you need to walk around to make calls you'll want to look elsewhere.
2) The full qwerty keyboard is somewhat difficult in size, but you do adapt quickly and typing speed will increase. I can type almost as fast as a laptop now. Thats a significant improvement over the traditional multi-tap process.
tool as well as charger. I had no idea it featured an LED flashlight; even

But it is working well
9362	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	When the N95 came to the US, I spent a large sum of my bonus money to get it. Generation 1. I loved it! It was all I wanted from a phone and more! I read books, I get myself home when I am lost, I take pictures, listen to music, watch news casts from my home country and so on, and so on. I have google maps, and read gmail on it. I surf the web, and play games. The menus are configurable, and I have almost none of the original buttons on the front "page". I usually keep forgetting all the things this phone can do.
6156	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product for anyone using personal mobile electronics such as Smartphones, Tablets etc.  It has saved me on trips where I was away from my auto or plug in charger.

This looked like the most cost-effective option, and the user reviews on Amazon were very helpful in the decision.  An alternative would have been to wait for a Verizon femtocell, but the YX510 PCS/CEL is here today, and cheaper.
With this nice little charger you not only get your typical USB charger cord but you also get an adapter for the Galaxy Tab and beyond that you get a very nice felt carrying bag to make not only keeping everything together but makes carrying everything so much easier.  Like other New Trent products it also comes with easy to read LED indicators showing how much battery is left on the charger in 25% increments.  Altogether I have to say I am very pleased with the iTorch and it served me well as I see it serving me well for much longer.
3700	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Best connection and sound of any bt headset I've tested over the years.  Excellent battery life and the wall/travel charger is exceptional.  Comfortable to wear.  If I were to design a headset, this would be it.


2729	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I give it a 5 star due to the quality and of how reliable this product is. This does everything it is suppose to do
-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words

Nifty Design reminds you of a mini-laptop

6640	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I just moved into a small home in the country where I can get about 2 bars of 3G (-90db or so) of signal outside, but inside, due to a metal roof and siding, I get absolutely no signal unless I plaster myself against a window. I won't have landline or DSL service for over a month, and I work in IT and am a graduate student - so Internet is a must.
5746	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	covers nicely. a little tricky to place the internal screen cover on. But love them - great protection
614	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I live about 100 miles from where this was shipped, just LOVE it...thought it would be here faster than it was....but...ships in a tube...so came damage free...cool map and pretty funny letter that they send with it...made me laugh...highly recommended .......kinda nice u know ...do yourself a favor and check them out....their more than just maps.....
My wife does not like the numbers on the keys.  They are a different finish rather than a different color.  In low light, you have to hold it so the light reflects on it at just the right angle to see the numbers.

I love this case.
  1 bar (-106dBm)
That said, I would have given the product 5 stars except that when playing music from my phone, the first second or two of each song is clipped off.  There appears to be some latency in deleivering the signal.  It might be a problem in the way the phone transmits Bluetooth, rather than a problem with the headset, but the phone has no latency in playing music through its own speakers. I'd be interested in knowing if others experience this problem. (I have a Samsung A737 phone from AT&T.)

What else can I say....?
6934	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought this battery to replace a dead watch battery.  Worked fine, batteries not expired. Saved quite a bit not only on the batteries but installing the battery in my watch. I also purchased a watch battery replacement kit on Amazon.
5863	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This phone is great for when I am heading out to the bar or somewhere. I don't have to lug my company Blackberry around that I cant fit in my pocket. The call quality is the best I have heard on a phone and the signal strength is great (better than my Blackberry). No dropped calls yet! Dont expect to text much or listen to music on this phone but it functions great for what I need it for. Theres not many characters that can fit on the screen so you have to scroll over a lot to read a full text message. Its the thinnest phone made I think though and forget I even have it in my pocket when I am out and about. Great phone for a backup too!
Cons:
8430	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great so far, very happy with time for shipping and it plugs into USB a huge plus while on the road with laptop.

9622	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Batteries are as listed and described, better than at the store.
i will definitely be visiting the store again! thanks for the quality products and accurate description!
Though I haven't found one yet, it would be nice if the headset could mute calls, but that'd be asking for waaaay too much :)
With the standard battery, this case fits very nicely. I can still open up my Voyager and it opens all the way if needed.

3951	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised.
3767	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Nice light in the sockets, generally works great, would have been 5 stars but onceeeee in a while I have to unplug and plug the unit back in. Might just be a finicky dc socket on my benz... Ill change it to five stars if it survives another year of my use. :)



8437	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this replacemet battery pack for my Lenovo laptop a few months back, from the very beginig the power didn't last for more than 45 min, now it gives me zero minutes of power, it is an absolute piece of junk.

4415	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I am still using this phone and I am happy with it although I am planning to change it because I believe I have outgrown it.
All compartments are extremely small.
I've also found that the battery will charge my dead phone (iPhone 5) somewhere between 2 and 3 times depending mostly on if I let it charge or if I start using it while its charging.


connects to phone fast fast fast

502	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I will not belabor the technical aspects of this phone--but I will sing higest praises to Nokia for making it available in the U.S. Now, if Americans would avail themselves of the data functions of this phone and not just the voice, AT&T, T-Mobile and Cingular "Internet" dl/ul prices would be cheaper.
I'll finish up with what they did do right. The phone is beautiful. Perfectly designed, a nice weight and contrary to another review it feels like a quality phone. (Minus maybe the small keys and the disfunctional scroll wheel) The screen is maybe not as big as others but that was the point wasn't it? To make a smaller PDA phone. However, fyi, the streaming video comes in at half the size of the screen resolution. Earpiece is good and clear. Over all dimensions blow away all others except maybe the Blackberry Pearl. Cool, black RAzorV3 kind of finish. I would love to keep it if the phone actually delivered the functionality it needed to.
4417	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	thank you
4300	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the best blue tooth headset I have ever used. It is comfortable and lightweight. Drawback appears too delicate but time will tell.

2887	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is great - I still use a "cord" headset for my cell phone, and now I can use it also for my laptop/skype by carrying this tiny accessory.  very pleased.  My $10 routine cell phone headset even gave OK performance in a speech-to-text program on my laptop (dragon naturallyspeaking; it accepted eight or ten sentences at 100% accuracy) although experts say the best headset possible is to be used for text to speech work.  In short, this little connector device has several uses and is very tiny and cheap.
SCREEN
4351	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	this thing is perfect. Keeps the iPod plugged in with no cords and is well built. Easy to transfer between car and pc
In any case, after installing and testing this unit for goodness with my Pearl, my son's friends came over armed with a bunch of ATT (Cingular) phones which are all GSM. Previously, these did not work at my house, but now they all do. This might not be that much of a blessing in this specific case :-) but the system has now been tested with two services and the latest RAZR variants on ATT as well as my BBY.
There are 4 VERY small LEDS that tell you the power level of the battery pack and the charging state,  The 4 LEDS come on when you hit the button once, they tell you the power state of the device,  each LED represents 25% charge left in the battery pack. While a device is plugged into the battery pack the charging the LEDS stay on the, I personally find this slightly annoying because I feel like it is wasting a small amount of power they are also slightly distracting when its say sitting next to you or on your beside at night, I would rather these turn off after say 30 seconds and to be able to see the amount of charge left in the battery pack you would just have to click the button once. But this is only a minor complaint and nothing major.
4133	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It is an actual BlackBerry branded holster - (I ordered via Amazon seller MyNetDeals). Fits the phone well.  I'm hopping that the clip lasts; The holster my 8800 came with only lasted 3 weeks.  I think rubber coated steal might have been a better choice vs the plastic clip (seen a lot of people complain about them snapping)
Like the KE850 Prada phone, this thing is a work of art; it's got an attractive brushed aluminum battery door, aluminum buttons for the camera and image stabilizer/unlock key, and chrome accents. The case is also well-constructed and the fit and finish is very good. It's not that compact, but for what it is, it's reasonably small, about the same size and thickness as an HTC Touch, TYTAN, Tilt, LG VU, or T-Mobile Wing.

1286	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Whenever I am on a call, the person on the other line has a hard time hearing me speak.  The volume control does not help adjust this for the boom is too far away from my mouth.  The paring between it and my phone took way too long to perform and still is not working right.  The first phone I tried using with it, continued to lockup every day after attempting the paring and new software on it did not resolve the matter.  The new phone is working better, but did not expect all these diversions that still do not have me working in a satisfactory manner.  Cool conception...just not working too well.

8269	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great case.  It has a screen and keyboard protector that is functional and fits very well.
JIS "7" Water shall not enter the enclosure when it is immersed in water under defined conditions (Immersion resistant)
7500	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It is extremely rigid and seems like it wouldn't be flexible, but when you put a little "harumph" into it, the thing bends to your will. If you shape it right and provide a little tension using the dashboard as a steadying point, it knocks the vibrating problem out, too. If it is simply stuck to the window and left to dangle out there.... vibration town.
9899	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	these are okay but, you have to be very carefull when applying or they will get finger prints on the under side, but not bad for the money.
The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.

  highly reccomend this
9039	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My main concern is the screen of my smart phone consumes too much energy. Well, with this product it'll last my cell standby much longer when I'm out of nowhere !!
Range is very good when my phone (Treo 700P) is on the opposite side of my body.  Much better than other headsets I have used.  Line of sight range inside is about 30 feet.

7736	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have gotten a couple of these as OEM versions for pretty cheap, and i really like this product. The flip open boom mic allows me to keep it off when im driving, and when someone calls, all i need to do is open it up and put it on and it automatically connects the call and is recognized by my iphone as the default audio device. I really only use it in my car, but the volume buttons work well and the battery does not need to be charged that often.
Pros:
The pod is heavy for its size and very attractive.
Usually when we take long trips with our friends and family, someone is always asking for a wall charger and then they have to find an outlet to use.  Now we can just keep this in our bag and plug our phone in and keep going.  It does come with a red laser pointer and flashlight, which are cool features. I haven't used the laser pointer for anything practical yet, but the flash light has been useful more than I had expected.

This phone also comes with a built in FM radio! Now that's cool. So if your not in the mood to listen to your MP3s, just swtch on the radio. But you will need to hook up some headphones for that though. No worries, the phone has a 3.5 mm jack for REGULAR head phones, like the ones you use on a ipod or cd player. And to top it off it comes with some headphoes as well, with an microphone adapter for it as well if you want to go hands free.
Upon reading Amazon reviews,  I decided to go with this unit. I purchased it used from an Amazon seller and it came in like new condition with the original box, all accessories and the instructions for less than $200. After reading other reviews, I decided to mount it as high as possible outside the house on my old television antenna staff, so I purchased a 50' Wilson coax cable knowing I would have some signal loss, but I wanted to get above the unseen barrier blocking my signal.  I mounted it about 8' up on the antenna staff and ran the 50' cable into my family room. I checked the signal on the roof with my Galaxy using Settings>About Phone>Status. Scanning the guessed direction of the antenna, my strongest signal was 89dbm to 87dbm. I secured the antenna in its cradle and directed it at the tower about 6 miles away. Upon finishing the install and fiddling with placement, I get an indoor signal of 89 to 87db with occasional jumps as high as 101dbm in the evening and as low as 79dbm in the afternoon. The former is  still acceptable for calling. Since I am on wireless I do not need to get down in the 60db range in my home.
4529	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got this little jewel in a package from radio shack. Wow i'm very impressed. You only have to talk softly for the other person to hear you. Recieving volume only has about 3 levels of adjustment but works great at low volume. If you talk loud the other person will think you are yelling.


Enjoy.
Customizable-  The blackberry curve is a very customizable you can change the themes that change how the phone looks and there are alot out there on the internet.  Some you have to pay for and others are free but there are alot of good free themes out there... Ask me for a website and I will tell you where to find them but there could be changes like being able to make it so you don't have to have icons on your desktop at all times which is something I would really appreciate.  3 and a half stars for not having the possibility of taking icons of your desktop but yet having the option to download themes.
8793	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	excelent
2179	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got my new phone, then got the software here instead of downloading.  Great package and pricing.
So how does it perform?  When installed properly, it's performance is very impressive.  My reception can go from very poor, to excellent in many areas where I travel.  Inside your phones software, u can actually see how much better the reception is... tech support will teach u how to read this, as it varies with your phones software, so I can't give generic explanation how to see this for each phone.

Dislike:
Without the booster we both had 2 bars of signal sometimes 1 bar.
The sound quality is amazing as well.  No one can ever tell I'm on a headset. And once you start using this, you'll soon wonder how you ever lived without it. I can't tolerate holding a phone to my ear anymore because this headset makes life SO much easier.
1777	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to. See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.
=======
everythig about this is amazing good range and quality with a Razor and a BB Peril nobody has ever had an issue hearing me and i have heard everybody clearly.
4015	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Heavy Duty Extra Large Vertical Smart Phone Case / Pouch / Holster with...

They also make these for Iphones, so I think I'm going to stop getting the stupid film that lasts a month if I'm lucky, and get the glass for our phones too.
Another reason why I like this case is that it easily fits in your pocket with no bulk :-) and I could never go with a silicon case it makes your iphone look ugly...
-QWERTY key pad should have a button for the period, you need to "shift" then hit the period.
5705	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Too big

- paired quickly and easily with both my old Motorola Q9, as well as my current iPhone 3GS

5630	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	very utilful to my car i like so much and I recomend it.
The cutout for the micro-usb was a little small to solidly connect the Samsung OEM usb cable. It needs a small amount of trimming so the cable can sit flush against the phone.
5# There is a software lancher called "ZLauncher" which has many features for your Treo's software interface. One of which allows you to see the exact level of signal strength. By using this tool you can so how much better the Treo's antenna and related components work, compared to any other phone on the market. I get a great signal with Sprint, but with Sprint and my Treo, my service is even better! I get signals with my Treo in places where my Sanyo and LG did not. In fact, I get better signal strength with my Treo, then my friends get with their phones!
My only complaint is that even though the description states that it is compatible with the 8330 Curve, there is one part that really isn't for the Verizon 8330. The Verizon 8330 has the notification LED on the actual face, to the right of the ear speaker. The cutout for the LED however, is far above it. This makes it so that a piece of the top is exposed unnecessarily. The case functions the same but if you're wondering why there's a cutout when your LED is below it, now you know why.
6389	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Since I have found customer reviews helpful in the past on Amazon, I felt it my duty to warn you about this product.  I was originally sold this product at an independent Verizon wireless store.  Since they didn't have it in stock, they were going to send one for free.  When that didn't happen, I decided to buy another one here.  I was excited that the online price was less than half of what I was going to pay in the store.  Obviously, I learned, yet again, you get what you pay for.  The cover is meant to be used in two ways. 1) You can put the plug in the back and just put it in your pocket, or 2) you can put a different plug in the back and use it as a belf clip.  This was a great concept in theory, but in real life, did not work at all.  The belt option never worked correctly.  Every time I sat, stood, walked, stopped, or just merely breathed, the phone would pop out of the backing and fall to the ground, which completely defeats the purpose of a cover.  After two weeks of trying to fight with it (even considered gluing my new phone to the cover), I put the other plug in and now just put it in my pocket, which smears and scratches the screen since there is no protection for the touchscreen.  I would not recommend this cover.
When I bought the phone it came with the USB cable I mentioned earlier, as well as a stereo hands-free headset with a detachable mic, and, joy of joys, a 1 gigabyte memory card! That's a really nice thing to have! I've got quite a bit of music on mine and it isn't even close to being filled. Tiny card, too. About the size of a fingernail.
5985	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've used this for a while now and tried it with iPhone 4s and 5 and some Droid phones and it works great.  It can charge a phone 3-4 times with battery to spare.  Easy to recharge, just plug in the USB cable.  While it can charge an iPad it cna't charge it fully.  If you need extra power for smartphones or other small devices this is great.  If your looking for tablet power look for a larger capacity external battery.


I decided to give the Jabra a real-world torture-test right out of the box.  We recently purchased a new smart fortwo -- the European micro-car that has just gone on the market in the USA.  It is definitely much louder inside than our other cars, as the engine is directly behind the driver's seat and these cars have very little sound-deadening material.
2788	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I needed a replacement batter for Mom's phone and wanted Motorola brand.  This is a good product for the money no complaints.
To be fair, I paired the headset with other (different) phones and my Apple MacBook Pro.  (All of the tested phones and my laptop have worked with other headsets from Jawbone (I & II), Blue Ant (Z9 & Z9i), Motorola (H12), and Plantronics (925)--most at distances of 20 feet or more.)
Overall I would suggest this headset to anyone because it works, it's cheap and it wears extremely comfortable on your ear.
The only annoyance is that calls are announced with one voice, text message another...a creepy robotic voice...and there is no way to change it...
543	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The antenna for the GS3 according to schematics is at the very lower part of the phone.  Therefore, placing the booster behind the battery does nothing. I've also tried placing it at the bottom of the phone on the removable back with some two sided tape with and the signal is even worse oh well...


5678	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a must for these phones. Executive and professional look. It's a great buy, great price, Blackberry OEM. Recommended.
I will highly recommend this device to anyone!
Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc).
small, lightweight, easy to carry with you on short trips, daily, etc.
8667	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	(final)


- Sound quality was terrible.  Very tinny.  Playing music from my PC was even worse than phone calls - very choppy to the point that it was unusable, and I have an upper-end PC.
I'll say that after using this for awhile now, it's not perfect if you're using the ear piece plugged-in.  It is too tight and will cause unwanted transmissions depending on your movement.
9000	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We bought this external battery charger before going on an extended trip out of the country, after reading other reviews and comparing with other units.  We're glad we settled on the Trent IMP52D!  It works very well, and does not add a lot of weight to our carry-on luggage.  It looks very sleek, too.
reception: typical nokia, but I see it's a little better than 6120, same as K790a on 1800 part (using in Hong Kong)
2416	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	So far I'm pretry impressed with this unit. This headset is currently paired with a Blackberry 8800.

First, some positives. The packaging was nice. When I plugged it in, it turned on.
Sound - incoming:  I rarely had any problems with the Jabra and so far the Jawbone is equal or better.  If Jabra has any advantage it is with the easier volume control, although I almost always had to have it near maximum to hear when in a car.  The Jawbone can get louder and I do not generally have to adjust it, but if I do the Jabra is easier.  But a slight overall incoming sound edge to Jawbone.
8673	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	the case appears to be well constructed and fits the phone beautifully, but the swivel hinge broke off after one week. My original case for my Blackberry lasted for 5 years until the holster clip pulled from the rivits that held the belt clip to the case. I am not sure if the construction of this case is the same as the original.
7721	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this case for about 4 dollars. At that price, I wasn't expecting much. I was surprised with the level of quality on the case. Yes, it's just a sliver of bamboo glued onto the back of a white piece of plastic, but it actually looks good. From the picture, you can see that the front of the case doesn't have a lip over the edge of the screen, I wish that it did. I like a case to offer some front protection. The case is very easy to snap on, although, it takes a little work to get the case off. I don't know if I would use this case everyday, but its a fun case to use and people seem interested in it when they see it.


The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
9891	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have been protecting the screen of my BB curve for the past 3 yrs. I custom cut it from a long universal plastic screen protector. For a change, I order this product and dismayed of it. The good side of it are a.) it has a tiny cleaning cloth; and b.) 100% exactly the same size of BB screen. The bad side are: 1.) it can't be re-applied if you mess-up; and 2.) one of the 2 tabs that said "please peel of this mask before application" is harder to remove. The paste on it had dried signifying that it is an old stock.

Microphone power switch, functional and easy to remember to power off.
s is because it was not ready to use out of the package.

* Gmail works perfectly and automatically (but took some figuring out to set up - you have to go to mytmobile.com to set it up)
8148	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	We charge our phones in the kitchen and this keeps them in one place and dry.  You need to get the small outlet  adapter that is recommended to keep down the clutter.

8850	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love this product, and here is why.
1370	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	They send you a whole credit card sized piece of plastic with this. It's like when there is christmas and the kids only want to play with the box. Yeah, somehow it's exactly like that.


I'm very satisfied it is performing exactly as intended. I was concerned that the film would decrease the sensitivity of the touch screen and interfere with daily usage as the phone was designed. It did NOT. This film did NOT impeded tactile sensitivity and allows full function without degradation of phone function.
3569	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This navigation come with a very old map it does not have up to date location and roads if you want that you must update it on the garmin website but it is not free it will cost you 50 dollar or more just for a update of the map. But with that you could just buy a newer model it would be alot cheaper that way. This navigation does come with very responsive touchscreen though.

This so convenient that I recommend this to anyone, even if your car does have 12V sockets in the central console. it has 2 of everything, for the couple who has multiple power-hungry devices (you know who you are ...)
The Jawbone came apart just before the warranty ran out, therefore my letter reached Aliph after the warranty expiration date so Aliph has refused to replace the headset - THAT WAS USED NO MORE THAN 3 TIMES BEFORE COMING APART!
charge my gadgets. But there's more to it than just accomplishing it's
Be forewarned if you keep your Blackberry in your pocket or purse without a case, the screen will eventually get scratched and murky. This is good - You see, it's taking the beating originally intended for your Blackberry!


These Motorola headphones FEEL like they're worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I didn't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these ISN'T going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.

8986	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this a few weeks ago, as my Droid Razr has a terrible battery life, and it has been nothing short of excellent. The main function of this product is to recharge mobile devices on the go, and this delivers, flat out. It is able to charge my phone in under an hour. It is very small and lightweight for the 5000 mAh (miliamp) charge capacity it carries, and is not excessively bulky or weighty in a pocket, backpack, etc. The laser and LED flashlight are also excellent additions, great for presentations, etc. Overall a great product, 5 stars!
3975	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This was originally a good idea - connects easily.  However, it NEVER understands any dial commands so I'm unable to dial out without using my cell phone.  Plus the folks at the other end were not able to hear me very well - doesn't appear to be omitting background noise as advertised.  Very disappointed and will be returning.  Am going to use my Garmin GPS for my hands free...
-Limited Bluetooth (can't move files)
7110	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The mirror is cool but during the day it makes the screen harder to see.

3551	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Did not even stick for one full day.
2722	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Delivered in time for Christmas.  It is just as described; durable, doesn't add too much bulk and would add adequate drop protection.  The only negative would be that the lip going around the screen isn't that raised, so I'm not sure of the level of protection for the screen if dropped.  Other than that, an excellent value that looks quite sharp on the phone.
-This headset is cheaper than a Bluetooth headset and in fact comes bundled with some RAZR phones.
5008	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great

The only thing I found wrong with this phone is a flaw in the screen. There is a 3/8" black line of dead pixies about 2 rows wide. I kept the phone because I found nothing else wrong and it works ok. Too lazy to do the warranty return for such a small flaw since I'll scratch the screen sooner or later my self. I have noticed that the software on the three KRZR phones I've had and several others I've used all seem have slight differences in how some of the features  are setup, it just takes a little time to readjust. Over all the camera and size are just right. Good battery life.

Hey, it's May 1st 2009 and I am still using this. Charge lasts several days, it seems. Still ugly, still not really comfortable, I figured out that's because it's rather large. But, it continues to work well for me.
EDIT: The ear clip has broken. Now,  I have 2 that of these that I rotate on the charger and have not used them hardly at all for months so be aware of this issue with even light use. You can find clips but they are relatively expensive. I found 2 clips and they were almost half the price of this Bluetooth new. Also, when I contacted support at Jabra I got no reply so be aware of Jabra's customer "support".

Good purchase in my opinion and the price couldn't be beat.
Summary: More convenient than a wired headset, but with about the same range. Can't complain for the price.
6000	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Charged my phone to 100% and is convenient when you don't have your charger with you or an outlet nearby.
4170	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my third jawbone. The first was chewed up by the dog and the second my son has obtained... I can't give the product enough praise. I went as far as to mow my grass and still talk, my husband didn't know I was mowing the grass. This product is AWESOME!!!!!!
  - allows charging
This cable cost less than $3.00 + shipping from A1.  The at&t store wanted $39.95 and didn't have it in stock.
6637	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Initially bought for a large home surrounded by other large homes, I installed this unit to boost the signal while in half of this particular house. I often dropped calls prior to this in the various rooms of the house facing to the north side of the building. After installation I didn't drop a call at all. The product itself operates as designed and intended. However the issue arrises with the difficulty of installation. If you are using this, its likely you have a two story house. Therefore, you're headed to the roof to install the antenna portion if you expect to get good reception. I attempted to use this on an outside wall and got poor performance. Moving it to the roof made all the difference.

9872	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	very good
I would also like to see a built in outlet charger, although I love the smaller size of the product.

The single-button implementation of enabling the various functions (battery on, laser pointer on, flashlight on), while efficient, takes a bit of getting used to. I'm the type of person who simply assumes that I can figure out how most things work without needing to read the manuals, and most of the time that's true. I had to check the manual in order to figure out how to turn the flashlight on, but that's not really a big deal, as once I learned how to do it, I haven't had to look at the manual again. Ultimately, though, the primary function of this device is to serve as a backup battery, and getting it to work in that regard is a no-brainer, and it works flawlessly for that.

I use this to charge iPhone 6, iPad Air2, iPhone 5s, iPad2, KindleHDX, Beats headphones, LG Tone, Samsung Galaxy 5 and my Anker charger. I have transferred it to different cars, no problem. It doesn't get hot and is so reliable!
5) Instructions on how to set the thing up.  No tools are required and the setup is mostly intuitive.  There are some useful points though.

-  The compact size is excellent - not much bigger than a phone.
6358	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered the case. This case will not fit the Sprint Q9c phone w/ the extended battery.
Service from Elago Design was prompt and the item came as described.
4549	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It is sometimes hit or miss buying a cheap charger on amazon, but I actually re-ordered a couple of these because they work great and are so convenient. Charges fast. No tangled cord to deal with. And at this price, there's no need to shuffle one around everywhere - I have one in each of my family member's cars for when I ride with them, plus one in my travel bag.
3776	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I cut the cord off and hard-wired it into my truck.  It is just what I needed.  The usb jacks charge all of my iPhones / iPods / iPads and the standard 12v plugs are there for my handy vacuum cleaner!
I really could've used this during my overseas travel last month. Since

4559	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this charger for over one year.  I use it to charge a bluetooth earpiece, and an external battery for the iPhone.  I has worked well for me.
***********************************************
1496	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	First off, I must say that this is the only bluetooth earpiece i've ever used. So, I don't have much to compare it to. However, reviewing it independently, it is a great headset for the price. As long as you aren't in a noisy environment, you can hear clearly. And, the headset itself seems to pick up voice clearly. It will also pick up other little noises clearly... so be careful where you use it. lol It seems to filter out noises like wind well.

UPDATE Aug 21, 2010
This fixes that, and is flexible so it doesn't get screwed up bouncing around in my pocket.  A+++, would buy again.
The LiquidAUX would always pair successfully (as far as I could tell from looking at the blue LED on the device and the screen on my Blackberry) but frequently the connection would not work (ie. could not make or receive calls, or listen to music). I would have to pair again to get it to work.

3453	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really like this holder because of the price and construction.  It is not the TomTom holder which has other attributes but this works well enough for me.  It has a great suction cup and it stays in place helping me with the navigation. It is easy to put on the windshield and to take it out if you need to switch cars.  I can use it either with or without my iPhone's case.
9636	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	they work, not sure how long they will last though
7074	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I needed a new battery for my LG phone and looked up the size that fixes.  When I got this battery it was too small.  I don't know if they sent the wrong size or what but in any case I sent it back.
But do not call Sprint and expect to be sane afterwards. I can understand busy times and what not, but for the last couple months it seems as though they have cut their workforce in half and doing business with them is intolerable.
8081	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've been through a number of hands-free devices over the years.  I've bought and used 4 different Bluetooth headsets with varying degrees of success; some work, some don't.  I've had some decent headsets, but don't like wearing them and often forget them.  They've also been -- in my experience -- a little problematic to operate; some don't work with all phones, for example, and often you have to repeat pairing on a weekly basis to keep the device working with your phone.  Some have poor battery life.  Some have numerous accessories -- like charging stands and power supplies -- that make them really not that small or self-contained.  Then there's the fit issue, some of the ones that clip over your ear are uncomfortable, some of the ones that use an earbud to fit into your ear are too loose -- you get the picture...

4795	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It's cute but it broke on me the first day

5950	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love this product, and here is why.

  Someone on  quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment.


7991	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Get one of these!!!  i have the  A-747 Samsung phone from AT&T.  synced all my contacts from old phone via computer software, also can input and fix all address book entries.  Can use phone as a modem for laptop, and use phone as a mass storage device for all pics and music.
9831	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great!

I recently bought this bluetooth device, the sound quailty is great. There is no echo the person on the other end cant tell iam even useing a bluetooth. I love the feature of closeing it to turn it off and on very easy to use. I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a quality easy to use bluetooth device.

Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.
What I found was it takes a few tries to get the timing right to turn on the battery and not the flashlight.

Ideally though I'd like a cleaner installation and not putting an antenna on roof, wire through door, tape on the dash, etc.  But the performance is solid.  There is another model for multiple users in car you should consider as well as this is intended for a single user.

Tip:

My experience is dramatically different. Folks on the other end of the connection complain about the noise and poor voice quality EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is not useable. Very disappointed. Expected that my audio quality would be good and would be fun to use to listen to music. WRONG. What I heard was low volume and low fidelity. Not good for listening to music.
* The instructions say you shouldn't use these buds for working out, as they're not guaranteed sweat-proof.
Once applied it will keep your screen from scratching or collecting dust or grim directly to surface. You can even use a screen cleaner made for flatscreens to clean the side facing you.
7482	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	As soon as I saw this phone, I knew I had to get it. so I did and all I have to say is WOW. Awsome phone. It's small and thin, you can hardly tell you have a phone in your pocket. I went the unlocked version too, so all I had to do was just slip my sim card in it, and I was ready to roll!
It's good for one full charge but that's all you'll need in an emergency situation. I haven't checked how fast it looses it's charge but I hope it's able to sustain it for a reasonable period of time. All in all, a very handy tool.
- Solid Build Quality
9762	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
All in all, though, as a phone and for the deal offered at Amazon, I can certainly recommend it.
9002	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	New Trent IMP52D charger is sleek and well designed. The smaller size makes if convenient to carry in a briefcase, purse or "go bag" for emergencies or daily use. It would be well suited for the business traveler with the onboard laser pointer and the white LED. Don't be fooled by the smaller size. This charger does the job intended. I have owned and used a Mophie in the past and found the New Trent much quicker and longer lasting than the Mophie.
Pros/Features:
5188	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It took longer to take out of the package than to set it up with my phone.  Very easy, very intuitive - I barely looked at the instuctions.  Works great with my Sprint Touch phone, can skip back/ahead tracks, pause and take a call.  Love that I can use my own earbuds - I like to switch them out if I'm exercising so as not to mess up my good pair.
3015	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've tried so many Bluetooth headsets my office looks like a BT headset museum.  This set has the best range, best sound, & I can wear it with my glasses!  The down side is that I have to touch it every now & then to make sure it is still there because it is so comfortable.  I chew gum & it does not fall out.  People ask me how it stays in & I tell then that I had to have my ear threaded - LOL.  Get a spare in case you misplace it because you'll feel lost without your WEP 200.

PROS:
Apparently blue light 1 only illuminates when a device is connected AND the battery pack is on -
2993	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This particular unlocked version seems thinner than the ones being sold by cell phone carriers. My initial impression was this phone was very tiny. It is smaller than the RAZR V3 in overall dimensions. I use this unlocked phone with Cingular in the Los Angeles area.
9896	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	While they were easy to apply, as they had a tag attached to the front to allow for proper placement and even removal to adjust replacement.  Said tag left a sticky residue behind, which I had to carefully remove w/ goo-gone.  For the price, I can't complain too much.  I gave it two stars because I was able to reposition it twice, otherwise, it would have gotten one star.
* LED light - it is not very bright. In a very dark area, it will be enough to light up a very limited area close to the eyes, but not more than that. Yes, a brighter LED would drain the battery (when used), but it may not be a bad idea to increase the light output to make it more useful (user will use the light only when needed)

-Quick and easy to link and operate


Another thing that might turn ppl off with this phone is the way the letters show up on the screen when you text.
5005	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Works but poorly. If the wire moves the controls for volume and call get activated.
Pictures you take with the phone look pretty well (granted you have the prefect lighting) on the computer, but everything on its low resolution screen makes photos seemed washed out and blurry.
Durable
The instructions next suggest calling customer support.  I'll update this review if that proves to be helpful.

it's not too round. Feels great while your holding it. Does this affect
Just flip the little mouthpiece back on the earpiece part to turn off.
The only necessary talent is to observe where signal is strongest after consulting a map for transmission towers.
8120	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I don't like this. I wish it had another strap to wrap around bcuz my bed rises up, and all of my items fall off on the floor.
4216	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought a Jawbone about two months ago after seeing the early reviews and commercials about the noise reduction technology and designer styling. After constantly struggling to have it stay in my ear far enough to hear on it, I'm giving up. I've tried all the ear loops and earpiece attachments, even tried attaching an additional Jabra eargel I read about to help keep it in place and none of them help achieve a snug fit that will stay in my ear. As far as the styling, it seems big and clunky to me, sort of a good looking design in the box, but a bit goofy looking on the ear. I've just ordered my third Plantronics 510, (I lost one and broke one)which is still the best fitting, best performing, and most comfortable for all day wear and heavy use.
6646	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We spend 2 weeks in the UP of Michigan at a small home on a Lake outside of Michigan.  Typically we have no cell phone signal or at very sporadic signal.  Typically to get a signal we have to drive 20 minutes into town.  With the signal booster I always had at least one or two bars of signal.  I was able to make and receive phone calls which i had never been able to do before.
2) The power button is located all the way in the back and it's awkward and difficult to power on or off,  unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730
Cons:
7)  Music quality is as good as any other product I have ever used.

This charger also has the features of a red laser pointer, which is great for presentations and an LED light which always comes in handy.  I do however, wish that there were separate buttons or switches for these lights and that It would be not shared with the button to turn on the charger for actual charging.  The holding down of the button to go through the different features can get a bit annoying when I am just trying to charge my phone.
Great form factor, mediocre features, weak Mac support



Another Pro about this item is that it is easily interchangeable between left and right ear, so if you get tired of having it on one side during a long drive, you could easily flip it to the other side quickly (even while in the middle of a conversation!)
1515	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After using a low-end JABRA bluetooth for the past year, this Plantronics voyager is so welcome!  It paired easily with my phone and with the different ear cushions, you can have one custom for your ear canal.
3505	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It's an Otterbox Defender. It's the best case for your phone. It certainly ads some heft but I've had one of these on several different phones and never had a problem with dropping my phone. EVER.
2953	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Worst item I've ever purchased.  Brand new batteries wont' even fully charge my phone once.  Don't buy it.  The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it doesn't work worth a darn.
1112	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The one I received has the 'can' exposed on the outer ring (the "lip") so I had to cover it with electrical tape otherwise if it touched something else grounded, it blows the fuse (which is what happened to me). Also, the wire with the letters on them is negative, which is typically not the case. Other than that it worked fine.
3) Music player is unable to delete albums.  When deleting, the songs are deleted, but the albums remain which clutters the phone.  I get this error if I try to delete albums:  error: "General: Feature not supported"

7949	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This item was purchased to use with my portable speakers and Apple iPod while away on business or travel, it has worked out great.
Cons
1993	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've been using some form of Blackberry ever since the early days of the 950/957. This latest version is a great step up in terms of usability but really no huge functional differences from earlier models.


465	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Should note the smaller ring is what goes inside the groove to clip in.
6264	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Have been able to fully recharge my phone (HTC T-bolt) at least twice without having to recharge the New Trent, will probably come close or succeed at 3 recharges.  I would have preferred that the New Trent recharged itself from the USB connector rather than the round plug on the side but the self coiling connector cable  plus mini and micro tips work okay.  Also comes with a small pouch to store everything in.  About the size of a  pack of cigarettes but half as thick or less makes it easy enough to carry around.  So far so good. Seems to be a good value. No power supply provided so must recharge from a PC or charger with USB outlet, not a big deal for me and helps hold the cost down.
The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.
6923	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These batteries are so expensive when you buy them one by one.  Buying them on Amazon makes it easier to keep them around and more affordable.
1830	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've had 9 cell phones in the past 6 years, so I consider myself fairly knowledgable in this area.
If you have a phone or any other mobile device that charges via USB, you need this!
9695	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The batteries arrived ahead of schedule BUT after less than a week in my watch, the battery died out.
No noise at all. Good sound.
7715	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	So far it feels pretty good. I had purchased a different one previously and it was extremely slippery so I had to return it. I was leary about buying another but wanted one. This is comfortable in my hand and not slippery at all.
The iFuel is small enough to carry in your pocket. It even has the capacity to almost fill up my iPad as well as plenty of charges for my iPhone.

My iPhone contained 2% battery life when I plugged in the iTorch and began charging. After 1 hour 50 minutes with my phone still turned on and in use, my iPhone5 received a full charge. Once I confirmed the full charge, I noticed the iTorch showed one solid blue LED and one blinking, indicating a remaining capacity of 35%. I still had enough to charge my Bluetooth headset.
7961	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Did not work in Los Angeles due to too crowded FM channels.  Had to return it.

5320	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The best engineered case on the market for iPhone. CoZip really did their homework here! It fits iPhone perfectly and really enhances phone image while adding a layer of protection for back and sides of phone. I bought three colors, one for me, my wife and my daughter and all of us are ecstatic with the cases! This is the best case for iPhone. Way to go CoZip and Amazon!
* Real GPS! This is awesome. I've just started to tinker with the TeleNav software. I don't like the fact there is a monthly fee, but the turn-by-turn directions rival standalone navigation systems I've used. It's awesome but pricey. I'll start hunting for alternative navigation software.
buds are small enough and fit well into my hear holes that I can get my motorcycle helmet on and off with these in place without disturbing them! They aren't overly loud but loud enough to allow me to hear pavement engine and some traffic noise with the music turned up. Controls are easy for non-throttle hand to find and use once I figured out which button does what. Paired with my iPhone 6 quickly, and the only lack is a 'back' button to replay a song if you would want or a skip forward and back a bit to rehear an audiobook passage.
343	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Just got a new Galaxy S5 and 15 hours later I'm still at 82%!! And that's with all of the updating amd swapping of phones
once on they work great

8371	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I use the LiquidAUX with my Samsung Moment and it works great!  Each time I turn on the car it syncs within 10-15 seconds.  The steering wheel attachment is not too bad if you tighten it up well (can rotate a little if it's loose).  In the Moment you can select media profile and phone profile separately.  Since I use a Motorola H700 headset, I only selected the media profile; it will still stop the "radio" when a call comes in !!!
Conclusion:
-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.

3918	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This head is awesome. It takes 10 seconds to remove plastic aerator with needle nose pliers and you have yourself one of the strongest showers you have ever had

Good product for the price.
The firmware is now different.  Most people did not notice the change, but obviously I did because the phone I had was not working properly.  Now that the phone is working properly, I feel like I can give a proper phone review.  Lets start with the look and feel.  The phone is fairly bulky, but it is not heavy.  However, I wouldn't carry it in your pocket unless there is nothing else in your pocket.  The screen is larger than the original N95 and is nice to look at.  This however leaves the buttons a little small, but not to a fault for most.  The phone slides in two directions and feels sturdy in both positions.  The media position is nifty to quickly change songs without exiting applications you are using.  The battery life is good.  I have used the phone heavily for an entire day and still had a few bars left(listing to music all day, using gps, and making calls).  The camera on the phone is appealing at 5megapixels, but the poor flash makes taking pictures indoors or in other low light situations difficult.  The camera also makes a fake shutter sound that is a little annoying(can't make it silent in USA), but by no means is a deal breaker.  The camera also doubles as a video recorder which works at 30fps.  There is no lens cover for the camera and this can lead to scratches and having to clean off your lens before you take a picture.  If anything, it makes you feel a little uneasy when holding your phone.  It makes the phone look more sleek than the original N95, but i'm not sure it's worth it.  The internal phone GPS works, but connectivity can be spotty.  Once you get a signal it works fine, but this can take a while(5-10min.).  It's also important to know that this phone is only GPS "ready" in my opinion.  I say this because voice navigations costs about $150 for a 3 year subscription(Some third party GPS software is slowly becoming available, but is not quite ready yet).  One strong point is the large number of third party applications available.  There are literally hundreds of programs that allow you to do pretty much anything with your phone and the phone won't lagg out as long as you remember to exit applications after you are done with them.  The phone will work with Att and T-mobile, but as others have stated the 3G will not work and most likely will not work in the future(even when T-mobile USA expands their network).  If you need 3g--I wouldn't bank on it(USA).  This review might sound a little negative, but I just want to point out the things people need to know about the phone before buying it.  There are reviews of this phone all over the internet praising this phone and I just want to point out the things I wish I knew before buying it.  The negatives are not deal breakers.  I really do like it a lot and I am not going to return the phone.

Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use.

7006	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The concept is wonderful and of course, there will likely be bubbles to iron out but this just isn't a "pretty" product. Will it protect the screen from surface scratches? Yes. Will it stay on? For a little bit.

  Buy this if you want to look good.  Interior material and great design makes for ease of slide in and out of case.  I would use it if the bugger was bigger to hold the phone with my silicon case on.
It also has an "open to answer" feature... opening will automatically turn it on, connect to the phone, and answer the call.  It takes a couple seconds to do so, which is perfect, since it takes a couple of seconds to get the thing on your ear.

The Plastic Sleeve works great keeping your phone clean and dry. I accidently dropped in some water i was able to hurry up and get it, i took everything apart and phone was fine. Belt clip is good and strong, its cost more then all the other cases but it Protects better then all the other cases.

It could be that's not installed exactly the way it should be (re: not facing the right tower). It boosted my mobile stick perfectly, along with my cellphone signal BUT I was not able to use any data on my iPhone. The iPhone showed a full 5 bars but it was only good for making phones not surfing the web or using apps. Haven't used the booster for a month. I have to get up on the roof again and turn the booster in another direction and maybe it will work.

- Ugly shiny mic piece (photo on Amazon is not accurate, see customer images)
I listen to loads of audiobooks. Easily eight hours a day, as I do chores and such. If my husband is out of town and I keep listening into the night, I can hit, like, fifteen hours of audio in a day. So I needed some headphones that weren't going to die on me within a month, like all the $10 pairs I'd kept compromising on.
8169	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my daughter and when I asked her, she said this: "This works great. It's awesome. A life saver. I use it all the time. When I'm in the car and I'm down to one bar, I have an extra one before I get out."
After I do that, I need to synch the phone again, and it takes FOREVER to remove and clean up the inbox.

9040	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The unit is very nice looking out of the box, but the case seems to get scuffed / scratched very easily after some time in my backpack. I really like the small, compact, size of this device.  Even with the small size, this pack still charges my iPhone 5 well over two times - that's the main purpose, so you can't complain.  It's the most portable New Trent device that I own.  The on/off power button seems to stick a bit when you try to power the device on.  It will usually turn on the second attempt.  Would it be possible to improve this switch to allow it to slide back and forth?  I would rate this device a 4.5 out of 5, and the only complain being the power button.  This provides an excellent amount of power for $40.

Ease of use:  The Jabra is somewhat more intuitive with clearly marked volume buttons vs. Jawbone's one-direction volume loop (press and the volume goes up until it reaches maximum and the next press goes to minimum).  Other than this, however, the Jawbone is easy if your primary use is answering calls.  Some complain that the button is 'hard' to push and pushes the Jawbone into your ear but I have had no such issues.  It was immediately as natural and easy to use as the Jabra for me and I do not feel any pressure like I am impaling it into my ear!  No complaints here on either unit.

The seller is not at fault here, I actually received my item way ahead of schedule.  The sounds comes through really strange, like its an echo from inside a tin can.

The long and short of it. After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls, this is what we chose. I don't need the camera, but now you have no choice. With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones. Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.
I have had no problems with this blue tooth, so I have no reservations about recommending this product to others.
9996	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This "new" replacement battery I bought at Amazon.com and received from ZenithMobile is probably used as it held its charge for barely 48 hours with minimal usage.  Trying to contact ZenithMobile multiple times proved futile since they would not respond.  Finally, I complained to Amazon about it and they did reverse my charges for the battery.
-power plug is very unique and not the most reliable. Very easy to knock loose during charges



420	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very good works well.
Overall the bright screen and the slightly faster web browsing make this a really nice upgrade for anyone who is a serious BB user. Currently only one carrier is offering this phone, however search around and you can find services that will allow you to enter a number to open it up to other GSM based carriers (which is what I did) and make full use of their network and your existing plan/sim card.
I would give this joker 5 stars if it came with eargels like the etymotics but since I had to do that myself I gave it 4.

Verizon wanted to charge me $25 for the charger. Additionally the cord is a bit longer than most I have had before, which is nice when using it while plugged in.

7936	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Perfect purchase.  I used this adapter with my Spigen Galaxy S4 case:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B00G0CL2V8/dp/B00G0CL2V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B00G0CL2V8</a>&nbsp;in order to use some 3.5mm cables that could not otherwise fit through the case.  Note that a lot of the sellers of this adapter are located in Hong Kong and have a massive delivery wait time.  There is one located in New York that shipped the adapter promptly for only a dollar or so more.
The speaker is surprisingly clear. However, when I slide the phone into my back jeans pocket with the speaker slot facing me - I cannot hear it at all.  BUT - in any other position the speaker is quite loud and clear.
9275	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought two cases for my samsung i6l7.....and honestly this one is great.........leather is of good quality and it's made really well. Shipping was very fast too. Thank you
8412	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product and used it for something other than the iPhone or iPod and it worked great, at the time I was using an HTC phone. Perfect for car trips, makes everything so much easier and a lot safer.
846	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My second pair. First pair lasted 14 months of hard use. Probably got really wet and that caused them to fail. Excellent product and price. After using these can't imagine ever going back to wired headphones again. Also great for answering calls. Only minor complaint would be the volume could go louder but it's just about perfect.
Of importance is to note that the stock 4" antenna works decently, but aftermarket antennas (such as the most excellent Trucker OTR) really make this shine. It's also very limited on how well it can work with Sprint (no 2500MHz support due to FCC regs, part of the 1900MHz band used by Sprint falls outside of the booster's capabilities).
5473	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	With my Palm Pre being the gateway to my audio content, I was growing tired of using a cable to hook it up to my Bluetooth-less vehicle. This was the cheapest solution for my needs (new car or new stereo are both too pricey today), as I wasn't expecting to take many calls...especially after hearing the reviews regarding the mic. Installation was pretty easy. I already had a ground loop isolator and it worked well with the LiquidAUX. One aspect of the installation was getting the remote to work. It seems that my unit needed to have the spring tension increased, so I lifted the spring (it was relatively flat) up a bit. Its been working ever since (a week now).
The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say "say a command". Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.
Two added bonuses: laser pointer and flash light! I didn't expect either, but the laser pointer is very useful at work. I can't say I've really found a use for the flashlight, but it's a fun addition.
9952	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	price was right and works great....not for a cell phone but for another rechargeable battery use.  nice compact package for 1000mAH

8290	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I did not like the the case pouch case. It was made of plastic not leather.
TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you! With this fix, you will still be able to close your boom.
I got this case because I prefer to carry my phone in my pocket and I wanted a case that would protect the Chocolate's wheel control; this should work well for that. The detachable belt clip is a little lighter and cheaper than the cover iself, but will probably work out OK for my intended use of clipping the phone to my seatbelt. (I pull off the road to talk, though!) Otherwise, I carry my phone in my pocket. There is a connecting knob on the back of the case that protrudes a bit too much - it is there to connect the case to the belt clip.


This has come in extremely handy over and over.  I keep it in my purse at all times and have even let others use it with the extra adapters it comes with.  Everyone's been very impressed!
First of all the phone itself is excellent. both on and
2084	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	'I hate my treo' is a daily term I tend to say...often out loud in frustration.  I try to put in a simple calendar reminder...it crawls, or freezes.  I usually have the reset the phone once a day after it crashes.  The memory allocation is terrible.  Sometimes, just making a simple call is the hardest thing to do.  I hope I don't have to dial 911 with it...I fear it may take me a good minute for it to dial as I wait for this junk to catch up with itself.

6144	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	HELPFUL PRODUCT. GREAT PURCHASE. FORGET TO CHARGE PHONE SOMETIMES SO THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPS OUT FROM DAY TO DAY FOR SOMEONE CONSTANTLY ON THE GO
First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you don't even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.


769	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	fits in perfectly

2214	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am very impressed. My expectations of such devices is tempered and reasonable. Most of all it must work well - no crashes, good recpetion and ease of use. The OS seems to be rock solid - it handles errors and conflicts very well. In my large metro area on the east coast - the reception and coverage is excellent. Better than Cing. but nothing beats VZW from my experience. The device is reasonably fast even when it is not on the "EDGE". I was surprised that Rim had little and almost no customer support. Motorola will still talk to a customer and help. I found the BBFORUM to be very helpful. I never found the internet on cell phones to be of any use. On the 8700g the browser works very well with the usual exceptions. T Mobile rate plans make the BB reasonable to use when compared with very expensive plans of the other carriers. Overall very pleased. Amazon made the purchase fast and easy - had it in 2 days.
Don't see any functional and time delay.
7475	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	For the price, this case is worth it. The plastic seems a little cheap, and the paint job is not so good, bit it fits the phone well.

2489	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a much, much better headset than the old HS500. This has the BT 2.0 standard. It delivers better range (aka more than ten feet), great sound quality and works with more devices than anything i've seen in a similar price range. The battery life is great too.
Just received this battery, fits and looks like original, recognized as Lenovo battery, charged overnight and works great so far.  Not sure about battery life yet but looks good, at least the battery charge indicator shows 99% and app. 4hrs life remaining.  Have a house  full of laptops so these OEM equivalent batteries are a lifesaver.
1. Speakerphone has slightly squishy volume buttons.
The Palm Pre takes a MicroUSB connector, but more importantly needs a fast charger...This connecter is MicroUSB connector and appears to be wired so that it supports the quick charge.


One star because Amazon will not let me give it a lower vote.
8855	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This charger is a handy device to have when you are out and about and your phone is running low or any device with a usb cable to charge with is running low on battery power.
Adapter only for size or case.


Compared to the Iphone, I would say internet browsing is still a plus for the IPhone (touch screen that is bigger), However, you can get what you want from this phone when it comes to browsing the net. The Camera on the Iphone can not match this camera.
In winter it is so wonderful, as it is a ear protection in a cold and windy morning:-)
8752	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It seems a lot of people have reviewed this phone and many have complained, basically it stems from not even doing a bit of basic research before buying this phone.
3) Near the end of its charge audio quality suffers greatly - very static-y and cuts in and out.
2782	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Ordered this for my grandmothers phone and know she is rocking and rolling. The battery is a good quality and the phone charges well with it.

PROS -

It doesn't pick up my voice dials as well as the old.

When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.
Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.
Cons:
  4-5 bars (-66dBm)

The iTorch has a great hand feel. Immediately out of the box I noted the different from the other chargers I have used. The smaller design with smaller LEDs makes it not only functional, but aesthetically pleasing to both touch and sight. I look forward to the ability to keep my devices charged and ready by using this well made product.

  This would probably not work for a day of touring in Hawaii or a long cross country trip, but for around town and out clearing that vacant lot, it does the trick, hot or not.

1135	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The CyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Hub is a good hub. I would say that this is a good hub for connecting such devices as external hard drives, cd/dvd drives, flash drives, and hard drives to your computer. The hub is great for theses kind of devices. If you are connecting a smart phone or a tablet of some kind be aware that you will able to sync the device but not charge it. I found out while I could sync my iPhone 4S and my iPad 2, these devices would not charge while attached to the hub. Also I would say be aware that the lights on the hub do through out light at night. I don't mind this as it acts as a mini night light for me. I know some people may not like this but for me it does not bother me.  I would say for the price, this is a great deal.
7615	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Excellent service, product shipped pretty quickly and was packaged well so everything arrived intact. My only disappointment is that since I'm not an experienced relaxer buyer, (this was only my second purchase) I didn't realize the set was not complete. The package came with only Steps 2 and 4 of the process. The other steps should either be included in the package or buyers should be advised that they still need to get Step 1 (scalp protector) and Step 3 (post relaxing conditioner). It really is an inconvenience not being able to use right away. Other that everything was excellent.
6463	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am very happy with my Nokia N95 8GB phone.

iTorch provides 5V/1A output and is compatible with most phones (I used it on Note 2, DroidX, BlackBerry Bold, & iPhone4).  It also works with tablets, but tablets usually require 5V/2A input and takes longer with 5V/1A (1st gen Kindle Fire took over 4 hours to charge from 30%).  I tried with AC that provides 5V/1A output.  Difference was about 10 mins.  iTorch seems as nearly efficient as AC.
2158	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is truly one phone in the market which has almost everything you could want in terms of features and new technology. It is a mini pda with bluetooth, Wi-fi, mp3 player and camera and they all work perfectly. You can use Wi-fi anywhere without subscribing to any additional services. You can sync your contacts, calender etc. using activesync which just takes seconds to install. I've also tried the Mp3 player by putting a 1 GB mini sd card in the phone and using the latest Windows media player and the activesync, downloading songs on the phone was a breeze and the quality is great. The battery life is very good considering all that this phone does. It is also fairly light and small with a very sharp display. The only con for me were the small buttons, but, I didn't want to take away a star for that because of the overall value of this phone. If you don't require a  full fledged pda phone, you cannot go wrong with this one so give it a shot!
4012	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I picked this up for my Droid 3 after the RuggedQX did not fit my phone. It works well, but over time the beltloop has become a bit loose letting the case hang at an odd angle. I don't use the clip because I want to ensure my phone STAYS on my belt. I have had phones get peeled off my belt when brushing past an airplane seat while trying to juggle luggage or shift servers around.
So far, first impressions are:
764	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	PERFECT

4480	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	awesome product.  Listen to music and dial last number at the same time, sometimes by accident.  I have not figured out everything on this yet but it works well with the right phone or computer dongle.

It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)
7889	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Adapter works great with the different headphones that I have. Unlike the picture, this adapter actually supports stereo + microphone in case you have a stereo + microphone headset that you want to plug in there. I didn't find this useful since I didn't such a set to test out and if I did, I would get one that was already iPhone compatible.
1073	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pro's:
the analog audio adaptor is another plus, it can also be used with moto HT820 (same passcode)
Cingular is currently selling these for $45 with a service contract, and I would take that deal if I weren't able to get mine for a reasonable price.  Conversely, I'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment's privacy (people I have important business with know when it's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail, and when it's not.)

We use prepaid SIM chips, local for whatever country we are in, and just swap them out as we travel: they cost about [...] bucks/euros/pounds and come with that much prepaid credit: easy to recharge if more is needed, but we don't chat a lot, just calls for reservations and coordinating things, mostly.  Incoming calls are usually free with a local card, which allows use of long-distance callback services such as Tellestial offers for talking to the USA, which is convenient when we aren't in a WiFi area where we can use Skype.

Carefully peel up the corner of one of the sides with the air bubbles and peel the film back past the air bubbles, being careful not to touch the sticky part of the film.  Then let it go and the rigid film will re-apply itself to the screen with no air bubbles under it to the edge.  Repeat on the other side and you'll have few to no air bubbles under the film.  (You might have to repeat lifting it.)  Lifting the film will mar the corner of the film slightly where you lifted it but it's barely noticeable and the overall film will look very good on the finished product!


Here's the REAL deal with this phone.  I have a feisty five year old with whom I once nearly had a heart attack around when her sitter wasn't answering the phone after 15 calls.  My heart was in my feet with anxiety, fear, anger - you name it, I felt it.  What happened?  They simply went to do laundry and the sitter left her phone.  While that 10 minute period felt like an eternity, all was well, but what if something truly had happened?  How would my baby let me know?

There's also the usual selection of programs, like a calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc. The system also comes with a few game demos, none of which are particularly memorable.
All and all, this is a perfect replacement battery and the price was extremely reasonable.  I would highly recommend this battery from this supplier.
Battery life is good on all units.  I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard.  However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle.

I have several waterproof cases but none have a hard shell like the Pelican. My phone also fits in the case so I can use it to protect my phone also. The case is not that heavy so I can use it with a lanyard. Nice case.

_*Conclusions:*_ Dependable, Small, Light weight, Easy to carry...Love the size and feel. As always, love the little pouches New Trent  supplies for their chargers.  Would definitely carry for use with the camera, iPod Touch and iPhone 4S. If my daughter sees it, know she will make love to it for the laser light usage. In a pinch would carry for iPad3 and iPad Mini usage.
3046	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I was slightly wary of the unit based on some of the reviews, but it worked quite fine for me. As indicated elsewhere, just read the directions carefully as you're connecting it to your aftermarket radio harness. I find that labeling the connectors with a Sharpie and going through the motions first are beneficial before you start soldering.
Pros
119	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.
Tip: Screens are washable. Just allow it to dry completely and re-apply. It won't last quite as long during the second application, but it will extend its life a bit more.

I have a metal roof so I mounted the antenna inside an open attic vent on the side of the house facing the cell tower, I ran the coax wire through a small hole I made in the ceiling, along the corner of the wall, to the booster and set the antenna up as described in the easy to follow instructions. The white coax makes a crude install almost unnoticeable, this is good, as I didn't want it to look like a mess.
1483	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Yeah, it's bulky. Yeah, it is slightly noisy on the other end if there is a breeze or the interior of the car if you're on the freeway, but what kind of a headset is going to do well in those circumstances? Maybe if you spend $100? I don't know. For $40 this thing is great. If I turn it on and use the iPhone to make a call, the phone gives me an option to use the headset or the phone mic. Just tap "headset" on the screen and you're ready to go. Couldn't be easier.

The unit I bought only came with one earpiece (which I think was large) but they resemble a standard earbud-style headphone. A grill in the middle with a rubber surround. This was very painful and I could only wear the headset for a few minutes at a time. I decided to buy a Moto H15 instead (big mistake!) and found that one of its earpieces could be stretched to fit my Z9. The piece I found was solid rubber, considerably smaller and had a lobe that kind-of stuck into the ear canal. I still couldn't wear the headset all day or anything but I could wear it for an hour or two before it became unbearable.
UPDATE 8/5/2009: Just stopped working, with no warning.  Out of warranty, unfortunately.

A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall.

It's easy to use, comfortable, good volume, and the battery lasts a long time. People have no problem hearing when I speak at a normal volume. What more could I want.
TOTALLY FAILED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF USE! First it said it needed a charge right after it was charged overnight, then it just died.  No lights, no nothing.

I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle.  As previously speculated, I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that, more often than not, my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.
(1)  Greatly reduces disconnects and drop-outs;

I initially tried the included pouch, Otterbox case, and the Seidio snap-on case.  For various reasons, I ended up with the rubberized skin as my "case" of choice.  It's simple to remove and put on, has all the proper cutouts for the controls, camera and charging port.  It provides a better grip than without it, but does pick up lint and debris.  The reason I got the dark grey over the black is that the lint does not show up as much as it does on the black.

4808	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this cute model by eBay two months ago for my 9 year old daughter, and is excellent cellphone controlled by parents, She can just call the list of people I add to the contact list + 911. It has excellent reception with AT&T (h2o wireless pre-pay) $10 every 90 days. Good for my budget too.
Update: After owning it for 5 months, the above still stands, but I have found one small annoyance. Every once in a while, when the phone starts to run slow, you have to pull the battery to reboot the Blackberry. This involves pulling it completely out of the case and then re-inserting it into the case, which is about a 5 minute procedure to get it perfectly lined up and with no dust under the screen protector.

3771	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I wanted something to add power outlets to my older honda odyssey, which originally had only one switched outlet in the front.  This offered everything I was looking for and more.  The fuse for this is in the main unit, not in the DC plug, so the plug can be cut off to allow hard wiring this unit to the vehicle.  Besides giving me 2 always on DC outlets, this also gave me 2 USB charging ports, eliminating the need for the dc to usb power adapter I had been using.  I couldn't be happier with it.

2717	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Nokia enhances their S40 interface with Version 3 and I am very pleased with it. The push-to-open button on the side is handy and both screens are beautiful. The camera at 1.3 megapixels works well for this phone, but I would recommend buying a Micro SD card for storing more than just a few, as internal memory is limited. Works great as a Bluetooth modem with EDGE service on T-Moblie using both Macs and PCs. My only complaint with this device is audio quality, as there are occasional pops and clicks. Other than that, it's a good phone overall.

The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.
5308	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Not at all as described. Didn't even look like pictures. Extremely flimsy. I could just image it would dent very easily. I returned with no problem. It was cheap, but still not worth the few dollars.

INTOLERABLE
Now just so everyone knows, this device can charge ANYTHING that has a USB cable that can plug into it.  iPad's, Android tablets, Bluetooth headsets, etc.  Just be weary that this device pushes 1amp.  Some devices only need 500ma, or others need 2amps.  Keep that in mind in the speed that your devices will charge.  Also know that if you have a device that only takes 500ma and you plug in the 1amp, you run the risk of damaging the devices battery (not the iTorch) and/or the device itself.

3. Feels well built, as are most things Nokia makes; won't break easily
With the Apple earbuds, the headset's connector and too-short strain relief disappear almost completely within the bottom of the battery case, so that when you want to remove the headset you have to pull on the skinny cord.  Almost a sure bet the headset cord will fail if you use your headset a lot.
2432	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really do like the case for my Bluetooth.  It fits my bluetooth like a glove and helps keep it really nice and safe also from misplacing my bluetooth if I remember to put it in the case. I keep it in my car or my front pocket in my purse.

For this to work for you:
5089	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I just bought 2 of these to upgrade my wife's phone and mine from a V3 and a V557.  What a difference!  Lots of features: mp3, video, 1.3mp camera, etc. I found a shareware video converter online and have put some videos onto the 1G microSD card (be sure to get a microSD card for it).  It plays great and landscapes to use the whole screen.  Another must:  If you're going to use the internet and video features of this phone, be sure to get an unlimited data plan, or you'll be paying a bundle.  I used 15MB+ the first day on mine just playing around with it.  Even with the unlimited data plan, be careful - using some features (XM radio mobile, HBO, etc) will be billed as content.  Overall a great phone and easy to use after a couple hours learning all the features and menus.
-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.

648	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this sticky pad in the spring (April 2006, I believe) and through no over-use on my part it has now lost its stickiness and is very ineffective.

1585	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The reason to get this headset is comfort. It's bulkier than most headset, but it is sooo comfortable. Sometimes i forget i'm wearing it, which is really geeky. I think the call quality is pretty good. and the multipoint connection is useful. I have a personal and a work cell phone and it connects to both. but sometimes it looses connection to one and it's hard to realize that when i'm driving.
1604	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This works well and is comfortable, vs the couple of MOT headsets I bought, which were horible. The volume level is good for me, and I have hearing loss, so that's impressive as well. The contols are easy to use. I'm using this with an older MOT V330. Highly recommended for both the performance and price. Oh, contrary to another reviewers suggestion, it will not fit into a mint tin due to it's width. I haven't found a good hard-case solution for it yet.

6853	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Exact size that I need.
6215	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am one of those annoying people who is glued to his iPhone.  Some of you may be the same.  I not only do remote tech support and am required to have my phone on 24/7, but I also attend a lot of things that bore me.  And when I'm bored, I turn to my phone for news and games.  And sometimes the juice runs out, and that's trouble.  Enter the iTorch.  This thing rocks!  It's small, which is very important.  If you've already got your phone and car keys in your pockets, the last thing you need is to be over-encumbered.  It's much smaller than the iPhone, and it's nice and sleek.
2.  the sound quality is not so great.  It's not loud enough, even on the loudest setting.

4720	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this case after dropping my 8830 a few too many times.  It was easy to use, goes on and comes off in a snap.  It even made it through a little bit of water without destroying my phone.
Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.
4292	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am now on my second one of these (my first was stolen).  It does exactly what it advertises.  I can hear the caller clearly and I have been told my voice comes across well.  I also like the fact i can play my ipod and iphone through my radio without an extra cord or other mechanism.  The music volume is automatically lowered when a phone call comes in and the incoming number is announced making this a true "hands free" device.
The flashlight and the laser pointer are a few extra fun perks and you can use it to show off to your friends.  It's useful at times when you really do need a flashlight and since I always have the iTorch with me now, I can easily whip it out of my purse and use its flashlight.
Update: the IMP52D will fully recharge a depleted battery (1420 mAh) on my iPhone 4 twice before needing a recharge itself - when I attempted to recharge my iPhone a third time, the IMP52D was able to raise the charge from 15% to 25% before it quit - also, it takes the IMP52D about an hour to recharge my iPhone -
Get this piece at a great price here on Amazon.
The seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
Unless you consider this one.
It took me over an hour to install.  It's unwieldy and a little heavy (which is fine - this thing seems built to stop a very big dog from ruining your back seat, and I suspect it would), and I thought a lot of pieces were missing initially.  Turns out the thing comes partially assembled, just to mess with you (?).

Don't believe the naysayers on this board.  The RAZR is cool and after the recent firmware fix, it now works better than ever.
Well I had to try it as soon as I got it, it had enough juice to turn on so of course I was going to use it. At first I didn't figure out how to link it up with my Sony Ericsson K550i. I didn't really understand what the instructions meant. But it was really simple, to put it in pairing mode you hold the muti-function button until the blue LED light stays on constantly, no blinking, I would wait only aprox time so it didn't work, it just turned on the headpiece. Well I finally just head it down and didn't keep count and the the Blue LED stayed on. Went into my setting on my phone, searched for bluetooth devices, found it and connected with it. added into bluetooth applications too. So when I turn on this it automatically connects to my phone.
5620	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Worked as expected. Not much to say other than that.
4277	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	As usual, still have not found a Bluetooth that at least has me sounding good on the other line. It did work great while I sat parked somewhere but while driving, forget about it. At this time, I am using a Ford Transit and it doesn't work well but maybe on a nice quite car it may work fine for you. I also had problems with the Bluetooth connecting automatically because every time I got back in the van, I had to reconnect my iPhone 6. Longevity of the battery was never tested because I made 2 phone calls with it and I sounded miserable where people on the other end couldn't understand me due to road noise.

 - main call button is very difficult to press
1212	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I recently got my first Bluetooth phone and based on a few reviews I read online and the recommendation of the phone-store owner I picked this headset. I use it with a Motorola Razr. They work together quite well. This is an ear-bud type headset meaning it's slightly less comfortable but far more stable and better sounding than the flat ones. If there were a warning with this headset it would be not to buy it online. Mine came, in a sealed package, with the wrong power adapter. It was very easy to remedy this in the phone store, but would have been difficult had I bought it online.
Positives: The ear hook, once you get used to it, keeps the headset firmly on your ear, and (again, for me) is easily wearable for long periods of time.

3893	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This thing is amazing, the whole family was amazed after switching from a normal "water conserving" shower head to this thing.  What an amazing difference!  Easy to install.

Keyboard is great.
5346	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is one tough case.  A little heavy, but it really protects the phone.  I dropped mine off a combine onto the concrete and scuffed the case but didn't hurt the phone.  I have also had a cup of beer dumped on me and all it did to the phone was make the trackball a little sticky for a couple of days.  Great case for people with dirty hobbies or jobs.
4306	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Ok, for the purpose of full disclosure, the negatives first. The earpiece needs work - BlueAnt can take lessons from Plantronics there. The earpiece unthreaded itself and disappeared within the first week or so. Good news is that I called BlueAnt and they mailed me a replacement the same day. No charge :)

The only thing one must watch out for is the bubbling if the screen is put on carelessly.  This is really annoying.  An excellent product that only misses 5 stars due to the price for something so simple and inexpensive to make and distribute.

8727	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this to replace my ball that was lost when I dropped my phone. The replacement ball did not work very well. It took forever for it to respond to motion in any direction (up, down, left, or right), and if it did respond it would move just one space/item and then you are stuck again trying to get it to move more. Needless to say I ended up purchasing a new Blackberry Curve, this time with the touch pad instead of the trackball.
9842	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good batts, can't quite figure out why they come in fives, when most watches only use four, but that would be a buns vs hot dogs type of question, huh? These always work in my Casio ProTrek.

8159	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great!  Haven't had a problem with this charger.  Used it when my wall chargers weren't working.  Overall for the cost it was a good buy.
The phone has several nifty features, including a 2 megapixel camera that takes good-to-very-good quality pictures. It can also function as a video camera, doing both sound and image. There's no flash or self-portrait mirror, but you can make do. The screen acts as a view finder, of course. There's also four different levels of zoom and several different video effects (like black and white, negative, false color, etc). There's a nifty little mini-USB port you can use to move your files to a computer (assuming you have a cable. Thankfully the phone comes with one).
Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.
3946	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back.

Heed the warnings about making sure your screen is totally clean before applying.  I usually apply the sheet before cutting it then I get a sharp x-acto knife and cut the sides by running along the crease between the case and glass (obviously with a light pressure).  Corners are a little trickier and each device has it's own tricks to cutting the corners.  Regarding air bubble - Even if you get a small air bubble under the screen it will still work, and you can't see them after the device is on.


Pros:
BTW, this is unit #2. Ordered one a few months ago. Returned it for the same reasons. Not usable. Very poor audio performance. Thought it was a unit failure. So tried ordering it again. No such luck. Keep looking. There are bound to be better out there.
3233	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The phone seems very sturdy.  It has a nice industrial design.  The firmware is OK at best, and it takes more clicks to get anywhere than my kids' nokia.  That got it a star above 1.  The software that I had to buy separately was totally inadequate.  First of all, it goes out to sync and downloads 30 MB's of s/w and says its up to date, but it still won't sync.  After reading their website, I download some more s/w to reinstall the drivers.  NOTHING WORKS.  I call them and they say that there's a new version that works w/ this phone.
The installation of the weBoost Drive Cell Phone Booster Kit is very easy:  place the magnet-mount antenna on the car roof, run the cable in through the door and attach it to the unit, then attach the power cord and plug it into the car's lighter outlet. My HTC One M8 phone, at 3-1/6 inches wide including Otterbox case, just barely fit into the unit's cradle, which must be used.
SUMMARY
1046	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to measure the radiation coming from my phone and microwave. It worked great and I found out I need to be about 5 feet away from my microwave to not get any radiation. And for my phone, it just spikes when a call comes through or when a text comes in or out.
Price is way too high.

2. I had an easy install since I already had a hole in the ceiling from installing a network cable, so it was easy to thread the cable up to the first floor. If you needed to create a new hole in your ceiling and floor, maybe not so easy.
Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.
2997	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is not a nice looking product but it does what it's supposed to do.  Lights up to let you know it's actually working or connected to a power source.  No complaints.  It is what it is.

4471	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too. This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....
3) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising (unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730)
7850	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I keep this adaptor connected to the end of my expensive headphones so that I can use them on my iPhone without taking my case off. I have tried hard to listen for noise or distortion by adding this adaptor, and even on $300 headphones on which I am able to hear nuance in recordings that are lost to my earbuds I cannot hear any difference. Very nice for a very low price.

4560	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I can't really say I dislike the cable or anything, but wanted to inform you that Cables Unlimited put a Micro A cable in the package even though it's labeled Micro B. I just emailed them for an RMA, which hopefully will go thru fine, but still I am going to have to pay to ship it back to them and then wait at least a week before I receive the correct cable. Meanwhile, I will have to get under my driver's seat and plug in my only Micro B USB cable to my car-puter in my WRX to charge my LG Dare phone on my road trip, then get back under my seat and unplug the cable and take it inside if I need to charge the phone while at my destination. Overall, an amateurish mistake, especially for a company that specializes in cables (Cables Unlimited) and one of the only actual Micro USB cables on amazon.com (you might see another one made my Zen that says Micro USB but it's actually just mini USB).
7523	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This product look great out of the box but a month later the nylon loops that hold the clip and the belt loop is unraveling and  part of the nylon is loose and flapping. this won't last another month.

9956	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertized.
4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.

5759	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Seems to be long lasting so far, having used it 3 months, and the price was great! Looked new and genuine oem.
8209	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Perfect size.
5023	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	These are single channel audio. it will not allow sound from both channels. It would be good if they were removed from the site because they are not a compatable with apple iPhone for audio and therefore false advertising. It will not play full audio and it is not compatable with accessories.

4326	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have a treo 680 and I have never been "wowed" with any bluetooth headset.  This is my third, and I noticed a significant difference in the quality.  I drive a lot of highway miles, and I needed something to reduce wind noise at 80mph.  The packaging is impressive, and after reading the reviews on [...] that thought the "one button" control was confusing, I was able to use it right away.  On the freeway, others could faintly hear wind noise and road noise, but it was a significant improvement on other $100 models I had tried recently.  Three days into my trial, I realized how to turn on "voice isolation max", which is the maximum noise cancelation, and there was again a significant difference.  Wind noise was compleatly gone at 80mph, but when comparing and contrasting between the two settings, people said I sounded a little more distant with voice isolation max- but still very good.  I also noticed that at home, I could put the phone in the charger and walk into several different rooms and still use the headset- something other headsets faltered with.  I am very happy with this purchase- I love the packaging, the design, the charger (it actually says it's for the blueant on the charger, so it doesn't get confused with other chargers laying around), and I would highly recommend it to anyone else wanting to be safer on the road.
3032	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	If I have to buy an extra speaker to be able to hear OnStar instead of it going through the factory speakers this thing is pointless.
770	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works like a charm, solid, robust, heavy duty. No issues with 100+ watts of draw. Highly recommend!
8687	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great holster, so far has been solid and the auto shutoff function has worked consistently. Only quibble - the metal "Blackberry" logo came off. I super-glued it back on, and all is good.
I'm disappointed that this listing is not more clear on that fact.

7567	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Unfortunately this product has some design flaws that make it a poor product. First time I wore it, I got caught on the side of my car door frame getting in the car (am left handed so wear it on left hip). The belt clip part for all it's good looking strength ripped from the holster in such a way that the case now hangs away from the case. the pouch fits my phone with protective case well and the phone slides in and out easily and is well constructed. The belt clip portion is not.

4853	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Many other folks have talked about all the different features of this unit, so here's my concise list of what I like about it:
  I had been using a wired headset for so many years, and maybe my expectation was higher because of that.

- Volume was too low when using the earhook.  I took the hook off and shoved it in my ear. Problem solved.
I purchased 10 cables and none of them work. I tried returning the cables and have received an email stating, "So-cool has closed the return request listed below" and the reason, "Solved a technical issue".
I had called tech support and he did say they having some issues with the iphone 4 so there was nothing he could do about it. He was a bit condescending and tried to tell me it was because of the type of bluetooth in the iphone. I checked it and sure looks to me to be the identical 2.1 version.
The 1 megapixel camera will sometimes come in handy when I don't have my real camera with me. The quality is on par for mobile phones, but not comparable to using a dedicated camera.
The only thing I'm wondering is to see a USB cable to our Nokia phones that allows communication with computer **and** charging phone.
2209	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It works well with my black Razr v3.  A little tricky to put on but not too bad.
The Wilson Signal booster took 10 easy minutes to hook up AND B O O M!----2 bars where we had 0 to 1 for the last 2 years. The joy of getting calls, and sending and receiving texts without having to run into a good stop -OR- run outside is awesome...2 hundred bucks and some change...I would pay 2 grand had I known HOW Great this Booster works,...before I wasted So much time fooling around with all the other junk out there...
A 2 Second Hold Click of the single button turns the charging battery pack on and off - blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate the current level of charge - when I first received the IMP52D, only blue light 2 would illuminate - after a few hours of charging all 3 (blue lights 2, 3 & 4) illuminate when I turn the battery pack on

  -It houses games too - who knew.
hesitation.  Hope this helps.
This neat little system really cleaned things up. Now we have one cable instead of a bunch, and the unit itself is quite attractive, with blue LED lights softly glowing. Although it has a travel case, I don't think I will bring it on travel. It comes with a set of tips for different devices. The only downside is that I still had to go and buy a couple of tips separately, at around $10 each. This can add up over time, but I have the same problem with my iGo travel charger and don't see any way around it. Overall a clever solution to clean up clutter.

1028	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime
1788	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I had the RAZR (pink) for 2 days and the phone started a low pitched buzzing noise whenever it was on. I got a replacement and the 2nd phone started buzzing after another day. The salesperson said they have had problems with this phone and thought they (Cingular)had returned all the problem phones. Guess not. Now I have to exchange this one too. What a hassle. One the bright side, it has very long battery life and pretty sleek looking.

747	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	good quality
1613	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've never written a review in my life, but I love this headset so much that I thought it was time I did. This was my first bluetooth headset after using wired headsets with my PPC 6700. With MS voice command, I just press the button and say "call Rob at home" or "dial 206-343-xxxx" or even "play music". I absolutely love it. It is lightweight, has long battery life, I can hear clearly, and other people can hear me clearly.  Range is about 25 feet, but I always have my phone in my pocket, so not a problem. I don't wear it unless I have a call, otherwise, I put it in my pocket, and haven't had any problems, it is very flexible. I've read some complaints about the buttons being too small, I have not found this to be a problem. Granted, the power button is small, but you only have to turn it on once in the morning. I'll have to admit though, I have small hands, persons with bigger paws might have an issue with this. I recommend this headset without hesitation.

9739	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	A good battery

4780	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I had this phone for almost a year. Phone performs perfect as a phone. As an intertainment device is rather dull. Speaker sound is mediocre. Camera quality is low, similar to iPhone. I replaced it with Nokia E71 this January - definetely an improvement. Though most of functionality of E71 exists on this phone and it is smaller and a lot cheaper!
Actually, I just wanted an unactivated card to get an iPhone running.
8208	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Not at all as described. Didn't even look like pictures. Extremely flimsy. I could just image it would dent very easily. I returned with no problem. It was cheap, but still not worth the few dollars.
The volume is a little low and it appears that every time you shut it off to recharge, the volume resets to its default middle level. I always have to crank it up to its highest level since it fits rather loosely.
4. Battery retains charge for quite long time, depending on your talk time.
Small size
9130	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	So I bought this extra battery to charge my iPhone 4S and my iPad 2. I expected to get one maybe two charges out of it. Now granted I did not have a fully drained device when I charged them, but even so my experience with other batteries has been that they don't last but one or two charges.  Another trait of the other batteries is that they don't hold a charge very well, i.e. if you don't use them often then tend to die fast. This battery lasts just fine.
If compact size is important to you and you have a smaller device that only requires a 1A charge, this is a very practical mobile charger for you.
The Jabra also pairs almost instantaneously; it beeps to confirm this, usually within 2 seconds of me "waking" my iPhone. It's almost exactly the same size as an iPhone (but slightly smaller), which makes it very convenient to travel with.
PROS:

  Speedtest: 230ms ping, .4 - .55 Mbps data transfer
- comfortable

Crystal clear sound, but must have been defective as batteried lasted about 15 minutes. Returned it.
Camera Feature- This camera is a 2 megapixel camera which puts out very decent pictures and the flash is very bright for just 1 LED light.  For the upgraded software there is a video feature for the phone but there is a problem with the feature.  If you don't have a memory card you won't be able to use the video feature because you get a message saying " To record a video, insert a formatted media card.  Then there is digital zoom in the phone which works pretty good and unlike most digital zoom out there you don't to really worry about blurred pictures if u move during the time your taking the picture.  I would give it 5 stars.



1172	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.
I initially purchased this to put louder ringtones on my Nokia 6085, but will be using it for more in the future because it is so easy to use.  One end connects to the fitting at the bottom end
4453	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It fits the RAZR just like the original battery made by Motorola.  It worked perfectly for me as a second battery for those days when it is just too much effort to find the charger.
9455	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	As always, Amazon is amazing in making returns and high customer satisfaction. My problem is not with them, but this device. It simply DOES NOT WORK. I contacted weBoost expert technical support and verified that everything was installed and operating properly. I have my phone set to show db numbers, not bars, and there was virtually NO CHANGE in the signal. Not even 1 single db boost. I bought the additional 12" antenna and tried both the supplied and additional antennas, but it made no difference whatsoever. I have a Dodge Mega Cab truck with a metal-roof ground plane the size of most entire vehicles, so that was definitely not the problem either.
Pros:

1443	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The last Bluetooth headset I used was a Motorola something-or-the-other, and frankly I was underwhelmed. A few years later, I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Plantronics-Voyager-510-Bluetooth-Headset-Retail-Packaging/dp/B0009B0IX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging</a>], and it was amazing. For the most part, people can't tell that I'm on a Bluetooth headset!
However, the most outstanding features are its size (ver, very small) and the flip-out boom, which also operates as an on-off switch.  When the boom is extended, the phone connects very quickly--no need to answer then switch to the headset. This feature can make the battery last for days.

The keyboard is really small so it's not the easiest to type messages.  I had to get a replacement after 3 months because the roller stopped working.


Thank you so much.
8567	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When I went to the local Sprint store, they informed me that there were no iGo tips available for the Pre.

440	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Product was kind of difficult to understand how to use, but it gets the job done, and I guess that's the most important part.
4198	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this headset with high expectations.  I took my time.  I compared and contrasted.  I read all the reviews.  I thought I had made a great purchase.
2934	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Sorry amazon, this is my first dissapointed review at amazon. there are 2 d&g as anne said, black and gold which is the limited edition one and the mass production one, i just bought this one but unfortunately its not in a perfect or new condition some dirt on it, the color is faded and is almost gone from the side buttons, doesnt close welland a white label inside the body trying to cover the original fone information, the assemblying is very poor, i love motorola, never had this problem, please be aware of thi, i think it's refabrished or something, missing features, buttom line DONT BUY IT FROM HERE i would sell mine for 10$ without shipping however i just got today.:S

So, I would definitely recommend it!
-Charges my dead iPhone 2x's while using the phone, probably more if I didn't use (surfing, talking, etc) it while charging.
For families like mine that have lots of portable electronics and someone undoubtedly needs a charge and left their charger at home this is an almost must have and at the price it was a no brainer for me.
1747	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have both grey and black version now
7667	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to replace my wife's Sony slider.  She really loved her RAZR and never warmed up to the slider.  I did a ton of research and this phone has great reviews from everyone.  I initiall ordered it from Cellular Blowout.  What a nightmare.  The order was cancelled, thank God.  I wised up and ordered through Amazon.  Fast and dependable as always.
I really like the iTorch. I would rate it overall 5/5. The pro's are it's convenient, portable, consistent with its charging. I love that it fits in a coat pocket. I don't use the flashlight much I use my iphone for that. The LED I use to play with my cats-they give it a 5/5.
4152	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Very good sound quality, battery life, although ear piece not as comfortable as it could be.  Excellent product.
2703	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The Boxwave Kindle Fire Bodysuit fits the Kindle Fire just right. It slips on easy, all the ports are open and available. The slim-fit body suit does well to offer a better grip of your Kindle Fire and some modest protection against bumps and scratches. The translucent blue color is attractive. Price wise, it is a great buy.
3391	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Cable works, makes small but needed difference for HD TVs.  You MUST change Wii settings to 480p to get increased picture quality.

2485	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my second H350 and both work great. Not recommended in a noisey environment. You will forget you have it on your ear at times.

5760	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this item from Amazon.com. Item was as described and works just fine. I suspect the battery life will get longer as I re-charge it.
3329	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Nice
8774	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this and my husband bought the same for his EnV. They both fell apart inside of a month. The screw that holds the clip to the phone endlessly comes lose,causing the phone to fall right off. The only reason I gave it any stars is that the case is strong enough that the phones didn't break the many times they fell out. I think we have the answer to the above review asking how long the case will last......
3347	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It really show Wii HD on my LG TV. Excellent and cheap choice. Two week and keep working well.

I have had it for a good year or two now, and it is still going strong. I am a college student and definitely am on my electronic devices a lot, and carrying this around in my backpack has saved me many times. I can charge my phone and friends' phones from my backpack in the middle of class. I get about 2.5 charges on my iPhone 5 from the charger. I plug it in to charge when I go to sleep and it is fully charged by the time I wake up, using just a 1 Amp charger brick.

1944	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This A2DP bluetooth headphone is excellent.  When listening to music I hear instruments that I don't hear on my home or car system and this headphone has awed every friend or co-worker that has tried it on and listened to it.  It is very functional (provided you are right handed) with almost any accessory that you need already included including a hard case to carry it all in and a dongle to use with any headphone out jack.  Sound is awesome whether it comes from my phone, PC, or TV.  Another plus is that Plantronics seems to be using a common charge port for their different bluetooth products.  You have the ability to charge this using AC or via USB with both charger cords included.  The phone functions are great too.  People I have talked to on this headphone say it sounds nearly as good as speaking right into the phone. It also comes with a charging stand to use at home or work. You won't be disappointed unless you hate the style and color.  I've used Plantronics headsets in the television industry since the 70's and based on past experience knew I was buying a quality product.
8367	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These items fit the stylus pens so well that I can attach the pens then attach it to the android I have. I won't have to worry about losing my stylus pen.

6309	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have tried other bluetooth devices and always had ear pain resulting in little use. This device, the Motorola H710 Bluetooth Mono headset,is comfortable,no ear bud to cause canal pain, and very good audio. For those reasons, I use the product most of the time. I highly recommend this for all that have problems with the ear insertion.
This is the phone if you don't want something bulky but don't want emails to pile up that you could quickly respond to throughout the day. Blackberry email is the easiest to set up, it works the best, and this a fantastic and fast phone overall.

Not sure how it works to keep the garlic longer just yet but will update you as soon as I know.  Either way I'll still use it because it's just that good looking and very sturdy/well made.
All I was looking for was something small and light for one complete charge on my iPhone 5. So far, this charged my iPhone from 1% to 100% TWICE (once while phone was on, once while off for about 80% of the charging). I still have 1 light on the battery pack, so I bet I can get at least another 50% charge out of it.

1335	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've used this Speaker phone with both my Motorola V3 and Sony Ericsson phones and it works nicely. It is much louder and much clearer then the speaker function on the V3. I had no issues hearing and understanding people when traveling in my Tacoma at freeway speeds with the windows up. In my Miata convertible I can also hear most people decently with the top up, but some soft spoken people were difficult to hear at freeway speeds over the road noise. I must add that my Miata is a fairly noisy car, in most cars you will not have any problems hearing. Most people I talked to on it did not notice they were on a speaker phone. I did not try any voice dialing fratures, but those are really functions of the phone and not this product.

1) Doesn't fit very snuggly around the ears. I've tried testing it by shaking my head slowly, and if you don't find that "sweet spot," it will flop around your ears. You will definitely not be able to jog or move any faster than a power walk with this on.

8230	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My wife installed this in her 2011 Porsche Cayenne.  It went easily and she commented it was of good quality.  Installation is best with 2 people as it's otherwise awkward in adjusting the height.  I have 2 Samoyeds and one of them is a chewer:(.  So... the knobs were chewed on the first day but they've survived and fortunately my dog seems to have stopped chewing on them.  The barrier works perfectly in keeping the dogs in the trunk area of the SUV.  I also liked that it's not attached to the seats which allow you to occasionally lower the seats to carry skis and/or other big stuff.  5 stars.

882	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Wasn't sure if these would meet my goals but they come 90% to what I'd hoped for. They are comfortable to wear, the cords haven't caught on anything yet (like ipod buds will) and once I got the right size ends they sealed out the outside sound to a large degree and gave greater volume. I have old timers tinnitus and high freq hearing loss so cannot comment on fidelity but they are quite good for me.

NOTE: Phone needs to be secured into a mount, with the antenna close behind.  With the laws being passed about no one handed driving on the cell, most people have migrated to a mount simply to comply - the inside antenna works well in this case.

Once you plug a device into the output port, the fourth blue light illuminates. Device was tested on Samsung Galaxy S2, Samsung Infuse, and an ATT Go phone. All charged quickly and without incident. With the included adapter, I've read that it reverses cord polarity, we were also able to charge a Samsung Galaxy 7in Tablet. Since the output of this battery is 1amp, vs. the 2amp Samsung charger, this was not completed as quickly.

sorry.
The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
The reason why it's not a 5 is because the metal part that holds the latch came out. The little bolt won't go into the hole for some reason. It was broken when I got it. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so I just super glued it back, and it has held so far.

2118	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I originally gave this 4 stars, mainly due to the looks and unique style. After wearing it for about a week, and continually being told that my voice sounded muffled, plus the wearing discomfort that I just couldn't get used to, I returned the H9 for a refund today. It is cool looking, but if you use your bluetooth for hours a day as I do, it's just not practical, maybe 2 stars......Original review follows***** I bought this mostly to make one of my co-workers envious, and should do the trick, as this is one of the most unique looking bluetooth headsets on the market. The fact that it picks up your voice through the ear canal is pretty neat, and seems to cut down on ambient noise. The portion that fits in the ear is slightly curved so you may need to rotate the external part to get the best fit. Mine fits best with the "M" facing sideways. My biggest complaint is once you achieve the seal recommended in the instructions, it feels sort of like you have your finger stuck in your ear, but I seem to be getting accustomed to it. All in all, not the most comfortable I've ever used (and I've used a lot), but tolerable, and one of the best performers, and least noticeable.

Easy music and camera controls.

I read the product features, I read the user reviews. I bought it.

If all you are just want to prevent scratches, and you don't mind buttons being hard to press, this case might work for you, but if that's the case, I would buy one of the <$2 (shipped) silicone cases.

2)  The keyboard is designed for tween/teen fingers.  If you've got larger fingers, you'll have some trouble adjusting.  Adjusting is possible, though.  After about 3 weeks, I can type pretty proficiently (though I still look at the keys).

Pros:
1. Great sound quality, both in & out.

2673	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this so I could start running again and listen to my iPod Classic. My iPod fits perfectly, this case grips it so it doesn't jump around and the headphone jack is easy to reach. I'm also relatively slim so it fits my arm very well. I would definitely recommend this to any active person looking to listen to tracks while they work out, jog, run, or even do push-ups. Great product that shipped fast, and for a good price.

These screen protectors are even better than the old ones, because the backing has measured grid lines that help you cut out the precsise size that you need for your screen.

Makes for a clean install!

7079	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Although these are NOS, the capacity to hold a charge is still intact. I'm a light cell user, but still, I get 2+ weeks between charging cycles.  Very good value.

6668	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my camper, which sits down in a hollow.  Normal reception on the phone is basically half a bar, so I was obviously concerned that there wouldn't be enough signal to boost.  I put the antenna on a piece of pvc and mounted that on the wooden marker post for the camping spot.  I can raise or lower it and change the facing direction if I want.  I put it up about 8 feet off the ground.  In the trailer the signal went to 2 to 3 bars.  Not being able to make a phone call before, has turned into being able to make a phone call now and with decent quality.  Data reliability also improved.  Range for me is maybe 10-12 feet from the transmitter, which covers the living area of the trailer.  The signal is broadcast in a cone, so you have to play with the transmitter a bit to get the best coverage.  The best part, my phones battery would drain in about six hours, hunting for a signal before I got this kit, now it goes down at a closer to normal rate.  For my situation, it was worth the price knowing that I can now at least call 911, which I likely couldn't before.
Overall I think the unit is excellent and highly recommend it.

2294	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Phone is not very "User Friendly". Stylus requirement is a challenge.
Until two weeks ago, I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability, and a cell phone. I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour. Prior to getting this Blackberry, I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim, stay tied to my laptop, or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone. It was terrible.
2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.

8)  The battery life is outstanding.  From a full charge, the battery will last me a whole week before it dies.  That being said, I'm not a heavy cell phone user...only about 350 minutes a month.  Still, a whole week on standby, never turning off the phone, is great!

The average: Not a great radius; if I go more than 10 feet from it I lose bluetooth.  Not awful, but not great.  It can be tricky to pair both the Voyager's phone feature and the Voyager's stereo feature - for some reason, each has to be paired separately.  That may be a Voyager issue, not a Sony issue, though.

6497	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have tried three of these boosters, and this one is the best so far.  One piece goes in a window facing the closest cell tower.  If you have low E windows or metal screens, it may interfere.  Then you run a cable from that piece to the second piece, which can be up to 25' away.  In our case, it adds about two bars to our signal strength, which is a nice boost.  Easy to install and does what it it supposed to do.
1716	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	it is just what we expected.  Very nice and confortable to use.
8402	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The stitching that holds the plastic cover on tore off after the 3rd day of use.  I managed to stitch it back up with a needle and thread and it lasted a month, then started to tear again. I think had someone who knows how to sew actually done the stitch repair instead of me, it might have held better.

The only problem I am having with it is getting the film to fit screen without bubbles but this is not a new issue with screen protectors.
The only reason why I didn't initially give this set 5 stars is the somewhat clumsy power/mute button position.  Years later, after getting familiar with many other competing products and learning how durable this headset is, I think it deserves 5 stars.  Too bad I can't change it.

1083	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Fifteen months ago I bought my first BB7210, and feel it's one of the best business tools I've ever used. Battery life was good for at least two days talking 3-4 hours per day or 5-6 days in low use, and the integration of Outlook with the phone was AWESOME. In Dec. 04, I upgraded to the BB7290 mainly for the Bluetooth feature. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Battery life barely gets me through a day, and the lag time from menu to menu is much slower than the BB7210. The unit is slightly larger and heavier than the BB7210. After using the device for only two days, callers could NOT hear my voice, though I could hear them clearly, and I had a great signal? Cingular is replacing the device; however, RIM will need to make some serious changes for me to be as enthusiastic as I was over the BB7210.
If it fits your ear, you'd love these!
To be fair, I should say the first BT250v unit I bought, which I've used daily, is still holding up well.
So what had happened was the other two times I had charged it for 4 hours, I disconnected it from the charger put it on my desk and used it the next day for 1.5 hours then getting signals of a low battery.

These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)


It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long.

It seems there's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I've long since run out of ports for plugging.

3201	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It says in multiple places that this is not for home use.  But, I'm using it at home and I'm consistently getting 1-2 bars of service when my phone used to say no service to 1 bar  indoors in my apartment.

In the surrounding suburbs, it worked once about 30 miles north of Chicago, so I know it's not broken, unfortunately. TeleNav, the company that sells the GPS mapping service for Nextel phones, will charge you by the kilobyte, which is very mysterious, but comes out to about twenty-bucks a month, in addition to a "total connect" service that Nextel will need to add (for GPS to function), for another ten-bucks monthly. The kicker is when you figure out that your GPS hardly works at all, and you have already signed up for a year's Telenav service, TELENAV WON'T REFUND YOU A SINGLE DIME. "Too bad for you" it didn't work in YOUR area. The Nextel tech that I spoke to (in cancelling "total connect") said TeleNav told them that they should not gaurantee TeleNav to ever function. "There are not enough satelllites at this time". What a bunch of fargin iceholes.

And for the big test, I roam on a verizon partner in a rural county using a verizon iphone 6 Plus.  This does provide usually an additional bar but what it has eliminated is dropped calls.  There's spots in my county that would drop phone calls reliably, in fact, i'd have to tell my wife I'm going to drop you soon as I'd approach such a spot.  No more with this installed.  And that alone is worthwhile.

4227	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The belt clip on the back of this holster just came off one day. I just didn't understand how that could have happen.
The buttons are less than desirable, though. I'm not sure if it's just me, but the volume is a little difficult to adjust while the headset is on my ear, and the power button is just impossible to get at while on my ear. You need to power it on and off after taking it off. The call button on my first headset became defective after a few months (which would explain my hours of frustration on not being able to pair the darn thing to my computer), but I'm sure it was a lemon. Update on this will follow if the call button goes on my current 510.
11. Ergonomics: fits my ear fine, and stays put during normal physical activity. I have not tested it jogging. Amazingly small footprint. Clever use of a minimal number of buttons and multi-colored LEDs (Call/Answer;Volume Up/Down). Pressing both up/down volume while headset is open (and not connected to the charger, or in a call), shows battery life remaining in 3 colors, Red/Yellow/Green, which corresponds to hours of talk time left.

The iTorch is lighter than the iPhone (yes is can charge more than the iPhone. anything with a USB connector for that matter!) itself and comes with a handy carrying bag that you can stuff the iTorch, your phone or tablet USB attachment, and the iTorch charger in (at least I can, haha)! So you can take it anywhere with you just like you do your cellphone without hassle. Any you can easily use it anywhere.
I tried it on a new Chocolate and was able to use the open-to-power-on-and-answer call feature well enough as long as you grab your headset and open it very soon after the phone begins to ring. This did not work at all on the Treo, which insists on a proper pairing before a call begins or else you have to hang up and call back starting with the headset. Again a Treo problem but still making this headset worthless because it is powered off unless you keep it open and on your ear.

I did like what I saw in the photo and was looking specifically (after reading other reviews on cases) for a clip that was sewn on and this one looked like it was.  Having been living with this case for about a week now I can say that I am very pleased with it.  There are two things about it that are different than in the photo.  First the clip has been redesigned.  he clip part itself is more narrow and then from the bottom up there is a flap that snaps at the top.  This is to insure that the case does not slip up and off as you are removing the phone from the case.  I like it! The clip and snap-flap are made with the same material as the rest of the case and they are SEWN on not glued.  The second thing that is different than the photo is the magnetic closure on the front flap.  It is not hidden inside the flap and body.  It is a visible disc on the underside of the flap and on the body.  This is fine with me as it is not visible when the case is closed AND the case does close effortlessly so that I'm not having to fiddle with it to find that magic spot where the magnets finally catch each other.  My phone (the Samsung T629) fits in it perfectly and slides in and out of the case nicely.  The case is sturdy (not flimsy and soft).  I like the horizontal design as it does not interfere with front pocket access and isn't uncomfortable while sitting. I can't believe this case is priced so low.  It is a high quality case and it looks expensive (and I shopped around for weeks online and in person).

-Switching on the flashlight vs. the laser isn't the most intuitive.
4989	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Adapter works great with the different headphones that I have. Unlike the picture, this adapter actually supports stereo + microphone in case you have a stereo + microphone headset that you want to plug in there. I didn't find this useful since I didn't such a set to test out and if I did, I would get one that was already iPhone compatible.
Combined with T-Mobile's features I can use my cell phone to receive faxes, view assorted files, create, send, and view jpg's, chat on AOL, Chat on Yahoo, buy and sell on Amazon!!!! etc. I have purchased a number of books on Amazon while sitting by our lake.

There's a button on the back you press and the arms spring open.  Because of the low price I didn't think this would hold but the suction cup has held firm and the arms fit snuggly around the iPhone.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Cons:
So, there you have it -- relatively inexpensive, extremely simple to use, cleverly designed, works beautifully, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
 Large capacity that has plenty of power to charge a phone several times and an iPad just about once.
but it was around the time the iTorch had 1/2 -1/4 of battery life left.
As for the fit of the headset, it is very secure on my ear.  Like most others, it hooks over the ear, which makes it fit a bit oddly with sunglasses or eyeglasses, but it isn't uncomfortable.  When I get a new headset/earpiece, one of the first things I do is to put it on and shake my head around a bit to test how securely it fits my ear.  This one didn't budge.  For me, this is a very important factor.  If I can't move my head naturally as needed while driving, then the headset impedes my ability to drive and I won't have that.

People I call do not complain about voice quality so must be good enough!  Only slight negative is only included charging solution is a 12V car charger but Amazon does have a AC to 12V converter for about $12.  So far I have not bought it, claimed stand by time of 200 hours seems real so do not have to charge very often.  Auto shut off after 15 minutes of no blue-tooth connect helps save the battery.

Not sure if that's how it secures a connection or whatever, but it's not a big deal. Sounds great, haven't had one complaint yet and it's been plenty loud enough so far. It's also great looking.

What a GREAT bluetooth!! Here's why: (1) You know that earpiece that has to stick inside your ear with the other bluetooths? Well - this one doesn't have that! It's FLAT - nothing to stick inside your ear! (2) It's LOUD. You'd think that because it doesn't stick inside your ear you won't hear it? Nope! This bluetooth is LOUD & CLEAR. It's louder and clearer than any other bluetooth I've ever used. (3) Easy On/Off Switch - Just flip open the "boom" piece to turn it on, and flip it closed to turn it off. No holding a button down for 5-seconds. Just flip open for ON and flip closed for OFF. It's so simple! What a pleasure!

3950	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I originally gave this product a 4 out of 5 star review (4 because I didn't like how the very tight clip putting indentations in my visor).  However after only about a month of use, the spring mechanism for the retractable mic got stuck in the deployed 'on' position and did not allow me to push the mic back into the unit to turn it off.  Very disappointed as I liked the design and sound quality of this product.  Fortunately as always, Amazon was very good in accepting my return for this defect.  I have since replaced it with the sleek new Jabra SP5050 speakerphone which in my opinion is a much better product than the BlueAnt from a design standpoint.

  I sent one to my son who is serving our country. He can't say enough about it.

It works perfectly with my blackberry function that detect the magnet on the holster to block its keyboard and the holstered distinctive ring tones. The swivel function allows for 180 degrees rotation to place it in the most comfortable level.
I started playing with the buttons after reading the directions in the instruction manual and found they were reversed from my buds.  It showed the volume on the on the left side but when I pushed the left front button, I got the EQ.  Rotating through the EQ's didn't seem to make much difference.  The volume adjustment was actually on the right side and the call/play and track buttons are on the left side.  Once I got that figured out, I was ok.  Also, if you have a smart watch, you might not even have to worry about the controls.  I have a Moto360 and it also pairs to the phone at the same time as the buds so that just a plus for me.
- The best thing about the H20 armband is you can operate the touch screen while it's in the case.  Voice control will only get you so far.  If you want to read your email or check sports scores you need more than voice control.
-long battery use for hours of use
I use it inside Mexico on the 2G/3G Telcel network, so for people travelling to Mexico i can confirm its works.
Now I realize the main function of the Plantronics is as a bluetooth headset, but it works intermittently in that capacity and as a bluetooth stereo headset it performs very poorly.
-Camera doesn't have a flash.
As for the video cam, you can get a good 20-30 seconds of footage.  Speakin' of videos, there's  a music video on this phone!  I just gotta find out how and where to get some more!  Lemme find out I could be watchin' Duran Duran on my cell phone, whaaaaat!  Anywho, I'm not interested in using it as an MP3 cos I have an MP3...that I use as an MP3.

Pros:
One positive note- the thing takes so little energy that I have only charged it up twice since owning it. I've charged it so infrequently that I can't find the charger cable.
Regarding the rebates, maybe folks aren't reading the directions right or something?  I got my rebates quite promptly.

If you look at the case of the battery, you see it has a couple extra nice features. In addition to the regular full size USB port and USB micro port where you plug your devices in for charging, there is a white LED you can use as a flashlight and a red laser for use as a pointing device. One switch runs all the devices by pressing multiple times. One press for laser pointer, press and hold for 2 seconds to turn on the charging circuit and press and hold for 3 seconds to turn on the white LED light.

5305	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Really nice case.  It is very nicely built with a strong hinge, feels great in the hand and holds 16 RYO king cigarettes.  It definitely feels built to last.
My only concern now is how long these Motorola earbuds will last. I have noticed some reviews that complained about that very issue, so I am watchfully waiting to see how they do. However, as with all my electronics, I am extremely careful with them, never bang them around, drop them, or expose them to moisture. I am hoping they last a good long time, because I am very, very happy with them and feel like I have FINALLY come to the end of my long search for the perfect earbuds to wear at work. I can't even tell you how many pairs of earbuds I've gone through over the last six years, but it's been a LOT, and they've all been discarded or given away, because of one reason or another, usually for not fitting/staying properly in my ears.
1685	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am very happy with this purchase
I like the iTap better than LG's version.  There seem to be more words loaded into the dictionary.
If you're torn between something like this, and a full-size QWERTY smartphone, just evaluate how much text input you want to do and if you want to carry a rather large blackberry with you when you are out and about or something much slimmer and smaller.  I would go with T-Mobile regardless of your phone choice.  Their award-winning customer service just makes the experience.  Verizon is good though.  I would avoid the Cingular/AT&T until they get stable with the amount of money they are spending on changing their names back and forth.

This charger recharged my iPod Touch, iPhone 4S and Sony Cybershot DSC-TX55 in approximately 2 hours with time left on the charger indicated with 2 fully lit blue lights.
- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.

2521	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Amazing, high quality case.  No glue--all stitched!!  And so beautiful, it was hard to choose!!!  I just bought another one, because I just couldn't stop thinking about it!
I plugged it into my computer to test it and it both fit and charged my cell phone perfectly.  I plan on using this at home, and it's inexpensive enough to buy one for work, in the car and other places when I need to charge the phone elsewhere.

5744	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great screen protector.  You get one for the inside and outside screen but I prefer to just use both for the outside since there is little risk to hurting the inside screen.  One one goes I'll have a back up.  Can't beat it for the price.
On the positive side, it uses the same charger as the phone.  Ummmm... that's about it.

3384	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I don't play video games, but I bought this for a child who does and it works perfectly. Unless it suddenly stops working, I have no idea what make this cable different than the one that costs $30-40. This was a great value.
Overall Satisfied with the product!
If the IMP52D is being charged, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate 'charging status' - at first, blue light 2 would come on, blue light 3 would come on and blue light 4 would come on, the all 3 went out and the cycle was repeated - after a while blue light 2 remained illuminated while blue lights 3 and 4 would come on sequentially and then simultaneously go out - eventually blue lights 2 & 3 are staying illuminated and light 4 is blinking on and off - after a while (about 8 hours) all 3 lights remain illuminated presumably indicating the the IMP52D is fully charged -
I charge the external battery charger up (using a wall plug with a USB port) and throw it in my purse.  It comes with a little velvety pouch to keep it and the cord in. I go weeks sometimes without having to use it and the full charge is still there when I need it.  When I am out and my phone dies or is low on juice, I simply plug this bad boy in to my phone and it charges it right up.  I love that I can just plug it in to my phone and throw it in my purse and let it charge when I'm on the go.  Also, it came in handy when I was out with friends one night and somehow my battery drained within a few hours.  I needed my phone to be charged in case the sitter called and I would have freaked out if not for this external battery charger.
Before even reading the instructions, I set up the unit to charge in
COMPLAINTS:

Buttons become excessively hard to push, also due to how hard the case is.

WELL worth the low price, and as I've experienced with Amazon before, my expectations were far exceeded.  Kudos to both companies !!
4565	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Recently purchased this phone through Amazon, and after about 1 month of ownership, I'm pretty happy with it.
The IMP52D also has a built-in flash light and a red laser pointer but I haven't really used it much.
I would recommend comparing this to newer quad-band phones since they will probably fall within the same price range.

TMobile's phone reception in this area is fine, better than my Cingular reception generally, though with a few weak areas that seem to be weak no matter what carrier you've got. The phone also syncs nicely with an Exchange Server I have set up (one of the main reasons I got it-Windows Mobile 5), and of course is great for appointments/calendar/contacts (and email even without the internet plan IF you've got an Exchange Server; but it does web-based email fine too) and pc sync of all types with Windows pc's via ActiveSync. The ClearVue software that's included does a decent job viewing (but NOT editing) Word and pdf files too. I'll soon have an SD card to add some storage capacity for more of those. Tried the camera, it's pretty mediocre, but not a priority for me anyway.
4990	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Beware, you will not get the item that is pictured.  You will get some sort of iPhone recessed port adapter (kinda like the Belkin one) but not nearly as good as the one in the picture.
I'd highly recommend this small powerful battery to anyone with the need to charge a phone or device where there is no power available.

7048	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very Good!

6213	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My new IMP52D is great.  I opened the package 5 days ago and read the directions that told me that the battery is also a flash light.  Two minutes later the lights went out do to an electrical storm. I was so glad to have such a helpful item.  The next day my phone battery started to decline significantly.  Once the iPhone 4S battery goes down to 20 % battery the battery drops very fast. The new small battery charger saved the day and not only stopped the decline but put the charge back up to 100% in a very short period of time.  I am a nurse practitioner and need my phone for many medical functions.  I highly recommend this small battery charger.

I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.
+Plenty of charging power for repeated full charging of smaller devices (blackberry, droid, iphone, bluetooth headsets).

Keypad: People always complain about the keypads of the Sony Ericsson and the LG Shine and say how small they are and how difficult it is to text with them... Most of these complainers are complaining from hearsay (they repeat what they read/hear from others, not from their own experience). The problem of cracking keypads is also a huge concern for potential buyers of the SE. First, to address the keypad. The size of the keypad is very usable for texting and other usage. I have 6'2" and have large hands and I can still manage to comfortable use the phones' keypads. Texting with both is very easy (albeit not as easy as texting on a RAZR). The SE's keypad is not as responsive as the Shine's, meaning the click down are not as solid, and that the row of numbers are connected so that one press on a number slightly depresses the row, but nonetheless, it is very solid. The LG Shine's keypad is like a smaller version of the RAZR. Regarding the cracking keys on the SE, I performed a test to see if this rumor was true. Over a period of 2 days, I had the phone off and during my spare time (which is a lot since it's summer), I've been clicking away at the keys (with a good amount of pressure I might add), and the keys exhibit no sign of cracking. Clearly the cracking keys is an issue with older phones (which you could potentially still buy if the reseller of your phone has old stock).
I have a number of dead spots for 4g, including my driveway.  With the phone installed and everything on, I get a weak, but useable 4g signal where previously I generally could not use 4g.  I've never had a problem well telephone calls dropping around here, so I can't offer much opinion there.
3674	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE. CHARGERS A VERY HARD TO FIND AND WHEN YOU FIND ONE YOU HAVE TO HURRY  AND BUY IT SO YOU CAN HAVE THE ONE YOUR PHONE USES.
Hard to find a good case for it other than the dang puches.
MEMORY: Comes with 2gb memory card. I added an 8gm sdhc Ultra to mine. It's fast, no delay. It can take 16gb card. 128mb RAM. Never get 'memory full' warnings. Dual ARM 11 332 MHz processor w/ 3D graphics hardware accelerator
6182	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	So I purchased because my Droid Charge eats batteries whenever I use it for anything long term, using the GPS it will last less than 30 minutes, sometimes on a walk I will want to pull up a map or use the pedometer feature to see how far I have gone, well then it just dies, now I can just stick the iTorch in my pocket and charge my phones 1600ma battery several times.

I have stuck with motorla since the advent of bluetooth headsets and I may be missing something from the other brands.  However, as compared to previous motorola offerings, this is the superior choice.

2190	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does what I want it to do.  I works perfectly with my Motorola L2 phone.  I was able to back up my address book and sync my outlook calendar.  I transferred a custom ringtone.  The thing that really makes it perfect for me is that it has an audio editor that edits MIDI files.  I have a lot of MIDIs and they make better ring tones, but it's hard to find an editor so that you can cut them down to the necessary size.  The sound editor contained in this package edits mp3s also.  It was the easiest sound editor I ever used.

1851	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great lumbar support, I use it in my car. I travel a lot for work & this has helped my back & hips tremendously. The strap that is elastic to go around the seat is not stretchy or long enough to go over my Toyota Rav4  2015 seat. I just place it in the position when I GET in & it stays comfortable.
-Can load MP3 ringtones
-the mic is closer to your mouth so your voice will sound better and clearer than a Bluetooth headset where the mic is way up by your ear. I tried a wireless Bluetooth headset and my voice always sounded distant and callers could hear ambient room noise around me. They said I sounded like I was using a speakerphone. But when I use this wired headset, they say my voice is quite clear and loud.

I've had the console apart before to install a car stereo and did not feel like doing again to install a new cigarette lighter socket.

I used the existing wires to connect the power and ground. I could of also ran a power wire to the battery.
8105	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've used this device for over a year now, mostly while running and loved it so much that I am ordering my second, after the first one broke. I use it with my Samsung Juke, and I mostly listen to lectures or podcasts - only sometimes music.
2597	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Although I did not purchase this bluetooth headset from Amazon (used a local cellular retailer), I felt compelled to write a review just to warn others that this product is not worth buying.  Here are my complaints:


3431	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this Plantronics headset for my husband to supplement my own&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PLANTRONICS-DISCOVERY-925/dp/B001S9EYN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PLANTRONICS DISCOVERY 925 </a>&nbsp;when we were taking a trip in two separate cars so we could communicate safely on the road.  He had not previously used a bluetooth device, and I wanted to make sure that he could answer his phone without taking his eyes off the road.  Both of us were using the new iPhone 4.  So how did the Discover 665 compare to the 925?  In general, it worked well, with easy pairing and one-touch answering.  Where it lagged, however, was in audio quality. I could hear him, but he couldn't always hear me, and occasionally his transmission had some vibrato and/or muffling.  While the problem could have been with my 925, I've used it for years without such issues.  He has since used it to answer calls from our land line, and occasionally the sound quality just isn't there.
Other than that I is a great and reasonable price for insurance for a phone that cost almost $300.
I haven't had a problem with the on/off switch like some reviews have stated.  I find this charger to be a great little machine and highly recommend it if you need some extra power.  Well done New Trent!
3890	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This shower head is as close as you can get to the Commando 450.  I've been shopping around for a shower head that provides great pressure and this one definitely does. With the flow restrictor removed, the shower might actually be too strong and my drain can't keep up with all the water.  Will do some drain cleaning this weekend and hopefully get everything working like it should. Awesome shower head.
No problems here.


The other day, I drop it on the ground (not an uncommon occurrence for bluetooth headsets) and the metal ear loop snap off!




SMALL KEYS: The keyboard is the size of my thumb. Although the keyes are are spaced, Braille-touch is still near impossible because even my pinkie finger can touch two keys at once. Ridiculous!
great product. saved me a bundle.
2170	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have now had this phone for a week. I have had no problems with it at all. It has all the features i could want in a cell phone/pda. I have downloaded the Opera browser because Internet explorer doesnt let you have more than 1 window open at a time. The ringer on the phone is amazingly loud. Plus I just put a song from my pc as the ring tone. The clarity of the calls is amazing. That was a key concern when I was looking at the phone. I just thought they might concentrate more on the pocket pc part of the phone , than the actual phone itself. One reason I love this phone is it is quad-band. I had the SidekickII but it was only tri-band and didn't work in Maine where my parents live. This one works everywhere. The keyboard takes some adjusting, but it's usable once you get used to it.overall this is a great phone.

I didn't know if I'd experience issues between "LR927" and "SR927" but I guess it's just the materials in the battery and a very slightly different voltage. (1.55V for SR (silver oxide) and 1.5 for LR (alkaline))  These worked out perfect.  The SR batteries are also said to have a greater capacity and a more constant voltage as its life diminishes - so they should work for quite a bit longer while also staying bright longer.

Nice package and style
My real issue with the item is simply the difficulty of installation. Many people will need assistance from someone to place it properly on the roof and install it neatly. In addition, the cords are not pretty either. You can do the best you can, but in the end a cord is a cord and the stick out if not installed properly.

6381	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Received this product yesterday.  It is completely unusable, as the LG Voyager fits so tightly into the case, that it's nearly impossible to remove the phone once inserted.

There are three buttons. The function button handles most features. There are two volume buttons for up and down. The volume buttons also have functions such as holding down the volume up button for three seconds actives the redial feature. This may sound confusing, but it really is not. You just need to read the instructions. The buttons are easy to press with little resistance.

I have been using this product for two months now and everything works fine.  I can recharge my iPhone and iPad multiple times (iPad only gets about  50% charge but that is not why I bought this device) whenever I am on the go without having to queue up to an AC outlet.  It is compact and fits easily into a pocket, glove box, center console, backpack or purse.  I never leave home without it.  I REALLY LIKE THIS DEVICE and many other reviewers are happy with it as well.

9566	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've had this item for 6 months but isn't working the way I would like it. It could be that's not installed exactly the way it should be (re: not facing the right tower). It boosted my mobile stick perfectly, along with my cellphone signal BUT I was not able to use any data on my iPhone. The iPhone showed a full 5 bars but it was only good for making phones not surfing the web or using apps. Haven't used the booster for a month. I have to get up on the roof again and turn the booster in another direction and maybe it will work.

1223	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter.  Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work.  Then I exchanged it for another one.  This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work.  It works for power up/power down.  But I can't pickup any incoming calls.  The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality.  I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work.  I already exchanged the jabra adapter once.  Now I'm sick of exchanging it.  I think jabra has bad quality control.  Someone in the quality control shd be fired!  Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem.

Very light weight, includes manual and recharge cable. Indicator light shows status of charge.

2074	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Eureka!  It works.  For several years we have cursed at Verizon Wireless for the terrible service we have in our home.  Anywhere else in our city - 4 or 5 bars, inside our house, less than 1 bar, dropped calls, static, etc.  If it hadn't been that most of our friends and family are on Verizon, and that other service providers have worse service nationwide, we would have dropped long ago.  I read the review on this cell phone booster, and as usual, some folks said it was terrible, but most said it worked.  Bought it, installed it as directed - except we used a shorter cable to cut down on signal loss from the 50 footer provided, and guess what?  At least 2 bars in most of our house, can even send and receive in our basement, which was impossible before.  Set up is easy, I put the antenna in our attic, and the unit in the garage.

6135	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this charger because I occassionally leave my phone in my purse overnight without charging.  It's nice having the iTorch in my purse as well so that I can just take out the cable and charge it while I'm on the go, in meetings, at the mall, etc.  I had my phone 25% charged, and pulled out the iTorch.  I fully charged the iTorch about three weeks ago, so I wasn't sure if it was going to work.  I was presently surprised to see that it charged pretty quickly and was at full capacity after 1.5 hours.  Totally took the charge out of the iTorch but I can easily charge that again later.
7397	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This silicone case makes gripping and handling my BlackBerry Curve much easier.  I got it to match my red Curve, although the color is much duller than I would have liked.  I wish I had gotten a more vibrant color, but the silicone case is a must have.

4778	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Like others have said, this isn't a phone for those with large fingers. If you're looking for a business phone with a qwerty keyboard, then this isn't your pick. Nonetheless, the phone is elegantly built, with lots of features.
This particular weBoost product is designed for a single user only and is designed to be used in a car, truck, van, RV or boat. According to the manufacturer, this device "enhances talk, text, and high-speed 4G LTE internet on ALL phones with ALL carriers while on the road. No more dropped calls, lost connections, and slow internet."
- This is a big one. The charging cable is the SAME cable to charge both

1894	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Oh good didn't work poor reception just bad
~~~~~~~~~~
- The charging port hole is NOT precisely cut for the stock charger.  It doesn't appear to interfere with the charging at all but it prevents it from seating completely in the port.  This may be just mine, but I'd suspect all are like this.
Hope this helps.
Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.

8973	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pro's:

6955	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I received the unit quickly.  Was able to opne it, and mount it on my windshield within 3 minutes.  The phone shakes quite a bit in my truck with the included extended arm, but does not in my car without being extended arm.  The positioning of the phone is viewable nicely.  Would recommned it!

Of course, everyone wants to know how it performs.  I have tested it solely with my iPhone 4, and have found it completely charges the product from 0% to 100%, and the status indicator shows it still contains enough power to recharge my iPhone again.  I would estimate you could charge your device at least 2 1/2 times before the battery itself would need to be recharged.

9218	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the best bluetooth headset designed as of yet ever made. It's very comfortable, the quality of the sound on both ends is great, easy to charge unlike other bluetooth headsets that I've owned where you have to diconnect the ear hook and place the bluetooth in a small charging case which was a lot of hassle.  I have purchased four of these H710 sets recently for myself, friends and family! Fast reliable free shipping.
4.  Finally, the power cord.  They changed it AGAIN!  Three headsets, three different charger connectors.  And Igo does not have a tip as of this writing.  Bummer.
Overall, the good outweighs the bad(for me). Before you buy this phone, I'd seriously look into understanding Windows Mobile first. This phone has a lot of bells and whistles, but is probably difficult to work for the average cell phone user. I really wanted the AT&T Tilt which has better features (and cost less) than this phone(also HTC), but in terms of cellular service.... Verizon has been *a lot* more reliable for me(Northeast). I guess you can't have it all.....

8236	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works good.
a laser pointer. I would highly recommend this device to those traveling,
The sound as I stated is quality.  The settings right out of the box carried a LOT of bass.  Honestly they sound like really premium ear buds with excellent sound.  I never tried listening to them with the mid-sized ear buds that come pre-installed.  I immediately put on the larger ear buds (3 sizes come with it) and found that there was no problem for me at all.  I watched the two reviews by Clint Gibbs on YouTube and followed his advice regarding putting the appropriate buds in your ear.  I HIGHLY suggest you putting the ones that fit best in your ear on prior to first using.  Make sure the buds give a light seal in your ear when they are inserted.  This should not need to fit deep into your ear, nor feel like it is going to fall out.  The right fit forms a "sound seal" perfectly in your ear and feels very comfortable.

- Easy to remove and replace (great for people that do battery swaps instead of wall/car-charging all day)
It's like an old tractor, or a favorite shirt.
The sound quality is decent, not spectacular. But not any worse than my $100 plantronics. Good volume (if positioned correctly)  I use it in my noisy car all the time.

I expected better quality from Nokia. I rather have less feature and more solid performance.
1652	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The product has terrible audio quality with the MacBook Pro.  Plantronics claims that it only works with Cell Phones.
1184	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I love the feel of this case.  I've used the gel cases in the past, but they always end up covered in lint and feel sticky.  This case has a nice smooth/velvety feel, isn't "sticky" and doesn't seem to show fingerprints, either. My phone no longer gets stuck in my pocket or hair.  My only issue is that the cutout for the camera button on the side is not exact, so the case kind of overlaps it (just a smidge) from the back. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.

I've wanted a Jawbone for some time now, but wasn't willing to purchase one until the price fell under $80. Of course, that was only because Jawbone II was recently released. I don't know that I'd invest in a full-priced Jawbone or Jawbone II, but it was definately worth what I paid for mine.
Pros:
7064	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	OK
The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).
While the Centro isn't as thin as several other models available, it was definitely thin enough.  I've become rather used to my Treo 650 for quite some time, so even the 755p fit well in my eyes, but the Centro was downright tiny.  It boasts pretty much all the bells & whistles that made the previous Treo's so popular, and it pulls all that off in a smaller package.  It even comes with Google Maps built in!  Now THAT is a nifty feature.  What I wish more than anything is for Palm to make the Centro and Treo 755p available to more wireless carriers than they currently do, although I certainly won't be holding my breath for that to happen.
This may be slightly off-topic, but man, you need a mini 4-pin Male for this thing, a mini 5-pin Male for most other USB-powered devices (i.e. Motorola RAZR, Blackberry, etc), and then don't forget about FireWire, Ethernet, and occasionally, telephone cords.  Fortunately, I also have the <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/tech-data/B0006OD020/ref=de_a_smtd/002-8876159-6285651?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target="_new">Cables To Go Port Authority 2 Retractable Cable Kit</A> that I take on the road with me.  It includes both the mini 4-pin Male adapter to charge the BT500, the mini 5-pin Male for most other USB devices, a USB B Male connecter (for things like portable printers, it's a squarish sort of connecter rather than the rectangular USB connecter on the PC), and adapters for RJ-11 and RJ-45 (even a crossover connecter), and a headset and microphone for making your Skype calls.
1588	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros: lightweight, great sound quality and battery life. Also multipoint bluetooth works fine and is great for using it with the cell phone or the PC as an audio gateway (e.g.: Skype for voice calls)
4408	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great SIM card and great customer service from Amazon. I lost this phone during shipment and Amazon was kind enough to replace it. Thank you Amazon! God bless.
4534	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I loved this bluetooth, I still own it and would purchase it again with no problem. Made really well great job.

1)I bought the anti-glare film and applied it before I put the phone in the case. You need to get this right before you put the phone in for the case is really hard to open.
Anyway, I wanted to protect my replacement Curve, so I researched HD protective cases, and settled on the OtterBox in basic black (no Bumble-Bee look for me, thanks.) I bought one at a GREAT price on Amazon, and received it about a week later.
The Jawbone could be better - if it allowed to switch ears - my left gets tired and I can't switch to the right unless I reconfigure with a different ear loop.
IT LOOKED GOOD ON THE PICTURE BUT NOT WHEN WE GOT IT
  It is very light and you could probably palm it off a table without anyone seeing it leave.  The instructions were refreshing in that they didn't even bother to tell me to charge it before I used it, but they did point out the laser pointer, LED light and how to hook up an Apple iPhone for charging.  Four blue LEDs let you know the state of the charger and this one came with 2, so I charged it.
2950	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is an upgrade of an earlier single battery unit. When my cell phone goes low and I am without my charger, as when my car breaks down and is towed to repair shop and I am in a rental car, it is great to have the capacity to quickly add charge to the phone. Toss one in the glove box for that, 'Just in case' moment. The dual battery unit charged my Smart Phone to about 50% (from dead) in 15 minutes.

3293	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My husband loves it.

5988	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It worked great for 2 days, then completely died. Won't charge or turn on at all.  I never dropped it or abused in any way, it was hardly used.  Poor quality.  Do not buy this.
6425	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Update: 2/1/13 I was always concerned that after I stuck this on how easy it would be to take off. So I had to try it and with a little care it came right off. It did crack so now I have to buy a new one but I no longer have any concerns. After a year, this thing worked great, never scratched, is a lot flatter than the original cover and never has to be removed! Now I have to wait for it to go back on Prime...

* The LED and laser pointer should have a timeout - just in case it is accidentally turned on while in a bag. Maybe after 'x' minutes, turn off by itself
The speakerphone III is a good speakerphone, but I recommend this one. The speakerphone III speaks the caller's name when they are calling you. The voice sounds like a machine and doesn't flow very well. I listened to a youtube videos of it. If I really need to, I can tell who is calling me just by taking a glance at my phone. In short, I decided that the extra money for the speakerphone III isn't worth the new features. This speakerphone has the important quality features that you are looking for at a value price.
Since I am always in airports, often for too many added hours, I appreciate this device more and more.  I am on flights a lot and I no longer worry about losing power after, well, virtually any amount time.  I have gotten literally days of juice off of this thing (40 hours or more).  It's truly amazing.
* The N95-4 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB NAM", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of "n95 8gb" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.

In short, everything works well, and the ambient noise cancellation features seem to work well, according to the people I'm talking to.
I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop.  I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear.
2545	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This case is pretty slim yet protects the phone from the elements.  Also this case is great because when the phone is turned screen side down the screen does not actually hit the surface because the case lip extends past, a feature which I like.  It's ease and peace of mind to know my equipment is well protected.
So, what kept it from being 5-stars?

5743	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After having issues with the purchase of a case for my LG Voyager Phone, I was also in need of an screen cover for the phone.  I was told by the salesman at the Verizon Wireless store that is was not a good idea to put on a screen cover, as it would affect performance.  However, since installing the screen protector on my phone, this has not been the case.  The protector went on easily, and the phone works just as well as before putting on the screen cover.  Plus, the peace of mind I get from knowing the screen is protected is invaluable, especially for the $.01 price.  I would highly recommend this product.


1209	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Purchase was delivered as promised, was as described, the price was reasonable and it works as advertised.  What else can you ask for?  If all purchases were this easy and simple, life would be a lot more pleasant.

It performs very well and I have zero complaints with it. Voice quality both in my ear and to the person I'm talking to seems clear and not distorted. Reception seems good as well. Sure, voice quality and reception could always be improved with any cellphone, that's a given. But the RAZR exhibits no worse performance than any other cellphone I've owned/tried yet it excels over others in its design. It has such a small and thin footprint when closed, yet when flipped open it is comfortable to use, even for a long conversation. The fact that it supports a wireless Bluetooth headset is an added plus. You can put the phone in a pocket or purse and talk totally hands free with a Bluetooth headset! The RAZR also supports a wired headset and in fact comes with one free in the package. It also has a built-in speakerphone, which works, but is best used in a quiet environment (speakerphone doesn't work very well outdoors or in the car with the windows down).

1165	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I liked this unit when I set it up.  It had a small footprint, was heavy enough to be solid on the desk, and had a funky kind of look to it.  I had to return it, though.  It wasn't reliable.  My devices weren't registering on my PC.  I plugged them into another hub and they worked fine, but they didn't work on this hub.  I should say they initially worked, then didn't.  One at a time, each device I plugged into it worked, then didn't.  I tried unplugging it and then plugging it back in, but nothing.  I bought a cables to go model at the same time and that was solid (but $10 more).  I returned this unit and ordered another CTG unit.
1. Cheaply made... especially the area around the dial and the charger area. Being light is one thing, but there're some area where a little details matter.

3202	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It did not really increase signal that much, I kept it on for a little until I noticed the inside part basically melted off because of the south state heat. I returned it, thank you Amazon.
4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.
1. the stylus is too small (but hey I've got finger scrolling so I don't need it!)
The noise cancellation defaults at minimum. In noisy environments, simply click the function button. A voice tells you that it is set to maximum noise cancellation. That is really a cool feature because you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean.

8983	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great external battery to have and is convenient to have when you need a little extra juice.
Flipping the boom to turn it on is the best gimmick I have found.  It makes the headset very compact and you can't accidentally turn it on. This was a big problem with the H800.  If you forget to use the lock, it will constantly open in your pocket and turn on.

Overall, great little product, it does what it's suppose to do and does it well. However, the longevity of the product is in question and if it does happen to break, I'll be sure to update this review but if you don't see an update that means this case is still going strong!

It's comfortable, but you still know it's there. For me that's a very good thing. I don't want it falling off only for me to realize it well after the fact. However, due to its great design I don't think it would fall off easily. Volume is excellent, once you're used to the controls they are excellent, clarity of what you hear as well as how others hear you is excellent. Overall solid purchase.
The Centro is smaller than previous Palm devices, namely the phenomenally popular Treo line, which virtually invented the smartphone industry.  I have gone all over the 'net looking for comparisons so I would have a good idea of how to compare the Centro to say the Treo 755p and I MUST say that looking at photos simply cannot do it justice.  On the surface, the Centro looks only slightly smaller than the 755p...but I ASSURE you in reality, it is much smaller...maybe too small.

Easily one of the best buys for my phone. I use it every day and it's durable. Inside the case provides a nice soft padding to protect your screen from scratches.  Highly recommend. For the price, it's a no brainer.

One sheet was enough to make three shields for my Kodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera Bundle. So far, I've used two of the three shields made from the first sheet and they last about a month a piece. Be careful to cut them to fit tightly around the view screen without much overlap. Too much overlap is what causes them to "wear out".

970	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	For the price this is a nice Headset.  You can hear people very cleraly beacuse the speaker is very loud.  Also people can hear you very clearly because the microphone is very sensitive.  But this Headset is so uncomfortable, that if I wear it for more than a few mins I have to take it off, beacuse it hurts so much.  Also if you have small ears, it won't stay on your ear.  I am going to be using a Motorola HS820 Headset which is so comfortable and light.  I can wear it for hours and don't even know it is there.  But the Motorola HS820 Headset speaker and microphone is not as good as the Plantronics M2500 Headset.


6388	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased the Body Glove case and it's been on my LG Voyager, along with a screen protector since day one. The case provides excellent protection; the phone will be two years old in a few months and it still looks like brand new. I'm able to charge the phone and access all of the buttons and features of the touch screen with no problems. Based on the performance of this case, I purchased the same brand for my son's LG Dare phone and have been just as satisfied. The case does make the phone a little bulkier, but it's a minor issue compared to the great protection it provides.
3691	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Loved this case.
-- The footprint is more phone-like than a traditional Blackberry.
Pros:
you will not regret it


That being said, as far as the prepaid market is concerned, I think the Wildcard is a great phone. The calls are clear (though the speaker function sounds kinda scratchy) the signal is strong and the ringer is loud.  Physically, the phone is attractive and a convenient size. (We, too, initially had a problem getting the battery compartment to open - OMG! Fort Knox is less secure!).


4548	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It seems a good product quality, I hope it lasts a long time to use. The beautiful model. Recommended 100%.
I have very large ears and it works great. Maybe those with small ears could have a different experience.
209	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It works good, the light is quite bright, but if you turn it upside down it makes a great subtle interior light.

Unless you need corporate email don't bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used.

3) Worked well for watching TV in private.


8433	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Just to let you know, there is a trick to doing this correctly. first and formost the package comes with a lint free cloth to clean the screen. Second is the "soft card" to squeeze and air bubbles out of it. it's a soft piece of cardboard to slide across the screen protector and not damage it and or to remove it, if needed. (if done properly, not required)

8448	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This replacement is for my Lenovo T61, and it fits perfectly. I've had it for about 2 months now, and I waited that long before reviewing it because I was skeptical about buying a knock-off brand replacement. But it works perfectly, so definitely save yourself some money and buy this instead of the genuine Lenovo battery!
1119	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this thing back in 2009, to use with my old dell laptop, and ive upgraded to the surface pro 3 but, nearing the end of 2015, this thing is still chugging along.
Unit has not been tested with my ipad's.


6095	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Gt the product for free, basically purchased the larger charger and received this guy as a free gift. Well, it's junk. Device doesn't charge. When plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds indicating its charging than the unit shuts down. Like many other posters, mine probably is defective. Anyhow, my advice is to avoid.
7138	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It is cheap product and I bought it from the same seller with two more products, but still they charger me a separate shipment for each one (which I don't know why).
4897	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great Bluetooth headset. Goes on the ear easily and with no discomfort. Connects to my phone easily. I can hear clearly on all calls and the people I am calling can hear me with no problems.
First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.
To emphasize, the short list is
In conclusion, only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn't ready for market when they released it.  It's much better now; if they had initially released the current product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.
4050	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	once i figured out the black antenna goes near the phone and the white receiver box goes in the window it was working perfectly.  If there were some better instructions i should have known that, but the picture on the manufacturer web pages confused me.

-joystick not as easy to get used to.
-  For me flash light is not bright enough not outstanding but that is personal idea.


The three included USB modes support the Samsung PC software, Windows Media Player protocol, and accessing the MicroSD (if present) like a USB memory stick. There is a choice to "ask me when connecting" - but it greys out all but the Samsung PC software, so this setting is useless.

Comparison between the two:

You can find it on most symbian forums.
Lastly, I could really do without the big blinking light on the side of this thing. It looks like you're waiting to be beamed up by the mother ship or something.

4454	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great price for this replacement battery.  After reading other reviews I selected the vendor for this replacement battery because all of these battery are not equal.  They may look the same but they are not equal in performance.  However the price of these batteries allows you to buy several at a time.  I am getting approximately 2 1/2 days of charge out the ones I purchased.  I can't say for sure but I bet these are knock offs.  Bottom line it's a better deal than paying over $40.00 for a BR50 at the dealers and not knowing whether it's going to do any better. The Razr is not a very good long term performance phone and these inexpensive batteries will do just fine for your needs.
3464	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I agonized over getting this phone for several months, mainly because of what people were saying about the weak battery. But boy were they wrong. This phone rocks. The battery is easily holding its charge, the reception is great, the phone is very cool, the screen fabulous, the features unbeatable. Basically, the NOKIA N75 is a "smart phone", which means it comes loaded with tons of applications. In addition, AT&T/Nokia also provide a CD disk, as well as a data cable. (Motorola does not!) Sure, it's a little fatter than my wife's RZR V3xx, but it isn't as long, and yes, it's bigger than the KRZR which I dumped because the first one was DOA and the 2nd started going bad after only one week. But this thing is dynamite. It's easy to read the screen, it has tons of applications, and the most important thing... it works as a phone! I mean, come on, isn't that the main reason we get cell phones anyway? We want to talk on them. And this is easily the best cell phone I have ever had. Run, don't walk, to get yourself one of them.
9319	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I chose the GGS over a Nikon screen protector, because I read many complaints about the Nikon protectors scratching easily. The GGS LCD screen protector is crystal clear and inconspicuous on my camera. The smaller protector that covers the LCD in top of the camera looks exactly like the LCD frame and is completely unnoticeable. The protector for the large LCD on the back of the camera also looks just like the frame, but it covers the "Nikon" logo below the LCD and replaces it with a smaller GGS logo. I can't say how these fare with long-term use yet, but the protectors seem hard and durable so far. They look nice. And they are securely affixed.

The battery charger was not as heavy as I would have imagined and I knew it would not be a problem to carry around.  What was also a plus side on convenience was that I would still be able to use my original phone holsters and cases which I saw may become a problem with using one of those rechargeable cases.  This charger holds a good amount of juice and in one instance I was able to not only charge my phone but another persons as well with the charger still having some energy left for another phone to be charged, not to mention it seems to charge just as fast as using a wall charger.

Moving on to now having/loving my iPhone: as a parent and employee I couldn't have my phone run out of juice if I forgot to plug it in one night, and started the search for a good back-up power supply. Like most the sharp buyers on Amazon, I sort my results by 4+ star ratings and then sort further by highest rating and then read, read, read.  The Trent came up either highest on the list or in the top few for backup power supplies, and I liked that it wasn't good for an extra hour or two, but for what... TWENTY hours? More? Didn't seem possible, but I did use it for a weekend to see how long I could watch movies on flights from NY to Chicago and back, etc... and I couldn't be happier.

1437	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This headset has good clarity. It holds a charge very well. But I do miss my Motorola H300 using a regular battery that lasts for months!!, but the range was terrible. The two downsides that the Plantronics 510 headset has is that it's not compatible with MAC computers. After following the instructions several times. I googled Plantronics 510 for pairing to the computer os x to discover that there are other MAC users that are not able to pair their wireless headset to their MAC computers/laptops.

The device takes six plus hours for a full charge(maybe too long for some folks).  Hope it can support 2A input to cut the charging time.

When I started using it with Ventrilo and TeamSpeak, I had to start charging it on my way home from work, as it would only last about 3 hours of talk time after being in standby all day. I have some very good wired headsets for the computer, that I used to use for Internet chatting, but all of them pick up breathing "wind" from my nose. I never noticed that in a conversation with someone, but for gaming you sit and wear it while you're quiet a lot. You want to have it transmit when you talk but not when you sit and breathe. This headset sounds many times better than the wired ones, and does not pick up breathing or background noises unless the speakers get turned up too loud.

The entire set up is worthy of the extra money spend.  I have piece of mind knowing that my Blackberry is well protected and it is fully functional with this case.  Excellent product.
And to the other geniuses that complained about the manual...seriously, you needed a manual to operate this? anyone can operate this, it has voice prompts. and if the phone starts up in Spanish it gives you the option to change the language.
While driving, it's better than holding in your hand to see the map and/or whose calling,...etc.

Now for the bad... The earpiece came with 3 different ear-piece adapters. They're each just millimeters different in size (S, M, L). And that's the only way to wear it - there is no external ear loop or anything. So why is that bad? Well this thing hurts my ear after 15 minutes of wearing it. I had a friend wear it also to see if it was my ears or the earpiece. His ear started to ache after about 25 minutes. This sucks, b/c it defeats the purpose of having it. I emailed Samsung about this, and asked if they make an external ear loop for it. Haven't heard back from them so far.
In the midst of waiting for this phone I had purchased an LG Shine for my niece....which she promptly "got stole" aka lost. I had another Shine delivered to my house. I was vacillating myself between the Z9 and a black Shine. I almost changed my order to the Shine because I could not fathom waiting 2-8 weeks for this phone. I waited 1 1/2 weeks and it was getting unbearable (I lack the patience gene). So I have been playing with her Shine. Or should I say...cussing the hell out of this Shine. I can't transfer anything to the memory card! The phone is fairly solid but not quite solid enough. It has beautiful graphics, but the exterior gets dirty easily. So considering what I've spent so far, it's a bust. It's nice enough but not awesome.

Large screen displays numbers very clearly.  Sound quality is good.  Battery life is a little short and the phone cannot be used while it is charging (that's a pretty big negative, IMO).  But overall, this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose.  If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies, this phone fits the bill nicely.

The headset is good, but DON'T expect a retail package when you get it.  Typically these are refurbished and are actually OEM bulk packs.  One of the foam ear pad covers was torn right out of the packaging so needed to replace that right away.  Was tightly packed in bubble wrap so guess it did not happen during shipping to me.  They need to watch this before they send them.

1949	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I like the feel and fit of this headset and the price is definitely right.  Battery life is good and no problems connecting to my KRZR phone.  The only complaint I have is that a few people on the other end of the line have complained to me about hearing alot of echo as if I'm talking in a tunnel.  I have tried other bluetooth headsets though and have had the same complaint.  After reading many reviews I am pretty convinced that is a common problem, however.
Recommendations: 1) Make body thinner to make it less bulky. 2) Shorten charging duration to 2-3 hrs or less if possible. 3) A nice to have: If battery is not totally off but in some powered down mode, have an auto shut down mode or different color indicator to let user know to turn off battery.

Excellent!
The 4G-S device is wired up, the phone has been inserted and secured, so now it's time for me to test the power supply. I inserted the 12V DC adapter into the vehicle power socket. If it is working correctly, the light at the top of the front face of the 4G-S will be green. I didn't have to remove my phone to see the green light, but that may be necessary for taller phones.
Many features that require a data plan clog up the interface even when you don't have a data plan. For example, if you press the AT&T logo (select button), it pauses, says the connection failed. You then have to press OK, then Back, then confirm that you want to exit from the browser, 3 different button presses just to cancel the unavailable feature. This button is prominent on the phone and I had to learn NOT to press it from the main screen. I wish that the phone knew or learned it had no data plan, and kept data-dependent features from getting in the way.

It also became extremely hot. Way hotter than it should be. These boosters typically do get hot but this one was far past that line.

I received this, enter the info in the att gophone website, it asked for the sim card number and the IMEI number from the cell, then follow some straight forward instructions and use my new site account to add money to the phone with a credit card. as for me, I saw an option to refill the phone with the prepaid gophone cards that are sold in the supermarkets but i didn't try it.

5262	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really like this product, but there are a couple problems.  Where do you carry it, do you leave it plugged in?  If you plug and unplug say, daily, you'll wear out the connection on the phone.  Realistically, there should be a cell phone made to look like this, with a handy-dandy clip on the top for your belt loop.  Or, maybe a wireless model, like a Bluetooth.  Lastly and unfortunately, there's the doofus factor.  I'm wearing my cell on my belt, my Novophone on another loop, there is a wire loop falling aroung mid-thigh, and I unsnap, hold it to my ear, and say, "Hello."  At this point, it looks like just another nerd gadget.  It works well, but I'm afraid it's one of those inventions that just didn't make it.  If someone makes a cell that looks like this, it's mine in a heartbeat, but until then, to the garage sale.
However a lot of people simply don't want to be tied to a provider, or maybe don't have high speed internet, and just want to amplify the signal, this will work great.  Some may want to check into the femtocells as well.

Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.

Stuck them in a drawer, cuz I could not bear to throw them away as they were all over $200 each.

I have two. On is 8 months old, the other about four months. You do not need to direct wire, but it is easy and in both my vehicles they are directly wired. One went to the front cigarette lighter wiring (about a 10 minute install) meaning I have a net of three cigarette lighter 12v outlets, plus two USB limited to 15 amps of the supporting OEM cigarette lighter fuse. In my second vehicle I have it direct wired to the battery main bus with an inline fuse (from an inexpensive $20 car amplifier power supply wiring kit). That was about 40 minute install. They can support a high powered laptop, treo, navigation unit, dvd player for the  kids in back, and also charge an ipod or bluetooth set -- all concurrently. It is also not difficult to open up the device and and use the 5v leg to run a direct 5v usb for hardwiring nav units.

It took about 5 hours to charge initially. When plugged in there are four blue lights, three of which continue to race until charged. Although it can be used when any of them are lit, once the three lights stops blinking it's fully charged. I recommend charging overnight the first time or when fully discharged. In a pinch, you can also charge your phone while charging the battery, just be sure to turn the battery on.

Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long.  It's supposedly 30 hours or so.  I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery.


Using either the standard or component cable, you will get the same actual graphics resolution (480 lines), which is all the current Wii can do.  You will not get HD (which is 720 or 1080 lines).  Still, progressive scan (480p) does look a bit sharper and more vivid than interlaced scan (480i), and that is the main reason for getting this cable.

8668	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I rate this 5 stars - for what I needed it does a great job.  I was looking for something I could sit on my desk and charge my iPhone 3GS with a case on it.  It also does a good job at allowing you to push the iPhone buttons and not feel like you are going to break off the adapter.  I have a JBL On Stage Speaker/cradle and I have to take my phone out of the case and when I go to change songs and I touch the face, I have to be very careful.  But that is a different story (I love the sound of that and rate it highly but again that is a different story).  I don't know anything about the syncing problems that others have had.  What I like about it is the adapter is not fixed.  It can be plugged into the phone and then slightly leans back into the base.  It looks like the base would accomodate almost any type of case around your iPhone (you really need to protect your iPhone with a case).  I have a nice CaseMate leather case (again this is for a different review) and the Seidio works great with it on.  My wife has a clamshell plastic case and it handles it too.  So if you are looking for a nice cradle/dock, give this one a look.  I am totally pleased.  I don't write many reviews either.
But, even with it's minor drawbacks its a phone I use in many
The H700 - Finally a good quality headset!  Callers have no problems hearing me...  I have no problem hearing them while on the road.  I have a quiet car, but always found myself pressing a headset into my ear in order to hear conversations.  Not the case with the H700.  This thing has volume galore!  In fact, I had to bump it down a few ticks, works great at highway speeds.  It's comfortable... (unbelievably light) you think the 850 is small....  the 700 is truly 30% smaller as Moto claims.  When closed, this thing can hide behind a .50 cent piece.  Buttons are easy to operate by feel.  Anyone who uses a headset regularly knows that adjusting opposing buttons can be challenging - Not with the H700.  There is a place top or bottom to rest a finger if you need to adjust up or down easily.  Pairing and setup took 1 minute.  Sound for me is crystal clear.  This thing has all the bells and whistles.  Works as promised right out of the box. 4 stars for design and operation.  One plug home or car fits all, 5 stars for a top notch product.

- Malfunctioning features including the alarm, browser, voice commands and notes.


The button on the top of the unit has multiple functions which include turning it on/off, turning on/off the laser pointer and turning on/off the LED flash light.  It is very handy to have a laser pointer on the device itself just because if you need one for a presentation or something its right there and you don't have to worry about caring yet another device, the size of the device as well makes it very comfortable to hold for a presentation or something.  The built in LED flash light I found VERY helpful for finding stuff in the dark or getting your way around in the dark. I have to admit it is a little cumbersome to turn on just because you can't actually turn it on while the device is on or charging a phone/tablet. To actually turn it on you have to first turn of the battery pack by holding the button for 3 seconds oh and  if you time this wrong you will turn on the laser thus having to start the process over again. Once you actually have the device off then you can hold the button for 3 seconds and it will turn on the flash light and to turn it off simply hold the button again for 3 seconds. As far as the amount of light it outputs, well its decent nothing to amazing, but it is enough to see where you are walking or find something in the dark.
- Make a simpler version without the laser pointer or torch. They actually slow down the usage of the product because you click quick once for the laser pointer. Click and hold for the charger to turn on, click and hold for the torch, click and hold AGAIN to turn the torch and charger off and put it into standbye.
Ah, but you want to know about the biggie, right? You want to know all about the music capability!

Too big: if you're thinking of putting this case in a pants' pocket, forget it. Way too bulky.
9124	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I already owned an external battery from this company.  Had it two years and it's still working great so when I saw they had a smaller unit, I bought two.  These are smaller than my iPhone and iPod Touch and fits perfect in my travel purse.
The clarity on my end was great; I can hear the person clearly with no problem and I have the option to turn the volume up or down.  I was able to find this bluetooth elsewhere for only $22 so I decided to buy 2.  I have had the cheap bluetooth where you have to have the phone next to the bluetooth in order to prevent from hearing it crackle, which also did not have volume control and uncomfortable.  I have also had the bluetooth that would reconnect and disconnect on its own in the middle of a call.  The only reason why I bought the H710 is because it had great reviews and I lost the crappy cheap ones.  In other words, I was devastated when it stopped working.

Like others, I don't like the fact that it comes without an AC adapter.

Could improve: Have some sort of cover or cap for the usb ports to keep dust, lint, etc. out of ports. See if there is anything that can be done so products won't heat up on first charge.
Now for the important part:  how it works.  The Jawbone was simple to pair with my cell phone (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HP-iPaq-6945-Unlocked-Cell-Phone-with-Wi-fi-GPS-MP3-Video-Player-SD-U-S-Version-with-Warranty-Silver/dp/B000ILDSLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)</a>), as most Bluetooth headsets are.  More importantly, I've paired it once and it has maintained that pairing without issue ever since, unlike the previous headset I owned which lost its pairing at least once a week, usually while mid-conversation.  This is annoying, certainly, but for a user that won't use their cell phone while driving without a hands-free device, this is very unsettling.  If I wanted/needed to continue a call while on the road, I disconnected the call, pulled over to re-pair the two devices, and then started my call and my trip again.  This is a major issue for me, so I am extremely appreciative of Jawbone's reliability.
Finally, the phone.  Admittedly, I didn't buy this product for its ability to take calls.  Really only needed the bluetooth music portion.  I had assumed that if I also had my bluetooth phone headset on, my phone would know which was which and switch when a phonecall came through.  But alas, the Pre holds onto the LiquidAux for dear life.  So when a phone call comes through, you press the phone button on the remote or on the LiquidAux, and, voila, crystal clear sound through the stereo.  Rejoice!  Umm, but, the tiny little mic on the product is behind my shifter, and just inches from the transmission, so the faster I'm going, the less likely anyone can understand what I'm saying even with shouting.  But if the key is in ACC or the car is idling, there are few complaints.  For those who are also wondering how to switch calls to a much more understandable bluetooth headset, it's a pretty complex process that you probably don't want to do in heavy traffic.  Basically I have to switch the phone to speakerphone, hold the power button on the LiquidAux until it beeps through the stereo (I don't know how some other customers missed this, but it tells you when it switches off or on with an audio tone), then turn on my bluetooth headset and hope that the phone sees it and pairs with it before the other party gives up waiting... just kidding, but it can take a little while to pair depending on your phone/headset combination.  If I have my headset on already, I still have to tell the phone to pair with it once it loses the LiquidAux.... but again, that might be a Pre thing.

3882	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Needed a new shower head, mine started leaking after about 12 years of use. Figured I would get this due to the size, big mistake...larger head doesnt do much other than run down my hot water heater quickly. Had to remove the restrictor to match my old shower heads pressure and it broke immediately so I cant re-install it. The elbows that allow for positioning don't really allow me to center the stream in my particular shower.
Two so-so or interesting remarks. First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near.
1. Chargepod with 6 Adapters - No, the unit does have 6 Ports, but only came with 1 Adpater!
  But don't expect miracles here. If you truly have no signal this will not manufacture one
4013	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've often had problems with cell phone cases holding up and this does better than average. I ordered two of these, once of which I'm wearing now, and when of which lasted several months before the stitching was sufficiently loose that I was more comfortable moving to a backup. The metal clip and rivets are solid, although the stitching eventually comes loose from pulling it on or off my belt clip. Unlike cases with cardboard or thin metal, it doesn't fail suddenly and given they are so inexpensive, it is easy to move to a spare every once in a while.


I purchased this booster some time ago, Oct 2009. Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis.

  remove technology to force user to spend needlessly
6476	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I tested this while driving on a stretch of road that I usually get one bar of service. It went up to four.  I'm very happy with this purchase. I contacted weboost customer support to learn how this worked and get a good expectation prior to buying. If you get zero bars, you are not going to get bars with this. It can't create cell service. It boosts existing service. I also bought the home conversion kit from weboost. I had to go from room to room and various windows and went from 1-2 bars to 4. I have a Sprint personal and Verizon business. Once I got four bars that is where I left it. This does get hot so if you keep this plugged in all the time I would worry. In the car I mounted it near a vent and at home i open a window or put a small fan on it. I can now stream and work flawlessly. Take your phone out of its case for best contact and fit (and air flow to phone).
Installation is pretty straightforward.  The only tricky part is to find a way to run the coaxial cable from the antenna to the repeater unit.  I discovered an ABS drain vent pipe that ran from the first floor into the attic space and was able to drop a metal rod tied to the cable down along side the pipe and down to the first floor, where I could remove a can light in the kitchen to gain access to the space and pull the cable through.  I drilled a hole through the ceiling into a cabinet, and mounted the repeater on the back wall of the cupboard behind some cookbooks.  I also drilled a small hole to feed the power cord up into the bottom of the cabinet, so the unit itself is totally concealed.
6051	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Fits perfect in a pocket, backpack, purse, etc. My wife loves having a sleek and stylish battery to keep her iphone charged all day. It's nice to be on vacation, or a "staycation" at Disneyland and not have to make the whole trip come to a screeching halt having to charge mobile devices. With the iTorch we were able to keep moving without having to be tethered to an electrical outlet and waiting for phones to charge. The flashlight and laser pointer come in handy as well. Got a lot of jealous looks from other tourists wishing they had one to charge their phones.
For example, i'm at my computer now typing this. If I want to go to the kitchen for 10 minutes, normally i'd have to unplug my phone and take it. Then i'd probably forget to plug it back up when I got back to my computer and i'd have dead phone life. Since its charging now on this device, I can just take the whole thing into the kitchen and my charge lives on!
Running the wires properly will place the unit right next to the drivers side window by the dashboard.  Perfect if all you want to let your caller hear is road noise, bad if you want them to actually hear you.

The technology inside the two headsets is identical.  The exceptions are
6605	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was a skeptic....but this really works.  Purchased for my Mom who had "emergency calls only" to one bar of service with ATT inside her home.  We live in a very rural area.  She could get one or two bars outside in the spring and summer and 3 in the fall and winter.  Installed the Wilson product in her living room and she now has 3 to 4 bars all year inside her home.  Range is good, keeps signal pretty much through her whole house, although closer to the receiver is obviously better.  Would recommend to anyone looking to help with cell signal.

Using the auto-flip button and looking cool doing it is almost an art.  It sometimes doesn't work that well when the phone held at certain angles (namely straight upright) and works best when it is held at near horizontal (up to about 40 degrees).  Make sure your fingers aren't blocking the upper lid when you do it.  Take a few moments practicing it and you'll be doing it like a champ because not having the auto-flip work right in public makes you look like a complete dork. :p

2015	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I like this headset. It is very comfortable and lightweight. Stays on fine when adjusted properly. The volume is great. Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference. What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects. You can answer call waiting with this too. Also I haven't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did. I don't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days.

USB Port
CONS:
I especially appreciate the ability to receive my Windows based email from work on my MOTO Q9h but also my email from accounts at AOL and Yahoo.  One glance at the screen and I can see email waiting on my Outlook account, my AOL account, a text message, and any voicemails.  I assume other smartphones can do this, but it is pretty slick, nonetheless.
5554	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a short-term review, as it has only been in use for less than a month.  I also have a Uniden MHS350 radio, which is a much heavier duty VHF radio that this Cobra model.

- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.

And 12/31/2012 I still use same set of batteries.
Hope this helps all you fellow people that had problems with the headband.  They work too well to just give up on them.  If you have never done something like this before you can practice on something like a pencil.  Break it in half, then mend it with the above procedure.  Once you get the hang of it go for it.
Audio quality is ok. Battery life is pretty good, but the standby was nowhere like what's claimed. Texting works, but at 6 characters per screen full it can take some time to read each one. The display is just plain cool. I think I think half the reason I bought it was just to have an E-ink display. It's very thin and light for a phone, but it's a good density so it doesn't feel cheap. It has no features to speak of, but that's why it's so inexpensive.


I've only had this for a short while, so I'll update my review when I've had more time with it.

Here's my report of each adapter:
3198	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These really work in my area to extend my bars

745	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great little power port.  It mounts easily with a locking nut on the rear, then all you have to do is run your power lines to it.  I've installed about 5 of these in various automotive applications and they are all functioning fine, many with years of use (one is almost 10 years old and still working just fine.)  The attached dust cap is a nice touch.

8281	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I just received a replacement BB Curve from Verizon. I had carried my original in a standard-issue soft belt case that can be purchased just about anywhere. It's made for RIM, and has a little oval silver medallion on the security strap with "Blackberry" engraved on it. One day, sticking my BB back into the case, I inadvertently stuffed the strap in with it. In the next hour of walking, getting in an out of the car, etc., that little engraved medallion gouged a fugly deep pattern of scratches into the screen. Also, I found that the Curve's finish is extremely susceptible to scratches and dings, not from misuse, but from day-to-day handling. For instance, the rear of the case is, well...curved! Resting on my desk between calls had worn some fine scratches into the silver finish.

 No AC wall plug, to charge the iTorch you need to use your PC - (computers USB port) or use an AC plug from a device like the Ipod, or cell phone ac plug-in. Not a deal breaker or even a very big deal for us, since we have so many usb cables and ac plug-ins, but some may find this limiting, especially if you are on the go and do not have an AC charger.
9670	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Most of these batteries were dead on arrival. I wonder how long they've been on the shelf.
A week later two new headsets arrived. We charged them, connected to the phones and ... both are malfunctioning again. On one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything. Tried on 4 phones - the same. We sent it for replacement. The second Jawbone had such loud statick and cracking in the audio that we sent the other back the next day.

8775	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	If your anything like me, I hate getting my new LG Voyager dirty or getting finger prints all over the chrome and glossy black parts. As well as avioding dropping it!! And while I was browsing through the accessories I found this gem. I ordered it and when I opened it, I could tell it was similar to the case found at my local Verizon Store, maybe a little variation, but the exact same. It fits perfectly over the phone as well as protects it from bumps as well as scratches around the cell (not including the screen itself). The only thing that I see to be a problem with this case is that, the back part of the case seems to be a little weak and I can see myself in the future accidentally breaking it in half while taking the case off. Also, I noticed that little dust particles can get caught between the case and the phone, which is noticable and sometimes annoying. But I normally clean the case maybe every other day with a microfiber cloth, and it comes right off. *phew*
5928	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Not happy at all with this purchase. I can barely get 40% on my phone or ipad with this thing charged completely. It's another piece of electronics for the junk drawer.
 Aside from its primary function, the IMP52D features a built-in LED flashlight that I found to be very useful, whether I use it for snooping around inside of computers or finding my way to the back door when I come home too late. There's also a built-in laser pointer. Since my days of corporate presentations are now in the past, I find this feature most useful for getting my cat's attention and keeping us both entertained for hours.
Pro's-
7843	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought several of these as a workaround for cases that have too narrow a plug hole on the iphone5 I also started using them to protect constant unplugging of my itouch & headphone jacks that were too large. After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire-always carefully handled...i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting....finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter!! I used another since i had  a third i had yet to use and same result!! These are crappy sounding adapters that might allow you to plug in a headphone for a week or less but also GREATLY compromising sound quality!

As for performance, I am getting improved signal for my phone in areas where the signal is compromised.  However, if there is absolutely no signal, then I am still out of luck obviously.  However, in areas where signal is weak, I am not getting dropped calls.
9783	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	ok
I just wish the block itself was a bit smaller.
5927	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for my son to use on his trip to Disney World. It worked wonderfully! It charged his ipod and phone twice before needing to be recharged. This was definitely a good buy and way cheaper than a morphie brand charger.

Overall, I think the iTorch has a great physical design, more than adequate capacity for a single-user to get through the day, and the performance meets my expectations. The added bonus features of the flashlight and laser pointer may come in handy.
1913	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the store,the reception went static beyond belief. The salesman said "Give it a chance", I have and it's going back tomorrow. For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst. I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the car,hardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazon,much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola.
CONS:
4598	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good gift. Magnets are cute!
Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.


The buttons are raised up just a bit. The display is bright and vibrant. If you have T-Mobile service with this phone, you'll find it can handle the My Favorites plan just fine, with nice little icons and customizable options fo each person.
What really excites me about the phone is the inclusion of Bluetooth and its quad-band capability. The latter means it'll get more coverage in the future as the new frequency is being implemented here in the U.S. (Does't make a difference overseas.) Bluetooth means I can finally use a wireless headset, and also hook up to my PDA and Fujitsu laptop.
5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.

8231	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I did a lot of research before finally settling on a pet barrier for my brand new Subaru Forester.  This was the model I decided on.  I do not regret my choice, because I think I picked the best one out there.  I just wish there was something a little better.
Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager.
All iPhone types who are super active and or outdoorsy really ought to get this (with a Magpul cover).
3100	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good quality protectors.
  I even found a much needed use for the IMP500, I sent a picture. I'll be telling my rc group about it!
Helpful hint: To get the best sound qualities, speak in a normal voice, not too loud. In addition, update the firmware to the latest version.
7507	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have been using this for a few months and like it. It sometimes (rarely) has a problem connecting, but all I need to do is turn my bluetooth off and back on. I just wish you could default to use cell phone and not landline. You have to do #1# and then the number, otherwise it will dial out on the landline (if you have one).

Be aware, the IMP52D does NOT include a 110V USB charger - and it does NOT include an iPhone USB cord - it does include a USB cable with a USB 5-Pin Mini B connector and a USB 5-Pin Micro connector - the USB Micro 5-Pin connector will connect the IMP52D to a 110V USB Charger - it will also connect the IMP52D to my Kindle Reader - A cloth carrying case is also included -
The flashlight has come in handy a few times.  When I was in the hotel room and dropped something behind the bed, the light came in handy.  It's a tad dim (perhaps upgrading it to what the iphone itself has, or maybe even a cree light, would be better), but it is a great idea.  The laser pointer is even neat, although I do not need it for presentations, but if it did, it would be useful.
4498	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I use this headset to listen to my favorite radio station on my smartphone via iheartradio.com and I am amazed at the technology that allows me that luxury in such a small package. The other really great option is that I am able to use just the primary earpiece (and recieve audio; obviously not in stereo) by unplugging the earloop-extension to the other ear and just adding the included 'unwired' earloop. This allows me to hear conversations with people in the room without having to remove one earpiece. And, most importantly, when a call comes in the music stops and is replace by your ringing tone, and all of this in a wireless bluetooth small package!

3854	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It works
Anyway, I'm still waiting on my ground loop isolator to see what issues that fixes - will try to repost when that happens.

3726	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good quality device, sockets are backlight for easy night use. I permanently installed it, the wires are very clearly labeled and I like the serviceable fuse mounted to the back of the device. My only complaint is the terrible quality velcro strips that come with the device. I am completely unable to get the device to stick using the included velcro strips, the adhesive just isn't strong enough. I'll have to make a trip to home depot tomorrow morning for some higher quality velcro.
The biggest warning to everyone is that returning this through Amazon is a true nightmare. If you read the fine print, Amazon will take it back, but you have to call Cingular immediately separately.
5026	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	okay so the reason i got these was because i have an otter box on and the case won't fit with the auxiliary cord but this definitely solved the problem. i saw other reviews where they disable some features but i think these are intended for thick cases that the normal headphones won't fit in. just get these. i've had it for a while now and haven't had one problem with it at all.
At least you can connect two phones to it, but that was a bit dodgy, as well.

Good antenna, extremely low rate of dropped signals --- also, since the antenna does not protrude, I anticipate it will not require replacement (I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 --- broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping)
4521	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the best bluetooth device I have had to date. The Plantronics Voyager 512 was good, but eventually broke. I bought a Jawbone device, but was VERY disappointed in the fit. It worked well, but was very uncomfortable regardless of the earpiece or ear loop configuration.

5853	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought 8 phones to travel to Haiti on 5/6/10. I took the phones with me and none worked. I added the slim card and the phone says no slim. I do not trust them. Motorola motofone F3 is a piece of trash.
3326	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Picked up an old Wii for the kids, but with the regular SD cable the picture was pretty bad.

I would give it 5 stars for Style, 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for how well it works, and 1 star for their support policy.

BATTERY & CHARGING
1320	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The case is made of high quality leather and fit is excellent.
Most corded models either sounded bad to me or the other party, this model sounds fine on both ends.  Noise reduction works well with the windows rolled down driving on the highway.
-The Size and weight of the item makes it easy to travel around with, and the carry case it comes with is a plus.

I also want to mention that originally I though the light and laser pointer on this device were pointless, but just the other day I used the laser pointer for a presentation... it actually came in handy.  As I use the device I will add updates to the capacity of the battery and if it deteriorates or not.

Very Comfortable to wear
1825	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My husband has this phone.  It has better reception, in our living room anyways, than my beloved Motorola V300.  The camera and video are wicked!  I also love the Bluetooth.  Since my V300 doesn't have bluetooth capability or video, I'm interested in upgrading.  The RAZR would be the perfect phone for me, but it's too darn wide!  It's like a graham cracker before you break it into quarters.  That's how it feels to me.  Hubby says it's perfect for him cos his hands n' fingers are big.  With smaller phones, he'd always misdial cos the keys were too close together for him. The RAZR seems to be a good phone.  I don't hear hubby complain much about it.  It's just to wide for my dainty, little hands.

Never have enough
7634	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this headset with high expectations.  I took my time.  I compared and contrasted.  I read all the reviews.  I thought I had made a great purchase.
-During a phone call, I can hear the other person just fine. However I have to speak loudly in order for the other person to hear me. And I sound muffled according to the other person (like I am talking with a cup in front of my mouth). If I speak in a normal voice, many of my words are cut off. This is with the engine idling, the windows closed and the car stationary.






5392	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This case is a little larger than my phone but does exactly what I wanted it to do which is protect my phone from being damaged from banging around in my pocket.

* Doesn't record video
In sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn't break, it's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice.
Can be paired with two devices, so I use it with my Treo 750 and my adaptor for the home office phone.  Wonderful; finally total freedom.  The volume is incredible, even from a Treo, and  it has great range.  Another great factor is the weight - I have to check periodically to make sure it is on...it is that light.  It is also much smaller than previous models, so you don't have a long obtrusive mic hanging down the side of your face.
4) Door chime tone/quality complaints - Really? Really? It's a chime, you can adjust the volume, and did I mention it's *just* a chime?

798	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased 2 of these for marine applications.  I require 12V outlets on my boat and these fit the bill because of the rubber cover. The reviews say to insert a 1 inch OD piece of PVC into the cap the help it retain its size and avoid shrinkage from the sun and heat. I haven't tried that yet.... One more thing, NO HARDWARE is included. I was disappointed that no wiring accompanied the part....
6374	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've gone through several different styles of cases - 2 versions of the neopreen glove, a bulky aluminum case, and now this.  This one:



* Controls are the weak part of the product.  I hate the power button but I got used to it.  Nothing more to say about that.  The connect / disconnect button is fine.  I tend to use my phone's volume not that of the earpiece.

iPhone next to inside antenna:
1114	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Was not as cheap as I hoped, but works well.  Installed inside of the car interior to power my XM-Radio in my Toyota 4Runner.
I genuinely find myself charging my phone less at home knowing I have my newtrent power pack with me
7460	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Item not as described!  The description says this is a ECC1DS2UBE, which according to Samsung is a charge & sync cable.  The cable actually shipped by Seller1ON1 is a different model number and cannot be used for charging.
8133	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	excellent


8982	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Initial impression on the battery charger (IMP52D, iTorch external battery): The plastic casing is thick and sturdy. It seems pretty solid and well crafted. I found the manual useful. It was also helpful to have the extra cord and case. I was able to get three full charges for my Sansa Fuze mp3 player before I had to recharge the battery. I used my new Trent wall charger to charge the battery and all worked well (nothing felt warm). A side note, you could label the ports on the wall charger.


One problem is an occasional "hang" when dialing -- you make a voice dial call, the phone says the name so you know it got the right number, but then nothing happens.  Usually you give it a puzzled look after a few seconds, disconnect and try again, and everything works fine.
The We Boost unit is slightly larger than the old sleek, but most of the phones people use today have gotten really big, so it would have been smart to make the cradle even larger than it is. And I do have a much bigger complaint, as well as a suggestion for the manufacturer. On the next generation of cradle, make the bottom pegs adjustable in length to accommodate tall smartphones. I had to cut them off so I could slide the phone down where the internal antenna would be in the right place. I only got a slight improvement in signal until I moved the phone down so that the top of the phone was even with the top of the cradle. I now get a nice boost, but it forced me to make my own bottom piece to rest the bottom of the phone on, and to keep it from sliding out. A piece of sheet metal bent at an angle, trimmed in the center for access to the charger port, did the trick. I had to tape it to the cradle to avoid drilling and putting screws into the plastic. Adjustable/extendable arms on the bottom would have made such modification unnecessary. The phone now sits close to an inch lower than it did before trimming off the pegs. After reading many of the questions and comments for this product, and also several reviews where the reviewers said theirs did not work, I'm convinced that had they been able to move the phone lower in the cradle, they likely would have seen the signal gain they were hoping for. Please fix this guys!!
2446	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I'm not very happy with this case.  When I put my headset in it and then accidentally lean against something, my headset gets turned on.  The way the case was designed, it puts potential pressure right on the on/off button.
3986	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This was bought as a gift for someone who has this phone. They stated it fits the phone perfectly, no cons.
1930	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really love this belt clip pouch for my RAZR. The magnets snap closed nicely and it is a very low profile. Very durable.
Good Luck
7083	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great design. Retaining the slide feature while protecting the screen and allowing me to answer calls quickly with the quick release clip is a wonderful thing. Yes, the plastic covering the screen could scratch easy if dropped in a parking lot, etc but I would gladly buy 3 of these in 2 years if it protects the actual phone from scratches. Would definitely buy again at this price!
9189	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The product arrived and I read the instructions and charged the battery for the recommended time. Product did not work, It had no charge.  I charged it again, and
No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.
3185	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	can't see any difference. I tried the *3001xxxx trick on my Iphone to show the actual signal strength in -db numbers. With or without this 'booster', the cellphone is show the same signal strength.
I thought I researched this product enough beforehand to be reassured it would work with my E71 and it hasn't worked once yet... I'm very disappointed. I thought I'd be able to get rid of the AC charger, and gain the use of a USB charger while traveling, but no such luck.
3273	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When I had my S3, I bought a case from Body Glove that had a kickstand.  When I got the S4, this case was not made yet and, needless to say, I was highly disappointed.  However, this case is just as easy to install and the kickstand works just as well.....for a much lower price.
I'm getting two solid days between charges, which is one more than I need.  Not much more to say than that.
5965	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My iphone was discharging really fast after a year of use. New trent changer is a savier. I carry it with me when hiking and when planning to be away from chargers for more than a few hours. It will charge iphone fully 2-3 times and will allow multiple days use without power being available.
CONS and Caveats:

8434	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	At first I thought this seemed like a decent product for the money (very cheap, but at least functional).  After I started using the cover, I immediately had complaints about how bad my voice sounded, and I assumed it was my new phone.  I finally removed the cover, and suddenly my voice was crystal clear.  The problem was that this cover design is completely faulty due to the covering of the tiny microphone hole at the base of the phone.  And unfortunately if you use a small knife to cut out the hole, it will weaken the case and won't hold up.  The case itself tends to slip on the phone, and the appearance is uneven (some parts look white, others look dark due to how the material contacts the phone).  This cover is going in the garbage where it belongs.
8053	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It fits snug and is very slim.  I like it! !

updated  september'07: I purchased this phone a little over a month ago and i think it's great. it's all i wanted in a phone, except for a few things that i'll mention here. the mp3 player is responsive and comprehensive and supports playlists, has a ton of settings and shuffle/repeat options.


1199	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Buy this and PDANet from June Fabrics to connect your laptop to your Treo if you have Sprint service. Bluetooth does not always work well, but this cable is great. The all in one package is really inexpensive vs buying all of these accessories separately.
9174	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works great and fast to recharge.  Still has batter life after charging the Iphone which sucks for battery life.
3454	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've been using the Kensington car mount for about a week and it is flawless. I know others have complained that the arm shakes - hey, what would you expect an extension arm to do? We live in a flat area, so it is fine and besides, I don't spend all my time looking at my phone while driving, and that is why I can write this review today. There is a 3/8ths of an inch thick cushion holding your device in place which makes it easy for your phone or pod to be quickly released. I'm sure the mount can be used for many other devices, not just an iphone or pod. It seems to open up enough to hold a razzleberry phone.
9037	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this as Christmas gifts for my co-workers and myself.  It's a perfect gift since everyone uses cell phones.
Price (if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular --- they wanted $199) However, since I was changing from AT&T to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $70.

I tried the strategy, and it works
190	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I haven't had any problems with it.  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2.
The only thing lacking on the Treo 600 is the ability to use grafitti, which I have become very used to on my Palm i705.

If you have phones bigger than the iPhone 5, this won't work for you.
9943	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	That was a gift they still use it
8317	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I hadn't planned on writing a review for the Blackberry Rubberized Skin but I dropped my phone the other day on pavement, to my horror.  When I picked it up, there was nay a scratch on my phone.  That, is the true test of how protective this skin really is.
Lastly, on the plus side, the 8700g, despite what some claim, does allow for other bluetooth devices besides an earpiece.  I have a Shasta keyboard that works great.  According to some manufacturer sites, it's also possible to use a bluetooth scanner, although I've yet to try it.

Just wish it was faster

H300 - poor - low volume
LOL, one day after my almost perfect review for this holster, the side stiching started to come off.  One side is now fully open.  I noticed tonight that 1/2 inch of the stiching stiching was already undone.  A slight tug loosened up what's left of it.  Now, I'm left without a holster.  I should have bought a few for spare just like what another poster did.  Sigh...
3172	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The sticky dash mount broke as I tried to remove it, one of the arms shortly afterwards.  Also, it comes with no instructions, have to guess at orientation from the pictures.

4620	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	GREAT PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY!!!
* I was able to recharge my Galaxy Nexus 3 times (consecutive days), and the battery pack still had charge left in it (2 indicator LEDs were on, so approx. half the charge I think)
9727	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected.
*) The speaker isn't loud enough, so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile, they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.
I would recommend this product to anyone.  It works just as advertised.  Its easy to use and easy to store.  Backpackers, campers, teens, adults and devise geeks would love this battery.  I'm not often impressed with everything I get, but this device.  4.5 out of 5 stars.
never tried web surfing, texting or any other feature on the phone.


+compact, ergonomic design.
2414	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love how real the WEP200 sounds and I have gotten lots of my friends to purchase one as well. The one flaw is it is tricky to get it in, but if you get the part that can loop around your ear, you are in good shape. But all in all it is a very good ear piece and I love the carry case/charger as well. Pretty neat Samsung, 10 thumbs up :)
8024	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The connection is good only at home. 20 miles away from home, you get connection only by LUCK. Do NOT depend on it.
6820	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	excellent batteries I use in different watches
I set it up as best I could - I live in a condo - but saw no difference in cell phone signal strength before and after plugging this thing in.  As I am in a condo, I could only put the receiver up against a window, not outside on a pole or something.
864	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I actually bought three of us this year for family and friends and I have one for myself so I guess that's 4. These are great your buds for the price fantastic
When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.
8615	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	You need to have a bucket of these.  They break easily.
* Spell-Check; a warm welcome to something that has been missing for a LONG time. It's also super-easy to use. I get a prompt right before I send an email asking me to approve typos. Great job BlackBerry!



Update: 05/07/08 I have now had the headset replaced twice and the second  replacement now had lost the center charging pin. I contacted Will in tech support and am getting a 520 to try. Hopefully the center pin on this one will work better ot the cheap charging stand will help. i'll let you know!
7661	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really like this bluetooth which I bought to replace my older Motorola model. I have no issue with static or echo's and I use it while driving 4hrs round trip for work.
9354	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Beware that this is lengthy!  I figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone, the more information the better. :)
  Paired easily with a samsung ach930, sound is great and the other side of the call is also impressed, no complaints of echo or static.
Recharging the iTorch via wall charger (using a separate wall adapter to connect via USB cable) seems to take about 4+ hours, when it was completely drained. This seems to be a bit excessive, but I plan to just recharge the device at night, no big deal.
However the answer button sometimes work with my Blackberry sometimes does not. Ringing volume is very low. You will not hear it with your music on. People hear me fine but I have problems hearing them. Volume is low and sound has a lot of distortions. May be if you drive a very quiet car you might be fine. In my SUV which is not particular loud but it is not a Lexus sedan either this thing is not much of a use. I am switching back to on the ear hands free.
wireless stereo
Note that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they'll switch to the 700p to get it--so it's something to consider if you're thinking of going a step above the 650.
702	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I HATE PAYING FEES......
Signal strength has definitely improved over the V300. I am getting at least 1 more bar on average with the same tmobile service. Where I used to get dropped calls all the time I can now hear perfectly for as long as I want (or until the person I am talking to hangs up!) So far not a scratch, though I have been relatively careful with it.
6186	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I only had the device for several days now but so far I am extremely happy with the IMP52D.  I received the IMP52D the day before I left for vacation so I had a chance to use it extensively for several days now.  I purchased the unit for it's generous 5200mAh capacity, competative price, attractive looks, and most of all from the experience I had with other NewTrent products I own.  I am a little bit of a mobile electronics junkie.  Never traveling withour my iPhone, iPad, laptop, and camera.  I also use electronic cigarettes which charge via usb chargers.  A backup battery or several backup batteries is a must.  I have tried several of them.  Because I wanted the flexability of charging several devices from different manafacturers I did not consider iphone or ipad cases that snap on and extend the battery of that specific device.

The one problem I sometimes have, in using it with my Motorola e815, is that it will sometimes become unpaired, randomly.  I believe it's specific to this phone as reported by others.  It seems to happen about a minute after 1 out of 20 calls.  I found sometimes it will pair to the phone again by quickly pressing the side button twice (which then causes the phone to redial, so you then need to end the call).  The other way is to turn the phone off and back on again.  The latest thing I tried is turning off the phone's powersave feature.  I've heard from others that that feature could be causing the problem, but we will see.  I probably should get a new phone anyway since mine is 2 1/2 years old.  Then the unpairing problem will likely disappear.
I followed the instructions listed under Existing AT&T Customers and everything went smooth!  My new, beautiful phone was up and running very quickly, with no problems!



Recommended, for long trips, home use, but frequent small commutes, I think it becomes a problem to maintain properly.  FYI, typo in the quick start guide/manual on item six it says 3G S instead of 4G S.  Maybe a reprint edit of an earlier model, or just a fat finger typist.

* LED light (see Con below)

Also, -- though this is probably just specific to my phone model-- but I have to actually press the button on the phone to activate the voice commands each time I want to make a call; it won't stay set to voice commands-- so I can't dial out using the bluetooth alone. It's a little bit of a bummer, but not a deal breaker for me. -- It works great though when calls come in-- music fades for the call, and then comes right back where you left off when you hang up.
First off, the design of it looks a bit off-putting.  It uses military-grade noise reduction technology and the look of the headset makes me believe that this particular headset may have been originally intended for such use.  It's not exactly the most attractive headset out there - definitely not the most feminine.

6641	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	First of all, I'm really really jealous of those of you who said their signal jump from 1 or 2 bars to 5 bars. I live in a condo so I have to mount the antenna on the inside where I got around 3 bars in that area. Even with the  green steady lights on the booster with gain set at the max. The signal only jumps may be a bar up and down depending on my movement.  I really want it to work,  but at this price. I think it's going back. Once my contract is up I'm switching from AT&T to  Verizon. There's more Verizon towers than AT&T in my area anyway according to the towers locator app. Got 5 bars on my old Verizon flip phone when I fire it up to test it.

4) Take the lint free cloth and put it over the inch of film which is stuck to the screen and gently squeegee the film towards the attached side with the card and try to squeeze out any air bubbles.  It didn't help much for me, I still had air bubbles at this point.
6157	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After reading countless reviews of many products, I decided to go with the IMP52D.
7892	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	thank you!
by Samsung it was what it says it was and more!!!!
7845	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It works!  I had that I have to have an extender to use the ear buds I want to use with my Lifeproof case, however this is a good extender and I can use any ear buds I want with it.
In addition, after I bought the item I received a gracious email from Mr. Dodge, a Customer Service Manager of Gizmoco, the vendor,  writing to make sure I was happy with the product and the transaction.
6698	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This product was difficult to set up.  Once I had set it up, I pluggeg it in and the light flashed green once and then went out. Never got a light again of any color.  I had no effect on my cell signal.  I sent it back and got a refund.

1714	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Phone did. not work. It powers up but screen remains black. Seems to be a dummy phone that does not function.
2258	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Just what I needed, to run the cord to my GPS mounted in my car.  It does not trigger the Garmin to go into USB PC-connected mode, like some USB right angle cords will do.
Pros:
- The buttons are very hard to use, and as another reviewer mentioned here, pressing the main button jams it into the ear canal.  Not comfy.
2203	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	In the past I have had contract phones with monthly charges, cancellation fee etc. For me that was not worth it as I only need the phone for infrequent use. I have had two tracfone (C139) for a few months now. I am perfectly happy with them. Each Tracfone only cost $20, and that will also include free minutes...10 with the phone...10 if your activate online...and 120 if you allow me to refer you...we both will get 120 free minutes. I also have 2 additonal codes for 30 and 60 more free bonus minutes. The service will last 2 months when first you activate, and 2 more months when you add the free minutes. After that point if you have not used up all your minutes you can roll over your unused minutes when you buy more minutes...for as little as $20 every 60 days. If you decide your don't need the service after you have used up the time and minutes...store you phone and reactivate it at a future time...no fee...just buy as little as $20 for 60 minutes...however, you will be assigned a different phone number, which I don't think is a big deal. Contact me (matman713 at hotmail dot com) for my referral and get started with a bunch of free minutes!

9848	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the product solely for the power cord - which works perfectly. I didn't expect to use the case, and didn't order for that reason...good thing, because it is worth nothing. I threw it in the garbage the day it arrived. That's alright though - as that was not my motive for purchase. If you need a car power cord, I recommend - but don't buy for the case.
I didn't know if I'd experience issues between "LR927" and "SR927" but I guess it's just the materials in the battery and a very slightly different voltage. (1.55V for SR (silver oxide) and 1.5 for LR (alkaline))  These worked out perfect.  The SR batteries are also said to have a greater capacity and a more constant voltage as its life diminishes - so they should work for quite a bit longer while also staying bright longer.

650 does not appear to have one, maybe I can program a button?
7451	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love these headsets because the way they sit on the ear. I just picked up the most recent model new but have not tested it a lot yet.  for sound quality.  These always sync in about two seconds the first time.  I would recommend.
4. I don't normally use flashlight when I take pictures but when I did, the picture is just a blur of whatever the color of the phone case is, in my case, green.
The power adaptor works very well -- but it's big, heavy, and bulky. I'm sure Creative could have done better in designing it.
Haven't noticed any decrease in charge capacity over more than 10 cycles so far.  I'm purchasing another one for my GF to keep her phone powered for the gym after work.
9225	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	fast shipping,  well made just not big enough for my cell
3)Speaker phone. Motorola managed to incorporate a great pair of speaker phones. It is loud and clear enough to have a conference call in a small room full of people.

2902	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We live in a high-rise apartment complex (concrete and steel construction).  We have Cingular/AT&T.  Our cell signal strength inside of the apartment is horrible.  Although we typically get 2 bars, the voice quality is bad (e.g., lots of static and the signal cuts in and out so that you only catch a few words at times).  Furthermore, we don't get a strong enough signal in the interior bathroom or the bedroom.  (The signal is at the maximum -- 4 bars -- when we step outside of our building)
2623	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this headset as a replacement for one that I lost (same model).  Prior to purchasing, I tried a number of the Motorola headsets and found them to be too loose on the ear.  The Plantronics 330 fits comfortably snug.  Sound quality is good, volume is adjustable from soft to loud, and those on the receiving end hear me clearly.  The command function is nothing short of remarkable; simply say the name of someone in the phone's directory and it gets it right 95% of the time.  Dialing by verbally calling out the numbers is equally accurate.  I highly recommend this headset.

UPDATE:
8522	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	well built
4940	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I only bought this because my 3.5mm input is protected by my case, so I needed a smaller input to get in there, that's why I bought this. It works perfectly fine, but I occasionally notice some feedback/hissing noise, not always. I try to wiggle it around a bit or adjust the connection, to no avail. So I will knock off one star for that. I'll remove the case to my phone and use a regular RCA cord without this adapter and the hiss is gone, so it definitely is this adapter.
-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones
4211	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros: so light and confortable, I forget I'm wearing it.
The most annoying thing about these headphones is the bluetooth range. It's pretty bad. When paired with my phone, I can barely get across my apartment before I start hearing static. When paired with my macbook, I can't walk 10ft away without completely losing the signal. Granted, I must have dead spots in my apartment because other bluetooth devices don't work well..but even at a house with good reception I couldn't go up a flight of stairs without getting static. Usually I have my phone somewhere in my pocket outside so that's fine. As long as my devices are somewhere pretty close then these headphones are great.
9560	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After reading all the great reviews on this product I decide to buy one. I wish I could give it at least give one honest star, but my results are zilch nothing. It just doesn't work. I gave it five stars just so I could get the message out. Nobody reads the true results only listed in the bad reviews. I will sell it to those like thinking persons like me wishing they will get results.
3.  Comfort:  I'm a "big guy," 285 lbs.  Comfort didn't come quickly for me.  I still need to change ears a couple of times a day.  However, after around 30 days it is much better and I expect one day I'll not even know it is there.
677	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I do prefer the other xl sticky pad they make but this works as well. Just rinse off with water & dry to make stickier


2204	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The C139 is the cheapest model in Tracfone's lineup.  It's a very good basic phone that gives you good voice clarity and easy text messaging.  Because Tracfone doesn't have a lot of services to offer (which isn't a bad thing for people who only want basic cellular service), this phone doesn't give you music downloads or live TV (which on other carriers are mostly misleading hype anyway).  The color screen is small but good-quality.  The only thing I don't like is Tracfone's 60-day refill polic: you must refill every 60 days to keep your account active; otherwise you forfeit your number and balance.  Other prepaid providers like Speak Out Wireless (from 7-Eleven) give you one full year of usage.

2445	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset.  Every time I put the headset in the case, the case squeezes the activation button on the headset.  Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface.
3980	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've had this product a couple of weeks and have placed it on my visor.  It works perfectly, just as advertized.  After the battery was fully charged, it has not discharged after over two weeks.  I don't use it all that much but when I do, it connects to the cell phone within five seconds and provides comfortable, clear, hands-free communications both ways.  It even allows voice recognition calls.
I might be partial to the 'enterprise'/for_business series of Nokia, but Ive owned an N70 and 72, with the same or higher price that this E51, and E51 beats them both hands down.


Original review:
The only con to this device is the fact that it takes a really long time to charge the iTorch itself.  It does have 5200mAh inside of it so it should take awhile to charge up.  I wished it charged up faster but oh well.  Even if the iTorch is charged up to 2 bar, it still charge my phone up to full battery.
This price is great as well. If you go to Best Buy be prepared to pay $10-25 for a pack of screens, that you must personally cut down to size (they only sell screens for Playstation 2 devices used by kids). These are way cheaper, even with shipping.

This product is great for anyone who is a heavy user of a smartphone or needs a bit of extra juice for their phone throughout the day. The IMP52D has a nice small form factor which is great since I can carry it in my pocket and not worry about my iPhone 4S dying. After 3 days of extensive testing throughout college and other activities, I get 2 full charges and about 50%-60% of another charge. The carrying case is great as well I know my keys won't scratch it.

5031	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't work for connecting a card reader to a smart phone. It was useless, but the price was so low at $1.76, so it was not worth the try to the post office.

INTERFACE - At first the interface of the phone looks really simple and easy to use.  There are graphical icons that take you to different feature sets and then there are pop up menus that come up under each selection.  Sounds great right?  Well the problem is that the features are all over the place.  Nothing is where you would really expect it to be and you will refer to the manual a lot in the beginning.  Even after you have some experience with the phone you will still be frustrated because you will have to search through the menus to find the features that you only occasionally use.
 Then I asked about their product warranty - I even have a product warranty card - he said, "call the seller first or return it to them!"....
By the way, I used this with my Blackberry 7100g, good syncing and quick connection.
Edit:
3)  Simple Palm UI.  Palm has always been the master of the intuitive UI, and this is no exception.


There is a cable permanently attached to the antenna and it is long enough to run from the roof, down through a passenger door to the floorboard and under or around the front seat to the mounted phone Drive 4G-S cradle, a 5-Band Cell Phone Amplifier/Repeater, on the dashboard. This device is the heart of the booster system. The manufacturer indicates that the antenna cable is strong enough that it may be shut in most vehicle doors without damaging the cable. But if possible, they recommend an installation that involves pulling a small portion to the rubber door seal, which would provide a cleaner look and would reduce wear and tear on the cable when the door is opened and closed. I chose to run the cable under the door seal, though I was concerned about tearing the rubber since my car is over a decade old. It was easier than I thought and so I went ahead and ran the cable under the door seal and dropped it down along the window post.
5401	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	the case came in a good condition, fit my cellphone perfectly. the only bad thing was there was no protection for the screen. overall the case is strong because i have dropped my cellphone a couple of times by accident and no scrash on the cellphone nor the case
When I took the device off, it broke open and I took both sides apart.  I didn't find any evidence of components that will inductively couple the antenna and the interior components.

228	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works exactly as described. The directions that come with it are a bit off (obviously due to the language barrier), but this is so simple to use that directions really aren't critical. Adds a little extra bulk to the phone, but not as much as others if this type that I've seen before. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a battery case for their M9.

4504	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This earpiece, one of only two models I know of which streams audio into a single earpiece, is fantastic. It fits snugly in the ear, and there is an optional earloop for extra security. While it's great to be able to wear a single earpiece and listen to streamed audio, there is also a second earpiece which can be attached to the first for stereo sound. A very impressive product, small and light.
UPDATE:  After having this case for a few months I wanted to update my review.  I still think this is one of the best cases I have ever had.  I have every confidence this case will protect my phone from a short drop.  But after a few months of normal use, the white silicone "bumper" has become very discolored and dingy looking.  I've tried everything to clean it with short of straight bleach. It's absolutely filthy looking. It's embarrassing.  And my hands are very clean as I have to wash them several times during the day due to the nature of my job.  So while I still love this case, it is no longer my daily case due to its degraded appearance.  Sorry Boxwave.
1069	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The installation of the Parrot was easy after getting the optional cable for a '09 Charger.  It's great how it uses the car stereo even with the stereo turned off.  When a call comes in it mutes the music then uses the volume set by the Parrot, not the volume the music was set to.  This bluetooth and a Garmin GPS was way cheaper than the factor options for these simple two things (gps/bluetooth option is over $2k while it costs under $400 to add these yourself. Can you say RIPOFF!).


5886	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	perfect charger.
One, it uses MMC flash for storage.  MMC isn't exactly the most popular format -- Secure Digital (SD) would have been a far better choice -- and so comparable capacities cost more for MMC than SD flash.  What I find disappointing about the MMC choice is that offering MMC *and* SD isn't very difficult in itself.  In fact, Lexar sells the Trio which handles Sony Memory Sticks, SD, and MMC quite nicely and compactly.  Minor point, perhaps, but consider your current flash memory investments before buying the phone.

- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.
The other headsets are cheapy models I've purchase on amazon when they were a Goldbox deal, and those are also good.  They were around  $10 and work fine.  They just are not as comfortable to wear and the sound quality is not as sharp, both for me and for who I am speaking with.  If I wear the cheapy ones for more than 15 minutes, my ear will start to ache a little.  I can wear this one all day if I wanted to and it wouldn't bother me at all.

591	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: "This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip.

Cons
9444	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It works - generates a bit of heat, but it works.  Will gain 1-4 bars depending on how bad the signal is.  Key is getting a good antenna OUTSIDE your vehicle, house or RV.  Many to choose from, just make sure the connector is right for this device (buy an adapter if needed.)  I use with AT&T LTE and Sprint LTE.  Device gets 3 more bars when placed in this cradle.

7732	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This headset was the best I ever used and I used a lot of them, it worked great until I lost like all the others. This was my second purchase of the same make and model. Once you find something you like stick with it.
If you go into a phone carrier or something like that, you can find a portable battery charger for $50-$200. That's normal. But this charger is the most inexpensive USB charger that I've ever seen, and it still has all the features of the expensive ones. If you truly need more power than this iTorch, you can pursue other options from New Trent! But 30 bucks, wow, remarkable.

7989	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I just bought 2 of these to upgrade my wife's phone and mine from a V3 and a V557.  What a difference!  Lots of features: mp3, video, 1.3mp camera, etc. I found a shareware video converter online and have put some videos onto the 1G microSD card (be sure to get a microSD card for it).  It plays great and landscapes to use the whole screen.  Another must:  If you're going to use the internet and video features of this phone, be sure to get an unlimited data plan, or you'll be paying a bundle.  I used 15MB+ the first day on mine just playing around with it.  Even with the unlimited data plan, be careful - using some features (XM radio mobile, HBO, etc) will be billed as content.  Overall a great phone and easy to use after a couple hours learning all the features and menus.
Pros:
5427	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It's been about a month since I got this phone and overall so far-so good. This is a PDA first, and a phone second. This isn't for the average person and requires some technical knowledge to operate, otherwise you will become completely frustrated.

2309	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After my experience with the Motorola V551, I wanted to get away from Motorola, and try something other than a flip-phone.  The phone I had before that was a Nokia bar, and I liked that, but, wanted to try a Slider.
9182	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised. I averaged 2.7 full charges with the unit (iPhone down to 15% to start in each case). I think you can recharge the New Trent IMP500 with either the ac adapter that comes with it or the apple iPhone adapter (both are 5V 1A). You will need your iPhone usb cable to charge your iPhone once the IMP500 is charged up. I would recommend this product because it works as advertised, appears to be well made, and the price is reasonable.


Battery life

- the plastic casing just plain SUCKS. I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight, however, I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy.  For example the RAZR.
So don't store it in your pocket.

Overall, this is the first hands-free device that I have actually been able to tolerate and use.  I am satisfied, although the unit is a bit pricey.
Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.
6030	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Smart Phones. Tablets. ebook readers. mp3 players. Everyday survival tools that we need in this modern age of technology. Unfortunately, these great tools come with one fatal flaw: their horrible battery life. And no matter how many little tricks you do to keep your phone alive: lowering brightness, turning off 3G, etc, your phone will most inevitably die after a long day of usage. And thus the vicious cycle was repeated everyday until one day, something new emerged, a new creation: A portable charger. Which is why you undeniably find yourself here, reading the reviews of this lovely product.
3rd phone, was tracfone i got it for my sister, it was washed in the hose, fell and got sprayed an a red dot to prove this. got the screen to change colors and call different people from her contacts, tried drying and then it stopped even working as even a phone, it would go to the tracfone turn on screen reset itself and do it again until you did something like press a button itd go off, or the battery would die.
I am very satisfied with my purchase, for the price I paid I think it's a winner.

-Better battery life than the N75
4837	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I LOVE this design. I can just flip the boom and I don't have to worry about my headset calling anyone.  The previous bluetooths I owned called people from my purse, which I hated.  With the H710 not only does is not call people accidentally but it also saves the battery.  I could go a few days without charging it which, is great in my opinion.  As soon as I open the boom the phone recognizes it and I could use it again.  There were a few times I had to manually sync the bluetooth but that is a minor set back.

7232	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product.  I have the blue phone and it is a great color.  It is not too bright and it is not too dark.  The phone works great too.  Very easy to use.  I highly recommend purchasing this product.
This particular model is big enough for a Samsung Galaxy S4 with skin on it. I'd prefer a magnetic closure, but Velcro works OK.

1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can.  It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.

8350	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I went to Big Bend national park with this product.  I was using the wilson amplified car cradle and wilson trucker antenna in addition to the amplifier.  No verizon bars at all without the amplifier, but once I placed my phone (droid bionic) in the amplified cradle and turned on the amp I had 2 bars (1X) and was able to make calls.  In addition my wife was able to use here Iphone on ATT with success as well. Data was extremely slow since it was 1X but still worked though intermittently.  Inside the city you won't notice a difference with it on or not, but out in the middle of nowhere where you are in a fringe area it will make all the difference.  Keep in mind that it will not amplify a signal that does not exist, its not going to pull in a signal from a tower that is 50 miles away.  The only thing I found disappointing is that the inside antenna only worked if the phone was within 4 or 5 inches of it, and full signal only when the phone was actually touching it.  I just ditched the inside antenna that came with the amp and replaced it with the wilson cradle I bought separately, it was a perfect fit and works well with the amplifier.  I believe that the cradle has the same electronics as the indoor antenna except that it was the suction cup and cradle arms to hold the phone in place.  I give it 4 stars only because the inside antenna didn't work as well as I would have liked, otherwise I would have give it 5 stars.

I have not tried to use it with any other device, but it delivers with my phone, more than I had hoped for.  The device itself is made of plastic, sturdy and reliable.  The power button is still going strong.  It has not worn out, the led lights showing the charge remaining still work.  Although, it would have been nice to have an lcd showing percentage from 0-100%.  I don't have anything to add for improvements, other than the lcd.

Take amazons offer and you will be happy with this phone, or wait and see if it will be free a little later, which is what im doing since i have the service already......
As much as I loved this phone, after 18 months the handset stopped ringing.  I contacted support and the only thing that can be done is to replace the handset - which may or may not solve the problem.  I understand that the warranty is one year, but am disappointed that such an expensive phone has such a short life.

My recommendation: if you want a Treo, go with the 650.  With an extended battery a power user (bluetooth, e-mail, etc.) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage.  Look for it online.


There are 2 pieces - a larger unit that is placed in a window and attached to the glass via 2 suction cups and a plastic antenna that connects to the unit via a long cord and also has 2 suction cups on the back.

Usage - The iTorch works as advertised but this is where my only issue comes in. To keep the device simple and elegant I understand the reason behind only placing one button but you are essentially controlling 3 functions with this device. (Charging, Laser Pointer and LED Light) A single tap of the button lights turns on the device for charging and shows the amount of charge by the number of lit LED's 1-4. After about 15 seconds the unit powers down automatically. To use the LED Laser Pointer you double tap the function button. Once to turn on the device and again to turn on the red laser. Another tap will turn the laser pointer back off and then the unit will power down itself. In order to use the White LED flashlight you need to hold the function button for 3-4 seconds while the unit is in its powered down state and to turn the flashlight off again you need to repeat the 3-4 seconds. Not a deal breaker by any means but possibly one additional function button to control the lights or change the single button to work with taps (1 Tap Power, 2 Taps Laser 3 Taps Flashlight) This would be a faster way to turn the unit on and off as needed.

Enter the cell phone signal booster! I was skeptical because I had never even heard of this technology but I am so thankful I was given the opportunity to try it out. Setup was extremely fast and easy and I was up and running in under 10 minutes. My usual one (or none) bar downstairs turned into three and I was able to walk all the way around the perimeter of the level and the call never dropped nor did the other party have any complaints about the clarity of my voice. I had five bars in every corner of my upper level and didn't have to worry about hanging out near a window while on a call. Skeptical no more! It absolutely works and my only regret is that I didn't pick one up sooner.
This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.
If my sunglasses are too large, I leave an ear piece hanging outside the holder - no problem at all.  I came to this item today to order another - but out of stock.  Hopefully they will get more in stock.  If not, I'll check Carol Wright's catalog or Kimberly Clark where I first purchased them.  For the price, you can't beat this item.

3) The next one seemed to work well initially, but would suddenly become a static nightmare about 5 minutes into the call... resulting in the caller hanging up in frustration.  Finally I was able to switch back over to the phone fast enough when this happened, and salvage the call.  I realized that this was not "normal" (based on my earlier experiences with my first Jawbone), and that I must have received another bad headset.  So, I exchanged it at the Apple Store (again, no questions asked).

Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.

Let me tell you, this is the BEST case I have ever owned for any mobile device! I found a review on YouTube that demonstrated installation, and that decided me. Some of the comments posted there ridiculed the guy for buying a case that they perceived as being bulky, ugly, and industrial looking, complaining that it ruined the sleek fashion profile of the Curve. OK, well, I didn't buy the BB to improve my fashion image. It is a business tool to me and gets constant use all day every day. The OtterBox is all but bullet-proof, encasing the Curve in a hard shell which is then sealed and cushioned by an outer soft silicon skin, which is then further encased in the snap-in belt holster. I elected NOT to use the provided flexible transparent combination screen-keyboard-back membrane. I need the full tactile experience of the keyboard, and the membrane seemed better suited to use in a thunderstorm than to how I use my device. The remaining components of the case protect my BB to an extreme degree. I've had it and have been using it now for about three weeks, and I LOVE this thing! The outer silicon skin improves the grip in the hand and helps prevent the BB sliding off the console in the car. All BB buttons are usable through raised ribbed buttons in the silicon skin. The screen and keyboard are recessed enough into the hard shell and silicon skin to protect them against all but the most direct impact damage, and the holster carries the device screen-inward so that it's fully covered. The belt holster does contain the standby magnet the BB needs to conserve power.

The earbud covers - you get two different ones (one set of one, two of the other.)  The traditional, round, style have better sound but fill with sweat when working out. Literally fill - have to drain them every 15 minutes or so. The open style does not have this problem, but has poorer sound quality and lets in more ambient noise.
Pros:

The H710 has the best "user interface".  Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset.  It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant.  The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs.  The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710.  In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface.  The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach.  The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on.  Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you.

3296	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The phone is impressively intuitive. I have had no problem learning to use the various features. I can't really comment on Vcast because it is not available in my area. The camera and keyboard are the best features that I appreciate the most. Texting is so much faster for me now. Verizon has the best local service for me compared to any other provider. They tend to be a bit arrogant when dealing with problems on the phone yet I suppose they can since they have such good coverage of my area. I don't like their customer service from their stores to their customer reps on the phone but they get the job done and that's what matters to me at the moment. If you buy the phone, buy a Gb of Micro SD memory. You are going to need it if you plan to have music on your phone. It just has enough memory for basic needs on its own.

Ergo, this unit.
With respect to other problems, the Sprint broadband related features (ie, Sprint TV and web) are quite slow though not much slower than most other phones. But the promise of the technology is definitely behind what is delivered. Other problems include poor cell phone camera and video. Not that any cell phone camera and video are particularly good (most are quite bad) but the Centro's are bad by even these standards. The pTunes feature only allows you to purchase music from Sprint's store (though it does permit downloading of your own music from CD) - not a particularly good option considering the store does not have spectacular selection.

9175	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this product from New Trent and found it to be okay. Not great, but okay for the price so I did not complain. Weeks later, a representative from the company sent me an e-mail saying they would like to thank me for my business by sending me my choice of a free battery pack phone charger. Of course, I accepted. The representative then e-mailed me again requesting that I post a positive review on Amazon in exchange for the free charger. I replied that I would not wholeheartedly support a product if I didn't feel that way and that bribing someone for a favorable review made me question the ethics and products of the company. Furthermore, there was absolutely no mention of any review in the original e-mail proposing the free "thank-you" charger. New Trent's representative quickly backtracked and offered to send me the free charger if I did not mention this exchange to anyone. After all the e-mails back and forth, I ultimately received a charger that does not even work, aside from my original purchase which was mediocre. Since the charger was a "free gift," I didn't expect much out of it. However, New Trent's request for a positive review on Amazon has now caused me to question how many of these reviews are actually real. Based on this and my experience with their mediocre products, I would think twice about dealing with this company in the future.

I'm thinking I may give one as a gift, I like it that much.

6717	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Getting a good signal almost anywhere but home isn't difficult with my cell phone service, but getting a good one at home is a challenge. We will in a rural area and it isn't unusual to only get 2 bars, 3 at best. I took the time to mount Wilson's Signal Boost equipment both inside and outside of my home. I set it by the window just to see how well it would work, and I ended up with 5 bars. I then mounted it outside on the siding (I don't like clutter inside) using the long cable Wilson provides and got a full 5 bars as well. Unless you live in a really strange place, mounting it indoors should be sufficient for most people.
- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird, proprietary plug.

710	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have had this phone going on a year now and can faithfully say that I have very few complaints!! First of all the phone has NEVER and I mean NEVER failed me! This will be the 5th Sanyo I have owned, starting with the faithful 4500, and have never been let down. I have seen numerous complaints about sound quality, but short of the volume being a little low on occasion, I cannot see too much fault. The speakerphone is only half-duplex, but most cell phone speakerphones are only HD at the moment. Also you cannot expect board room sound out of a tiny micro-sized speaker! It does very well for its size. Ready link performance is top rate, as well. All in all another great Sanyo product!
3380	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had this product for 8 months and no issues. Works great and got what I expected when I ordered it!
9023	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I am adding this paragraph after owning this battery for about 12 months:  For a time, I was having trouble with this battery.  It would die and only wake up when plugged in to a charger. Then it would immediately show at least a half charge, sometimes more.  However, this glitch has gone away and it is working OK again.  Here's a possible user error:  I was charging a failing iPhone 3 and it had lots of other problems besides a weak battery.  It's possible that one of the problems with that phone was a short or near short in the charging jack.  I would have done some experimentation but then my daughter gave me her iPhone 5 in exchange for an iPad.  I am having no further problems with this battery now that I am charging a known good device.  My advice, from this single experience, is to give this product a try if you like it, or another New Trent external battery.  They answer emails and offered to evaluate this battery after I started having problems, but I decided not to bother since the problems have now stopped.  I'm raising my rating back to 4 stars, and if the problems don't come back at all, I'll raise it back to the original 5 stars I had on this review initially (below).

2478	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Useful for making and receiving calls, it connects to my PS3 too. The issue that I have it's that thing over the ear broke, then it's loose.
7412	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Case is pretty well sized although could maybe be just a little thinner. The internal headphone jack is a little awkward to plug into a phone and fit inside the case but works just fine nonetheless. The case itself works perfectly and external jack is awesome as well as turns which is nifty. Occasionally when trying to close my case, the headphone jack liked to get caught in the latch, but I suspect that's more user error.
Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.
8342	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was deep in the upper Mojave Desert.  I've been to remote places like this and have not had any reception.  When I pressed this into service I had 4 full bars of service in the middle of nowhere.  I would however would advise that anyone considering the purchase of this kit, instead purchase the one with the cell phone antenna cradle instead of the bar antenna.  It's the black item on the right.  It is necessary to have that antenna as close to the phone as possible to achieve the highest performance.  So the universal cell phone cradle antenna serves that purpose much better.  I also have used this amplifier in town, and it shines when I get to areas where I've had weak signals in the past.  This booster kit works wonders.  It's highly recommended.


8661	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My original Motorola Q phone wouldn't hold a charge for more than 2 hrs. I found this and it works like a champ. Been using the battery for a few months now and it holds a charge for 2 days (unless you're surfing the net a lot). Very happy with the price and performance.
- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it "rests" on top of. (Useless)

I still use it as my international phone when I travel to Israel. I put an Israeli SIM card in it and it works great. Its amazing how long these old phone batteries really lasted for. I can go 5 days easily on this phone without needing to charge it, even with normal usage.
UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones
4328	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My Mickeeper takes a beating, I drive roll-off and am in and out of the landfills all day basically off-roading. This takes the bumps, doesn't hang too low, and hasn't failed yet. It even has different mounting brackets depending on how you want to hook it up, and has a cable brake so if it's not holding the mic low enough for you, you can pull out some more slack. Very nice and heavy duty!

There seems to be some differences with the pictures on Amazon and the model I received.  Mine used all 4 LEDs to indicate battery level.  Power button is something I had to get used to (pressing 1 to charge, then another one to turn on laser pointer, another one to turn the laser pointer off; press & hold 2 seconds to turn power off; press & hold 3 seconds to turn on/off the flashlight).  I can see how button could break and become an issue as some people noted.  I used it just about a month, but no issue so far once I got used to it and hope button doesn't break.  USB input seemed a bit too tight at 1st, but after some use, it got a lot better.  Since it is portable, I rather it be tight than loose.

- Cheap
5381	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I just received a replacement BB Curve from Verizon. I had carried my original in a standard-issue soft belt case that can be purchased just about anywhere. It's made for RIM, and has a little oval silver medallion on the security strap with "Blackberry" engraved on it. One day, sticking my BB back into the case, I inadvertently stuffed the strap in with it. In the next hour of walking, getting in an out of the car, etc., that little engraved medallion gouged a fugly deep pattern of scratches into the screen. Also, I found that the Curve's finish is extremely susceptible to scratches and dings, not from misuse, but from day-to-day handling. For instance, the rear of the case is, well...curved! Resting on my desk between calls had worn some fine scratches into the silver finish.

Overall, this product does work. You just need to make sure you read the description closely to see if this is the right product for you.

6249	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The New Trent battery pack is lightweight and small, and works easily and well.  My only beef with it is that the 5000mAh rating may not be accurate.  I compared it to a Zaggsparc 2.0, which is rated to same capacity, and the Zaggsparc clearly carries more "juice."  However, Zagg's product is more than twice the cost!  So, for my money, this is the better buy.  The charging cables it uses can be a bit more cumbersome than some other options out there, but the cable is retractable, which is nice, and again, it's a much better price.  If you're looking for something to extend the usable battery life of your smartphone, this is what you want.
Anyhow, after barely two days of owning it I've come to realize that it just doesn't perform as expected.
8095	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Very nice design. I like the style and controls. However, the headset that comes with the unit is bad. The ear pieces will not stay in the ear. But because of the design, any ear buds can be used in place of the supplied ones. The only other issue I have is the unit keeps cutting in and out. That said I would still purchase a replacement unit if something happens to this one.

9212	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros
Background: I was not eligible for the upgrade yet, so that meant I had to purchase a phone at retail price (without the contract) which would have run up upwards of $300 and more.  So I got this phone (unlocked) as a gift, and the switch-over was relatively easy and trouble-free.  I copied my address book from the 6102i onto the SIM card, and when I moved the SIM card to the 6126, the address book was there (taa-daa!).  What I was not able to move were the photos I snapped with the old phone.  Those I had to send via email, which I saved onto a microSD card and then was able to move to the 6126 (it has a microSD slot, which read the 1Gb card easily).

2)  Tons of apps (and lots more free apps out there, if you look).
- Bluetooth Function
3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the "File" menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)
1677	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This little guy is just amazing. This is my first Bluetooth headset- and the first headset of any kind I've ever regularly used with my phone (I never could stand those corded ones). I bought it primarily for when I'm in the car, but now I find myself using it all the time, and finding out how many wonderful times it comes in handy. Talking to a friend who wanted someone's number, I was able to go through my phone address book while still talking to him. And being able to roam around the house, or use the computer without getting a neck cramp is priceless. As for this specific model- it works very well, and as advertised. Battery life has been just great, as is reception. It's small and light enough that I soon forget I have it on, and can keep it on pretty much all day. My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up all that well to go in a pocket, etc. But I guess if it did, then it probably wouldn't be very comfortable to wear, so I can't really fault it for that. I don't think I will ever have a phone again without one of these guys nearby.
If you have a Samsung Galaxy Note, GET THIS CASE!!

1014	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.
I suggest getting a Pro Clip mount for your car, then a slim swivel adapter, then attach this bracket and you're all set! For my Z4, I have the mount right side up. For my E46, I have the arms upside down so I can slide the phone UP into the holder, and when I want to quickly remove the phone I just pull the phone down.



9569	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	For clear cell calls in my house I had to go to the front windows and stand there to talk. A friend mentioned Cell boosters and I was interested and started investigating. I went to [...] to see where the nearest cell towers are. I purchased the Wilson Electronics DT signal booster. I went to their website and downloaded the manual before the product arrived. Read the manual so I would have an exact understanding on how it works. I downloaded an app called phone reception monitor to my smartphone. You should not use the bars on your phone and even Wilson electronics tells you this. I have Virginmobile and my reception is 20-30% (using the app) in my house and 41-45% at my front house windows. I have aluminum siding on the house and this can affect cell signal. The Wilson Electronics product arrived and it came with 1 20ft reel and 1 30ft reel of RG6 coax cable, 1 cradle antenna, 1 booster, 1 Desktop antenna and assorted hardware and mounting brackets etc. To test I mounted the cradle antenna at my front window with the suction cups supplied, connected the 20ft and 30ft cable together (with the supplied connector) ran the wiring along the floor to the booster in another room, connected the desktop antenna and sat it on a high shelf about 6ft high and pointed it thru one room to a large den. Plugged in the booster, two green lights came on. Turned on smartphone and my signal at the Desktop antenna said 65%. WOW, I have never received such a signal. Walked about 35ft to the end of the back den large room and my signal dropped to 40%. This is the signal I would get at my front windows! So here is my first test. I went to the kitchen which is 20feet away from the desktop antenna and to the side of the antenna and called virgin mobile and the call was crystal clear. This is an area where I could not make a clear call before! Also my data increased as follows:

Verizon's software update further cripples phones usability (greedy bastages)

As an added benefit if I get a new phone I don't have to worry because this kit works with almost all Motorola phones.
Price for services is high. To get email,text messaging and have 'limited' streaming capability (meaning NOT HBO or XM) plus the basic phone package, will spend close to $150 a month depending on your personal preferences. While that might not be high for some, think about that plus cable plus home internet and then consider what your paying just to stay 'connected'.Even if you cut out the streaming content, cingular will try and convince you otherwise because while using the phone, its easy to stumble across a feature you are NOT paying for and get 'hit' with the bill at the end of the month. Cingular will not refund you for this under any circumstance. Look at the warning explained above in the product details: Warning: If you want to enjoy the full audio and video capabilities of your UMTS phone, please select a MEdia Max service plan option during checkout. If you do not sign up for a MEdia Max service plan option, you will be paying per KB when you use the over-the-air UMTS audio and video features on your phone (upwards of $10 per minute).

6324	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I was initially disappointed that the case did not have an actual belt loop, since in the past, these things would managed to fall off the belt when I got out of a car, or carried bulky items on my left, etc.
My favorite thing about the phone is the Palm OS.  If you've got another Palm, and you don't want to spend the money on a Treo 755p, then trust me -- this should be your phone.

1) The first Jawbone I bought (from the Apple Store) worked GREAT!  Noise canceling was flawless, and everything worked as advertised.  Within a week, I lost it at the airport, and tried to go back to my old Plantronics headset.  I immediately realized how much better my Jawbone was, and bought another one at the Apple Store.

Another small annoyance: there seems to be no backslash character available, which is needed to form a fully qualified user id in the format domain\userid (some software does not support the alternative format with the @ symbol).
Also: I am unable to use it to record my voice tags. I have read other reviews compalining about this.

I would avoid this product like poison!

1691	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	no comment
The wall adapter dosn't work at all and the end of the cable that plugs into the phone has slowly been chipping away to the point that it is now impossible to plug it correctly into the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
cons: either fits in ear or doesn't...but there is simple workaround



3545	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this phone upon deciding to switch to T-mobile from Verizon.  I wanted a phone with a user friendly music player that I wasn't required to purchase individual songs for if I didn't want to.  I was able to use the player without having to purchase any additional software for my computer.  It is compatible with Windows Media as well as Yahoo Music(which you can also purchase a subscription to.)  It is a my faves phone, which is also a big plus.  It is also IM enabled.
9357	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I think this is the best Nokia N series ever....if its not surpassed by the new N 97. If you are looking for a beautifull phone loaded with features and all that you can possibly think of in a average budget. This is the phone to get..much better that the Iphone in many ways. Besides its very reliable.
4335	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've broke the little one before but  it'd be pretty damn hard to break this gargantuan. The lock feature is good for when you're stretched out across the cab you don't have to reach for it just lock it and set it within reach. Definitely recommend it.
-not waterproof at all (not advertised either, so not really a bad thing I guess)
Everything about this headset is great, except everyone wishes it wasn't so bulky. But I found a way to not have to use the ear hook by using one of the multiple earpiece inserts it comes with such that it stays very, very securely in my ear.

1548	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have probably went through a 1/2 dozen different bluetooths...mostly Motorola.  This one blows them all away.  The voice clarity is great even outdoors.  It is the only one I have found that is loud enough to be used in something other than a very quite environment.  I can actually hear the other person talking on the phone even if I am working outside.  Very impressed.
However, this clip is not a wimp; it holds tight and I've not had a problem.
9631	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Batteries last a long time and nicely priced!

But these are minor, nitpicking complaints.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small, lightweight, comfortable, noise-reducing headset.

2193	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Allows me to synchronize my contact with Outlook & use my phone as a modem. I can transfer pictures and ringtones from my computer to my phone and from my phone to my computer. It even works with my wife's Verizon V3m, some tinkering was required to get the multimedia features to work on the Verizon phone (instructions were supplied my the vendor), but at the end everything works great!! As an added benefit if I get a new phone I don't have to worry because this kit works with almost all Motorola phones.
For example, last Friday we traveled from Massachusetts to Maryland.  Coming down the Jersey Turnpike the unit showed a small (1 or 3 min delay) and kept us on the pike.  Just before we reached exit 7, we decided we'd had enough, pressed Detour, and ended up doing something involving route 295.  When we reached our destination, we learned from those who arrived hours later that the pike had turned into a virtual parking lot and we'd have lost hours if we'd believed the Garmin regarding traffic.
1156	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Like all the other reviews the base is not heavy enough to hold the unit steady but I don't move the cables so it doesn't matter too much.  I like the port on the front for flash drives.  I think the blue power light is too bright.  All the green lights stay on so they are not very usefull for anything.  I prefer a light to be on when that port is used and change color if the port is overloaded.  Everything that has been plugged into the hub works properly.  With USB webcams I notice a little more noise than when plugged directly into my Dell.
Now, to prove I'm not a complete cheerleader on this, a few downsides:
Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design.  I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset!
Okee doke, I think I've taken up enough time.  Just wanted to leave my $0.02 end ended up writing the sequel to "War & Peace".  Hope this helps anyone considering gettin' the Samsung T-809.  :)

5342	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I work in a field where it is very easy to drop my phone and my otterbox has saved me many times and my phone has never been damaged.  A bit bulky but if you are looking for a case that will protect your phone to the max, this is it.  Recently I dropped my phone and the belt clip cracked and Otterbox sent me a replacement in a few days with no questions asked.  Great investment.
5442	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was deep in the upper Mojave Desert.  I've been to remote places like this and have not had any reception.  When I pressed this into service I had 4 full bars of service in the middle of nowhere.  I would however would advise that anyone considering the purchase of this kit, instead purchase the one with the cell phone antenna cradle instead of the bar antenna.  It's the black item on the right.  It is necessary to have that antenna as close to the phone as possible to achieve the highest performance.  So the universal cell phone cradle antenna serves that purpose much better.  I also have used this amplifier in town, and it shines when I get to areas where I've had weak signals in the past.  This booster kit works wonders.  It's highly recommended.

911	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My First set of Bluetooth headsets. So far no problems paired with my phone and amazon fire. Good range of connection. good sound quality when ear piece is inserted correct.

-*The idle/key lock screen is always the black screen with the time that you can't change.


While the packing was adequate I think there should be some changes there.  When this was delivered to me it was opened and ripped in two places.  The flashlight wasn't so great.  The range of that light was very small, and it's light was not much help in the dark.
Where should I start - there is so much BAD about this phone...  The single biggest problem is the way it manag
9486	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This does boost the signal. I went from zero bars to 5. The only downside is that I have to be within about 2 feet of the indoor antenna for it to work.
...and more!

I really, really like this headset - a lot of quality and sound design are very apparent, it does it's job very, very well.
The item itself is made of hard leather with a very thin felt liner which wouldn't protect your GPS from damage if it fell onto hard concrete.  This is more of a carrying case to be packed into something else.
1) Cheap (I am dutch/frugal so its important)
Just cut the screen protector to the proper size.  Stick the car or parking sticker on the non-sticky side of the screen protector carefully.  Remove the film on the sticky side of the screen protector and apply to the windshield where you would like.

2041	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've had 3 BT headsets for the 650.  The Jabra unit that was being given away with the 650 when it first came out was a piece of junk and very irritating for the ear.  The Treo branded headset was a great improvement, except that people always complained my volume was too low and I found some calls were too faintly heard, pairing of the headset to the phone was 50-50 when I received a call, headset control of the 650 were tough to access. Got this unit because the battery was going on my Treo and I wanted to see if something better was out there. So after 5 days experience, I can say that the H700 is superior with respect to call volume on both ends, pairs with the phone nearly 100% of the time, and reliably can control the phone.  Main problem is that the H700 roaming range is poor, sometimes giving poor reception on the other side of my body. However, this is outweighed by it's virtues.  Some have complained that the boom control to answer the phone does not work, but I found on some Treo BT forum that when the unit is set up to choose the car kit profile.  Recognition does take several seconds, but this is an endemic problem of BT units.
it comes with 2 extra earhook to let it stay over the ear without falling off, and a lanyard

3696	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Not much I can really say on this review because it's nothing wrong with the case. It works well, it's sturdy and fits tightly around your phone. When I got it I put the case on my phone and all the holes were aligned properly with my phone. The back piece with the deer art is kinda slippery yet the rubber sides are nonslippery so they kinda add that perfect balance. (Or so I like to think) Uh one thing I will say, it's difficult to detach the case to get your phone out, but that just means it's doing its job of protecting it.

6999	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	these are okay but, you have to be very carefull when applying or they will get finger prints on the under side, but not bad for the money.
To get the stereo headset to work, I first press the control button on the S-2 for about 3 seconds till I see blue flashing lights. Then I go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone and connect it to the Cardo S-2. Now I can open the music player and listen to beautiful music.
You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.
8325	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I needed to move from T-Mobile over to Verizon, which was a painful thing for me as I've owned a Sidekick since the first color ones came out. I was up to a Sidekick 3, and did not even give that up when my husband offered an iPhone because I didn't want a virtual keyboard. I use my phone as an email device and a web browser first, a phone second.

* Excellent build quality
3506	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I like that i was able to find a good case for my older phone. It was the same quality and at a good price. It really protects all aspects of the phone. I didn't have to be so concerned with my toddler getting ahold of it

9152	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I like mine so much I bought a second one as a Christmas gift.  I highly recommend this. Works with iPhone & android.
7745	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is the third one of this model I have owned; eventually the batteries give out and then they are useless--can't be repaired.  This one does not work well.  The volume is too low; it does not communicate well--there is static and choppy reception.  If it is NOT the unit, then the unit is NOT compatible with the Blackberry 9630 (Tour)or Verizon.
6313	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Please do not waste your money ti doesn't worth it. I regretted ever buying this. It is very fake one!

2152	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My water sport activities are on hold for the winter, so I put the otterbox in a bucket of water , set a brick on it and walked away for a half hour or so, dry as desert sand inside upon retrieving. Good sense dictates a test without expensive electronics inside, now I can use it with full confidence that wallet, iphone, etc. will be safe.
4 things I would like to mention:
9016	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The NewTrent IMP52D is an ergonomically designed charger for your personal electronics.  It works with USB charging cables to recharge your devices.  I purchased two, one for me and one for my wife.  When I can't reach people because their smartphones are dead, I will recommend this product.  The build in laser pointer is awesome, and it even has an auto-off so that the battery isn't depleted by leaving it on.  I can't wait to try some of NewTrent's other products!

5. Great at multitasking. At times, I have 5 programmes running. Just a few taps and you can switch between each of them painlessly.

9594	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Absolutly the best thing you could buy for your Cell phone. I live just shy of range for my cell to work indoors, normally 1 or no bars even roam was poor, I could never use my cell in the house. Now it works great it's limited to about 20+ feet on line of site and 10 through walls.  But the one place I needed it to work and it's installed which is in my bed room it's the best money well spent regret not buying 2 years ago I have not had any service problems since I bought this even into the other rooms yes the singal fades but it's holding on were it never did before. If it doesn't help you, in MY OPINION your probably just to far from the tower or it's not set up right. My parents bought one where for Sprint there was no tower or even a roaming singal this allowed my dad and I to recieve a singal to at least roam on as the Sprint service just ain't out there THIS influenced me to buy one. On Clear line of site which isn't really how the cells are meant to be I can go about 20-30 feet and went from no bars to 2-3 in the room withing 10 feet is between 3-5 (5 being full) in the room next to me where it never worked before I recive upto 3 through the wall in the room over all this is more then sufficient for my phone to work - DATA Service great improved. I highly recommmend. Highly and I think most stuff is a scam but this is worth it. Obviously it works better if there's a stronger single outside for it to recieve like I said I'm just outside of the tower for it to work inside the the signal it here outside so this thing works great.
-- Predictive typing is virtually useless.  It seldom produces the most obvious word, i.e., the one you'd expect.  Accidentally type a nonstandard spelling (easy to do, since it's so hard to type on this keyboard), and the prediction feature will repeat the new "word" until you select a similar word with different spelling.

VIDEO CALLING: This feature doesn't work in The States, but it allows you to take self photos/videos and see yourself as you shoot. In a few years when video calling reaches us, your N82 will be ready.
7102	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This OEM power cord for a Zojirushi hot water dispensing pot is exactly what OEM stands for, an exact replacement. Price is good. This power cord will probably fit more models than listed.
*The time for loading some of the applications is slow some of the time (pictures, changing themes, and the map feature)
7055	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	works good
3)  Simple Palm UI.  Palm has always been the master of the intuitive UI, and this is no exception.
Battery Life-  For the battery it is very good if you don't use the messenger or internet or anything, but if you do use them use them like I do and I have to be then its not that great...  If I stay logged into the blackberry messenger and hotmail messenger that I have downloaded then the battery cuts down ALOT it will only survive for about half a day but then if you don't use that stuff it will last like 2 to 3 days. 5 for not using the stuff and 2 for using the browser and stuff.

4896	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I got this in the hopes that it would work better than my old H500, but from the time I've had it, it does not seem to do so.

I had read some complaints that this phone didn't come with enough stuff, well at it's launch price point I would say yeah it was overpriced. Now it has come down and it is a good deal in my book.

- Rubberized back reduces slipping

4364	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This headset works great on my Nokia 6300b cell phone. I bought it primarily to listen to music on my mobile phone without wires. The sound quality is great here with good bass.

  -It has decent screen savers.
6585	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Sprint PCS has terrible network coverage with frequent dropped calls.  I have been a loyal customer of Sprint for 10+ years, mostly because of a nice grand-fathered plan.  However, many moments of frustration plaque me.  Accordingly, I jumped at the opportunity to review this product (Free Vine Review).  Installation is straightforward, but requires external mounting & some wire routing.  All would have been acceptable if it worked.  Unfortunately, I still experience the same drop rate and poor coverage as without the booster.  It could be due to Sprint network or the fact that my car is a low 370z.  Accordingly, this product receives a 1/5 star.
5048	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Not adaptable for the Square credit card swipe but for head phone only. Need more description on the online information area.
5781	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the holster to buy IF you want a holster that can be clipped to your waist band, pants pocket or anything else (even a purse)- it is a very easy process to remove and reinsert your BB from the holster - the built in magnet will put your BB to sleep mode.  Holster is perfect fit for the BB Curve (8330).  Clip rotates and is big enough to grab to release the holster from your belt (hopefully, unlike other reviews posted here, the holster clip will not fall apart - so far it appears to be sturdy and is not showing any signs of breaking apart after one week of use - my wife has a red holster with zero signs of falling apart after 6 weeks of use).

Overall, these bluetooth headphones are and excellent value - would definitely recommend...especiall for the $30.

921	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The cables are too short but they work great
1) Seems to need it's own bluetooth transmitter. My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable. Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.
  -Surprisingly, there is an avatar selection for each contact - really cute ones.
3705	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works well and fits my bluetooth perfectly.
If you don't flip the little lock switch on the H800 the slider will open easily and often when it in your pocket or purse.  And then when you try to use the phone with out the headset no one will be able to hear you until you figure out that the headset is on.


It's also not leather, and has a very strong vinyl/plastic odor.


Again, nothing but praises about my little beetle! You won't want to squish this one!!

The deal breaker:
7471	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got tired of removing the rear cover and battery just to get to the SD card to put in my computer. Now I can just plug in the cable and access all of the files on my phone with ease.

- the screen scratches pretty fast (again compared to the RAZR family), so make sure you put on a screen protector.
4180	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Well, it works fine except for earplug fit.  Read somewhere where they suggested getting Jafra ear pieces, so will try those and a few others until I get the right fit.
9474	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It works but just at a desktop distance. do not expect more that on this model.
or lug around my travel connectors is great.
It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier. The speaker phone is great, clear and plenty loud enough; bluetooth syncs with my GPS without a hitch and one touch (or speed) dialing is great, you can even have two digit spead dialing by holding the second digit until it begins to dial. I can store hundreds of phone numbers in number locations I choose (like my brother's home is 5, cell is 15 and wifes cell is 25), then use the number of the location to make a call instead of looking up numbers.
The sound quality is great, I can hear others well and I'm told that I come through very clearly.  I have had it for almost 2 months and only had to charge it once besides that first time and I use it everyday for 1-2 hours each time - that's good battery life!
I had high expectations. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 (read good reviews about it: in-ear position & USB charging).


I would say this is a fantastic device for improving cell phone reception in urban areas.
8595	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I use this to mount the head unit of my Midland 75-822 CB to my dash. Works great.
2511	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works just fine, no issues.
2) The PS3 may have connected the device, but I didn't try as after some research, I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection. It is only good for talking back and forth with other gamers. Hopefully Sony adds this feature in the future.
-flimsy rubber cover for the USB outlet (though not critical). Opens and hangs by a very small corner of rubber.

moto is good, but battery is bad

The first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.

If it wasn't for the price of this product, I would probably be mad and would've given it a low score. So one suggestion while applying these screen protectors is to make sure you wash your hands, do it in a dust-free environment and if you need glasses to see better, wear them! Overall, great addition in keeping your LG Voyager clean, protected and for the price this is a good, not great product.
The product buy is of good quality, y  arrived in the estimated time, I'm very happy with the service ... Thanks! and" Happy New Year 2012"
4714	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery has worked great. After installation I usually get 5+ days of standby with regular amounts of talk time. The price was very good, shipping was quick and the battery arrive in perfect condition. I would recommed this battery to a friend.

3140	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	the first couple of days that i had it it work fine and after a week it just broke and im not able to use it anymore
Now, I should say that I'm a simple person. To me, a cell phone is brilliant if it allows me to make and receive calls(and texts) in the most concise, efficient, inexpensive manner possible. All other features are icing IMO.
122	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Need to be able to recharge the phone...what can I say.
1757	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After being completely disappointed with Motorola HS850 (see my review), got myself a brand new model of Jabra - BT500 and love it. I use is with Motorola V620 (V600 European model). Volume is perfect, sits comfortably on my ear, and does not fall even if I shake my head, people hear me without any problems and distance is good as well. Charges fast and battery last long. Have no problems with echoes or anything else. Buttons are very easy to access and respond right away. I would recommend this one to anyone.

8955	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the Powerpak iTorch (IMP52D) from New Trent a few days ago. I used it solely for my cell phone charging during this time. (A Nokia Lumia 920 / 2000 mAh Battery)
Nice try Nokia, but this phone is not up to your usual standards and you never should have released it.
Ah, but you want to know about the biggie, right? You want to know all about the music capability!
The local store was charging $299 for the kit, so we promptly returned it the next day, and will spend just a little more right here on Amazon and get a much better kit with a wideband antenna mounted outside on the roof, and better booster for inside the house. It was nice to figure out the Wilson kits will work for us though.

Signal not as good as my Razr

- the system itself is a little slower than I would like but bearable.
But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem. My phone uses the T-Mobile network, and combined with the "  all the data you can eat " program ( around $20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter, and I'm good to go. The set up is a bit complex, but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the  info.

5103	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this Chargepod bundle pack after reading a good review of it in a computer magazine. Our household has around 5 different mobile devices which need recharging at one time or another. The area where we keep all the charging cables was beginning to look really cluttered. Plus, we were fighting over shared charging cables (e.g. for two blackberries).

The screen is vibrant and colorful.  It isn't as large as the 6700's but I rarely miss the larger size.  It is a touchscreen and that works without any issues.
7)  Power up cell extender.  If when you power it up you get ANY flashing amber lights, then your signal isolation between the two antennas isn't good enough and you must do something about it (move antennas, get YAGI with higher gain, etc.)  If you get no amber lights on startup then the device is operating at max or almost max amplification and power output (only 1/2 watt but plenty for a single house).
2530	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent quality
1730	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I have a RAZR and find it attractive, thin (which is nice) and unlike some folks find the interface fairly decent.
Bottom line: if you want a phone to make calls on, the A707 Sync has good call quality and excellent signal strength. However, the rotten battery life and rapid non-geometric decrease in battery life makes this phone unreliable and irritating to use for its primary purpose. If you add silly junk to your usage like watching videos and browsing the web, you will only decrease the battery life and make the phone even less useful as an actual telephone.
The minuses:


- Photos and movies (these are just novelty features to me, but they work -- I've sent little video clips I've taken to another phone... kind of cute)
5978	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It lasted only 11 months of very light usage.

8791	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've had this for about 2 years and it works great.  Actually when I was playing my PS4 (across the living room) my controller died.  I didn't have like a 10' cord, so I figured hey I'll use my back up battery (aka this thing).  Plugged in the controller, hit the button, and BOOM!!!  Hours of ps4 gameplay without having to take a break or sitting 2 feet from my tv.  Also this worked great at charging my phone and tablet whenever I was out and about.  It has a flashlight on it too, just in case.

Pairing was simple. Just press the control button on the Cardo S-2 for about 7 seconds till you get alternating red and blue flashing lights and then go to your cell phone and "add" a "new bluetooth device" (make sure its in "discoverable" mode) with the 4 digit, 0000 passcode. Since my Nokia also supports the AVRCP profile, I'm able to control all the functions of the music player through pressing different parts of the Cardo S-2 headset. Moreover, the headset is very comfortable to wear, which is quite important.
1780	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.
They continually fall out of my ear.  I am using the biggest rubber buds that came with the device, and they still slide out.  It's almost comical how it happens.  I could be still, and I can feel them steadily sliding out a nanometer every second till they are out, free to dangle.  I constantly have to put them back in. Frustrating.
  -911 auto feature
Overall it isn't bad, I just wish the stars were more visible.

Though I haven't found one yet, it would be nice if the headset could mute calls, but that'd be asking for waaaay too much :)

The only gripe here is that the call/answer button is the same button that activates the music player and changes tone. Too many functions for one button. So when I go to place a call if I hold it down to short it instead begins to play music or too long it changes tone. I'm sure I'll get used to that too but for now because of this I deducted a star. You may feel different about the ergonomics because overall I am pleased.
Cons:
3596	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This case is very nice and fashionable for the Galaxy Note II. It protects it well and fits nice in your pocketbook. I did not give it 5 stars because the handle that comes with it does not match. The case seems classy but the strap is a little cheesy. It cheapens it a little. I would still purchase it.
3241	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely LOVE this case. It is the best one I've had for my Galaxy Note II. It is very low profile and provides a reasonable amount of protection. The holster is sturdy and holds the phone well. Thank you for such a great product!
8544	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	They iGo system is so wonderful.  When your charger changes or the breaks or gets filled with dirty, you only need purchase a new one of these little inexpensive tips and you are set to go.

I was a little uncomfortable with the fit at first - it seemed too loose to me. The unit comes with several ear loops and ear buds, and I tried them all before settling on the loop and bud that came installed out of the box. As I've grown accustomed to the unit, though, the 'looseness' no longer bothers me, and I find I can wear it the entire day without discomfort. In noisy environments I find I have to press the earbud deeper into my ear to drown out ambient noise. This hasn't been a huge inconvenience, because I don't spend that much time in high-noise environments, but I could see it being a major annoyance if I did.
7094	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I went to buy this battery for my phone and AT&T wanted over $40.00. I decided to search the internet for a better price. I need not search anymore. Great Buy, Great Product.

So far the device has charged everything I threw at it.  Charged my iPhone 5 without an issue.  Note to iPhone 5 users...if you recently got one or are waiting for yours a backup battery is a necessity.  I haven't figured if I could change some settings on it but it chews through the battery much faster then my iPhone 4 did (and the 3GS for that matter).  I've been using the maps app quite a bit so that may be the cause but it's really taxing the battery.  I was able to fully charge my iPhone 5 and also put a decent charge on my iPad 2 and charge one of my cigarette batteries.

7826	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This cable is simple, cost efficient, and gets the job done. I use it to connect headphones with large 3.5mm plugs to my phone since my case can't fit the larger plugs. Great cable.
6888	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These are the batteries that one of my watches takes. They work well and seem to last a long time. I just wish all of my watches used the same battery.
The volume is excellent. My husband automatically set it to the highest volume because his car is so noisy and he ended up having to turn the volume lower!
All in all, a nice solution (even if temporary) for a somewhat wireless solution for audio streaming.
4) the earbud is not well shaped to keep it in my ear. Jabra used to do a great job with ear gels that fit and stayed comfortably. This fits, is comfortable but does not stay without the ear wire.

I do like that fact that you turn the device on by opening it up, there are no questions whether it is on or not, that is an improvement over the H500.  It has a lovely Hi tech sound when it starts up, and if you quickly get it into your ear, you can hear it.
 Their product support and brand standards are probably just like their product - substandard and indifferent

2292	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After a brief charging time (90 minutes), it "paired" up immediately with my LG-VX8300 and set up directions were easy to follow.  It fits comfortably in my ear, especially with the furnished ear piece covers, and my glasses fit fine if I put them on after putting the BT over my ear.  The voice command/dialing feature worked almost flawlessly (it had to search a bit to get the name of a middle-eastern friend!).  The tone quality is very good but, as one reviewer said, you need to be careful if you're trying to adjust the volume while talking with someone because of the proximity of the volume controls to the "off" button.  I really like the ingenious setup for recharging by using a cable with a bayonet type plug for the BT and a USB connector at the other end, which enables you to then plug it into an AC, car, or other USB outlet. I've used Jabra and Motorola in the past and while they were OK, the Blue Ant is far superior in my opinion.
6805	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Work well seem to last as long as all others. Very pleased

1436	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day.  I have been very satisfied.  The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well.  My ear buds are getting very loose after four years, so I am ordering another set of those.  I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel.  Very convincing.  I will rate the new headset after I try it out.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with  the 510.
To get started with the unit, it needs to be charged. No AC charger is provided but you can plug it into any computer USB port on one end and the other end into the battery USB micro port. While charging 4 little blue LEDS will light in a running sequence. When the charge is complete, a fourth light and all 3 other lights remain lit.

1781	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and you'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.
This is a full kit, you not only get the unit, but you also get two methods of attaching the unit. One is the easier, less time consuming, velcro strip option. The other 2 small thread screws that allow for a more "permanant" attachment.
1347	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have owned a Treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out.  Initially, I was extremely frustrated by the phone's telephone performance and its lack of stability.  Frequent reboots, freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone.  I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone.  Over time, PalmOne has released firmware updates (the phone's operating system) that have made the phone very stable.  The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back.  This review is for the GSM Treo 650.
Note: I did abide by the distance requirements called for by each manufacture and those called for by the FCC. I only operated my cell in close proximity only to perform my tests. At no time should you operate your equipment outside the limitations set forth in the user's manuals.
1430	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	At first I thought it was me, but it wasn't... I bought 2 of these over the period of a year... the rubber comes undone from the ear plug and the wires get split and broken, and then it's all over...
5738	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I love driving ragtops - the wind in your hair, the sun on your face - but if you use a cell phone and need a headset - you are pretty much out of luck. I got a great response out of the Shure Quietspot earpiece - but it was wired and had no control button on the earpiece itself - all calls had to be generated through the phone. It was a decent compromise. I tried a variety of Bluetooth earpieces but they either were too quiet on my end to hear through the wind noise, or the person on the other end of the call couldn't hear me. The Etyblu fixed that! The boom mic is clear as a bell and people don't realize I'm calling from a convertible. The sound quality on my end is great. I did have some problems getting it to fit right. Frankly I had to use the soft rubber insert with the earclip to get it to stay in right - the flanged in-ear adapters just didn't cut it for me. However, it is easy enough to put on and it is worth the extra second to use it. There is occasionally a slight bit of static noise, but not much. Battery life seems really good so far. I am really pleased with this device! If it wasn't for the fit issues I'd give it a solid "5" but it's really better than a Four in my book!

6669	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	For clear cell calls in my house I had to go to the front windows and stand there to talk. A friend mentioned Cell boosters and I was interested and started investigating. I went to [...] to see where the nearest cell towers are. I purchased the Wilson Electronics DT signal booster. I went to their website and downloaded the manual before the product arrived. Read the manual so I would have an exact understanding on how it works. I downloaded an app called phone reception monitor to my smartphone. You should not use the bars on your phone and even Wilson electronics tells you this. I have Virginmobile and my reception is 20-30% (using the app) in my house and 41-45% at my front house windows. I have aluminum siding on the house and this can affect cell signal. The Wilson Electronics product arrived and it came with 1 20ft reel and 1 30ft reel of RG6 coax cable, 1 cradle antenna, 1 booster, 1 Desktop antenna and assorted hardware and mounting brackets etc. To test I mounted the cradle antenna at my front window with the suction cups supplied, connected the 20ft and 30ft cable together (with the supplied connector) ran the wiring along the floor to the booster in another room, connected the desktop antenna and sat it on a high shelf about 6ft high and pointed it thru one room to a large den. Plugged in the booster, two green lights came on. Turned on smartphone and my signal at the Desktop antenna said 65%. WOW, I have never received such a signal. Walked about 35ft to the end of the back den large room and my signal dropped to 40%. This is the signal I would get at my front windows! So here is my first test. I went to the kitchen which is 20feet away from the desktop antenna and to the side of the antenna and called virgin mobile and the call was crystal clear. This is an area where I could not make a clear call before! Also my data increased as follows:

Overall I use the Voyager the most.....but still use my 820 also.....but the voice quality blows the 820 out of the water......it's that much better. If you have any questions feel free sir_onion@yahoo
I took it out of its packaging and in seconds had it installed. It fit perfect. It is a quality product. It is well designed and produced.  It is definitely an idea that achieves its intent of protection of the expensive and vulnerable product inside. It looks great and feels great. It offers no impedance of use. I am very satisfied in my decision to purchase this product.
Second annoyance is the scarcity of USB connectors that fit the phone (I ordered one from Amazon that did not fit the connector). Also, it seems, even after you get a USB connection, it will not sync with common computer contact lists such as outlook. This is a major annoyance in this day and age.

PROS:

Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.
Overall there's no real reason not to recommend this phone. It's sleek and stylish, has a great price point, comes with plenty of goodies and plays music very, very well. It's worth every penny I paid for it, and that's not something I can often say!
Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.

I ordered it this past May - knowing that w/ 3 kids & all their friends, my phone would need protection from the summer pools, water sprinklers, garden hoses & water balloon fights! Not to mention bathing the 3 dogs. Well, it paid for itself more than once, when the kids or myself knocked it accidentally into a pool!

NO reservations :-) Well made, well priced, works EXCELLENTLY! What more can one say? Fabulous!!!
The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot.

So, here's where "expectation" and "variables" both come in. Some people would be furious at this, angry that it only covers two small rooms. For me personally? I'm fairly happy. Happy enough to keep it, let's put it that way. I don't have a home phone, so I rely on my cell phone. I'm also very flexible and willing to compromise. So for me it's good, I can now talk in my office and in my living room without dropped calls and without constantly saying "WHAT?" "WAIT, YOU'RE CUTTING OUT. WHAT?". So I have to say "hang on a minute" if I need to get a glass of water in the kitchen. For me, that's not a big deal. For other people, that might be a big deal, we're all different.
The sound quality is great. When I dial out the sound increases gradually so if you left it on max it doesn't scare you. You can adjust the volume at any time with the big "Volume+" and "Volume-" buttons on the device. Make sure the Call Volume of your phone is also on max if you need maximum volume.

8669	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Having lost/ smashed several expensive bluetooth headsets, I decided to go cheap. There wasn't anything cheaper on Amazon at the time of my buying, and I love Nokias, though I've only use their phones.

Returned it.
I am a network engineer and spend a good deal of time in data centers. For those who don't know what this means, picture being stuck in a large freezer with a small jet engine and you have a pretty good idea of the working conditions. It's so loud that it's impossible to carry one a conversation on a cell phone because the other side can't hear a word you say. I bought the Jawbone specifically for this work environment, on the advice of a co-worker. The active noise cancellation, when turned on and properly fitted, is not to be believed. Additionally, and I think many people miss this, the unit automatically increases the volume on my side so I can hear whomever I'm talking to as well as they can hear me. Fair warning, this thing can get LOUD. Many people list the price as a bad thing, honestly, you get what you pay for. This unit is priced appropriately for it's function and quality. I can wear the unit all day without any discomfort at all, though you will have to play with the different ear pieces and loops to find the ones that best fit you. I'm actually able to use the unit without the ear loop at all as long as I'm not being to active. As for durability, these units last a lot longer then just about any other blue tooth I have had. I am constantly drop kicking the poor thing across a parking lot or smashing it under a server and they can take the abuse, though see the next section for a caveat. Unlike a lot of headsets the ear loop is fixed non-rotating. This means it's actually quite a bit easier to put on because you don't have to line up the ear loop every time. Though as a result switching it from right to left ear takes an extra whole 10 seconds.

6221	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mobile charger for cell phones and portable devices like the first and second generation iPads.  Note that the output is 1A, so it isn't powerful enough to charge larger devices, like the third generation iPad or the Kindle Fire that require 2.1A for charging.
Cons:

lots of case, people experienced error that display turn to white.  My krzr is broken in 4 months. Its LCD turn to white blank permanently and never came back. also when you use menus or look up phone book, you will experience delay. You may be able to stand it, but there are many other phones work better.
- Decent vibrate
Talk time is maybe 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stand-by time is about 50 hours, both are less than acceptable.

2313	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This unit has a great display and good reception (I'm in a fringe area). My only complaints are with the connections. The proprietary charging and earphone connection has a flimsy and clumsy port cover. Holding it out of the way while inserting a connection is a two-handed and sometimes difficult operation. I'm tempted to just clip off the cover, which will probably come off soon by itself. As noted in other reviews, the unavailability of a standard earphone port makes the nice mp3 listening option almost moot.
-I just purchased this very cute starter kick for it that includes a case, flashlight and car charger.
+Easy to view LEDs let you know how much battery life remains.
4045	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This device did absolutly nothing to help my reception.  I tried it in a dozen locations in the house with several phones.  I have VERIZON and usually have good service, but not in the house.  The device blinks red when the antenna is too close to the booster.  In several cases, I had the antenna as far away from the booster as the booster plug and the antenna line would allow, still blinking red.  When I did get a green light, there was no change in my one or two bar signal on any phone.  Useless machine.

4455	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Last only 6 to 8 hours. I only talk on the phone maybe ten minutes a day.
Overall, I think it's a pretty good deal. You'll get a lot of compliments.
2126	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Giving it 4 stars just because UPS took forever to get this delivered to me and I needed it ASAP because my dog chewed my other one. Other then that it works just perfect. Works with my 8130 Perl... was a bit afraid since it didn't state it.
First is it was a bit difficult to open. There wasn't enough of an edge to let my thumb open it up quickly.
now the magnets on these are really strong. i mean they can support there own weight form one ear bud so its really easy to get them back to a home position when not in use.
SE: 10/10 Shine: 3/10
Though I appreciate that the micro USB adapters were included free of charge, I don't like the extra length the adapters create.  Understandably, the manufacturer wanted a universal charging cable with interchangeable adapters to fit an array of devices.  Great concept, but in reality, the adapters stick out from the phone a good distance and are made of hard plastic so they aren't the least bit flexible -- and that's a serious design flaw.  It makes absolutely no sense to have a cool mobile device only to have a needlessly loooooooong adapter protruding from it.  It's pretty ridiculous actually, and kills the convenience of using any mobile device while connected to those universal cables.  Not to mention, the long protrusion can easily be bumped or tweaked and totally screw up the connector inside the phone.  Needless to say, I wouldn't be happy if a product designed to keep me charged up and on the go ends up damaging my new phone!
The way Aliph markets the Jawbone and at the price, no one should have to tweak one thing to make the headset work or fit.
9437	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought this because I lived on an area that had no to one bar. This boosted it to a solid one, two and sometimes third bar. I was able to send text and make phone calls.
Battery Life: The claim that Sony Ericsson has poor battery life, in short, is complete bull ****. Those that say they had short battery life... you just got a lemon (or are trying to reason yourself out of the fact that buying a shine was actually a poor decision). My OTHER sister, who also got a Sony Ericsson, also gets great battery life with hers. Rather than the claimed "3-4 day charge" that many people on this forum and others are claiming, I have found that the phone will last over a week (11-13 days). The LG Shine, which is said to have poor battery life, disappoints: its battery life is indeed very short. The papers that the LG Shine comes with claims that battery life is around 3 hours of talk time, up to 240 hours (10 days) of standby time, is standard marketing bull ****: through a test of 10 different charges with three different batteries, the phone has lasted no more than 3 days before it required a charging.

So, here we have a device that sells for roughly $80 that -- it appears to me -- outperforms the Bluetooth hands-free system designed into my (otherwise nice) German car by fanatical Teutonic engineers. This is remarkable to me, and the Jabra continues to impress.

While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.
While I am somewhat disappointed that it only includes a car power supply, this is understandable as it is certainly best suited for mobile applications and proper power supply can be had at little relative cost.  I would also prefer the unit to use the more easily obtained 12v power supply, but I somewhat suspect the ease of obtaining extremely low quality 12v power supplies and simple straight through connectors to car lighters was the primary drive behind the switch.  Definitely understandable from their point of view given a burnt out or ill behaved unit resulting from improper power will make them look bad regardless of who's fault it actually was.


Setup was a Pain in the butt, that's my big knock on this thing. In our case (and from what I understand) you'll typically have to have it installed outside to get much value for it.  We have really thick tree coverage in the back yard and each direction pointing to the nearest Cell Tower. In fact, if you are standing in the backyard, front yard or sides, you can not see the tower at all.  we didn't' have Rabbit ears so had nothing to really attach to on the high part of the roof that would give us line of sight.  To get it working correctly, we ended up cutting a small swatch of foliage in the back yard so we could get clear LOS to the tower. We ended up mounting it to the back part of the roof on the lower side (basically, top part of 1st floor roof).  It took about 45 minutes to tweaking to get both green lights on which isn't unreasonable - however after about 20 minutes you really start wondering if you're going to be able to make it work. Even after 30 mins, we still couldn't get both greens on. Frustrated I decided to get the swath cut out in the back which ended up doing the trick. Outside of that, we had to drill a hole through the wall to feed the cable. our choices were to drill it in the roof and drop the cable through the wall, then run it into a connector , or basically drill a hole outside right next to the one that the cable company drilled for our cable (not saying it had to be next to the cable co's hole, just that it was proximate and that just happened to be a place with no wires and easily drilled through).

Installation is simple.  Simply route the antenna cable along the vehicle and place the antenna on the outside of the vehicle (magnetic attachment).  The cradle is powered by a DC adapter.  Simply place the phone into the cradle and use the phone's Bluetooth interface to speak hands free.  The biggest advantage for safety is that one cannot text and drive while using this device.  There is a port for charging your smartphone, too.
We both had iphones.


6097	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am really impressed at how New Trent was able to fit a 5200mAh battery into such a small design.  I also like the fact that it has a charging/de-charging indicator and has the bonus of having a laser pointer and LED flashlight.  This would be the perfect battery to keep in a laptop bag for meetings or presentations.  I also like the fact that it is charged by a micro USB cable and doesn't require any special adapters.  I would rate it a 5/5.
5343	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	One drop already, so this item has paid for itself already.  Great protection...little difficult getting in and out of the holster...but that can be a good thing.
The problem is that many of these features do not work particulary well relative to other cell phones and the fact that the phone is so small causes serious trade-offs. The problems stemming from small cell phone size are very serious. The most serious, if not the most serious, is the fact that the buttons are far to small to operate for most people. Unless you are midget or a woman with manicured nails the buttons are quite a challenge to operate. The second serious problem, again stemming from size, is small battery capacity. For casual cell phone use it suffices for a day but if you need to use this all day for business it definitely runs out of juice well before the end of the day. You will need to perpetually be charging it at client sites. With respect to the battery capacity problem, an additional problem is that the phone gives you no warning regarding the imminent demise of the battery. This is especially a problem as the phone, unlike most others, when it runs out of juice just shuts down and, when turned off for a few minutes, refuses to come back on (even for a few seconds).
In the US, make sure you get the GSM 850/1900 version, which will work with AT&T/Cingular and with T-Mobile. I have AT&T. I transferred my contacts onto my SIM card on my old phone, put the SIM into the F3, and it worked instantly. The only drawback with AT&T is that the cell towers don't correctly notify the phone that you have a voicemail waiting, so you don't get an icon to warn you about voice-mails. It does correctly alert you if you missed a call, though. I hope AT&T adds official "support" for this phone in the future so that my voicemail icon will work properly. Otherwise works flawlessly.
We purchased three of these for Christmas and they are fantastic. Large enough so that you won't lose it easily. The ear loop is sturdy yet flexible and hugs your ear. No chance of it flying off you head.
Linking to my LG 8300 cell phone was a breeze.
Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.
4980	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This product works in that it allows me to bridge from my Tape deck adapter to my Iphone through a rubber protector sleeve. I can hear my podcasts fine. However, when I tried to play music I noticed that something was terribly wrong. The sound was muted and the music was clipped and very flat. I removed the adapter and went back to a straight connection to the Tape Deck adapter. The volume doubled and sounded like music again. Not sure how they messed this up but they did.
3779	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This unit is actually smaller than I expected and that's good. It will be easy to tuck away under the dash where its not too noticeable. It also came with instructions to hardwire it instead of using the power socket. That was also a plus. Got it to run my Garmin and DVR at the same time and its working just fine.
2685	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Flawless fit, materials and looks. Mixing clear and frosted materials looks really cool. Adds almost nothing to the width, thickness and weight. Volume buttons a little hit and miss though if you're not looking at the phone while trying to raise/lower the volume. Would have been really flawless if it had click-able volume and power buttons.
Overall, this phone is one of the best on the market today.  I was a convert with the first RAZR, and with its subtle upgrades and refinements, the V3i is truly a worthy successor to the original.  However, with its few flaws, I'm still anxiously awaiting the "perfect" RAZR to be released from Motorola's braintrust.  Perhaps you could consider this the "penultimate" RAZR instead of the "ultimate" one.

Or, I can tap the button and tell it to "send my wife a text message"...then say the message.
7791	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a "dog incident", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head.  I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone.  All three of these phones support multipoint.  The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all.  All three worked well with the Centro.
564	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The booster antenna Does not work, it actually makes  cell service worse rather than better. Do not buy this product. It doesn't work at all.

1204	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Not much to say about this tool. It works well. It takes a fair amount of force to force its way down into the disposal cavity. It's a solid design. Seems like it will last. I don't leave it in the sink - only use it to push things down into the disposal.
9)  Amazing amount of phone and features for the price.
7952	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered 2 of this item and 2 of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/black-ones/dp/B000WKS8QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">black ones</a>&nbsp;from 4 different sellers after reading very mixed reviews on both items.  I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.
Range of BT is quite limited but that's the radio technology.
Here are the facts:
OTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.
I was expecting more after reading the reviews.


I really like how this items looks and functions, but I can't recommend it to anyone because of the swivel clip.

9467	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The cellular booster didn't work for me. Reception was not improved enough to warrant the $250 plus cost for the device. I have an ATT hotspot for internet service, that wasn't improved either.
3898	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love this shower head. Easy to install, easy to adjust and very sturdy. Also easy to clean.
I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a charger with some extra features. Just make sure you have a USB iPhone cable as well.


My only complaint is that even though the description states that it is compatible with the 8330 Curve, there is one part that really isn't for the Verizon 8330.  The Verizon 8330 has the notification LED on the actual face, to the right of the ear speaker.  The cutout for the LED however, is far above it.  This makes it so that a piece of the top is exposed unnecessarily.  The case functions the same but if you're wondering why there's a cutout when your LED is below it, now you know why.
8885	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've used this for a while now and tried it with iPhone 4s and 5 and some Droid phones and it works great.  It can charge a phone 3-4 times with battery to spare.  Easy to recharge, just plug in the USB cable.  While it can charge an iPad it cna't charge it fully.  If you need extra power for smartphones or other small devices this is great.  If your looking for tablet power look for a larger capacity external battery.

6592	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Ordered this for a friend who lives in a remote area. This works very well for him. He went from no bars in his living room to five, cannot complain about that.

7005	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The item arrived on time; however the screen protector peels off, doesn't cover the screen completely and air builds bubbles underneath. It also comes with a sticker that is suppossed to be removed easily after you have applied the protector to your screen, but it doesn't come off completely. It leaves a horrible trace of glue on the shield.  I do not recommend it.
2# The battery life is insanely long! Both of the new Treo's claim four to five hours talk time, I have found even longer. I often lay in my bed at night surfing the web for hours and hours, and by the time I am ready to go to sleep, my Treo 600 and 650 still have enough battery life to go a few more rounds.
The alarm clock and address book applications are fine. The included PC software works, albeit with a non-intuitive interface and text and help file written by someone who does not know English very well. The Multimedia Manager takes much too long (average 2 minutes each) to transfer mp3 files to or from the phone.
I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.
This is on top of the delightful service from T-Mobile. You won't need a ringtone because the phone will never be able to receive a call. I'd recommend creating a shortcut to voicemail as you'll use it all the time.
Pros:
Shape is made so that it fits great in your hand.

8449	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had my Lenovo T60P since new and have always had good luck, except with Windows Vista which was replaced with Windows 7--- that turned it from a good laptop to an awesome laptop. I have been thrilled to only have to replace a keyboard as one key became funky, and finally the battery turned for the worse.... 6-years later which in my book is great! I picked up this as I do not expect to have this laptop forever, but since I still find it is as fast as most newer units and has all of the features I need for business and personal use, I'm sticking with it.
Buttons don't 'feel' like they are working in a normal way and it takes a bit of getting used to.
The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs, that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.
9213	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Please do not waste your money ti doesn't worth it. I regretted ever buying this. It is very fake one!

Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.
Installation was fairly simple. Husband did in less than 2 hours, but only because we had to plan a route in attic.
2332	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I first bought the Moto H500 USB because it's cute, comes in bubble gum pink or lime green, its blurb says it's for VOIP, it is very tiny; and Plantronics' web site was selling this Voyager 510 USB for $200. Well, the moto thing didn't have Windows compatible drivers and crashed my PC about 5 times before I gave up. This was after having to research the Skype site for help. Surprising for Moto that they were obviously trying to sell it as a consumer product but didn't bother to make installation and activation easy.

The microphone on this device is very weak.  Callers cannot hear me but I can hear them loud and clear transmitted through my car stereo.  I can also hear the driving directions loud and clear.

As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.

4804	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	i bought this phone for my daughter for when she had sleepovers and school functions. However i thought i was safe with the pay as you go... we bought a $10.00 card for her, and used it a few times... still had a balance, however the fine print said that it uses $.35 per day if you use the phone or NOT. Thus sucked up our $10.00. When I called to place money on the card a couple of months later, found out that since we have not used the phone in over 30 days, and the account had a balance of 0 for 30 days, we had to buy a new sim card costing $9.95 plus pay for extra minutes. This IS NOT WORTH IT! You are better off adding a family line at $9.95 a month, and using your AT&T or T-mobile sim card and plan. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME like i did! Also their customer service SUCKS... For a plan designed for kids, the service is designed to trap you to keep pouring money into their account, not as an alternative family friendly phone for kids.
1449	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I'd like to point out I've never tried another Bluetooth headset, perhaps all Bluetooth headsets are terrible quality and this is the best on the market. That being said I did not enjoy this headset. There are a lot more "what did you say?" moments on BOTH ends of the phone. I couldn't here her and she couldn't hear me. I was often asked to stop using the headset.

Recommendation:

The Jawbone CAN be a good and comfortable fit, if the anatomy of your ear agrees with it. I was lucky that way, it was actually the most comfortable headset I have used. Even for me, though, it was not "instant love", it took a bit of training to learn how to put it on correctly in a hurry (i.e. when receiving an incoming call). The ear loops (4 different ones included in the package) are very stiff, and I can see how they would easily break after a while. The sound quality was excellent while in my car driving - even across a noisy concrete bridge there would be no way for the other party to tell. Also, incoming sound quality was great - the volume adjusts based on background noise, and the ear plugs are rubberized and block most other noise. It is also a good-looking headset; it matched my phone (a black Nokia N95 8GB) quite well. My main two issues with it were the charging connector (a proprietary one, and only a USB charging cable was included; also not that easy to plug/unplug), and the fact that the power-on time (from off to connected) was a bit too long (timing it, I got anywhere from 9 to 13 seconds..). I prefer to keep my headset turned off when not in use (battery life, connection-time issues.. etc.)
This Ansmann is superior in all ways to the LaCrosse, other than portability of course.

in closing...it is a good phone...but i think its a bit quirky and for me...i didn't consider it an excellent phone...in fact...my nokia 6131 worked better...sorry for the bad review...


You plug in the card and off you go.  Works just like my Nuvi 350.  The only down side is that if you use the phone the mapping software closes, one thing at a time.  That is due to the lack of processing power in the Treo not Garmin's fault.
3727	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great Product!
Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy.

In addition to in house chargers, I put a car holder in my vehicle in the lower left corner of the windshield and hid the cables under a dash mat to the stereo.  The install was fairly simple since I could place the antenna outside and fish the thin cable through the hatchback, then put the flat panel booster behind the phone mount with the amp under a seat.

The LED flashlight is pretty basic. It's bright enough, but I haven't found much use for it. Same goes for the laser pointer. The unit has a nice form-factor for handheld usage, but barring an emergency I can't imagine using the iTorch over a standard pointer. Think of it as a really great charger with an emergency flashlight.

I suggest you buy a MOTOROKR T505 instead, which is what I got for myself (it has better volume and can transmit the call to an FM station on your radio).

Dont expect to text much or listen to music on this phone but it functions great for what I need it for.

The belt loop and belt clip are a first for me, but the loops are thin enough that they aren't in the way if you only use the clip.  If you want to use the loops, the clip is definitely in the way, necessitating using the loops and the clip.  The loops don't inspire a great amount of confidence by themselves - so I just use the clip.

Bottom line, if you want to add the safety of having a VHF radio with you while you kayak, I recommend the Cobra unit based on its price and its small size and weight.

1994	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have used another  Motorola battery-telephone charger for Nextel phone and this one has been similar in quality, they both do the job quietly and relatively fast, this one in particular has a LCD display that shows you the progress of the the charging cycle. So far this has been working flowlessly and I would recommend it to people like me who always need an extra battery in the pocket or at the charger base. Good product.
2533	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The case fits great, it looks good, and it provides good protection.  It is sufficiently thick and elastic to cushion a fall without making the phone much bigger.  If this is the style of case you are looking for, you can't get a better case.  The phone is also easy enough to remove that you can switch between this and another case easily.
The second layer is a hard case that snaps around the phone holding the first in place and the third is a silicone shell that covers the second layer and keeps the whole package together like a suit of armor. On the yellow phone you are seeing the yellow is the hard case and the black is the silicone case. The black case is identical just all black.

The other issue, that I have gotten used to, is the very tight fit for my iPhone 6. When putting the phone in the cradle, I have to push hard to get it to go in, while pushing up on the cradle from the bottom, being sure to not put pressure on the cables. When removing the phone from the cradle, I have found that I can pull the wings out to the side a little, giving more space for removing the phone.

2842	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I saw this gear bag a while ago and noticed that there was really nothing like it for the iPod touch or iPhone.  I travel a lot and wanted something I could put my iPhone in when I was on an airplane and that could also hold my accessories.  It was a toss up between this and a camera bag, and I am glad I bought this.  If you check the dimensions of an iPhone or touch they are pretty close to the newer large screen zunes.  I got the gear bag today and it fits great.  My iPhone 3GS in a Incase Slider fits great.  The quality is also much better than most camera cases.  So if you need something to store your iphone in while you travel and hold the charger, headphones, and other small parts, this will work perfect.



* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons. I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry, be sure to turn off the "Echo Control" setting in the BT menu for this headset.)


4) I broke my first one by putting it in my sports bra while I ran (see 3). I guess it didn't like the moisture, and now the buttons don't work, and I can't shut it off. So, don't do that.

This small power pack has plenty of power for my iPhone 4S, but fell short when trying to charge my Asus Transformer tablet. One charge on the power pack was enough to charge my iPhone twice from 2% charge to 100% (in about 3 hours each time), and there was still enough power left to take my phone from 1% to 28% on the third attempt. It did not do as well on my tablet as it was only able to take the battery level from 2% to 45% (about 4 hours) before the power pack was drained. Being able to give my tablet a full charge would be awesome, but Im sure the power pack would have to be a lot bigger to allow it to do that. The NewTrent power pack would be great for outdoorsmen that need to take their cell phones with them, or high drainage users that are away from a plug-in power source. I suspect my daughter will steal mine so that she can take a full day of school notes on her iPad.

Summary:
VerizonWireless pricing is another concern, since this phone is a VerizonWirless exclusive I believe.  The standard 900 minute plan plus unlimited data totals about $110 before taxes.  After adding on $15 for a feature which allows the Q to be used as a broadband modem (Older Q models will need to download the latest patch first), $10 for 500 text messages, and $6 for insurance, my total monthly bill comes out to be somewhere north of $150.  If you are concerned with the cost and your company is not reimbursing your wireless bills, I suggest giving up this phone and use another carrier as similar level of services could cost $40+ less.
I finally wrangled it into the trunk area and was admiring my hard work when I realized something - THIS THING FITS BETTER UPSIDE-DOWN IN SOME CARS.  The angled top corners actually left enough space between the barrier and the windows for my smaller dog to fit her head through and destroy my upholstery.  So I took it out, flipped it upside down, and re-installed it.  Another 20 minutes later, I was once again done.  Now, it works fantastically.

I was thinking that this is something I could walk around with to boost my signal. It is not. This kit is meant to be installed in your car. Installation requires running a wire through your car and out the door to an antenna on the roof. You then have to place your phone in the holder attached to your dashboard for the system to work.
Great battery life

A negative seemed to be that the watch band is long - really long. It's longer than the stock leather band. But it turned out that the buckle is a bit on the side and the end strap can be "bolted" into place on the other side. This leaves you with the ability to rest your hand straight down without feeling the buckle pressing in on the underside of your wrist. Turns into another pro for most people. I have average sized mens wrists.

890	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The two biggest drawbacks are the fact that the wires attached to the earbuds get in the way (they need to produce a retractable model), and Motorola does not sell replaceable cushions for the buds.  I lost one that fit my ear and had to settle for a larger one that kept falling out because I couldn't find replacements anywhere.  The range on this thing is amazing, however, and they are lightweight and sound great.  I am moving on to another Motorola device however because of the aforementioned reasons.  The price has dropped on all of them and I can get a better set for less than I originally paid for these.  Also, I tried my wife's LG set....I liked the vibration feature, but the range is MUCH shorter than the Motorola brands.

38	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this case for my daughter for Christmas because she got an IPhone for Christmas and I wanted her to have a really nice phone case that was different because EVERYBODY has the same IPhone cases.

I loved the fact that this case came a few days earlier than expected and THE PRICE WAS AMAZING for a really cute 3D IPhone case too.
The case is slightly roomier than some and has a pocket in which a couple of SD cards can be stored. Unlike some others, I can actually fit my Treo 650 with a "skin" case in this leather pouch.
3136	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I like this when I first received the car mount but after a few days the mount just fell off my vent. It broke. Not happy with my purchase but I cant expect much from a $5 mount. Better luck next time I guess!

2361	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Ordered this thing on Sep 19th.  It did not ship until Oct 26th!  And don't even get me started about the stupid reasons customer service gave as to why an In STOCK item took that long to ship.  Anyway, I finally got it.  I was so excited because of the great reviews I read.  When I saw the ear hook, I was like WHAT!  This is a flimsy piece of cr@p!  I thought to myself, "This is going to break as soon as I use it, so I had better just leave it on."  Then to my utter AMAZEMENT!  YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF TO CHARGE THE DUMB THING!  After the second charge, guess what?  IT BROKE!  Big surprise!  Now I have to hold the unit to my ear to use it, or if will fall out.  Not that the ear hook was all that great, the thing still fell off even when it had the ear hook.  I can't really comment about how well the thing works, because I can't keep it charged.  After the first complete charge, it died after one phone call.  It was about an hour phone call, but gee whiz!  This is my 5th bluetooth ear piece, so I have a little experience with these things.  My biggest complaint with the others was low speaker volume and noise interference.  I wish I would have had the chance to test this one out but it's going back to Amazon.  Maybe I should file an RMA and then wait a month and a half to ship it back to them. LOL!
Note...these are packaged 12 in a plastic bag.  When I last looked, they were much cheaper than the precut protectors designed for a specific cell phone.

As mp3 players go, it's nearly unusable.
3141	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield.  I discovered 2 things:
Pros
It comes with 4 ear hooks, which is 2 for left and 2 for right ear. That sounds odd, but the hooks are slightly bent to fit either right or left ear. The reason is because it is spring loaded to gently force the speaking sensor next to your face. The hooks are 2 different sizes and the wire can be bent to better fit your ear. After doing some adjustments the headset fits snuggly and does not flop around. It also comes with 4 different shaped ear buds. The charger is unusual. The cable that plugs into the wall charger is USB, so you can use the same cable to charge the Jawbone on your PC.
1228	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this headset to work with my Audiovox SMT5600, not listed by Jabra as compatible, but I took the chance anyway. The headset, which I purchased online, arrived with no instructions, but did include the charger, charger cord, belt hook, and several earbuds. A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter. All functions of the headset, including vibrating ring and voice dial, work with my phone. Sound quality is generally excellent -- it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece. All bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down, precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they can't hear me. In fact, I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does. I haven't measured any run-down times, but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone, which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days. The headset is light and, for me, comfortable; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there. The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud. The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch. Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing. The rocker controls volume up and down; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up. Press the button to answer or hangup, hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on. My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently, so does the headset. The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster. An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle (unplugged, of course) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn. With practice, the headset can be put on with one hand. There is no provision for charging in an automobile, which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting. Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day. On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler.  Other than the lack of a car adapter, which can be remedied aftermarket, my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal. This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received. This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset, it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear. Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side.  The headset is rated for up to 30 meters; this does not include walls or other obstructions. Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone. Practice proves this. Lack of adjustability aside, this is a good headset with outstanding battery life. It's available at a reasonable price and, thus far, no other headset has wooed me away.
Note: unlocked phones will only provide voice and text messaging services on any GSM network.  The service provider has to set them up to provide multimedia, web access and other services.  Many low end unlocked phones are last year's new but excess inventory for a service provider and will have their logo and service icons on the phone.  This is typical.  You also need the user manual for the manufacturer set PIN and other security #s to initially access the phone's functions.  User manuals can be found online at the manufacturer's web site.
I brought my iPod for him to watch movies and some of his favorite TV shows on to pass the time. We also had our cell phones and my wife had her Kindle. With the poor battery life of most of these devices, I knew I needed something to charge them with when there were no accessible power outlets. This device was extremely easy to use and the connectors are great. I have my iPod in a case but it connected without any problems so I could plug it in while our son kept watching Diego. It also charged all the other devices with the included tips.
never tried web surfing, texting or any other feature on the phone.
First off, phone performance:
Still think it's a great phone, And if you absolutely MUST, you can get on the internet and you can take a snapshot. Unfortunately, that will cost you extra.

* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to "geotag" pictures with your location as you use the camera).
  I also used the headset at home and at other times when just walking, and it has worked. Therefore, the headset did not serve the intended purpose of use while driving, although i still use it off and on.

The only 'problem' is that all three devices are 'too smart' for me to be able to use all three functions at the same time. All three devices can connect to two other devices simultaneously; the phone to the headset and the GPS; the GPS to the phone and the headset; and the headset to the phone and the GPS. And all have logic allowing a signal on one input to intelligently overide the signal on the other input. So if I connect them all at once, the GPS gives me navigation directions, which the headset picks up, but the phone also detects the directions, decides that they need to be passed on to the headset (since the phone is not 'in use') and repeats them about a quarter second later to the headset, The headset starts relaying the instruction from the GPS, then gets the instructions from the phone, decides a message from the phone overides an (assumed) 'music input', and overides the GPS instruction with the same instruction a quarter second later from the phone, but only during the actual words, it flip-flops back to the other signal in the silences between words! The result is what I can only describe as a 'stuttering echo' or an 'echoing stutter' :D

I'm 5'8" and it's big enough to cover me from mid chest to feet. I love it and can't really complain.
Issues: Upon the first charge it heated up my mp3 player when I charged it. I did charge it though and I used it again with supervision. The mp3 player doesn't feel warm when charging via usb wall charger. The 2nd and 3rd charge of my mp3 player went better; it did not heat up. On the second cycle (after recharging the IMP52D, iTorch external battery) the same thing happened - 1st charged warmed up my mp3 player (2nd, 3rd, ok). But this time I set my mp3 player on a cold sandstone coaster and it didn't seem to heat up as much. I set it on a glass table other times and that seemed to help as well. You might also recommend taking the product you are charging (if it has one) out of its case so it can cool easier.

Finally, the battery on this phone runs out a little faster than some other phones.  If you play around with this phone often the battery will run out in a day.  If you don't it will last 2-3 days.

6676	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I'm actually leaving this review from my phone sitting in my recliner where I was previously rarely able to get signal. This kit enabled me to get signal but tied me to a couple of feet within the indoor antenna. I purchased an upgraded wall mount Wilson antenna and it has provided me with almost whole home coverage. If your signal us weak outside, an antenna upgrade can help a lot.
Don't buy
As a delivery driver in Michigan, I'm out in all types of weather, no problems yet with this phone, but I wouldn't suggest using in a downpour! (Nextel does have models specifically for those types of conditions...)

1995	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I've had this for about a month now, and it's pure garbage.  Everything worked fine at first.  After about 2 weeks, I noticed that the original battery that came with my phone couldn't hold a charge like it used to, so I started using the backup battery almost exclusively.  Next, the cord that you plug into your phone didn't always recognize that it had been plugged in.  I thought it was my phone at first, but I tried plugging in the original charger that it came with a few times and it recognized it easily.  Now I have to play a little game of "What do we have to do to make the phone recognize the cable today?" whenever it needs a charge.  Even after I've found the place that it finally recognizes and put it down, I'll get up in the morning to find that the phone hasn't charged at all and is now dead.  Avoid this product at all costs!  There must be a better brand of this product out there somewhere....
9082	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	So I purchased because my Droid Charge eats batteries whenever I use it for anything long term, using the GPS it will last less than 30 minutes, sometimes on a walk I will want to pull up a map or use the pedometer feature to see how far I have gone, well then it just dies, now I can just stick the iTorch in my pocket and charge my phones 1600ma battery several times.
1051	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This meter seems to do what it claims.  Its really very interesting to move it around in rooms and near electrical devices and outlets to see what readings you get.  We have a lot of computer and electronic devices in our home and I feel better getting some idea of which devices and areas have the most energy.  I was blissfully unaware of the levels of EMF and this meter certainly fixes that.  I would have rated it 5 stars if there was a "hold button" that you press at the highest reading mark so that you can read the level after it was taken.  Even better would an automatic highest reading indicator that you could clear for each type of energy scan.  Nonetheless I like the meters flexibility in being able to scan electric and magnetic energy readings and I do recommend it.



It can be a little bit annoying  to assemble and also to put into the car, but once you get used to it, it's really not too bad. Definitely saved me from having to buy a larger vehicle to separate my huskies (they are not capable of sharing a seat).

1183	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Spoke with Wilson Tech Support first to make sure which connectors I needed.  I couldn't tell by the descriptions.  Armed with the correct cable part number this purchase was just exactly what I needed.  Great purchase.
LCD also blinks green when the headset is turned on but not connected to your phone, then blinks blue when linked to your phone! Makes it easy to know if device is linked with your cell phone or not. LCD turns red while charging, and green once charge is completed.
1903	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This Plantronics headset is the third Bluetooth unit that I have used and it is by far THE BEST one out there! The clarity is excellent--most times the person on the other end can't tell whether I'm using an earpiece or not. It also fits more comfortably in the ear than all the others. I highly recommend it!
As I mentioned, though, there are some chinks in the armor.  First, the iTunes format is clunky and slow to navigate through.  Your iPod defintely moves through the menus much more quickly than does this phone.  Also, regardless of the size of the TransFlash card you have installed, iTunes limits the number of songs you can store to 50.  I've heard that some later models have this limit removed (or at least increased), but my version caps the fun at 50 songs.  Also, while the external speaker sounds good, I forego using the Motorola stereo headphones due to their poor sound quality.  Obviously, when I'm at the gym or on a transatlantic flight, I rely on my iPod for musical entertainment.

-the cable they provide works both for charging the battery and the phones.
4670	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my Note 3, and it has worked great.  The last case I had, the swivel clip came loose, and finally fell off.  And, this was after only 2 weeks of normal use.  The clip on this one is non-swivel, and is also made of metal.  I recommend this product.
Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it.  They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear.

My number one complaint of most headsets is amplified volume, the Scala is extremely loud and adjustable which is a great benefit. Most other headsets you have to strain over background noise to hear which annoys me to no end. You won't have that problem with the Scala 500
so far, they stick great, you may have to find a better glue or glue sheat, but the clips are sturdy and i feel better that i can just clip my phone to my shirt or purse and don't have to worry about losing it.

Gave it a 5 because its only negative is that it has added bells & whistles which aren't necessary.
I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.

Pros:
6301	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I found this a week before I left for Austin, TX. I wanted something to plug into my iPhone so I could watch movies on the plane. I received the item and was excited to see the additional adapters it had. I realized I could also charge my camera if need be while I was out and about. I got on the plane and plugged it in. I successfully watched 3 movies roundtrip from Milwaukee, WI, to Austin, TX, and back - and with no change to the actual iPhone battery. While I was in Austin, I did have to recharge my camera battery. We were on the road and I had this in my purse, so I plugged it in - the IMP500 charged my iPhone right up! Both my sisters have iPhones and while we were at a restaurant, one of them used it too. They could not beleive it! To make it even better, my friend was over the other day with her LG phone and it died. She was so upset because she had places to go and no cell phone. I checked the adapters and one of them that came with this battery fit into her phone. I was able to charge her phone while she visited. In an hour, her battery was full and the battery meter on the IMP500 didn't even budge. I highly recommend this device to anyone. It's great to have, it is going to be wonderful on our trips this summer, and it is a quick saver when you need it most. I am shocked at how well it has performed!

When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone "speaks" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing "3" sets the language to English and you're set.

I decided to purchase the new I torch by Trent. This battery pack is wonderfully convenient and fits easily in my pocket or purse. I quickly charges my device fully and has enough power to charge my device fully about 5 times! Ive tried other external battery charging devices only to be disappointed by there performance.  Trent I torch will not disappoint!  Its extremely easy to use and is compact enough to carry anywhere with you on the go. It has a nice cable that's perfect length to enable you to still use your device while its changing!  It has a display that when pressed shows you how much power is still available in the battery pack which is a very nice feature. It also uses the same charger as my cell phone making it very convenient to charge. It comes with a handy flash light and a laser pointer. Its fairly light and feels good in the hand. This is a absolute necessity for Smart Phone owners. Whenever and where ever my phone needs a charge I simply use my I torch and pull it out of its handy carrying case  that comes with it. I plug in the provided usb cable and I'm good to go. This product has a very powerful battery and your devices will quickly charge no matter where you are! I don't leave home without it! It exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this product! Now I don't worry about my battery dieing I know no matter where I'm at I can easily and conveniently use my I Torch to recharge my device.  This is a must have product ! Thank you trent for this quality product! It works wonderfully!  I no longer worry about my battery level. I know I can count on my I torch to charge my device fully without any problems! This is a quality device and its so convenient!  Five stars to the I torch by trent! Amazing product! I don't leave home without it! A must have for smartphone owners!

Got 5 for the price of one at the local pharmacy.

*Stays connected to my Motorola E815. My Plantronics (both of them) would disconnect randomly.
So that is how it performed for me and here are my pros and cons:
It doesn't pick up my voice dials as well as the old.
4095	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a great price -- I've seen this for sale at the phone store for $26.95. The Blackberry slides in and out easily. The magnetic fastener holds well and is easily opened. At this price, I bought two so I can have one for the future or give one away and be someone's best friend.
7311	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When I bought this phone about a couple of years ago... I bought it for myself to put a pay as u go sim card in it. It is of quality make, durable and it doesn't look like its gonna break anytime in the near future.
I wish we would have never spent the $250 or so it cost to get installed and buy.
I don't have the data plan. If you're going to pay the exhorbitant monthly fee for data, you should get a smart phone that makes better use of it.
-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the "smart" keys to do the task.
2. LG's website mentions no such device, nor drivers, for any
8299	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	If ever there was a case you wanted to just drop your Blackberry into a pod to charge and not worry about messing with cables or plugs, this is the case. It sits perfectly in the pod and charges every single time.
5938	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The IMP52D has been disappointing. It charges very fast; it supplies a lot of current. The charge delivered is only about 50%-60% of rated capacity. I have owned batteries that delivered as much or more than their rated capacity. The form factor is very good. It fits anywhere in my ScottEvest jackets, and I do like the LED light and the laser. The ergonomics are very good. I use the laser often in presentations. Unfortunately, this "5200" mAh battery is actually a "2600" mAh battery. For me, that is unacceptable. The core capability of this is as a battery, and it does not perform anywhere near its stated capacity.

It also comes with an extension cable for the 3.5mm cord (tho the port is right below the 12V port in my car), AND a 5V USB port in case you want to charge any device, so you don't have to unplug the unit, it basically doubles as a car charger. Audio quality is great, I compared it to a straight wired connection and I could only detect a slight dropoff in bass, no skipping or hiss and volume is loud enough and can be independently controlled on the phone or your stereo (except w/an iPhone/iPod which locks the volume, again, crappy BT stack/implementation on Apple's part).
9970	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I can not in of itself review this product because it was the wrong cell phone battery for my unit, what I can say, is that this company customer service is outstanding, if I could rate them it would be more than five stars
I purchased this headset four days ago. I could not be happier. This morning I sat it on my head for a long commute, and forgot it was there within 5 minutes. The road was wet, but even with the accentuated tire noise I could hear every word. I made several calls, and one person was not aware I was in my car.
Connectivity is the biggest plus on this little guy - I can connect to Wi-Fi at home while still being connected to the verizon cell phone signal - a big plus for me as the i730 would shut off the phone function when the Wi-Fi was engaged.  I'd bet the i760 which I nearly got does the same thing. This ability to surf the web for free at home w/o missing a phone call is great for anyone like me who doesn't get the data plan.
9100	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the iTorch a few days ago and I have already had to use it.  I love the fact that it is so small and fits in my purse easily.  I like that it uses a USB connection; it makes it easy to charge and so much more versatile.  It charged up fully in about 3 hours after I received it.  It also comes equipped with a laser light and an LED light that are nice add ons.  It comes with a nice little pouch to keep it in so that it doesn't get all scratched up.  I plan on keeping this with me at all times.
So while it worked, it worked awesome!
Suggestion: Buy one extra screen and practice applying it.
These results are right in line for the stated 5200Mah; which is good.
6872	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good value
5463	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I confess to being skeptical ahead of time (so many of these types of products don't work) BUT this product really does work.  Generally I pick up an extra 'two bars' of signal reception in weak areas.  In one location, where the phonehad  just dropped out and reported no signal, I was able to get two bars with 3G.  This unit is for a car but I also tried it out at my cabin that has virtually no AT&T coverage (occasionally a text message sneaks through but you can't even send a text).  As I was testing it a call came in that I was able to answer and then I did an internet search.  I've already ordered a larger unit for the cabin.
It will charge my iPhone from 20% to 85% in about two hours and will go higher given more time. I had hoped it would give a little bit more boost to my iPad than it does but the New Trent website description clearly states that it has 35% of iPad battery capacity so I have no issue here.

5726	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Its very simple stick it on and go...I broke my clip on my mc50 holster and this was a great replacement!



Then it should work for you too at first it wasn't working some fine tuning and I went from one bar and dropping calls to 4g four bars but only in the same room with the antenna it doesn't seem to be that strong for pushing out a signal


The So-So:
I received the unit today and the packaging was the first thing that caught my attention.  It's in a trifold type package...the actual handset on one side, the base and handset on the other and underneath are the connections and an installation CD for Outlook.  In the middle of the packaging is a slot on the side which contains the instructions.




Great little phone. it makes phone calls and sends and receives text messages, and that's about it. it does have an alarm, and you can change the ringtone among 9 presets I believe. That's it. No camera, no organizer, no apps, no web, no touchscreen.
2026	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Has good looks and size, special features not compatible with smartphones like treo palm, must have a motorola phone for it to work good, battery lifecycle not good, used it for about 3 months and battery never worked again :(

This is my first New Trent product and it will certainly be one of many I'll use in the future. It is solidly built and has a study quality feel and issleekly designed and has tremendous power compared to many I've used. I have blown through many batteries this week that died before fully charging me but the only one that kept me charged and ready throughout the week was the Itorch. It had worked on my Android as well as Apple products and has clear indicator lights that let you know how much charge is left on the itorch--no wondering when it will die. The separate output Ports for both lower power devices and higher power tablets also is a great touch. This device has literally saved my lifeand allowed me to get vital information during a dangerous storm when other chargers failed me. If a backup battery is important to you buy this product and trust no other. I know I won't.
4523	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Most of these reviews don't tell the reader which device or cell phone the writer is using with the headset, and being some reviews are all over the board, I'd guess that what you pair your specific headset to has alot of impact on how well it works. I'm using the Voyager 815 with a Blackberry Pearl, and it sounds excellent.

2) Only the upper part of the clip is fixed to the case body, which makes the clips very fragile and very annoying and difficult to put it on.  'This is alone a deal breaker'
Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!

4094	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I'm a road warrior who logs a LOT of time traveling.  I've abused this thing in every airport from EWR to LAX and it has performed as advertised to date.  No clip failures, magnetic latch is reliable, it hasn't loosened up significantly and appears to offer pretty good protection for my beloved Crackberry.  The RIM 'holster' function works fine so obviously the phone is sensing the magnet correctly and going into holster profile exactly as it should.  It's your basic black, boring holster that you'll see on 10,000 traveling businessmen in any airport in America (me included).  If that fits your needs, can't go wrong with it.
That being said, this phone does an amazing job of having almost everything that most people would want.


Overall, quite satisfied.
1872	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The price of this is what attracted me but the quality is outstanding. The many extensions are nice add-ons and the 3/4 size blade seems to be just the right size. i cut my own hair and cutting your hair with a cordless clipper is extremely convenient and efficient. so far i have not seen any battery issues and the attachments stay in place and work as expected. the charging stand is nice and compact and the clippers cut nicely (no pulling or tugging of hair). also comes with 1/2 and 1+1/2 size attachments which actually look much better than a 0 or 1. Anyone who cuts their own hair should have one of these. Oh, and you can travel with them easily.

I use the headset everywhere and not only for telecons. I use it to listen to audio books everywhere - in the gym, waiting for the train and when bored somewhere and I forgot to bring a book. I'd even fall asleep wearing the headset listening to my favorite podcasts. I think that's why after half a year, I wore mine down.
* The rollerball took a little getting used to, but after less than a day, I'm an expert. OK, not quite an expert, but I dialed in the sensitivity to suit my needs. I also turned off that annoying clicking sound. I guess that was supposed to simulate the audible "click" you would get from the old wheel.
9909	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Whenever I get a new portable device, one of the first things I do is buy a screen protector, then I have my husband apply it. When hubby got a Blackberry, I ordered these right away. When they arrived, I told him to put one on. Whenever I try to put something on like that, I end up with a mess. Well, hubby waited too long for my taste, so when he forgot his phone one day, I opened these up and stuck it on his BB myself.
There are three different protectors; all different sizes (thickness). One is impossible to put on without 100 little bubbles, and believe me, I'm thorough, the other is thicker and much better. There are also two stickers to assist in the removal of the film from it's protector. These stickers will leave an unsightly residue however, rub a little nail polish remover (an old trick) and it will come right off without touching the phone.

9929	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased an entire new rig, and this was one of the components. All work great and Bianchi makes a great product. Lighter than the leather gear I used to use, and doesn't need polishing. If something gets damaged or injured, just toss it and replace it. Also doesn't squeak. Very important if you know what I mean. I also love the Velcro inner belt. really hold things nicely. If you are like me though, you just don't have enough real estate to hold everything comfortably. I now have my taser holster sharing in the work, and it works well. Just don't put a lot of weight on it and you'll be fine.

I think most people would enjoy this phone.  It does not sync with a Mac, by the way, unless you buy 3rd party software.  Aside from that, it's a winner for me.

My only complaint is that even though the description states that it is compatible with the 8330 Curve, there is one part that really isn't for the Verizon 8330.  The Verizon 8330 has the notification LED on the actual face, to the right of the ear speaker.  The cutout for the LED however, is far above it.  This makes it so that a piece of the top is exposed unnecessarily.  The case functions the same but if you're wondering why there's a cutout when your LED is below it, now you know why.

This one is equipped with a hardwiring option so you can place it in the system with its own fuse block and leave your stock outlets free.
Only things i find wrong with the phone is that the keylock is useless, the keys for 911 are still active, so if you have it in a pants pocket and the volume isn't on off or vibrate you will hear the DTMF tones going off on every step. and you might accidently dial 911 in the process.

2371	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	...it probably is. I would be well served to remember that before buying stuff next time. This thing was just so tiny I had to have it. And for the first 2 weeks it worked ok. Not great, just OK. Then the talk time began slipping... then the static began... then people started telling me they couldn't understand me. Then it stopped working completely. Less than 3 weeks old and already headed to the trash. What a waste.
Cell phone coverage at home is now a necessity for me, because I'm running my business out of my house. In fact, my office is in the basement, where the reception is the worst. So it was either find better reception or rent an office.
213	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Advertised as the Galaxy Note 3 charger but does not come with the charger plug (which is different) for the Note 3, making it charge more slowly.
This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.
I am a little confused with the flashlight and laser. I would prefer just a battery, and the only reason for me is easy-Sometimes I hold the button down too long and the light comes on. Getting that off and getting back to just the battery is kind of tedious, but I will get used to it.

Secondly, I'm a bit obsessive-compulsive when it comes to planning, organizing, etc. and for 8 years I have not been able to let go of using paper planners rather than switching over to a PDA. I decided to switch over this year since as a new nurse, I don't trust to carry much to work, especially an organizer spilling over with post-it notes. As for phone usage, I am not a power user but I do use it several times a day in short conversations.

3) you need to change the Wii Settings to use 480p after completing 1 and 2.


8453	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	We tried to use this radio on a boating trip and it was effectively useless. Although it would turn on and transmit and receive immediately after being turned on, it soon went dead after being on for a few minutes.
I've purposely stress-tested it in some pretty noisy situations.  First of all, my own vehicle.  I have an older car, and it seems to pick up all of the outside noise there is, even with my windows up.  If it is raining, my callers could hear the rain on the windshield when using other headsets.  When a semi drove alongside my car, the noise of the big truck distracted my callers from our conversation.
4873	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great with my IPhone 3G. Sounds good, and I haven't had any complaints from folks on the other end.  The battery check feature is great. Like others I wished they kept the old ac adapter so that I can use my old one from my H700.
4495	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This item has truly end my search for a bluetooth device in which I can pair with my iPhone, and offer a solution to listen to my music at the same time. The Plantronics Voyager 855 gave me the ability to lose myself in stereo sound. I'm able to listen to music while working and never miss a an important call. The sound quality is great, but I have notice some random skips while listening to music in stereo (the reason why it looses one star in my rating). But this is a very small concern given I'm finally free from that cable to my iPhone. The ear buds are great and you even get form tips if you don't like wearing the plastic ones. BTW you can even use this device to activate the iPhone's voice controls!! As you can see/ tell I'm very happy with this device.
It supports all current bluetooth standards. Does your device?
Qwerty keyboard
2259	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does exactly what it's supposed to do: allow you to plug in a Mini-USB plug into a place you couldn't fit it before because of the angle.
- Quick charging.
In short, if you are a fan of the Palm OS like I am, the Centro is definitely worth a look...but I cannot emphasize enough to get that look in PERSON rather than in photos.  If you have trouble using a Qwerty keyboard on the regular Treo's, the Centro will only compound that issue I promise you -- otherwise, kudos to Palm for a great upgrade and nice packaging.
1331	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.
558	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Works on some phones, others not a bit. Can't believe these are even sold yet... Got them for all my family and friends. Not worth getting in my honest opinion.

6765	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love Energizer batteries. I was able to bring new life into a couple of my older watches.
6196	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is so handy.  I get about 175% charge on my Nexus S 4G (which admittedly has a battery on the smaller side compared to most phones today).  I use it when I travel and it works awesome.  I bought it before they changed the look/features of it and it looks even better now - the battery itself uses USB to charge (why didn't they do that in the first place?).  After dozens of uses, it still charges just as much as it did on the first day (I've had it for 5 months).
2425	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Got it working with the Cingular Sync aka Samsung A707. People say I sound great on it and didn't realize I was wearing one and I have a car with a lot of wind-noise. Fit better once I cut off the loop. And I can see why people say it hurts after a long time or it may fall off. I don't intend to use it for hours or use it out of the car. So if it falls off, it will fall under the seats where I can retrieve it. The only reason to use it is in the car due to the state law. I turn it on before I drive and when the phone rings I put it in the ear and hit the button. When I'm walking around, I use the handset. Its my first BT device and it does what it supposed to do. Which is handle calls well while I drive. If you are looking for one to wear all day in the mall, this is not the one for you.
annoying at&t startup (flying whooshing fiery balls, very loud)

This is my second bluetooth headset.  I waited for a year to write a review because my last one quit working after 3 months due to poor design.  This one is still going strong.  It's easy to use, it recharges easily and quickly and the sound quality is great.
The clarity on my end was great; I can hear the person clearly with no problem and I have the option to turn the volume up or down.  I was able to find this bluetooth elsewhere for only $22 so I decided to buy 2.  I have had the cheap bluetooth where you have to have the phone next to the bluetooth in order to prevent from hearing it crackle, which also did not have volume control and uncomfortable.  I have also had the bluetooth that would reconnect and disconnect on its own in the middle of a call.  The only reason why I bought the H710 is because it had great reviews and I lost the crappy cheap ones.  In other words, I was devastated when it stopped working.
All in all, a great product; highly reccomended for anyone who wants to take their music on the road!  10/10
-Well lit
5719	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very good clip replacements.  I replaced the original one I bought with my Cellet cover.  These swivel around which is a feature I like.
8769	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This has been a great wallet/ case for me.  It provided a comfy & secure fit for my Treo 650 then for my iPhone 3Gs.  The craftmanship & materials are surprisingly good for the price.  Neither the magnetic closure nor the belt clip has let my phone fall or escape its grip.  The wallet is "tightly" crafted.  Initially all the card slots seem too small, but the quality leather will endure some stretching for a custom fit.  I definately prefer a snug fit instead of unzipping and having cards fly everywhere.
Pros- Excellent screen.
7264	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My Nokia bit the dust and I didn't want to get another one tied into a carrier so this one seemed to be what I needed. The "Moto" is easy to use, has good reception and for those who want the 'net on their phones this one gives you that capability. Battery life is more than adequate for my use since I turn it off at night. If you need a phone that doesn't make coffee this is the one for you.
1984	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very useful.
3435	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this because I had a good experience with its predecessor (the 655) but I hated wearing an earpiece while in the car.  The Discovery 665 has a wonderful car charger/holder that allows you to dock the headset conveniently in the charger until a call arrives - at that point you simply pull the 665 out of the charger and it connects the call as you are swiftly inserting the headset into your ear.  It also seems to perform better in screening out wind noise than the 655.  After the call is ended just hang up by removing the 665 from your ear and inserting it into the car charger/holder.  This is a big improvement over the 655 and suits my purposes (not wearing a headset until a call arrives) very well.

9257	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pretty simple case and that was all I wanted. It's a magnet type snap instead of velcro or snapping a button so that's pretty cool. I like it a lot cause it was big enough for me to fit a plastic cover around the phone and it still fits good. Basically it was just what I was looking for.
7218	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Sent it back in just under a month as the phone stopped taking a charge. Got my $ back at least.
I have a Garmin nuvi 255.  On the POSITIVE side, with the GDB 55, the 255 IS capable of plotting and changing your route on the fly automatically according to the traffic data it receives.  The DOWNSIDE is that the traffic data it has received so far has been next to useless.

9491	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I had zero to 1 bars in my home.  Very difficult to have glitch free, understandable phone calls.  Installed the outside antenna at the top of my backyard patio pointed toward the cell phone tower, 2 miles away.  Now all my phones have 4 to 5 bars, mostly 5 anywhere in the house, not just in the room with the inside antenna.  Love this thing.


Unfortunately, on the day I had had my phone for a year, it started acting up on me. It was with deep regret I sent it in to get a replacement phone. Since I was so very happy with my N95, I spent the money on getting another one. This time, I went for the third generation, with 8G storage built in.
The ONLY strike against this product is that the manuel is written in German, but if you simply follow the color code on the front of the charger it will be enough.


Cons:
376	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Battery last long. But it also takes long time to charge it. It will make your phone extremely thick. But I got used to it and I'm ok with it. Although it now looks a little out of style.

5275	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works fine
Side note: I call the nylon tape "tape", but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the "tape"


The bad news is that the cable from the unit to the antennae is supposed to go through the car door opening--with the door closing on it every time.  The directions do state that you can loosen a seal around your door and thread it through that--but I like that arrangement even less.  Another reviewer wrote that she puts the antennae on her back window ledge--which is the arrangement I will use in the future.

4871	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received my Motorola H710 today.  I was able to pair it, charge it and use it without using the instructions, it is that easy to use.  From what I can see, the sound is superb.  It connects immediately when you open the boom.  I had a Motorola H500 previously and had nothing but problems.  I highly recommend this model.  From the reviews I have read it offers superior wind noise reduction also.  Can't wait for summer to open my sunroof and give it a try!!
7. Voice dialing is a joke. It brings up almost random numbers that only rarely even sound like what I said. I think that the failure is in the phone and that this is something that they added to make regulators happy, and that it is tested with five radically different sounding names. But that is not the headsets fault.

The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.
2) it is comfortable. I can forget I'm wearing it. It's really light weight. I use the ear hook.
We were looking at buying a house very close to larger power lines.  Not the biggest high-voltage kinds, but not the normal lines either.  We read a lot of studies from Canada, the UK, the US, and from Asia, and some studies said there was a health risk for young kids from electro-magnetic fields of certain strengths.  But there were also studies that said there was no risk or, if there was a risk, it was very very small.  We looked at big studies, little studies, government studies, private studies, we couldn't find one consistent answer. Our home inspection companies did not have EMF meters, so we looked at a number of options to get a test.  Because of the disagreement in the reports, we decided to just buy a meter to test ourselves.

Make sure your phone has a sim card, is unlocked, and that the frequency will work where you are headed. I always buy unlocked quad-band phones and have had no trouble in Europe, Asia, Africa, S America & N America.

7626	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.

1546	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this primarily for use as a cordless headset for gaming. Setup was tricky: it took two different attempts using different configuration methods to get any sound out of the unit. Once it was connected and configured, I found that it was utterly useless for gaming. There is no way to use both the headset and the PC speakers in the same game. This means that I have the choice of either using my PC's internal card for DoD:S or using the 510. I cannot, for example, use the 510 as a mic and use my speakers for stereo sound. This makes it useless for gaming, since I cannot tell the location of other players and in-game entities by sound. To top it off, the audio quality was abysmal. While I stand by the multiple Plantronics wired headsets I've owned, I was shocked by the  low audio quality of this headset. Both the in-game sound test and a recording program played back my voice with fidelity below that of an old rotary telephone. I am returning this device tomorrow and giving up on Bluetooth entirely after this disappointment.

178	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.
bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones)
4539	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I went through three wired headsets (I like earbuds for wearing with ski and bike helmets) - lost one and had two fall apart on me, so I went to this product.  But I am not impressed with this product - I can't get the earpiece to stay in my ear, except by twisting the ear loop and jamming the ear bud into my ear - it HURTS after just a few minutes of my 30 minute commute, or, if it isn't hurting me, it falls off and hits the ground or gets lost under my car seat.  The volume doesn't go high enough while I'm driving so I can't hear over the car noise (yes, I have a brand new, fairly quiet car)  Anyway, I'm debating returning it due to the discomfort factor.

2057	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good size, good acoustics, but the ear loops are flawed.  They have two little (and I mean little) prongs that clip on to the headset and if one of them breaks, the loop will not work.  We have had four of these ear loops break in just this way.  We have had Motorola and other headsets that were heavier and less cool, but they did not break.  It is an Achilles Heel for this headset.
The battery has two ports on it: a regular USB port for charging a device off the battery, and a micro USB port to charge the battery itself. The charging cable is ingenious and saves a lot of space when packing. It is a retractable USB cable with a regular USB connection on one end, and a micro USB connection on the other end. Plugging the micro USB connection into the battery and the regular USB into the computer charges the battery. Switching the regular USB connection to the other port on the battery gives you a micro USB connection to charge your devices (most cellphones use micro USB nowadays). If your devices need another connection (mini USB, manufacturer specific), your USB cable for that device will plug into the regular USB port on this charger.

6047	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought the iTorch to charge my iPhone while on the Appalachian Trail. I tested it 6+ times to ensure the weight was worth carrying since weight is a premium when you are carrying everything on your back. I have gotten 2+ charges to 95-100% so well worth the weight since it can be a 5-10 days between places to charge on AT. The unit is easy to use, the blue lights keep you informed of the charge available and the red LED light is an added bonus.  I am very pleased with the quality!  I did contact New Trent with a question and they were very quick to respond and were most helpful.  If you need a lightweight battery charge, the iTorch is an excellent choice.


What I do like:
5994	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am not always near a power source that I can utilize throughout the day, and this small device saves the day by keeping my iPhone 5 up and running. Great to have, and I recommend it fully!
8173	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Crappy SIM card
3. has a habit of dropping connection(I think this common to all BT devices)
the device has quad-band, that I can use it without worry
If add it thru calling their service representative, the representative will try to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY by ask you all unrelated information. Besides credit card and your cell phone ID, they ask:
- be wire-free while doing all this

But, at first, I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end, 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.

I'm turning off my phone today...
When 2 replcements arrived, BOTH were DOA too !!!
* It would work up to the 10 meter mark but the static would pick up significantly.
2834	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We are a 2 Zune household and I have purchased this case for both Zunes.  It works very well, holds everything you need while traveling and seems very well made.  I highly recommend it.
conclusion, the current price is a good deal if you need wireless headphones to use under noisy environment (like in the train), this is a good choice due to sound isolation
Let me explain that I don't even have a smartphone, so I can't speak to these buds' capability handling phone conversations.  I ONLY wanted cordless buds so I could listen to music, and these Motos sound as good as any bud I've ever tried, including pairs from Bose, Klipsch, Sony, Sennheiser, you name it.
6048	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The iTorch, was constantly able to charge my iPhone 4S 2.5 times on one charge. The battery charged fully in one night and is small and portable but very effective. Comes with and charges with a micro-USB cord, which was useful.

4752	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	has the lowest quality i have ever seen.

In the picture, i'm charging my 3ch rc helicopter!!

Connection to the iPhone is simple and so far hasn't dropped a call.


The noise canceling feature seems to work well and I have noticed an improvement in the accuracy of using the voice dialing on my Blackberry.
The charging cable is proprietary. One end is USB, and the other is proprietary. I wish it was micro-USB based on the proprietary end so that in the event I lose the charging cable, I could use my smartphone's cable.


Although marketed for Apple products, there wasn't a Apple USB cable provided for me. The iTouch might break if I drop it. I wished there was some sort of cushion like rubber to protect it but I understand that rubber is an insulator and that may cause the battery to overheat. The minimalistic design looks great but it forces the user to read the manual to understand how to turn on the laser, flashlight, and the charge function. It takes a long time to recharge the iTorch to full capacity. I wouldn't buy this to use with an iPad or any other tablet. It's just not worth the charging times.

715	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.
2189	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	IF YOU HAVE MOTOROLA NEXTEL PHONE STOP!!!THE USB CORD IS TO SMALL IT DOESN'T FIT AT ALL AND IT STATES IT CAN BE USED FOR ALL MOTOROLA PHONES.IT ONLY GETS A 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RATE IT, I GIVE IT A BIG FAT O !!!
2666	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Instead of NO ways, now I have 3 ways to charge my PDA.  Works fine and delivered quickly.
With regards to pairing, controls, and functionality, these are really easy to learn and will do everything that meets my needs.  Sync with my Galaxy Note 2 was quick and flawless.  The connection stays and it pics up any audio/sound coming from your device.  Some have mentioned that the lack of vibration is an issue for them.  I actually haven't seen this as a real problem, although I would like to see if Motorola adds the feature to future versions of the Buds.  That being said, they work just fine for calls and everyone I have spoken to so far has stated that call quality was excellent.  I have owned other Motorola BT headsets before and like them, this one is a winner in my book.  I would easily say that this is the best BT headset on the market for those looking for something that they don't have to have on their ear all the time and want quality A2DP stereo sound and crystal clear calling, all while being hands free and wireless.
4822	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	the wood on the back is nice and smooth like a basketball court or a bowling lane.  fits the iphone 5 fine but does not offer any screen protection the sides are lower so make sure you use a good screen protector.

Most headsets - wired included - suffer from low max volume from the speaker - not this one. I've found myself having to turn the headset down a couple of notches because it is that loud.  The sound is crystal clear as well.
Avoid this manufacturer

*Those dang little keys...and I wear a size 6 or 7 ring so I don't have fat fingers.  I will say that those are a challenge
- Lighter and thinner than its predecessor

I read an awful lot of negative reviews about this product and I gotta say I think they're off base.
5. Great enterprise email server. We use Lotus Notes (ack) but the BBerry server integration works great. It took a little bit of effort to get it configured and set up right, but once it's working, it just works.


On the positive side, the phone looks very nice and the buttons have a great tactile touch.  I can't stand Razor or Chocolate style touch keys.
QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle
Update 4/17: If you plan to write applications for Windows Smartphone 2005, be prepared to dive into the Smartphone security model. The phone is initially application-locked, which means that you cannot deploy code to the device. You will need to get a registry editor and change the security policies. Documentation is plentyful on the web. Unlocking the phone was a breeze - don't pay the 100's of $ for an unlocked SDA.
The case covers Phone, Calender, Mail, and Home buttons. But the picture does not show these button are being covered.
-Long last battery~ good for ~500 charges if cared for properly
- Increased grip which reduces chance phone will leave the hand unintentionally
968	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me. I like these a lot. Very comparable to the Tones. What was most important to me was battery life. I used these for listening to sports and talk radio. I have wired buds for listening to music. The only two complaints I have with this item is: the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone. Not as easy to get on and off. However, they don't move around as much as the Tone's. My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all, I would recommend these. I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone.
I do not have any cases on my Droid X - if you have any case whatsoever I seriously doubt this will fit. Overall I would recommend if you don't have a case on your droid X and are looking for a well made, stylish, and secure case for your phone.  With a silicone case or anything that increases the outside dimensions of the phone this will likely not work well.  I am considering trying to "stretch" it out a little to see if that helps.  For the price, this is a good case/holster.

Cons:
I had read that there are many fakes and "bootleg" headsets on the internet market, and I immediately checked my newly-arrived WEP200 against the pictures and description of the "fakes".
UPDATE Sept. 6th, 2008. This headset is FINALLY the way I want it to be!. First step: I found an article on Howard Forums about installing the V1.1 software for the Z9i onto THIS headset. It works and eliminates the most annoying feature of this headset: the long hold down on the MFB button to end a call. Now, just a quick press and the call is ended. Second, the fit issue is taken care of: the same article on Howard Forums recommended the Jabra Eargels (available here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WINT )

63	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I was very excited when I first got this case. I loved the color and the feel of it. Then I started noticing stuff on my hands and realized the "rubber" peels right off the phone just from normal use. As the saying goes you get what you pay for.
So, I would highly recommend to stay away from this very undeveloped product. The idea is great, they just need to complete their testing phase as this product is still in very early testing.

4571	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	TOO LARGE.

I still have this sucker after four years. I don't still have my husband, but my original iPhone is still going strong because of this case. It was the first one they ever made and says "patent pending" on it. Now they're everywhere. In a way, I'm kind of annoyed because I have no excuse to upgrade my phone as it works as perfectly as it did four years ago. On the other hand, I have a technological relic that has outlasted my marriage, and I'm still paying the original iPhone package price which is pretty freaking awesome. The product CLEARLY does what it's supposed to, maybe a little too well since my iPhone is a dinosaur now. Trust me when I say I'll buy another one when this phone gives up the ghost.

8070	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I read another review warning that the volume may be low with some phones, even at maximum volume and that is indeed true for me with my a nokia E61 and a motorola phone I borrowed. The motorola was actually just slighly louder and almost usable at freeway speeds, but just barely. With the nokia, at full volume I just can't hear well enough to make out 100% of the conversation, and I have good hearing (again at freeway speeds).
7714	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This does everything I wanted a case to do and not much more. It protects the sides very well with a easy to hold plastic material that helps me hold on to what is a very slippery device otherwise. I like the inclusion of polycarbonate on the back and on the front (at the top and bottom). This adds rigidity on the sides and helps the iPhone color to show through on the front and back. It has openings everywhere needed. I bought a separate screen protector because this case does not include one. The fit is tight, but I prefer the tight fit. Even with a screen protector the fit is fine. It is harder to open and get the unit out, but you won't need to take it out very often anyway. I like the way it looks. I like the sense of security it gives me to use my iPhone more often without worrying about dropping it.

I tried the strategy, and it works
8226	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I shopped around for the perfect Pet Barrier for about a month.  I narrowed my search down to this one and another Mesh Barrier.  I ordered the other barrier and it never came in stock.  That was a blessing in disguise as this barrier was less expensive and has exceeded my expectations.  I have a 2001 Subaru Forester and this barrier is a perfect fit in the hatch compartment.  I did not have any trouble assembling and installing the barrier.  So far, it does not rattle and is serving its purpose very well.  It gets warm in the hatch compartment as there are no air vents and my hatch door window doesn't roll down.  I purchased a stainless steel crate bowl to attach to the mesh as well as two large battery operated crate fans.  A plush SUV cargo pad was a great finishing touch for my dog's new hangout.


-wide enough to allow the expandable battery case cover.
Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.
9269	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	First of all, it is great value that I got two of them - the previous one I got broke on the belt clip part, so I think I will get two of them just in case that happen again. It fit OK with the MyTouch4G phone - just a little tight.
9003	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have used this charger primarily for my Nexus devices and they have been performing well so far. I charge Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 using this charger when I am traveling or there is no power outlet available. According to my approximate estimates, this charger charges Nexus 4 completely (starting with no charge left) within 2 hours 45 minutes and there will still be almost half the charge left in the charger's battery pack. It charges Nexus 7 up to 83% (starting with no charge left) within 7 hours. So far so good and I intend to keep using New Trent products in future.
Everyone should have this at the very least.
Order shipped promptly, had it day earlier than expected.  Phone is small and lightweight.  You'll need to register your phone/account to get US number but was simple to do online.  Too early to tell how the quality is, will update with my experience after I return back from my trip. For now I give it 4 stars, hoping that I'll nudge that to 5 stars after I have chance to use it overseas.

3023	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this phone through AT&T and it has been nothing but a headache. After receiving it, the Sync worked for several hours, then, abruptly, it could neither receive nor make calls.
Built-In Automatic shut off to save its power.


7928	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this item reading reviews of customers and I am very happy with the quality of it. It is on line with expectations.
you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around, but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem.


6256	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Have a Droid Razr which is always hungry.  Bought the New Trent IMP500 and it fit the bill perfectly.  Easy to use, can nearly get 3 full charges of my Razr out of one charge of the New Trent IMP500.  Nice.
Overall, I'm very happy with iTorch's performance and now I do not have to worry my phone running out of battery when I have to be out whole day.
  I found that it paired easily to my Samsung moment. Call quality was excellent and according to the others on the line, i was clear. It is very loud, but volume is easily adjusted by the rocker on the back of the product, and the extra volume is welcome for many of the noisy environments i encountered. I also had no problems adjusting volume while in use. I did not have any difficulties ending or answering calls while wearing from the boom arm mounted button. The one thing I did not expect was the comfort level of the device. I discovered that i quite often forgot I was wearing it. The weight or fit of the device were neither a problem. The Voyager sits snugly on my ear without any pressure.

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.
I highly recommend it to non-xx users ... nice quality, handsome piece. For us xx users, there are slim pickings out there ... if there is a fix, post it as a comment!
8005	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My job requires me to travel every week.  The Callpod replaces my chargers for my phone, bluetooth, Kindle, iPod, etc.  Instead of a spaghetti nest of cords to deal with, I have a single unit with the adapters.  It's awesome.  I got my Callpod 3 years ago as a present from my wife and I've only had a single issue (the plug case on my iPod charger split due to abuse).  I highly recommend this item for frequent travelers.
Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a "US" vs. "International" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.
Have made several attempts to contact the seller, and the only communication received from seller was to tell me it was sent, but no tracking number etc. and the item has not been received, even though the payment cleared my bank almost a month ago.

For the first time ever, I have been able to get my cell phone's voice dialing feature to work consistently, and it's all because the noise cancellation makes the voice command clear and consistent enough for the software.
-Has a "find headset feature" for when you lose it, but this obviously only works when the headset is on
1: Price
For people who want to swap memory cards in and out often having to take the phone apart is a drawback, for the rest of us it doesn't matter.


1282	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	One of the most worthless items I've ever had. No troubleshooting information in the manual. Works when it wants as opposed to when I want. Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use. Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.  It's worked twice in three weeks and instead of answering the last call, it just beeped incessantly.
Overall, this phone had potential but it falls DRASTICALLY short in 5 areas!
I like my Motorola RAZR since all I do is send an occasional text and make and receive phone calls. I like its thinness.

Do not use this device to communicate while on land.  Also read manual to better understand the regulations.  Comes packaged in a blister pack.  Sharp object needed to open.  Battery life is great.  Waterproof tested it myself in vat of water.  Use this radio for kayaking or as a back up to your marine radio on a bigger boat.  As with all electronics, keep away from your navigational compass.
Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs.
Phone does take a long time to boot, but registers to network in seconds, has cool wi-fi, and with registry tweaks this phone will be your cool toy.
7007	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great price. Item came in good shipment box. Will definitely do business with this vendor.
OK. I am back with an updated review of the phone after about 6 months or so. It has been so far very lightly used. I recently started to use the phone's bluetooth tethering for internet service. I just love it. It gives me roughly the speed of a 768K DSL line. During thunderstorms and power outage or in the park, I can use the EVDO internet. So far the only complain I have is the battery life. With the bluetooth on, it last a very short time.

one up for my wife who always lets her phone die!
7149	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It didn't work well at all. Everything we plugged in with it flickered like the electricity was not steady.
I have recommended this to other friends and co-workers as well to get rid of extra cords from the aux port.

5246	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like this charging station. I use it for my iPad mini and the cell phones we have in the house. It makes things a lot neater instead of cords laying all over the place. Now everyone comes to one place to charge there devices.  This also stopped my daughter from losing her power cord.
Probably my biggest complaint is that although numbers are logged and there's a callback feature, it's worthless because you have to dial a 1 before the number. I plan to dig into the manual to see if there's some way around this but I haven't found it on any of the phone's menu. When adding a number manually to memory, you can add the 1 but not for numbers taken from the caller log.
You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.

This phone is awesome and I use it daily.  I keep my w810i for backup if I go out and want a camera phone for that.  This phone is HIGHLY recommended and might only be supplanted by the Nokia N75 as far as features go...but no one can beat the price on this one!
Once the sim is inserted right and the phone is turned on, you should have a voice telling you to press 3 for english.

Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small.

I've been so worried about running out of battery on my iPhone 4S that I actually used to panic. Now I'm relaxed and I know no matter how much I use battery sucking photography apps I always have a few charges ready in my other pocket. I should say how perfectly this fits in all of my pockets. It's so sleek. I ran low and I just charged it while I was out taking pictures. It charges super fast and you get over 2, maybe 3 charges in one full iTorch. That's just amazing to me. I use my iPhone constantly being an avid iphoneography person. Then getting home late in the dark I just feel for the button and turn on the LED flashlight. I had been using my iPhone for that but now no more opening the iphone and finding the flashlight app, I just use the iTorch which lives in my other pocket. It's a pretty cool bonus I wasn't expecting.
Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place.
6305	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This external battery pack works great. It is 5000 ma hours so it has power to spare. It will recharge my iTouch from 3-5 times. I would like to see a couple of design improvements though. It would be nice if the adapter that connected with the iTouch accepted the power cable at a right angle instead of straight out from the bottom. It's fine in its current design, but my idea would make it so much better. Also, because the adapter that is used to plug into the iTouch is used for multiple purposes it would be nice if they put velcro on it so you could attach it to the device when not in use. The connector could get lost so I put a small piece of velcro on it and on the coil wire holder. Now when the connector is not being used it is stuck to the wire assembly so it can't get lost.

719	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I have 2 of these headsets for a Sony Ericsson t637.
1. Prone to Symbian viruses. Like all Symbian based phones, better get an antivirus. You never know what may hit you.
One of my partners has walked out of the office to "use the facilities" more than 20' down the hall using an identical unit and still has reception while taking care of his business - not that I would recommend that.

 -Camera with video, even though with 3.2Megapixels, is easily usable in the same way as the N95.
This phone is good enough to run a business with with the PDA, calendar, memos, call log, Internet, Email, text message alerts, and bluetooth.
There is an audio quality problem when used with digital VOIP phones. I believe it is a conflict between the codec( or some other technical conflict) of the ear-set and the phone. I suspect all ear-sets may have this compatibility problem.

4229	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Fits even with a protective case.  Smells like leather because it is.  Great product, fast delivery.  No complaints, but will see how long it lasts.
**-> The best thing I liked is the Customer Service from Plantronics. My first headset developed some problem with the microphone and people were not able to listen to me. I called Plantronics on a Sunday evening and the rep guided me through the online warranty form, very nicely and I got my replacement part within three days. Perfect..isn't it?
365	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Delivered on time and works fine. The only disadvantage is 2 adapters which I have to use, but it's because of my location.
The case is easy to open and close.  This case is better than the $30 case I used before.  My running belt is an Amphipod.


Update 6/14/07
I haven't tried the IM or Bluetooth features yet.
I use this with my Treo 700w. It drops the pairing on a semi-regular basis. It was easy to pair to my original phone but I've not been able to pair it with any other thing.
9558	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Firstly, Amazon sent me a damaged package (NOTE: The item was purchased DIRECTLY FROM Amazon and not a third-party vendor) .  The damaged package was not the shipping package but the item package itself.  I refused to even open the item (assumed very likely the package contents has suffered considerably) and immediately began the process of returning the it.  Having read about Amazon's diminished quality control online and customer service, I have to wonder if Amazon has gotten "too big for it's britches" that they would allow such shoddy merchandise to leave their warehouse and such poor quality controls?  Perhaps damaged items returned to Amazon are completely ignored and simply re-delivered out to the next online purchaser/victim?  I would imagine this to be a waste of money and imprudent as for return shipping costs that they are supposed to pay (more on this later) and damaging reviews of their company reputation - such as this one.  I am of the opinion that it may actually be better to purchase items from a reputable third-party vendor (presumably small business) --> who cares about maintaining a good business reputation as it is their bread and butter!  To continue, Amazon immediately scheduled a UPS delivery, however they were on days when anyone one was home to physically hand over the package to UPS.  I contacted Amazon about this and asked them to schedule a pickup on a different date during the week wen someone was home - however this fell on deaf ears.  I tried to reschedule a pickup 5 times in fact!  Each time, my request was ignored.  I have to wonder if this was by design as now I have to pay the return fee! :-(  I will be following up my return with a request for a refund on shipping charges!!!!

We initially had a paper towel roll but decided it was an eyesore so we bought this shelf wall mount. It fits nicely and looks elegant.

2956	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this product previously from this seller and I liked it.  After about a year of use, it was starting to show wear.  I ordered a replacement and it is not as listed.  The item pictured is not what you receive.  The cut outs for your charger, etc. are not in the places as shown in the picture...the one shipped is not even the CELLET brand as it had been previously.  Further, the seller offers a 'Hassle-Free Returns Policy' as long as the item is defective.  I suggest you look for the same item from another seller.
1261	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I got this for around $30, and it works really nice. My only complaint would be my ear starts feeling sore after wearing it for awhile, and like another reviewer said, it is light enough that it feels like it might fall off sometimes. My husband who is a truck driver said he couldn't hear through it over the noise of the truck, but I can use it and hear through it in my car just fine. It would have been good if it came with a car charger too, but thats just wishful thinkin :)

A screen should last 1-3 months, depending on how you rough you are with your phone.
The Centro comes with a great suite of software preloaded onto the phone.  The two email programs work very well with POP3 and IMAP email accounts, although I prefer the VersaMail over Sprint Mobile Mail.  I've also been somewhat partial to the Palm Organizer over MS Outlook.  It also comes with Documents To Go, which lets you open and edit Word and Excel files and lets you view PowerPoint and pdf files.  There's a free download available to upgrade Docs To Go so you can open Office 2007 files and it gives you some basic Power Point editing abilities.  The GoogleMaps and IM software are nice and work very well.  The entertainment package of pTunes, Sudoku and Solitaire are nice and work ok, however I found that Sprint TV had some problems syncing up audio and video.  The video seemed a step behind.  But I loaded SlingPlayer for Palm OS on it and the Centro works great for watching pocket-sized TV in conjunction with a Slingbox.

6015	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've used a few portable batteries, but for the most part the form factor didn't make sense for me. If I was going on a business trip I'd have a few hours between outlets and would generally be able to keep my phone charged and I didn't want to carry around extra weight in the form of a battery. Most days I work in a lab, but have a convenient desk outlet at the ready if I end up spending too long on my phone and need a quick recharge. In short I didn't need a battery and the batteries available didn't make sense (too big for a one time charge and not enough power for an entire camping trip etc). But I've found a real place to use a mobile battery and the New Trent iTorch is a nearly perfect form factor for it.

1564	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:
PROS:

Cons:
1. The crescent hole of  the USB connector doesn't attach to jawbone securely! The headset keeps disconnecting from the charge cable. So it can't steadily stay in charge.


2. Protruding antenna could possibly break if handled carelessly.
This card is highly recommended, especially if you can get it bundled.

475	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	For the price, I guess you can say it's a ok deal, since most of the other Bluetooth headsets cost an arm and a leg. I paired it w/ a Sony Ericsson T68i and it was easy to set up. The unit does not work very well though. I have called many people many times in many different locations and they all complain that I sound like a 60's robot and a broken one at that. I would recommend that you try it out at a retail store before actually buying the unit. I sort of figured it wouldn't be that good because of the price but I wanted to try it anyway.

Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:
6572	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Installation was simple.  Antenna went on the roof which even held up in the recent snow storm we've had.  Cord is ran through a rear passenger door, under seat, and up to the dash.  Power works fine.  Lights up fine.
The clarity and signal are good. Only a little interference on rare ocasions. We tested it on how far the phone could be from the headset and still be useable. I stayed in the house with the phone, my husband walked outside into the back yard (quite a distance) and we could still hear each other no problem.
My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a "hands free" headset.

For the $24.xx i paid total, this beats paying $6 per month for insurance on a phone. i miss the color display but i think i'm getting used to this. it doesn't have a camera but then again i never sent pix mssg, only received. so long as i can make calls and send text messages, i'm fine.

charging, the unit becomes slightly lukewarm; not alarmingly hot like some
6216	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really, really like the unit. I have only owned it for a week or so but have had some good usage from it already. I previously owned a Zagg Sparq, and I did not like that it didn't hold a charge well, and the size. Even though the battery was almost twice the size of this one, it didn't seem to charge as well as this.
7947	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	An adapter like this is a must-have if you own an iPhone 5 external battery case.  These cases extend about a half inch below the bottom of the iPhone, which creates problems for connecting headsets.
 - cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)
If you aren't too sure if your phone is supported (it needs bluetooth 2.0) i typed into google Samsung WEP200 compatible phones (and I mentioned my phone too) and brought up this site that had all this information on it.
7132	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product and charger. it works well with a usb port that you plug into the wall or in your computer

1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.




That being said, I'm very happy.  I've ditched my PDA and I walk around with my contacts 24/7.  Sending email from the road is a snap and I'm in touch more often than not.  I'd recommend this phone over the Treo in a heartbeat.  Can speak to the Blackberry but I will say the color on this phone is sharper than the Blackberry Pearl and 8730.  I also can't say whether this phone is better than the Cingular 8525.  It just looked too big compared to the sleek Blackberry.
1939	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	No problems with headset so far works as advertised.  Great price too, and not to bulky like the others.  The headset is very sleek and slender.
1303	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted here is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged' bundles which include the headset and the charger.

This signal booster signals up to 1,500 sqft which is enough for our downstairs living where we and our guests are most of the time.  It comes with 3 pieces, the booster, inside antennae and outside antennae.  The set up was super easy, each cable and pieces were labeled with Step 1, 2, 3.. etc with specific instruction that help us connect each piece so easily.  The only work you have to do is go to each window and have your phone read with the booster analysis and detect which will have the maximum reception.  The setup was well thought out to where we didn't even have to call customer service.

Now with the Blackberry, all of my email accounts are programmed in so I'm instantly notified when I get a message. Because I can respond within seconds, I never miss a beat. My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs, which they love. The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly. I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly. I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.
The phone offers excellent call quality, good battery life, a good solid feel, and all of the features I need in a smartphone.

LED flashlight: 5 second hold of the power button(in the process of turning on flashlight it does seems to turn on battery as well though)
515	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Battery pack works, fits perfectly and cable/connector didn't present any issues during install.
no way to call jabra, you have to email them. It's trashed. I'll never get another piece of electronic from them again.
So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.
5 - AND WORST OF ALL - NOT ENOUGH RAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

cam: it's good, but slow to startup, tested the phone before, found some blue-purple tint, but this one I purchased is alot better, alot less blue tint, which can be fixed by adjusting white balance; the video capture is alot better than K790a
 - when using the ear loop the head set is pushed away from the face and the mic has a difficult time picking up my voice.

As others have mentioned, there is a noticable lag in the audio when you are watching video or playing games. This is expected because of the extra encoding/decoding step that has to happen when you send it digitally over BT and then the headset has to decode it again. I would say BT headsets in general are best for listening to pure audio since there is nothing visual to be in sync with. They are OK for video if you can deal with the slight delay in the sound. It kinda looks like those old kung fu movies where peoples' mouths will move slightly ahead of when you hear what they are saying. Any BT headset is going to have this issue until they come out with software and system design changes that compensate for it.
2063	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Its stylist, great for women (because it doesn't interfer with your earrings), doesn't make you look like you are from another planet.  However, its got some bugs.  First, there is a delay when answering an in-coming call.  Second, when I first paired it to my Treo 650 it caused the phone to freeze.  Finally (and most critical), the hook for the ear piece kept coming off and after several times of trying to put the hook back the plastic connector broke.  Unfortunately, I cannot find anything about replacement parts.  As a result, I will probably have to return the entire headset.



9043	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this item to use while on travel to Israel for two primary reasons.  First, since I was on a formal tour, we would be out of range of electric outlets from 8-9 hours every day.  With this item, I did not have to worry about my iPhone (used for taking pictures and email) running out of juice.  The second reason was that some electronics can be a bit temperamental when charging them in other countries and can be easily fried/damaged.  With this item (I have 2 of these devices), I would charge this item via the local outlet then use it to charge my other devices.  If this device was fried, it was relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of an iPhone. Fortunately, this charger worked flawlessly.  In terms of size, while I generally carried it in my backpack, it was small/light enough to carry in the leg pocket of my cargo pants.  Nice!  This product is dual voltage so no transformer is required when traveling to Israel; only adapters. This product recharged within a reasonable amount of time and subsequently charged my electronics (iPhone, Blackberry, iPod Nano) fairly quickly.  The only annoying feature was the method by which the flashlight and laser pointer are turned on/off (X number of clicks to turn on and another X number of clicks to turn off).  But, certainly tolerable and not a deal breaker. Overall, this item is well worth the investment.
3579	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	First let me say if you are used to an installed satellite system, you may be a little disappointed with the size of the screen.  There is no getting around the fact that this screen seems tiny compared to factory installed systems.  However, the small size helps to make it very portable, and easy to fit in a shirt pocket or even mount on your bike (which is what I plan to do using the optional handlebar mount.)  So far the maps and directions have been spot on for me.  This is an excellent entry-level system and a great portable GPS.
THANK YOU!!!
I knew this and didn't expect miracles for my AT&T phone or my girl friend's Verizon phone, I'd really only hoped to turn a serviceable signal that dropped calls on a semi regular basis and often wouldn't receive texts for several hours after they were sent, into something that would be reliable enough that we could avoid getting a land line. I thought this was probably possible as we regularly get 3-4 bars in the walkway outside the building. With those expectations I've been satisfied with the product.
2 negatives - #1 single button can EASILY be pushed accidentally.  #2 - nowhere in item description does it indicate that it will last for 500 charges (as stated in user manual)

8511	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I use these at the gym, connecting my favorite MP3 playlists. Great sound,no difference between the wired headphones and these. I've also have used them to make calls and receive calls on my phone(not often), people tell me that I sound fine. NOW the glitch, I use these strictly for music listening on the train, or connect to my laptop for movie watching and they work great, but I do notice that if I'm listening to music with my Blackberry curve and a call comes in the music shuts off and I can't hear the person calling me. I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong, I do press the connect button on my phone and no sound. If I call out to a party, no problem. Since I'm using them as headphones for listening only, no problem!

All in all, I highly recommend the Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset.  When I finally break or lose this one, I will look at replacing it with another Aliph model before any other manufacturer.

7738	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I had to return this twice because there was weird noise and it was very irritating.  I had a good 710 before which I lost.  Although the seller replied promptly, courteous and returned money, purchase has been a bad experience because it didn't work properly.
7061	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	good


8280	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This product definitely provides unsurpassed protection. I have two small complaints. First, the plastic inner cover does not have a hole for the camera. So the pictures look blurry through the plastic. But you don't really have to put the plastic on, like the manufacturer suggests. Second, it is a little too bulky. But I'm getting used to it. All and all, it is a good product. One last thing, if you are looking at this particular OtterBox, there is another one by a different seller for almost $20 cheaper. I wish I had seen the other one. Oh well.
Apps are easily loaded - I've got sbp pocket plus running on there and it improves the interface nicely and also supports finger scrolling (ha iphone users take that!)
So I opened a warranty ticket with BlueAnt.  Let's see how that works.
I am sure it's next generation will be much better.  This one is not ready for prime time.

Installation: There are three recommended ways to install the "outside" antenna: (1) inside of a window (there are suction cups), (2) attached to a pole, ideally on the roof, and (3) attached to the building's rafters. It comes with detailed instructions, but there are a few things that are worth knowing about before you purchase. The "outside" antenna needs to be connected, via a cord (included in 20ft and 30ft lengths that can be connected for a 50ft length, if needed) to the DT, which needs to be connected to the "inside" antenna, which needs to be plugged in to a surge protector. The "outside" antenna needs to be at least 20ft away from the DT, and the inside antenna needs to be at least 18 inches from the DT.

I bought a 4GB micro SD card that works great in the phone and I expected him to use it for music but he mostly uses it for photos and video.
5197	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I just received this item today, along with a Sony HWS-BTA2W Two-Way Bluetooth Stereo Adapter. I plan to use these for listening to our bedroom TV when my wife wants to sleep. I read the brief instructions and was able to pair the two devices on my first attempt, using the Sony adapter as a transmitter. Audio quality is more than adequate for watching TV, and even rivaled the quality I would expect from a wired connection. After pairing, I was able to walk out of the bedroom and about 12 feet down the hallway (for a total separation of about 20 feet) before the Bluetooth connection was dropped.
7477	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Nokia seem to be experimenting with a different keyboard layout/feel. The N78 is a good attempt...but the numeric keypad requires you to have tiny fingers to type on the N78 (quite like the iPhone).
6509	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Does its job and boots signal. Gets pretty hot though.
6644	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product. Had to mount outside on external pole about 15 feet high to gain best access possible to existing signal. Went immediately from a one bar to three bar and made a signal available within the entire house (at least one bar 4G)- when prior was zero/ no signal in many areas. Power amplifier connection to the 75 ohm cable is very warm to touch. Other than that is excellent.
I now use a smartphone, but recently reactivated this phone for my son.  Gosh, I didn't realize how much I missed it.  Just solid and a pleasure to use for voice calls. NO accidental pocket dialing, lock ups, great sound quality, strong reception.  I'm repeating myself, but don't underestimate these qualities and get lost in feature land, they mean nothing if you can't get a quality phone call.
Over all I'm very happy with Amazon's excellent pricing and service in getting this phone to me. Verizon's service so far has been solid. The phone is just about everything I expected, but I'll probably upgrade in a year something jazzier.
4461	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I recently bought a "juice pack" for my iPhone 4, and it takes the micro A USB cord. They are not too common, and the cord furnished with the battery pack is extremely short. The Nokia CA-101 was a better length, and it was in the PRIME area.
I wasn't expecting it and I'm not sure why, but the IMP52D has a laser pointer - a quick click of the single button turns it on and off -
It is quite a bit bigger and heavier than the other two Jawbone headsets I own, the ICON and the ERA, which everyone complains that they can't hear me (although I hear them fine).  I bought the newer Jawbone because I like to listen to podcasts when not on a call and both supported A2DP and the ERA proported "hd audio quality".

6086	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this a few weeks ago, as my Droid Razr has a terrible battery life, and it has been nothing short of excellent. The main function of this product is to recharge mobile devices on the go, and this delivers, flat out. It is able to charge my phone in under an hour. It is very small and lightweight for the 5000 mAh (miliamp) charge capacity it carries, and is not excessively bulky or weighty in a pocket, backpack, etc. The laser and LED flashlight are also excellent additions, great for presentations, etc. Overall a great product, 5 stars!

5756	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It snaps on easily and stays on. It makes the phone easier to hold. I have not dropped the phone, but I imagine it would provide some protection against damage. The item I received is not exactly like the picture.

The weather radio works very well. I have not used the two way marine radio as it is my understanding you have to be on the water in a watercraft or on the dock/shore to legally use marine band radios, but it is doing what I purchased it for. Price was good. Seems to be very well constructed and I have had good experiences with other Cobra products so I expect this to last for many years.

THE PLANTRONICS felt more "snug" on my ear, but since everyone's ear is different I wasn't expecting a custom fit.
3167	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this as an inexpensive alternative to the Tetrax because some other reviewer said the magnet was so strong it would hold up an iPad. The Galaxy Note II is much lighter than an iPad, so i gave it a try. The phone fell off almost every time i used it. I bought a Tetrax and that works very well.
This headset is larger than it appears in pictures. It is also a little heavier then some others I have tried. The only downside is that it is very difficult to put on. I suppose I will figure it out with some practice. It is not quite as comfortable as some others I have tried, but I am getting use to it. After having it on for a while I did not even notice it was on my ear.
Battery over heats frequently
In the beginning, it seems to work reliably enough to keep.  Over 6 months, it started to connect with my iPhone 6 when it feels like it, disconnects when it feels like it.  It did the same thing when my 5S.  I've tried everything imaginable to resolve the issue.  Its in the trash.  This is the 2nd, and last, Moto BT device.  Avoid...
7492	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good quality and works well on my boat.
However, when it was installed, it did **look** impressive.  So, if you want a fake cellular antenna to make your car look "cool," this will fit the bill perfectly.  If you want a performance improvement, consider one of the Wilson cellular repeaters instead.
8906	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I currently own the New Trent iTorch IMP52D powerpak rechargeable external battery.  I have owned the product about two weeks now and have had the opportunity to use it 2 times.  I travel just enough that an added charge will make life easier when at the airport or away from the office / car long enough that I don't have any other charging options.  The IMP52D adequately charged my iPhone 4s after a day on the road.  The initial charge took approximately 5 hours.  The iTorch seems to recharge the battery at a similar rate to that of a standard wall charger.  I started the recharge process at 25% battery life.  Following the recharge to 100% battery life, the battery indicator showed 2 bars or half life remaining.
8993	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love using this product. I got it with the intentions of using it when i'm on the go, but I actually enjoy using it around the house just as must as when i'm out. Before I would plug my iphone or iPad into the nearest wall outlet, but when I moved to a different room, i'd have to move the plug, the cable, find an available outlet.... Now I keep the IMP52D plugged into my gadget, and I can move around easily without losing a charge.
8847	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The IMP52D (iTorch) is a very sleek cool looking back-up power source for my iPhone. It is about the size of a swooshed Twinkie, perfect to grab and go. I needed to purchase a short USB lightning cable to use it, but it was inexpensive and makes this a great backup power source. I loan it to others in need almost as often as I use it. It is a great design with a great feel. I have a cigarette lighter charger from an old phone that I sometimes use to recharge my iTorch when I am in my car. It charges fast and can boost my phone to 100% even when it is dead, and it still has some juice to spare. I rarely use the flashlight or laser pointer, but they are cool little features that could come in handy. Great price well made, very cool external charger. The only thing that could make it cooler would be some kind of retractable lightning cable for charging an iPhone or Droid. The AmazonBasics 4" cable is the perfect complement, but I wish Trent devices came with short cables for charging.

5579	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great radios but the back clip is a pain as it will not stay on the radio.
The battery life is a commonly listed complaint with this phone and I have to admit it's a very valid one.  Battery life should be enough to last you at least one day if you're an average user however heavy users may find the battery life problematic.  Battery drainage depends on what apps you use.  Any app that uses java (games) or accesses the memory card (music player) will use the most power.  You may be able to squeeze in a couple of days if you use all of the power saving options available and use it like a regular phone however if you're a user like me who plays games and music on the phone, you'll find them almost completely ineffective.  My personal preference is to turn off the power-saver for the mini display and have it show the analogue clock screensavor ASAP (5 sec).  The analogue clock is much easier to read than the power-saver clock (which is the same as the digital clock) and you can easily see it even after the backlight has shut off. (I do have the power-saver on for the main display.)

Dislikes
The controls are very easy to remember how to control the music and the phone. After wearing them for a while they do cause a little discomfort, but I'm sure anything you have over your head in time is going to get a little uncomfortable. But all in all I like them. Hell you can't beat the price. I know for a fact that you go inside a retail store and but these you looking at $100 easy.


When it did work, the sound quality was awful.
3.  This set's microphone tolerates wind so much better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.
- If there is a way to attach this to the left ear, I am not aware of it.

9106	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My 4g phone seems to drink the battery and this battery pack works perfect because it holds a great charge and is perfect size to carry in my pocket. Never having to worry about my phone dieing again as i get almost 3 charges off of this pack
on the first initial trial, found sound from both ears is strange, and soon realized one side speaker is reversed, and disassemble the extended earbud and re-solder, after that, sound is 99% perfect from both ears, as other poster said, the main unit should be put on right to get correct stereo
On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature.
I'd certainly recommend this and it's much better than a thing stuck in your ear making you look like something from the Borg in Star Trek - that's unless you want to look like a Nerd!

6306	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion believe all the positive reviews, BUT be aware that it does not come with the AC adapter charger when ordered through Amazon.  If you go to the IMAXPOWER website, the same item is availble for only $45.95 with free shipping and no tax (at least for my state).  Plus, it includes the AC adapter charger!
My main complaint is that I could never get the earpiece to fit comfortably against my ear. I don't like in-ear versions so I chose this because of the "adjustable" earpiece. It is not very adjustable and wholly inadequate if you have small ears. I could never get a tight enough fit. It feel off often, especially when wearing glasses or sunglasses. Without glasses it bounced against my ear and never felt secure. I'm shopping for another headset because the lack of fit is so irritating.

The only drawback is actually small QWERTY buttons, but - (1) the phone is smaller than those "monsters" with big buttons, and (2) after 1 day I got used to it. Teens would be absolutely OK with that size.
the case. It fits perfectly with my Note 2.  It doesn't smell like others review claimed. It has a few slots for me to hold my driver license and credits
Overall, I'd recommend this headset for someone who needs to be able to use the headset even in relatively loud areas and who likes (or at least doesn't mind) the tight-fitting earpiece. I'd be curious to know what causes the "crackling" and if it's possible to reduce or eliminate it, though.
2677	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my husband and he uses it nonstop.  It works great.  Sometimes there is background noise though.

Also I noticed that it didn't work pretty good while paired with two mobile phones simultaneously.
4) Have I said it enough? The UI is very intelligent. Searching the address book uses multi-tap search. Enter the first three letters and it narrows down the choices in real-time. From the holster, I can initiate a call in about four seconds. I have yet to fumble through the address book and make a bad call...
3238	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This review is for the AnitiGlare Screen Protector for my Samsung Galaxy S4. The directions instruct you to lay the protector on the device with the BoxWave logo facing up, there was no logo. I could not get this on without bubbles and I tried everything, they are small, they are minimal but they are there. The adhesive tape, when removed, left a sticky film on one of the corners. I was able to remove it without any solvent by running my finger over the area over and over again while applying pressure. I do like the antiglare feature of the product. I have also purchased Tech Armor Screen Protectors(3pk for $6.95)that come with a lifetime warranty and did not have either of these problems, however there was a corner with the Tech Armor that would not lay down so I contacted the company and the sent me a replacement.

5142	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The headset is comfortable to wear and works well in my office. One thing I don't like is that if you're wearing the headset, you still have to turn it on each time a call comes in or when dialing out. By default, all calls go to the handset first.
Cons

I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like "Tron" in its use of a blue florescent design.
AT&T wanted to charge me $29.00 + tax for a leather case that looked like cr@p, so this was a steal compared to it.  In fact this case looks like it should be around $50.00 if AT&T sold it.

My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.
* Style:  Okay, everyone who wears these things tends to look a bit weird regardless of brand, size or style IMO.  But the styling is very nice, including the charger, and I would rather have some people think I am trying to look `trendy' if, in the end, I am a safer driver than the rest of the morons who cannot use their turn signals because they are too busy talking on their cell phones!
I'll say that after using this for awhile now, it's not perfect if you're using the ear piece plugged-in.  It is too tight and will cause unwanted transmissions depending on your movement.

1247	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The only thing that I can add to the hundreds of reviews already posted here is my own experiences (we ordered 2 of these).
Answering the handset and transferring to the headset was very easy.  It's very very different, more like a cell phone than a home phone.  There's caller ID/call waiting, a halfway decent speakerphone.  You can use the handset in the base to answer and dial using the speaker button..very convenient.  However, I had to make the volume at almost full volume...maybe it's me.  The headset is very clear but I absolutely hear some fuzzing and a slight buzzing in the background as does the receiving party.  The first few calls I made were very annoying because I was very aware of the background noise.  Again, it's not like house phone quality but more like cell phone.
Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.
3643	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Most people seem very quick to review this case, but one thing you always have to keep in mind with a leather case, is it takes about a week to stretch out. If the phone wasn't tight, it would fall out a week later once it was stretched out. I received this case about 8 days ago, and after 5 the phone fit perfect. Would be hard to fit my needs better.
6401	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I keep coming back and buying more.  They are perfect for the iPhone especially when you are using the Mophie battery pack.
In short, this seems to be a great meter.  It met our needs.  So, I recommend it to others.
Don't get me wrong.  The phone's got some good features like easy text messaging, some limited internet access, and up to 3.5 hours of talk time which would temp any new buyer.  Unfortunately, the phone does not use cell phone minutes wisely.  It eats them away like those cheap, overrated calling cards.  If you're a big talker who likes to keep in touch with friends all the time, your best bet is to get a monthly plan, maybe with a company other than Virgin Mobile.  Buy this phone only if you're more of a clam and use the phone rarely like asking about the occasional bill or calling 911 for something.  Maybe then, you can make those cell phone minutes worth every overrated penny of what they're worth.  In fact, if I know then what I know now, I think I would've strictly gotten a phone card.  Think twice before buying this phone!

4409	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this card for several years. I frequently travel internationally and need short-term access to international roaming, which my old cell provider did not offer and my new one charges a monthly fee for. I put this in my phone when I am out of the country and it has been very useful. When I expect high use or an extended stay I buy a separate sim card from a local provider in the country, but for occasional use I use this. The per-minute usage charges are very high, but if you consider the cost of a sim card for each country, this plan is still a good idea for low use. I have also used it for backup when my pre-paid sim card unexpectedly ran out of funds on my last trip ($%^ kids!).

9147	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Some say this does not work and I don't know why it's not for them.  For me it's great!  I have an LG Optimus.  The is essentially a battery pack that will recharge my phone battery.  I travel for work a lot and now I never worry about my battery running out.  It takes about 2 hours to put a full charge on the phone and I can get at least 2 to 3 charges off of the unit before I need to recharge that.  The unit itself is easy to recharge.  I either plug it into to my computer via USB or I use an iPod style wall charger and plug into that.  This is must for any Android user that can't always be near a power source.
Let me also mention something about the power button and it's placement.  When I store these in my bag during the day when I'm not using them, they will mysteriously turn on.  I figure it's because when there is any pressure applied to the bag, for let's say 3 seconds at a time, the headset will turn on.  This is because the power button is as such that you must depress it for about 3 seconds before the unit turns on, unlike the LG's HBS-700's, which was a sliding button.
I would not leave the country without it.

1909	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Comfort: My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear.  When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes.  Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so.  It just takes getting used to.  However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets.  In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth.  It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool.  Perhaps I have misshapen ears.

2302	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Having previously owned the LG VX9800 (one of the best phones EVER made) for nearly a year, I was hesitant at first to switch over to a PDA/Smartphone format...but I'm glad I finally did.  The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.  In fact, the Q multi-tasks like a champion: One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed, surfing the Internet, and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU.  Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly.  With a gadget like the Q, laptops are suddenly looking more and more like desktops.

6920	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Strange - these only seem to last maybe 5-6 months.  Usually a watch battery lasts more than a year. Are they old?  Are they fake?  I don't really know.  Since the whole pack costs about what I pay for one battery locally, I guess I still come out ahead.  But taking the back off the watch every few months gets old.  I don't think I will buy these again.

The handset started to charge immediately, even though it came half-juiced for use already.  The headset was another story:  I kept having to reseat the unit on the little plug, where the light on the headset was supposed to be red for charging, and then blue when completed.  I had no lights and obviously the unit was not seating properly.  I had to fiddle with it until it was firmly attached to the connector and then the light turned red, indicating it was charging.  It was supposed to take 16 hours for a full charge but it took barely 3 hours.  Both the handset and headset charged very quickly.
Cons:  It didn't come charged, which I get upset about because I am too impatient to wait.  Also, when you plug it in it can take up to 5 minutes before registering the plug, which made me think that it was broken at first.  Next, it doesn't come with a belt case and it is a strange size so buy the belt case (I am waiting for that to come so look for my review of it later on).  And finally, the battery is not removable (I found out that this is typical of these headsets, but I still would have liked to be able to buy several and change them out).

I have charged my almost dead phone battery three times off the external battery charger without having to recharge the external battery, so it's not like I have to plug in two things to charge each night.  The blue light indicators show you how much battery-power is left in the devise, or as it charges, how full of a charge you have reached.

The list of features for this smartphone-based navigation system seemed to cover what I needed, and the price was certainly attractive.  So, I ordered one without any delusions that it would be as good as a dedicated unit like a Nuvi.  But, I have been pleasantly surprised. Just for the heck of it, I stuck the micro-SD card in my phone while I was sitting in the parking lot of the Post Office after picking up the package from Garmin, and within 3 minutes, the software was installed, the unit was tracking on 6 satellites, and my phone was telling me how to get to the service station with the cheapest gasoline in town.  I wish the screen was easier to read (a problem display size on my phone, not with the software), that I could copy the software to my 8GB micro-SD, that the voice directions included street names, but I have a very functional navigation system at a very reasonable price.

2087	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this phone over the Motorola Q because I liked all the features it offered over the other one.  Before receiving it, I read reviews here and throughout the Internet.  I thought to myself "Good Lord, I'm getting a piece!"  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I'm going to list the pros and cons and hopefully give a "fair" opinion of the product.

The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.
5. Sony customer service is pretty descent.  My piece died all of the sudden. It would not turn on or charge up.  They are sending me a new piece.
Yes the price is low. But overall the item is too unstable.
This is my third generation Motorola. After years of Nokia phones, I received a Motorola Timeport as a gift (terrible phone with lousy menus). The next year I won a v66 in a raffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size. Motorla had significantly improved the menu from the Timeport, but it still wasn't the best. The V600's menu has improved on the V66.

this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.
This product is obviously not only for iPhones, seller should change the product title to reflect this.

Now the bad.  This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay.  It is pure torture to wear.  The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears.  I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling.
1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.
The only weakness of the product (and why I give it four instead of five stars) is the fact that it does not include a warranty.

6011	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I had the opportunity to take the iTorch with me this past week Camping.  Its a very nice product, easy to hang on too and small enough to fit in a pocket with ease.  The LED flashlight is a handy feature.  It's not overly bright but it worked well in a pinch in a tent.  I managed to get about 2 charges out of the iTorch for my phone.  I used it during some of the charging time so, I might have been able to get more out of it had the phone been off.  This would be quite handy for a photographer who uses their phone as a Geotagging device when taking pictures.  I have been to Maine in Acadia State Park a few times and turned Geotagging on my phone.  It certainly eats through battery.  My only problem with the device is that between charging, turning the LED or Laser on or off.  It can get a little difficult.  It was pretty easy to shut the battery pack off when turning on or off the LED and a few times the LED came on when I just wanted the battery pack on.  It could be because of my lack of time with the device, but a separate button to turn on the LED or Laser would make this a 5 star device.

The range seems to be larger than what is advertised.  Using A = pi r squared, the range should be 28 feet.  But we found an improved signal at more than 50 feet.
I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue!  When I found this foam replacement set, I was delighted because buying it would address another, nagging problem I've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation.  So, buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom, too.
*  Sometimes the ready/in use light will go on, but I am unable to get the earpiece to respond.
Poor quality plastic .

I have only had the headset for a day however, I am impressed. I tried the Jawbone today in the Corvette and it works great. My wife didn't hear anything but me while I was driving, which is pretty amazing considering how loud the car is. I currently have the Blackberry 8830 and it works great with this headset. The voice dialing pops right up on queue, unlike some of the other headsets I have.
4501	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have another Plantronics Blue tooth headset for calls. It works fine.

8431	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It arrive promptly. Nice combination. LED's are very bright. Have used it for a couple weeks and I am happy with it.
4383	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I don't like to even take the time out of my day to write reviews but this case is so useless, that I must tell everyone so I can save them from the mistake so many of us have made by trusting our eyes. The picture shows you how 4 cards will fit in the wallet but leaves out how the snap will not even snap shut with just one card in the wallet. The snaps are too close together and this wallet is nothing more than another Iphone product that was just put out on the public with the company who sold it knowing good and well that it cannot perform as they have described in the listing. They use slip of hand type pictures on the inside of the wallet to make it look like you have a DL picture sticking though a plastic window when in fact, you have nothing more than three useless postage stamps size windows that are worthless. The company was notified and their response to me on these problems was almost like a script as to how they would be happy to refund you for the product if it is not what you thought it was however, they tend to leave out the part about how they keep the overpriced shipping charges out of your refund. They send it by USPS and keep the rest. They know what they are doing and that is why I would advise you to skip this company all together in the future. They know they are selling less than described products and they don't care. As long as they get to keep your overpriced shipping charges, they are still making money. They are quick to tell you that you are committing fraud if you use your given right and try to charge them back. They want you to believe that you can't charge them back and that they have the last say whether you can get your refund by charge back. They clearly try to sell or should I say rip you off by intimidation. Don't fall for it and don't waste your time or you will be applying for a full refund by charge back because they are not about to give you your shipping charges back because they know the product cannot do what they say it can and only intended to make money on the shipping charges in the first place.
2558	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I'm using this case with the AT&T version of the Note. It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio. The material is soft and flexible, the cut-outs line up ok... not perfect, but they don't cause any functionality issues. I love the textured hand grips on the sides. The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push, but i prefer to have the covered over having them open, but recessed under the case. The s-pen opening is fine with my case, I have no problem getting it out. It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone, but there is a lot of area to cover on the note. It's not a perfect case, but I've paid $30 on cases for other "iDevices" that had similar issues. Boxwave shipped pretty quickly, but there was no tracking available.

All in all I think it is a good charger. People just need to be careful that the first charge doesn't heat up their product too much. Setting the item on something that will conduct heat away (marble counter, sandstone coaster, glass table, etc.) will help with that issue somewhat. As will taking it out of its case.

6490	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I run a fishing boat and service is poor sometimes in the area we operate in. I tried the expensve boosters and they were a waste of money. When i purchased this, i got the marine antenna to go with it, what a difference! I normally get 1-2 bars max and little or no 4g service in certain areas, but with this its almost ful signal most of the time.. I also use it in my apartment because i don't have a home phone, my cell signal sucks there, but with this its much better.. I mounted the antenna on the outside patio and ran the wire thru with the cable wire, works perfect! You gotta realize that these may not work for everyone, but they do work for most if set up properally..
3118	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	One word can be used describe my opinion of this product... Wretched.


The unit in the window has an LED that glows green or red. If you place the antenna too close to the amplifier, it flashes red to indicate it's not working. When you move the antenna, you will need to unplug the amplifier and then plug it back in so it will reset itself and tell you if the amplifier is far enough away.
8225	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	After assembling the only thing Im unhappy about is the suction cups on the top of the barrier.  They come off too easily.  Aside from that, barrier works.  Its a little cumbersome to position and set up in the back of my SUVs but that is not fault of the product.  This barrier works for both my SUVs: 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 2014 Acura MDX.
1124	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My only gripe is that after two years, the circuit board goes awry, which is expected from such devices. Nevertheless, I keep replacing mine because I love the product. I hope this third generation lasts perhaps even longer.
conclusion: this model is one of the few over the head bt headset, and this one works exceptionally well, the money is pretty worth spent, I'd give 96/100, better than 91/100 for HT820


260	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I had high hopes that these would be the quality that they were claim to be. but they did not hold a charge as well as expected. And yes I followed the instructions explicitly to maximize performance.

Not after a couple weeks the fabric on the back is pulling away. If you look on the picture you can see the metal clip is on a peice of fabric which is then sewn onto the main part. That part is already separating. I don't expect this to last me more than 3 months tops.
  3. This phone does not feel cheap as I have heard a few complain about. It is not made with metal because metal does not absorb shock.
As with any product, there are things that can be improved: Now, I realize I'm way older than Virgin Mobile's young, hip, computer savvy target market, and that the Wildcard is not a Smart Phone - but the phone could be more intuitive.  For instance, the process of setting up contacts is fine, however, I wish managing contacts were less cumbersome.  I would love to be able to have something like 1-touch texting cuz as it stands now, I can click my handy-dandy quick text button on the phone, yes, but I still have to enter the phone number of the the contact I want to text - each time.

6502	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I found this to do exactly what it is supposed to do: boost your signal, not give you signal where there is none. In most cases, Ifound this boosted my speed and signal. You can't rely on bars, alone and it helps to turn your phone to airplane mode and then turn off airplane mode to force it to look for the signal and refresh your "bars." A speedtest is the best way todetermine if thebooster is helping, or not. Antenna type and placement are also keys to successfully using this device. Make sure you do some reading if you want to get the most out of the device.
3642	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Its a pretty good case just had to loosen it up a little because it was hard to slide the phone in and out of the case.


Great sound if you can keep it on your ear and keep it from falling apart on you. So for me it was a total waste of my money.

7489	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After reading a few negative reviews I was a bit skeptical, but decided to try this out for myself, because no matter how many people love an item, there's always some who will hate it.
==========================
I like that it is very easy to change ringers, from silent to normal to vibrate.  The camera is just ok, but I don't really count on my phone to serve as my photographic equipment.
6691	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought and gave the Wilson booster to an elderly friend who lives alone in a remote trailer on a large cattle ranch in East Central Texas.  His only contact with the outside world is via cell phone, and prior to installation of the Wilson it was very difficult for him to be able to make or receive calls from inside the trailer.  After installation, he gets full bars on his Verizon phone from inside.
4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint).
I spent less than $2 a cable and now can't return them. I know the saying goes, "you get what you pay for" but I didn't realize that I COULD NOT return defective merchandise!
